Abstract = {{Resistive switching in single crystal anatase TiO2 grown by atomic layer
   deposition on Si (001) with an epitaxial single crystal SrTiO3 buffer
   layer is characterized and analyzed. Although switching occurs via a
   valence-change mechanism involving motion of oxygen vacancies,
   electrical characteristics highly reminiscent of electrochemical
   metallization memories - low leakage current in the high-resistance
   state, highly linear current-voltage characteristics in the
   low-resistance state, and a very high on/off current ratio - are
   observed. We postulate that these characteristics may be associated with
   formation of TinO2n-1 Magneli or Magneli-like nanophases in the
   low-resistance state. In addition, quantized conductance is observed in
   the low-resistance state, with the number of conducting ballistic
   channels being highly controllable via application of different
   compliance currents during the memory SET process. For compliance
   currents of 10-200 mu A, low resistance state conductances corresponding
   to 1 to 4 conductance channels, controllable to within a single quantum
   of conductance, are observed.}},

Abstract = {{The modeling techniques for business process are mostly graphics-based,
   that is argued to be simplified when the processes become too complex or
   expanded to provide full details. In this paper we propose a technique
   for modeling composite activities by including components of data, human
   actors and atomic activities. Furthermore, we represent business
   processes with composite activities using process-oriented languages. To
   explore the properties of the business processes under this modeling
   technique, we define a set of metrics that reflect the degree of data
   aggregation and human actor involvement of executing composite
   activities. Algorithms to calculate these metrics are derived based on
   the goal-directed nature of the modeling technique for composite
   activities and business processes. At last by providing a use case, we
   discuss the artifacts and future work for this modeling technique.}},

Abstract = {{It is anticipated that plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), which rely
   exclusively on a battery to provide some or all of their driving range,
   will grow in popularity in the coming decades. In anticipation of the
   growth in electricity demand to support PEV charging, extensive study
   has been devoted to assessing the effects of these loads. While optimal
   charging strategies could be applied to minimize the impact of PEV
   charging, these strategies have not been widely adopted, nor are there
   significant incentives for vehicle owners to adopt them. In this work,
   Monte Carlo simulations are performed to assess the effect of
   uncertainty in vehicle charging loads on frequency regulation
   procurement requirements in ERCOT. Results indicate that even for the
   largest fleet size simulated, 500,000 vehicles, the increase in
   frequency regulation required is typically less than 6 MW, which
   represents just over 1\% of the average quantity procured in 2011.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel low power 11-bit hybrid ADC using flash and
   delay line architectures, where a 4-bit flash ADC is followed by a 7-bit
   delay-line ADC. This hybrid ADC inherits accuracy and power efficiency
   from flash ADCs and delay-line ADCs, respectively. Also, in order to
   reduce the power of the first stage flash ADC, a power-saving technique
   is adopted by biasing the DC tail current of the pre-amplifiers at 5 mu
   A instead of the operational current, 47 mu A in stand-by mode. The
   hybrid ADC was designed and simulated in a commercial 65nm process. With
   1.1 V supply and 100 MS/s, the ADC achieves an SNDR of 60 dB and
   consumes 1.6 mW, which results in a figure of merit (FOM) of 19.4
   fJ/conversion-step without any calibration technique. Also, Monte Carlo
   simulations are performed with a 3 sigma device mismatch for the SNDR
   estimation, and the SNDR is observed to be better than 58.5 dB.}},

   smoothly blend these via a Laplacian pyramid. Evaluation on a variety of

Abstract = {{Correct estimation of the state variables of a power grid is
   indispensable for its stable operation. The advent of smart grid has
   further enhanced the importance of secure real-time monitoring of the

   by an adversary trying to manipulate the state estimator. A novel graph
   theoretic formulation is developed for the problem of determining the
   optimum measurements to introduce spurious data for a hidden attack by
   the adversary. The paper discusses a polynomial-time solvable algorithm
   to optimally solve this problem under different settings. From the
   perspective of the system operator, techniques are proposed to help
   identify critical measurements for protection to prevent such hidden
   data attacks and to reduce their efficacy. The performance of the
   algorithms are demonstrated through simulations on IEEE test cases.}},

Abstract = {{The huge amount of (potentially) available spectrum makes millimeter
   wave (mmWave) a promising candidate for fifth generation cellular
   networks. Unfortunately, differences in the propagation environment as a
   function of frequency make it hard to make comparisons between systems
   operating at mmWave and microwave frequencies. This paper presents a
   simple channel model for evaluating system level performance in mmWave
   cellular networks. The model uses insights from measurement results that
   show mmWave is sensitive to blockages revealing very different path loss
   characteristics between line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
   links. The conventional path loss model with a single log-distance path
   loss function and a shadowing term is replaced with a stochastic path
   loss model with a distance-dependent LOS probability and two different
   path loss functions to account for LOS and NLOS links. The proposed
   model is used to compare microwave and mmWave networks in simulations.
   It is observed that mmWave networks can provide comparable coverage
   probability with a dense deployment, leading to much higher data rates
   thanks to the large bandwidth available in the mmWave spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal stress development in concrete structures is significantly
   influenced by the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of concrete.
   Optimizing concrete CTE can reduce the thermal stress, which will
   eventually reduce the cracking potential of concrete structures. At
   early age, when concrete has low strength, it is much more vulnerable to
   cracking. Early-age cracking has a detrimental effect on the durability
   of concrete structures. This study presents the importance of concrete
   CTE on the thermal stress development in concrete structures as well as
   three techniques to reduce the CTE of concrete. Replacing high CTE
   coarse aggregates with low CTE coarse aggregates is the most effective
   method for reducing concrete CTE. Concrete CTE can also be reduced by
   reducing cement paste volume. However, if the cement paste reduction
   increases the void content in the concrete system, saturated concrete
   CTE is likely to increase.}},

Abstract = {{A rotational capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (RCMUT) for
   airborne ultrasound applications is presented. The device is comprised
   of two conventional parallel-plate CMUTs mechanically coupled via a
   pivoting-beam structure. The cavity beneath each CMUT piston is
   vacuum-sealed to reduce thermal-mechanical noise and unwanted air-film
   dynamics. The pivoting structure is designed to provide high bending
   stiffness and low rotational stiffness. The beam therefore serves to
   reduce common-mode deflection of the structure under large omnipresent
   atmospheric pressure that statically loads the structure upon vacuum
   sealing, while enabling the structure to maintain sensitivity to small
   differential pressure between diaphragms. The coupling structure
   therefore permits larger, more compliant vacuum-sealed diaphragms to
   exist than would otherwise be possible without the coupling structure.
   Theoretically, this enables a design path towards highly-compliant,
   vacuum-sealed sensors to address relatively-low frequency airborne
   ultrasound applications. The paper summarizes the fabrication of
   prototypes and their dynamic characterization using electrostatic drive
   signals and laser Doppler vibrometry.}},

Abstract = {{We present an unconventional capacitive micromachined ultrasonic
   transducer in which a vacuum-sealed cavity beneath a diaphragm layer is
   comprised of an internal beam that pivots and has a first rocking or

   anticipated that the unique structure may find application in
   biologically-inspired ultrasound sensors that simultaneously detect
   omnidirectional sound pressure and pressure gradient. Vacuum sealing the
   cavity in which the pivoting beam resides eliminates squeeze-film
   damping that would otherwise cause excessive damping and/or stiffness.
   This paper presents scanning electron micrographs of successfully
   fabricated and sealed prototypes and dynamic frequency response

Abstract = {{Combined intravascular ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging (IVUS/IVPA)
   is an emerging modality for the improved characterization of
   atherosclerotic plaques including anatomical features of the imaged
   vessel and tissue composition. Encouraging initial demonstrations of the
   technique, however, have been limited by slow catheter rotation and data
   acquisition rates on the order of several seconds per frame, with
   off-line image processing. Herein, we present both a system and an
   integrated catheter capable of real-time IVUS/IVPA imaging with online
   image processing and display of both IVUS and IVPA images. The
   integrated IVUS/IVPA catheter is fully contained within a 1 mm outer
   diameter torque cable with the electrical signals transmitted at the
   proximal end using a slip ring rotary joint. Additional components
   include a pulsed laser operating at 10 kHz pulse repetition frequency,
   motor and servo drive, an ultrasound pulser/receiver, and a 200 MHz
   digitizer coupled to a system capable of real-time IVUS/IVPA imaging.
   The system performance was validated on a vessel-mimicking phantom with
   an embedded coronary stent intended to provide IVPA contrast within

Abstract = {{In ubiquitous computing environments, we are surrounded by significant
   amounts of context information about our individual situations and the
   situations we share with others around us. Along with the widespread
   emergence of ubiquitous computing and the availability of context
   information comes threats to personal privacy that result from sharing
   information about ourselves with others in the vicinity. We define an
   individual's context to be a potentially private piece of information.
   Given the individual context of multiple participants, one can compute
   an aggregate context that represents a shared state while at the same
   time preserves individual participants' privacy. In this paper, we
   describe three approaches to computing an aggregate measure of a group's
   context while maintaining a balance between the desire to share
   information and the desire to retain control over private information.
   Our approaches allow dynamic tuning of information release according to
   trust levels of the participants within communication range. By
   evaluating our approaches through simulation, we show that sharing
   aggregate context can significantly increase the rate at which a group
   of co-located users learns an aggregate measure of their shared context.
   Further, our approaches can accomplish high quality context sharing even
   in situations with low levels of trust, assuming the availability of a
   small number of highly trustworthy partners.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Pages = {{153-161}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) can be used to model impacts of traffic
   control plan scenarios on travel behavior. However, using DTA for
   modeling construction project impacts is limited by the computational
   time required to simulate entire roadway networks. DTA modeling of a
   subarea surrounding these work zones extracted from a larger network can
   decrease the overall run time. A particular issue of interest is
   estimating dynamic demand along the boundary of the selected subnetwork.
   Often demand at the subnetwork boundary is based on flows extracted from
   a full, base network analysis. However, it is likely that impacts within
   the subnetwork caused by traffic control plans will extend beyond the
   boundary and affect this demand. The use of a logit model to reassign
   demand at subnetwork boundary centroids on the basis of differences in
   internal (subnetwork) travel times between base and impact scenarios is
   presented. The proposed methodology was implemented by using several
   software programs linked through automated scripts. The method's
   implementation and the results from a case study are presented.
   Implementing the logit formulation was found to provide better estimates
   of subnetwork demand, specifically along the boundary, when compared
   with use of a fixed demand table extracted from the vehicle trajectories
   of the full network model under base conditions. Ultimately, the
   findings were encouraging and suggest that the strategy could enhance
   the accuracy of subnetwork demand estimation.}},

Abstract = {{Although many genetic markers are identified as being associated with
   Alzheimer's disease (AD), not much is known about their association with
   the structural changes that happen as the disease progresses. In this
   study, we investigate the genetic etiology of neurodegeneration in AD by
   associating genetic markers with atrophy profiles obtained using patient
   data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.
   The atrophy profiles were quantified using a linear least-squares
   regression model over the span of patient enrollment, and used as
   imaging features throughout the analysis. A subset of the imaging
   features were selected for genetic association based on their ability to
   discriminate between healthy individuals and AD patients in a Support
   Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. Each imaging feature was associated
   with single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs) using a linear model that
   included age and cognitive impairment scores as covariates to correct
   for normal disease progression. After false discovery rate correction,
   we observed 53 significant associations between SNPs and our imaging
   features, including associations of ventricular enlargement with SNPs on
   estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and sortilin-related VPS10 domain containing
   receptor 1 (SORCS1), hippocampal atrophy with SNPs on ESR1, and cerebral
   atrophy with SNPs on transferrin (TF) and amyloid beta precursor protein
   (APP). This study provides important insights into genetic predictors of
   specific types of neurodegeneration that could potentially be used to
   improve the efficacy of treatment strategies for the disease and allow
   the development of personalized treatment plans based on each patient's
   unique genetic profile.}},

   latent construct for reliable analysis. In this study, we perform an
   exploratory item response analysis to investigate the latent construct
   underlying the relationships between the ADAS-cog item responses. The
   results indicate that the underlying latent construct of ADAS-cog is
   multidimensional in nature with the latent factors measuring cognitive
   declines in several domains (such as memory, praxis, and language
   domains).}},

Abstract = {{Advanced hardware components embedded in modern smartphones have the
   potential to serve as widely available medical diagnostic devices,
   particularly when used in conjunction with custom software and tested
   algorithms. The goal of the present pilot study was to develop a
   smartphone application that could quantify the severity of Parkinson's
   disease (PD) motor symptoms, and in particular, bradykinesia. We
   developed an iPhone application that collected kinematic data from a
   small cohort of PD patients during guided movement tasks and extracted
   quantitative features using signal processing techniques. These features
   were used in a classification model trained to differentiate between
   overall motor impairment of greater and lesser severity using standard
   clinical scores provided by a trained neurologist. Using a support
   vector machine classifier, a classification accuracy of 0.945 was
   achieved under 6-fold cross validation, and several features were shown
   to be highly discriminatory between more severe and less severe motor
   impairment by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
   (AUC > 0.85). Accurate classification for discriminating between more
   severe and less severe bradykinesia was not achieved with these methods.
   We discuss future directions of this work and suggest that this platform
   is a first step toward development of a smartphone application that has
   the potential to provide clinicians with a method for monitoring
   patients between clinical appointments.}},

Abstract = {{Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a 3D imaging technology in which
   an x-ray fan beam rotates around the breast, producing a series of
   projection images. The imaging geometry of DBT lends itself naturally to
   stereo viewing because a stereo pair can be easily formed by two
   projection images with a reasonable separation angle. Stereo viewing may
   reveal the 3D structures of breasts thus has the potential to increase
   the sensitivity and specificity of breast imaging. In this study, we
   conduct a simulation study that mimics the detection of breast lesions
   on stereoscopic viewing of DBT projections. The presentation approach we
   investigate here is one in which the reader is presented with a sequence
   of stereo pairs from a rotating point of view. We render voxel datasets
   that contain random 3D power-law noise to model normal breast tissues
   with different breast densities. A 3D Gaussian signal is inserted to
   some of the datasets to model the presence of a breast lesion. Sequences
   of stereo pairs of projection images are generated for each voxel
   dataset by varying the projection angles of the two views. The
   diagnostic performance, in terms of the accuracy of binary decisions on
   the presence of the simulated lesions, is evaluated with a numerical
   model observer.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm to solve the Security
   Constrained Optimal Power Flow (SCOPF) Problem. We consider a network of
   devices, each with its own dynamic constraints and objective, subject to
   reliability constraints across multiple scenarios. Each scenario
   corresponds to the failure or degradation of a set of devices and has an
   associated probability of occurrence. The network objective is to
   minimize the cost of operation of all devices, over a given time
   horizon, across all scenarios subject to the constraints of transmission
   limit, upper and lower generating limits, generation-load balance etc.
   This is a large optimization problem, with variables for consumption and
   generation for each device, in each scenario. In this paper, we extend
   the proximal message passing framework to handle reliability constraints
   across scenarios. The resulting algorithm is extremely scalable with
   respect to both network size and the number of scenarios.}},

   with History Dependence}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2467}},
Pages = {{73-79}},
Abstract = {{A substantial amount of urban traffic is related to drivers searching
   for parking. This study developed an online stochastic shortest path
   model to represent the parking search process in which drivers must
   choose whether to park at an available space or continue searching for a
   space closer to their destination. Existing online shortest path
   algorithms had been formulated for the full-reset or no-reset
   assumptions on revisiting links. As described in this paper, neither
   assumption was fully suitable for the parking search process.
   Accordingly, this paper proposes an asymptotic reset model that
   generalizes the full-reset and no-reset cases and uses the concept of
   reset rate to characterize the temporal dependence of parking
   probabilities on earlier observations. In this model, drivers try to
   minimize their expected travel cost, which includes the driving cost and
   the cost of walking from a parking spot to the actual destination
   conditioned on the parking availability on in most recently traversed
   links. The problem was formulated as a Markov decision process and was
   demonstrated with a network representing the neighborhood of the
   University of Wyoming campus in Laramie. The case study successfully
   shows the extra time used by drivers to cruise for an acceptable parking
   space and illustrates the impact of in on the computation effort
   required to compute an optimal policy.}},

Title = {{Equilibrium Analysis of Low-Conflict Network Designs}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2467}},
Pages = {{129-139}},
Abstract = {{Low-conflict network designs aim to reduce intersection delay by
   restricting or eliminating crossing conflicts. These designs range from
   alternating one-way street grids in central business districts to more
   radical designs that eliminate crossing conflicts altogether. However,
   travel distances in such networks are generally higher than in
   traditional networks. This paper proposes an equilibrium approach for
   evaluating the trade-off between increased distance and reduced
   intersection delay in networks of varying topology and demand patterns.
   To accomplish this objective, suitable link performance functions are
   developed to reflect different types of intersection control. Three
   control strategies are compared: two-way grids, one-way grids, and a
   vortex design with priority merges. These strategies are compared in
   grid networks, with analysis of sensitivity to demand levels and other
   parameters. The vortex-based design generally leads to lower average
   travel times and higher trip distances. However, at high demand levels
   the use of gap-acceptance formulas for priority merges with route
   choice; this union results in unstable, chaotic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Impedance-based fault locating algorithms assume a radial distribution
   feeder when computing the distance to a fault. With increased
   penetration of distributed generators (DGs) to the distribution grid,
   this assumption is violated. Short-circuit current to a fault comes from
   two sources, the utility substation and DGs. Ignoring the latter term
   when the fault is located downstream from DGs will adversely affect the
   accuracy of location estimates. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate
   the impact of DGs on the accuracy of existing impedance-based fault
   location algorithms. The goal is to understand how different factors
   such as DG technology, MVA size of the DG unit, DG interconnect
   transformer, tapped loads, location of the fault from the DG unit, and
   fault resistance affect fault location in the presence of distributed
   generators.}},

Abstract = {{Malicious data attacks on specific buses of the power grid can lead to
   incorrect state estimation and in turn affect electricity prices and
   operational stability. A hidden data attack model is presented in this
   paper which involves an adversary corrupting meter readings in the grid
   to produce undetectable errors in a set of critical state variables. A
   polynomial time algorithm is given to identify the minimum set of
   measurements needed by the adversary to corrupt the desired state
   variables. To prevent such hidden attacks, a greedy protection algorithm
   is proposed for two cases, one where the adversary is resource limited
   and the other where the adversary has no resource constraint. The
   performances of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated through
   simulations on different IEEE test systems.}},

Abstract = {{This work uses a two-stage stochastic program (SP) to simulate a
   vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system operator participating in an electricity
   market to provide frequency regulation. The model developed for this
   work challenges four principal assumptions used in V2G models in the
   literature: the V2G system operator as a price taker; pre-scheduled
   vehicle use; deterministic vehicle state-of-charge; and deterministic
   regulation deployments. The results shown focus specifically on the
   effect of PEV battery size and PEV charging station (EVSE) power rating
   on V2G operator revenues and potential compensation for V2G program
   participants. These results indicate that battery size has a limited
   effect, but that increasing EVSE power rating can significantly increase
   revenues and compensation. Consequently, for the battery sizes in most
   PEVs, the V2G operator's market participation is constrained by
   available power, not energy, which is consistent with the magnitudes and
   time scales of typical frequency regulation deployments.}},

Abstract = {{Wind power scenarios from individual wind farms are synthesized using
   given sample paths of wind power from these same wind farms through the
   generalized dynamic factor model (GDFM), where wind power scenarios are
   represented as the multiplication of a fixed polynomial matrix and time
   varying dynamic shocks, which are white noise. The stochastic structure
   among wind power outputs is nested in the polynomial matrix, but
   inherent wind power intermittency is nested in the dynamic shocks. We
   can generate an arbitrary number of scenarios by changing the dynamic
   shocks. Since the dimension of dynamic shocks is generally less than the
   dimension of wind farms, we can reduce the number of random variables.
   Synthesized sample paths of wind power from candidate wind farms might
   be used as scenarios to plan the wind power generation and transmission
   expansion.}},

Abstract = {{Although shield wires are typically grounded through a finite tower
   footing resistance, positive- and zero-sequence line impedances are
   calculated assuming no tower footing resistance. Since impedance-based
   fault location algorithms require sequence line impedances to compute
   the distance to fault, this paper evaluates the impact of the grounded
   shield wire assumption on the accuracy of fault locating algorithms. A
   simple test case, which consists of a 3.73 long transmission line with
   two shield wires and a tower footing resistance every 0.19 miles, was
   setup to evaluate the assumption. The analysis shows that tower footing
   resistance affects only the zero-sequence line impedance. This leads to
   a marginal increase in error from oneended impedance-based methods in
   locating single line-toground or double line-to-ground faults. On the
   other hand, fault location estimates from two-ended methods are not
   affected as they do not make use of the zero-sequence line impedance in
   fault location computation.}},

Abstract = {{Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) and Oxide Breakdown (OBD)
   are two key reliability concerns for nanometer VLSI circuits. Gate
   over-sizing has been done in the past to mitigate the effect of NBTI and
   aging to meet performance constraints. However, this could make the
   entire circuit more prone to OBD. In this paper, we propose a new gate
   sizing formulation that considers both NBTI-induced delay degradation
   and OBD-induced circuit lifetime. Since NBTI and OBD are highly
   sensitive to the input vectors in a conflicting way, we consider their
   dependencies on signal probabilities. Moreover, we take into account the
   degradation in rise slew due to NBTI which could affect the fall
   delay/slew of the inverting gates in the next stage, and this has not
   been considered in previous work on NBTI aware gate sizing. Experimental
   results on industry strength benchmarks demonstrate that by
   incorporating OBD into holistic gate sizing, we can achieve more
   reliable circuit without compromising the circuit performance and area.}},

   basic scientific concepts. We discuss the available cloaking methods,
   including transformation optics, plasmonic and mantle cloaking,
   transmission-line networks, parallel-plate cloaking, anomalous resonance
   methods, hybrid methods and active schemes, and give our perspective on
   the subject and its future. We also draw a parallel with cloaking
   research for acoustic and elastodynamic waves, liquid waves, matter
   waves and thermal flux, demonstrating how ideas initiated in the field
   of electromagnetism have been able to open groundbreaking venues in a
   variety of other scientific fields. Finally, applications of cloaking to

Abstract = {{Analog signal-processing in deep sub-micron technologies poses many
   challenges arising from both low supply voltage and intrinsic
   voltage-gain of short channel devices. Class-AB CMOS transconductance
   obtained by a pair of complementary transistors is a widely used power
   efficient building block because it has linear v-i characteristics. This
   is topologically the same as the logic inverter of CMOS digital systems.
   This block enables the basic signal-processing operations of addition,
   subtraction, scaling and integration. Replica-circuits are used to keep
   the large process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations under
   control. Thus we can perform analog signal-processing at a level of
   precision required for designing high-speed data communication systems.
   This paper discusses this in a canonical fashion. Simulation results
   using device models for 65 nm CMOS process are presented to validate
   these ideas.}},

   power and occupying only 0.07mm(2) of active area. The
   pseudo-differential VCO implemented in the prototype achieves better
   than 9-bits linearity with the overall ADC linearity better than 12

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the potential of coordinated air conditioning
   control for a simulated community of 900 homes with a high penetration
   of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. The simulated community of
   homes is created from an extensive data set including home energy
   audits, homeowner surveys, and electricity meter measurements from
   actual homes in Austin, Texas, USA. Coordinated air conditioning control
   in the homes is simulated using a rolling horizon model predictive
   controller to minimize the peak demand of the community using both
   centralized and decentralized control methods. By manipulating
   thermostat set points, the controller takes advantage of the thermal
   mass of the buildings to store thermal energy. In all cases considered,
   the centralized controller outperforms the decentralized controller, but
   both lead to significant reductions in peak electricity demand. We find
   that decentralized control achieves nearly the same peak reduction as
   the centralized control method when all homes have rooftop PV. We also
   find that coordinated air conditioning control achieves a marginally
   smaller benefit as the penetration of rooftop PV increases.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the interdependence between the design of a
   (process) system and the design of the corresponding controller. This
   relationship is the subject of a ``conservativeness{''} tradeoff between
   achieving robust stability and nominal performance in the face of
   uncertainty in operating conditions. We propose a novel strategy for
   specifying and fulfilling individual dynamic performance criteria for
   the dynamics of the process and the associated control system, while
   maintaining the (bounded input-bounded output- BIBO) stability of the
   closed-loop system. To this end, we implement a switched control law at
   the design stage, along with additional constraints that enforce BIBO
   stability. By establishing a link between the switching conditions and
   the bandwidth of the closed-loop system, we are able to meet a
   pre-specified level of process conservativeness (e. g., in terms of size
   or cost) in process design. Second, we extend our previous results
   concerning identification-based optimization (IBO) to formulate an
   efficient algorithm for carrying out the optimization calculations under
   uncertainty without the need to generate computationally costly scenario
   sets. We illustrate these ideas with a case study concerning the design
   of an energy-integrated process.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for rapidly generating controllability and
   reachability sets for constrained finite horizon Linear Time Varying
   (LTV) control systems by using convex optimization techniques. Set
   generation is accomplished by first solving a Semi-Definite Programming
   (SDP) problem and then solving a series of Second Order Cone Programming
   (SOCP) problems. Recent advances in convex optimization solvers have
   made it possible to find the solutions to these problems very quickly.
   From a geometric stand-point, we first find the largest volume symmetric
   simplex that fits within the constrained control problem, then grow new
   simplices out of the faces of the original simplex. This process is
   repeated until the growing polytope converges to the constraint
   boundaries of the actual set. Additionally, a method for incorporating
   stochastic constraints and uncertainties into the deterministic
   framework is developed by posing the stochastic constraints as
   chance-constrained constraints. Finally, the controllability set for a
   two-vehicle Low Earth Orbit (LEO) rendezvous problem with stochastic
   uncertainties is generated using the new algorithm.}},

   mass conservation equations are developed for each control volume.
   Transient dynamics captured by this model include the electrochemical
   reaction, heat transfer and mass transport. Activation, ohmic, and

   An experiment was conducted to give a baseline with which to tune the
   model. Tuning of the model parameters was performed and validation of

Title = {{Considering Safety Impacts of Skid Resistance in Decision-Making
   Processes for Pavement Management}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2455}},
Pages = {{19-27}},
Abstract = {{With the increase in material and labor costs and the decrease in
   purchasing power, the Texas Department of Transportation (DOT) is
   striving to maintain its roadways at the current level of conditions
   within a severely constrained budget. In particular, maintaining
   adequate pavement skid resistance has become a challenge for decision
   makers at various levels. The goal of this study was to develop a
   methodological procedure that could be used to establish the appropriate
   threshold values for skid resistance so that safety would not be
   compromised on Texas highways when there is a budget shortfall. The two
   primary issues were to be addressed: (a) identification of the
   quantitative relationship between pavement skid resistance and crash
   rates and (b) determination of threshold values for skid resistance and
   corresponding recommendations for maintenance decisions. A detailed
   methodological framework was proposed. Highway segments were categorized
   into homogenous groups of safety-related characteristics, except skid
   resistance. The quantitative relationship between crash risks and skid
   resistance was then established with the concept of the crash rate
   ratio. Three threshold values were determined to establish four decision
   categories of skid resistance values, with crash and skid resistance
   data collected from 2008 to 2011 on the highway system maintained by the
   Texas DOT. Corresponding recommendations on maintenance decisions were
   provided. The results show that the proposed methodological procedure
   can effectively capture the safety impacts of skid resistance at the
   network level and provide a useful tool for the Texas DOT to take safety
   into its maintenance decision-making processes.}},

   of Flexible Pavements}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2457}},
Pages = {{105-113}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring and managing the skid resistance of the highway network is
   necessary for controlling and reducing the number of road accidents.
   High-speed measurements of surface texture can be used as a surrogate
   parameter for controlling a pavement's surface friction on the highway
   network. The two components of surface texture that affect skid
   resistance are the macrotexture and the microtexture. However, the
   technologies commonly used for measuring pavement texture at highway
   speeds account only for the macrotexture. This study explored ways to
   characterize the microtexture of pavement surfaces with the main
   objective of quantifying the effect of accounting for both components of
   the texture on the prediction of skid resistance, as measured by a
   British pendulum tester. Various methods for characterizing the
   microtexture were compared to determine which one better predicted
   surface friction. The study used field measurements of surface texture
   and friction performed on various in-service flexible pavements. The
   surface microtexture was characterized by a series of texture parameters
   calculated in both the spectral and the spatial domains. The impact of
   incorporating the microtexture on the prediction of the British pendulum
   number was evaluated through analysis of a series of models specified by
   each of the proposed parameters. The results of the analysis showed a
   drastic improvement in predicting the British pendulum value when the
   authors accounted for both components of the surface texture, as opposed
   to only the macrotexture. In a comparison of the analyzed methods for
   characterizing the microtexture, the use of spectral parameters led to
   the best prediction of the pavement surface friction. A series of
   recommendations is provided for the calculation of microtexture
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a procedure to design mantle cloaking devices
   made of multi-layered metasurfaces. If properly engineered, such covers
   are able to individually cancel several modes contributing to the
   scattering from a given object and, differently from traditional
   mono-layer mantle cloaks, reduce the observability of objects that
   cannot be considered electrically small. The analytical formulation for
   cylindrical and spherical geometries is outlined and some examples are
   provided. Moreover, we propose a potential application of multi-layered
   mantle cloaks to reduce the blockage effect on antennas due passive
   supporting structures, without affecting their mechanical

Abstract = {{Current-controlled oscillators (CCO) for analog to digital conversion

   non-linearity in the tuning characteristics are identified and modeled.
   A method of compensating for these errors is presented. Process and
   temperature effects are minimized by trading speed for robustness in
   manufacturing. The design has been verified by simulations as well as
   fabricating a prototype in a typical 0 : 1 8 mu m process node.
   Simulation results indicate that 0.2\% linearity can be obtained from 0
   1 0 0 deg C for the frequency range upto 5 0 0 MHz. The main idea is to
   improve linearity by design as much as possible before performing

Abstract = {{Bug fixing is a crucial part of software development and maintenance. A
   large number of bugs often indicate poor software quality since buggy
   behavior not only causes failures that may be costly but also has a
   detrimental effect on the user's overall experience with the software
   product. The impact of long lived bugs can be even more critical since
   experiencing the same bug version after version can be particularly
   frustrating for user. While there are many studies that investigate
   factors affecting bug fixing time for entire bug repositories, to the
   best of our knowledge, none of these studies investigates the extent and
   reasons of long lived bugs. In this paper, we analyzed long lived bugs
   from five different perspectives: their proportion, severity,
   assignment, reasons, as well as the nature of fixes. Our study on four
   open-source projects shows that there are a considerable number of long
   lived bugs in each system and over 90\% of them adversely affect the
   user's experience. The reasons of these long lived bugs are diverse
   including long assignment time, not understanding their importance in
   advance etc. However, many bug-fixes were delayed without any specific
   reasons. Our analysis of bug fixing changes further shows that many long
   lived bugs can be fixed quickly through careful prioritization. We
   believe our results will help both developers and researchers to better
   understand factors behind delays, improve the overall bug fixing
   process, and investigate analytical approaches for prioritizing bugs
   based on bug severity as well as expected bug fixing effort.}},

Abstract = {{Using a suitably designed, ultra-thin graded metasurface, we demonstrate
   the possibility of hiding an arbitrarily shaped/sized object from an
   impinging plane wave. The metasurface is tailored to provide an abrupt,
   inhomogeneous discontinuity to the electromagnetic field that
   compensates for the unwanted scattering created by the object. The
   desired field distribution is generated based on the equivalence
   principle through reconstruction of the electric/magnetic fields at the
   metasurface location, resembling a flat conducting surface for an
   external observer. We apply this concept to hide electrically large,
   cylindrical (two-dimensional, 2-D) and spherical (3-D) domes at optical
   frequencies and discuss practical cloaking designs for microwave and
   terahertz regimes. The presented graded metasurface-based cloaks may
   find interesting applications as low-profile, tunable covers for low
   observability and noise reduction in wireless commutation systems.}},

Abstract = {{A new algorithm for implementing test vector compression in software is
   presented. It is based on a compression procedure recently invented by
   Melhem, et al., called RDIS (recursively defined invertible set)
   {[}Melham 12]. While RDIS was originally proposed for a memory
   correction application, it is shown here to be very well suited for the
   problem of compressing test vectors. When the inputs that are unassigned
   during ATPG are left as don't cares (forming ``test cubes{''}),
   typically only 1-2\% of the remaining bits are care bits. It is shown
   that the RDIS procedure is very efficient when the number of care bits
   is small and is able to achieve large amounts of compression. The RDIS
   procedure works by recursively constructing invertible sets and
   efficiently encoding the information with row and column counts. The
   compressed data is stored on the tester. The tester then transfers this
   data to an embedded processor's memory, and a simple decompression
   program is executed on the embedded processor which uses this
   information to reconstruct the original test cubes which can then be
   used for testing a chip, board, or system. Experimental results are
   shown which indicate that significant amounts of compression can be
   achieved independent of the dimensions of the test cube matrix.}},

Abstract = {{We establish a duality result between linear index coding and Locally
   Repairable Codes (LRCs). Specifically, we show that a natural extension
   of LRCs we call Generalized Locally Repairable Codes (GLCRs) are exactly
   dual to linear index codes. In a GLRC, every node is decodable from a
   specific set of other nodes and these sets induce a recoverability
   directed graph. We show that the dual linear subspace of a GLRC is a
   solution to an index coding instance where the side information graph is
   this GLRC recoverability graph. We show that the GLRC rate is equivalent
   to the complementary index coding rate, i.e. the number of transmissions
   saved by coding.
   Our second result uses this duality to establish a new upper bound for
   the multiple unicast network coding problem. In multiple unicast network
   coding, we are given a directed acyclic graph and r sources that want to
   send independent messages to r corresponding destinations. Our new upper
   bound is efficiently computable and relies on a strong approximation
   result for complementary index coding. We believe that our bound could
   lead to an approximation guarantee for multiple unicast network coding
   if a plausible connection we state is verified.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of learning the underlying graph structure of
   discrete Markov networks based on power-law graphs, generated using the
   configuration model. We translate the learning problem into an
   equivalent channel coding problem and obtain necessary conditions for
   solvability in terms of problem parameters. In particular, we relate the
   exponent of the power-law graph to the hardness of the learning problem,
   and show that more number of samples are required for exact recovery of
   discrete power-law Markov graphs with small exponent values. We develop
   an efficient learning algorithm for accurate reconstruction of graph
   structure of Ising model on power-law graphs. Finally, we show that
   order-wise optimal number of samples suffice for recovering the exact
   graph under certain constraints on Ising model parameters and scalings
   of node degrees.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes recent advances in resolution of the Time
   Synchronization and Controlled Asynchronization of Remote Analog Signals
   (TSCA). Measurements using a pair of cables of different lengths,
   similar to 150m and similar to 300m are synchronized with sub nanosecond
   resolution. In addition, output signals from these cables were
   asynchronized with the same resolution, to target values ranging from
   -3000ns to + 3000ns. This synchronization and asynchronization was
   accomplished by controlling the relative delay of these two signals,
   when generated by a dual channel Arbitrary Function Generator. The
   advancement in resolution was achieved using a highly enhanced
   resolution Time Domain Reflectometer (e-TDR), having the capability to
   accurately control the speed of the e-TDR signal in the cables. This
   advance in resolution was obtained because a recently discovered signal,
   that has the property of distortionless propagation in lossy cables, was
   used as the e-TDR pulse. The system was implemented as a Virtual
   Instrument (VI) in LabVIEW, using a two channel Arbitrary Waveform
   Generator (ARB) and a Digital Phosphor Oscilloscope (DPO). The resulting
   errors were less than +/-0.26ns.}},

Title = {{Determining Strategic Locations for Environmental Sensor Stations with
   Weather-Related Crash Data}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2440}},
Pages = {{34-42}},
Abstract = {{Adverse weather leads to more than 1.5 million vehicular crashes,
   resulting in 800,000 injuries and 7,000 fatalities nationally. The
   appropriate deployment of roadway weather information systems (RWIS) has
   been considered an effective strategy to address safety concerns.
   However, the current practice of selecting the locations of RWIS
   stations depends primarily on the knowledge and experiences of field
   operators. Limited research has been conducted on methodologies that can
   identify RWIS locations systematically on the basis of widely available
   safety and geographic information system (GIS) data. This paper proposes
   a spatial optimization method to identify strategic locations for
   deploying RWIS stations within a large regional transportation network.
   Weather-related crash data were converted to a safety concern index and
   then used to examine routes that provided good spatial coverage of the
   region for optimal locations for RWIS stations through a maximization
   algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated with crash and GIS data from
   a tri-county region in Texas with the coverage for each RWIS station
   assumed to be 10 mi. The resulting locations illustrate the promising
   potential for the proposed RWIS location optimization algorithm.
   Additional sensitivity analysis is also conducted with an evaluation of
   the resulting changes from yearly crash data variations.}},

Title = {{Pay-As-You-Drive Insurance Its Impacts on Household Driving and Welfare}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2450}},
Pages = {{76-82}},
Abstract = {{Vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) can greatly affect crash risk and,
   therefore, insurance costs, but accurately assessing VMT has been
   challenging for insurance agencies. Affordable technology now allows
   insurance companies to track VMT better and has prompted pilot programs
   and further research of mileage-based, or pay-as-you-drive (PAYD),
   insurance. Research shows that PAYD programs can discourage extraneous
   driving and thereby save drivers money (but reduce consumer welfare by
   less than consumer cost savings) and reduce crash risks, insurers'
   costs, and externalities. Studies consider aggregate, national, and
   statewide effects of PAYD policies, with some focus on equity effects,
   but much heterogeneity is ignored. This study bolsters existing work by
   predicting PAYD effects with the use of National Household Travel Survey
   (NUTS) data. These data are used to model driver response to driving
   cost changes and an insurance pricing model (per vehicle) according to
   actual loss data and risk factors by vehicle type. This study
   anticipates PAYD impact variations across a sample of NUTS households
   and vehicle types and finds that on average households save enough on
   reduced insurance and travel costs to cover lost welfare from VMT
   reductions. Results suggest that the average (light-duty) vehicle will
   be driven 2.7\% less (237 fewer annual miles per year), with average
   consumer benefits of only \$2.00 per vehicle with a premium that is
   partially fixed and partially mileage based. Drivers with the lowest
   annual VMT needs are expected to receive the largest welfare benefits,
   thanks to a convex relationship between VMT and crash losses. This
   analysis provides support to existing literature that PAYD policies can
   reduce VMT and insurance pricing equity without harming driver welfare.}},

Title = {{Robust Tolling Schemes for High-Occupancy Toll Facilities Under Variable
   Demand}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2450}},
Pages = {{152-162}},
Abstract = {{High-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes have become an increasingly prevalent
   form of congestion management pricing in the United States in the past
   few decades. The success of a HOT facility depends on the pricing
   scheme, which determines the utilization of the HOT lane, and the
   corresponding congestion relief on the parallel general purpose lanes.
   An additional complexity in determining HOT rates arises from the
   inevitable variability in travel demand inherent to transport networks.
   A successful tolling scheme must therefore be robust to changes in
   travel demand. Various tolling schemes for HOT facilities are examined
   in efforts to identify robust pricing policies. The expected performance
   and the corresponding variability of the facility are evaluated under
   each pricing scheme for different demand profiles. The focus is on
   noncorrelated demand uncertainties (i.e., number of arrivals during
   given time interval is independent of number of arrivals in preceding
   and following time intervals), which are modeled by considering the
   number of arrivals in each minute as an independent random variable with
   known distribution and time-of-day dependent mean. The performance model
   for a given demand realization is deterministic. Results show that a
   fixed toll can achieve about two-thirds of the benefit of an ideal HOT
   system. The performance of a prescheduled toll system is between the
   fixed toll and the ideal system: closer to the ideal when the
   coefficient of variation is below 40\% and closer to the fixed toll
   otherwise. The performance of a relatively simple real-time system, with
   density-based linear adjustment to the prescheduled toll, is practically
   equivalent to that of the ideal system.}},

Journal = {{PERCEPTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1286-1302}},
Abstract = {{Motion can impair the perception of other visual changes. Suchow and
   Alvarez (2011a, Current Biology, 21, 140-143) recently demonstrated a
   striking `motion silencing' illusion, in which the salient changes among
   a group of objects' luminances (or colors, etc) appear to cease in the
   presence of large, coherent object motion. To understand why the visual
   system might be insensitive to changes in object luminances ('flicker')
   in the presence of object motion, we constructed similar stimuli and did
   a systematic spectral analysis of them. We conducted human
   psychophysical experiments to examine motion silencing as a function of
   stimulus velocity, flicker frequency, and spacing; and we created a
   simple filter-based model as a working hypothesis of motion silencing.
   From the results, we found that the threshold of silencing occurs when
   the log frequency of object replacement is roughly one quarter of the
   log flicker frequency (the mean slope is approximately 0.27). The
   dependence of silencing on object spacing may be explained as a
   phenomenon of temporal sampling of the stimuli by the visual system. Our
   proposed model successfully captures the psychophysical data over a wide
   range of velocities and flicker frequencies.}},

Title = {{Effect of Road Grade on Networkwide Vehicle Energy Consumption and
   Ecorouting}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2427}},
Pages = {{26-33}},
Abstract = {{Because of growing concern about the impact of emissions from the
   transport sector on global climate change, vehicle energy consumption is
   a factor of great interest to network planners. In addition, drivers are
   interested in reducing energy consumption and, thus, fuel costs.
   However, traditional models of vehicle energy consumption have neglected
   an important factor: road grade. This assumption has traditionally been
   supported by the idea that the energy consumed because of the road grade
   would be reflected in changes in speed and acceleration, but a
   demonstration of this on an aggregate network in a city of a realistic
   size has been difficult to show. This work demonstrated the impact of
   road grade on networkwide vehicle energy consumption by the integration
   of energy consumption equations based on road load equations, elevation
   data available from the Google Elevation advanced programming interface,
   and a dynamic traffic assignment model to capture the effect of user
   route choice. This work quantified the impact of the energy consumed
   because of road grades on two city networks, and the results indicate
   that the effects of grades should not be excluded from evaluations of
   vehicle energy consumption. In addition, the effects of ecorouting, in
   which drivers choose the shortest path that consumes the least amount of
   energy, were explored. The results for the city networks indicate that
   if drivers do not account for grades, they might choose a route that
   actually increases vehicle energy consumption. The proposed modeling
   tool is scalable and easily adaptable to different cities.}},

   Moisture Analyzer Balance and Dynamic Shear Rheometer}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2444}},
Pages = {{88-96}},
Abstract = {{A new procedure has been developed for residue recovery of emulsified
   asphalt. The procedure uses a moisture analyzer balance (MAB). The MAB
   recovery method is quick and simple compared with traditional recovery
   procedures such as distillation or oven evaporation. Although the MAB
   procedure has become an ASTM procedure, there have been a limited number
   of studies on the rheological properties of the emulsion residues
   recovered by MAB. This research used a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) to
   investigate the rheological properties of MAB specimens. The MAB method
   was used for several types of emulsions, including cationic and anionic
   emulsions with several modifications. The MAB method developed in this
   study addresses the issue of breakdown of polymers during recovery of
   modified emulsions at high temperatures. The study evaluated the effect
   of recovery temperature on the recovery time and rheological properties
   of emulsion residues and proposed a new recovery-characterization
   procedure. The results show that a preliminary performance grade
   classification of the emulsified asphalt can be made with the combined
   MAB-DSR procedure. Furthermore, the study quantified the effect of aging
   that might occur during the recovery and emulsification process on the
   rheological properties of the emulsion residues. The combined MAB-DSR
   procedure is proposed to be a cost-effective alternative method to
   evaluate the performance of emulsified asphalts.}},

Title = {{Removal of Dissolved Heavy Metals in Highway Runoff}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{131-138}},
Abstract = {{Some findings of the recently completed NCHRP Project 25-32, Measuring
   and Removing Dissolved Metals from Storm Water in Highly Urbanized
   Areas, are highlighted. One objective of the project was to assess the
   potential for adsorption to reduce the concentration of dissolved heavy
   metals in highway runoff. One of the major difficulties of this type of
   work is capturing the impacts of background organic matter and other
   complexing ions on adsorption behavior in multicomponent systems. To
   address this difficulty, the synthetic stormwater used in this
   evaluation included natural organic matter (extracted from actual
   highway runoff) as well as the typical inorganic constituents. A series
   of column experiments was run with iron oxide, manganese oxide, portland
   cement concrete, and crab shell waste as adsorbents. Factors that were
   evaluated included organic matter concentration, competition between
   metal ion species, pH, ionic strength, and alkalinity. Results of the
   column experiments indicated that iron oxide removed dissolved metals
   substantially better than did manganese. Both portland cement concrete
   and crab shell waste were effective at controlling pH, which was the
   largest factor in determining the removal of dissolved metals;
   adsorption capacity declined by more than an order of magnitude at
   elevated concentrations of organic matter and elevated alkalinity. These
   experiments indicate that the addition of iron oxide plus concrete or
   crab shell may be a cost-effective way to remove dissolved metals in
   highway runoff.}},

Abstract = {{Linearity test is a fundamental test for ADCs in production. The
   stringent linearity requirement for an on-chip signal generator has made
   ADC built-in-self-test (BIST) solutions prohibitive in the past. The
   stimulus error identification and removal (SEIR) method has greatly
   reduced the linearity requirement. However, it still requires the
   addition of a highly stable voltage offset, which remains a daunting
   task. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a simple and low-power
   method to inject the required constant offset. It exploits the inherent
   capacitive sample-and-hold circuit used in various ADC architectures. It
   ensures the injected offset to have a very high constancy, which results
   in an accurate INL estimation. A 16-bit SAR ADC with the proposed BIST
   scheme is modeled and simulated in Matlab to prove its validity. The
   results show that the estimation error on the maximum INL is less than
   0.07 LSB.}},

Abstract = {{Pavement concrete containing aggregates that do not meet ASTM C33 often
   experiences workability problems. One of the reasons is the lack of
   proper guidelines for proportioning concrete that contains aggregates
   with poor shape, texture, and grading. Commonly used methods, such as
   ACT 211, were developed for aggregates that meet ASTM C33; these methods
   are not adequate for optimizing mixtures containing aggregates such as
   manufactured sands. This paper presents a simple mixture proportioning
   method for designing pavement concrete with low slump. The proposed
   method has the potential to minimize the cement content of paving
   mixtures with any available source or combination of aggregate without
   affecting performance. Several combinations of aggregates were tested
   and the results for slump, compressive strength, and modulus of
   elasticity are presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the use of modern methods for estimation in Vacuum
   Arc Remelting, a manufacturing process used in the production of
   specialty metals for aerospace applications. Accurate estimation in this
   process is challenging because the system is nonlinear and all available
   measurements are corrupted with noise. Particle filters are nonlinear
   estimators that sample a set of points, called particles, in the state
   space to construct discrete approximations of probability density
   functions. Real-time issues arise when using these methods in systems
   with low signal-to-noise ratios because of the large number of particles
   required to reach acceptable accuracy. In these cases, the throughput of
   the particle filter becomes critical, and parallelization becomes a
   necessity. This paper presents the implementation of a particle filter
   using a GPU with NVIDIA's CUDA technology, whose large number of
   processor cores allows massive parallelization.}},

Abstract = {{Modern large-scale distributed storage systems utilize erasure codes to
   store only cold data, i.e., rarely access data such as click logs.
   However, a major portion of the data that is currently used for
   large-scale processing is hot data, data that are frequently accessed,
   in some cases by many users or system processes simultaneously. When
   storing hot data, replication seems to be the option of choice for
   redundancy due to a very desirable property: a single information symbol
   can be accessed in parallel as many times as the number of available
   replicas. This is sometimes referred to as higher data availability.
   However, the rate of a replication scheme vanishes as we increase its
   availability or replication factor.
   This paper describes erasure codes that have arbitrarily high rate while
   allowing for high availability. In particular, these codes enable
   reconstruction of each information symbol from t disjoint groups of
   other code symbols, each of size at most r. This paper further shows
   that these codes attain a trade-off between minimum distance,
   availability and locality.}},

Abstract = {{BLIS is a new framework for rapid instantiation of the BLAS. We describe
   how BLIS extends the ``GotoBLAS approach{''} to implementing matrix
   multiplication (GEMM). While GEMM was previously implemented as three
   loops around an inner kernel, BLIS exposes two additional loops within
   that inner kernel, casting the computation in terms of the BLIS
   microkernel so that porting GEMM becomes a matter of customizing this
   micro-kernel for a given architecture. We discuss how this facilitates a
   finer level of parallelism that greatly simplifies the multithreading of
   GEMM as well as additional opportunities for parallelizing multiple
   loops. Specifically, we show that with the advent of many-core
   architectures such as the IBM PowerPC A2 processor (used by Blue Gene/Q)
   and the Intel Xeon Phi processor, parallelizing both within and around
   the inner kernel, as the BLIS approach supports, is not only convenient,
   but also necessary for scalability. The resulting implementations
   deliver what we believe to be the best open source performance for these
   architectures, achieving both impressive performance and excellent
   scalability.}},

Abstract = {{Building operation consumes approximately 40\% of energy in the United
   States, approximately half of which is consumed by residential
   buildings. Compared to commercial buildings where the push for
   commissioning in recent years has contributed to improved efficiency,
   less is known about the consumption of residential buildings, limiting
   the possibilities for performance-based analysis of these buildings. The
   increasing deployment of technologies such as smart meters and home
   energy management systems (HEMS) provide a great opportunity to better
   evaluate the performance of residential HVAC systems, one of the single
   greatest consumers of electricity in residential buildings, particularly
   in warm climates. The increasing availability of energy use data allows
   for the possibility of identification of faults that merit maintenance
   and repair in HVAC systems. In this paper we investigate possibilities
   for data-driven HVAC commissioning based on highly granular residential
   energy use data for a home in Austin, TX. The study aims is to identify
   possible HVAC deficiencies, and provide a preliminary methodology to
   identify one of these faults through energy use data analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Nanomaterial synthesis and modification for applications have progressed
   to a great extent in the last decades. Manipulation of the
   physicochemical properties of a material at the nanoscale has been
   extensively performed to produce materials for novel applications.
   Controlling the size, shape, surface functionality, etc. has been key to
   successful implementation of nanomaterials in multidimensional usage for
   electronics, optics, biomedicine, drug delivery and green fuel
   technology. Recently, a focus has been on the conjugation of two or more
   nanomaterials to achieve increased multifunctionality as well as
   creating opportunities for next generation materials with enhanced
   performance. With incremental production and potential usage of such
   nanohybrids come the concerns about their ecological and environmental
   effects, which will be dictated by their not-yet-understood
   physicochemical properties. While environmental implication studies
   concerning the single materials are yet to give an integrated
   mechanistic understanding and predictability of their environmental fate
   and transport, the importance of studying the novel nanohybrids with
   their multidimensional and complex behaviour in environmental and
   biological exposure systems are immense. This article critically reviews
   the literature of nanohybrids and identifies potential environmental
   uncertainties of these emerging `horizon materials'.}},

Abstract = {{We present an efficient method for computing A-optimal experimental
   designs for infinite-dimensional Bayesian linear inverse problems
   governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, we
   address the problem of optimizing the location of sensors (at which
   observational data are collected) to minimize the uncertainty in the
   parameters estimated by solving the inverse problem, where the
   uncertainty is expressed by the trace of the posterior covariance.
   Computing optimal experimental designs (OEDs) is particularly
   challenging for inverse problems governed by computationally expensive
   PDE models with infinite-dimensional (or, after discretization,
   high-dimensional) parameters. To alleviate the computational cost, we
   exploit the problem structure and build a low-rank approximation of the
   parameter-to-observable map, preconditioned with the square root of the
   prior covariance operator. The availability of this low-rank surrogate,
   relieves our method from expensive PDE solves when evaluating the
   optimal experimental design objective function, i.e., the trace of the
   posterior covariance, and its derivatives. Moreover, we employ a
   randomized trace estimator for efficient evaluation of the OED objective
   function. We control the sparsity of the sensor configuration by
   employing a sequence of penalty functions that successively approximate
   the l(0)-{''}norm{''}; this results in binary designs that characterize
   optimal sensor locations. We present numerical results for inference of
   the initial condition from spatiotemporal observations in a
   time-dependent advection-diffusion problem in two and three space
   dimensions. We find that an optimal design can be computed at a cost,
   measured in number of forward PDE solves, that is independent of the
   parameter and sensor dimensions. Moreover, the numerical optimization
   problem for finding the optimal design can be solved in a number of
   interior-point quasi-Newton iterations that is insensitive to the
   parameter and sensor dimensions. We demonstrate numerically that
   l(0)-sparsified experimental designs obtained via a continuation method
   outperform l(1)-sparsified designs.}},

Abstract = {{Symmetric tensor operations arise in a wide variety of computations.
   However, the benefits of exploiting symmetry in order to reduce storage
   and computation is in conflict with a desire to simplify memory access
   patterns. In this paper, we propose a blocked data structure (blocked
   compact symmetric storage) wherein we consider the tensor by blocks and
   store only the unique blocks of a symmetric tensor. We propose an
   algorithm by blocks, already shown of benefit for matrix computations,
   that exploits this storage format by utilizing a series of temporary
   tensors to avoid redundant computation. Further, partial symmetry within
   temporaries is exploited to further avoid redundant storage and
   redundant computation. A detailed analysis shows that, relative to
   storing and computing with tensors without taking advantage of symmetry
   and partial symmetry, storage requirements are reduced by a factor of
   O(m!) and computational requirements by a factor of O((m + 1)!/2(m)),
   where m is the order of the tensor. However, as the analysis shows, care
   must be taken in choosing the correct block size to ensure these storage
   and computational benefits are achieved (particularly for low-order
   tensors). An implementation demonstrates that storage is greatly reduced
   and the complexity introduced by storing and computing with tensors by
   blocks is manageable. Preliminary results demonstrate that computational
   time is also reduced. The paper concludes with a discussion of how
   insights in this paper point to opportunities for generalizing recent
   advances in the domain of linear algebra libraries to the field of
   multilinear computation.}},

Pages = {{129-137}},
Abstract = {{There has been considerable interest, and consequent progress, in the
   modeling of household vehicle fleet composition and utilization in the
   travel behavior research domain. The multiple discrete-continuous
   extreme value (MDCEV) model is a modeling approach that has been applied
   frequently to characterize this choice behavior. One key drawback of the
   MDCEV modeling methodology is that it does not provide an estimate of
   the count of vehicles in each vehicle type alternative represented in
   the MDCEV model. Moreover, the classic limitations of the multinomial
   logit model, such as violations of the independence of irrelevant
   alternatives property in the presence of correlated alternatives and the
   inability to account for random taste variations, apply to the MDCEV
   model as well. A new methodological approach, developed to overcome
   these limitations, is applied in this paper to model vehicle fleet
   composition and count in each body type. The modeling methodology
   involves tying together a multiple discrete-continuous probit (MDCP)
   model and a multivariate count (MC) model capable of estimating vehicle
   counts in vehicle type categories considered by the MDCP model. The
   joint MDCP-MC model system was estimated by using a Greater Phoenix,
   Arizona, travel survey data set. The joint model system was found to
   offer behaviorally intuitive results and to provide superior goodness of
   fit in comparison with an independent model system that ignores the
   jointness between the MDCP component and the MC component.}},

Abstract = {{While solar photovoltaic (PV) panels can offset emissions and water use
   at the power plant, high levels of installed rooftop PV capacity can
   have negative impacts on the stability and efficiency of the local grid
   because of power factor (PF) degradation. Specifically, electric
   utilities have cited voltage fluctuations that occur more dynamically
   than legacy, electromechanical voltage regulation solutions like
   capacitor banks are designed to correct. At the same time, distributed
   power electronics devices like inverters can provide the type of dynamic
   voltage support that utilities seek to maintain reliability while
   juggling load growth and a greening grid. Using data from Pecan Street
   Inc. Smart Grid Demonstration Project in Austin, Texas and Austin Water
   Utility (AWU), this research examines the potential for a three-phase,
   four quadrant variable speed drive (VSD) in the water sector to provide
   PF correction to a load pocket of 63 homes experiencing varying levels
   of PV penetration. In the analysis, the VSD is not reserved for voltage
   support; instead it is predominantly used to drive a 30 kilowatt (kW)
   centrifugal sewage pump. The simulation determines the degree to which
   the VSD can restore PF to a defined threshold of 0.95. Further, the
   economic viability of using the VSD as a grid device is explored by
   comparing the per unit cost of the PF correction it provides to a
   current utility solution for dynamic volage regulation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a power electronic interface that enables localized
   energy management. The proposed interface, named as Active Power
   Distribution Nodes (APDNs), not only controls power flow and power the
   load during complete power loss, but also performs as a power buffer to
   handle instantaneous power imbalance between sources and loads. Power
   flow control is performed by power electronic interface, and the power
   buffer function is implemented by integrating energy storage within the
   interface. As a power buffer, the APDN can be used to enable local
   energy management of zones decoupled from the rest of the network.
   Furthermore, such decoupling simplifies expansion planning of microgrids
   by enabling a modular approach based on a sectionalized power
   distribution architecture. Performance of the APDN is verified by both
   simulation and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a novel method of performing subband analysis of
   digital signals is proposed. Conventional subband decomposition
   algorithms typically use a binary tree filter-bank structure comprised
   of halfband filters. Due to design limitations of finite length filters,
   conventional decomposition algorithms typically suffer from interference
   due to aliasing. While longer halfband filters may reduce aliasing, such
   filters also increase latency and implementation complexity. Our
   proposed algorithm uses a novel structure of quadrature mirror filters
   to ensure aliasing is present outside of the spectral region of
   interest. Simulation results indicate that, compared to conventional
   algorithms, the proposed algorithm 1) reduces interference from aliasing
   by over 30dB, 2) reduces signal processing latency, and 3) reduces
   implementation complexity.}},

   Our system uses the artificial-noise-aided beam-forming approach to

   and the secrecy performance against eavesdropping. Our analytical
   results provide conditions on the minimum number of feedback bits and
   the minimum strength of the intended channel for making secure
   transmission possible. We observe that strengthening the secrecy outage
   constraint puts higher requirements on the number of feedback bits and
   the strength of the intended channel. To maximize the achievable secrecy
   rate, the optimal transmit power allocation between the information
   signal and the artificial noise is also derived in closed form.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel framework for the integration of
   scheduling and control of process systems. We introduce internal
   coupling models (ICMs), defined as (low-order) representations of the
   closed-loop input-output behaviour of the process under supervisory
   control. We explore the derivation of ICMs for a specific class of
   input-output linearizing nonlinear controllers. Then, we formulate the
   scheduling problem as a mixed-integer dynamic optimization under the
   constraints imposed by the ICM, aimed at finding the optimal setpoint
   trajectory for the supervisory controller. We illustrate these concepts
   with a case study, demonstrating that ICM-based scheduling has
   comparable performance to other scheduling approaches in the absence of
   plant-model mismatch, and vastly outperforms them when mismatch is
   present.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous properties from metal nanostructures can be tuned by
   controlling both their size and shape. In particular, the latter is
   extremely important because the type of crystalline surface affects the
   surface electronic density. This paper describes a simple approach to
   the synthesis of highly-structured, anisotropic palladium nanostructured
   dendrites. They were obtained using an eco-friendly biomolecule
   5-hydroxytryptophan, which acts as both a reducing and stabilizing
   agent. The growth mechanism is proposed for the evolution of dendrites
   morphology. It was found that the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptophan
   played a vital role on the morphology of the nanostructured Pd
   dendrites. This nanomaterial shows enhanced electrocatalytic performance
   towards the oxidation of formic acid, and it exhibits surface-enhanced
   Raman scattering properties towards the prostate specific antigen. These
   properties may be explored in fuel cells and biosensors, respectively.}},

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{14643-14647}},
Abstract = {{While silicon nanostructures are extensively used in electronics, the
   indirect bandgap of silicon poses challenges for optoelectronic
   applications like photovoltaics and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Here,
   we show that size-dependent pseudo-direct bandgap transitions in silicon
   nanocrystals dominate the interactions between (photoexcited) charge
   carriers and phonons, and hence the optoelectronic properties of silicon
   nanocrystals. Direct measurements of the electronic density of states
   (DOS) for different sized silicon nanocrystals reveal that these
   pseudo-direct transitions, likely arising from the nanocrystal surface,
   can couple with the quantum-confined silicon states. Moreover, we
   demonstrate that since these transitions determine the interactions of
   charge carriers with phonons, they change the light emission,
   absorption, charge carrier diffusion and phonon drag (Seebeck
   coefficient) in nanoscaled silicon semiconductors. Therefore, these
   results can have important implications for the design of
   optoelectronics and thermoelectric devices based on nanostructured
   silicon.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-short-period (AlN)(m)/(GaN)(n) superlattices with tunable well and
   barrier atomic layer numbers were grown by metal-organic vapour phase
   epitaxy, and employed to demonstrate narrowband deep ultraviolet
   photodetection. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and
   X-ray reciprocal space mapping confirm that superlattices containing
   well-defined, coherently strained GaN and AlN layers as thin as two
   atomic layers (similar to 0.5 nm) were grown. Theoretical and
   experimental results demonstrate that an optical absorption band as
   narrow as 9 nm (210 meV) at deep-ultraviolet wavelengths can be
   produced, and is attributable to interband transitions between quantum
   states along the {[}0001] direction in ultrathin GaN atomic layers
   isolated by AlN barriers. The absorption wavelength can be precisely
   engineered by adjusting the thickness of the GaN atomic layers because
   of the quantum confinement effect. These results represent a major
   advance towards the realization of wavelength selectable and narrowband
   photodetectors in the deep-ultraviolet region without any additional
   optical filters.}},

Abstract = {{Trip distribution is an invaluable portion of the transportation
   planning process; this distribution leads to the creation of origin
   destination (O-D) matrices. Location-based social networking (LBSN) has
   increased in popularity and sophistication and has emerged as a new
   travel demand data source. Users of LBSN provide location-sensitive data
   interactively with mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets.
   These data can provide O-D estimates with significantly higher temporal
   resolution at a much lower cost in comparison with traditional methods.
   An LBSN O-D estimation model based on the doubly constrained gravity
   model was proposed to improve a previously proposed model based on the
   singly constrained gravity model. The proposed methodology was
   calibrated and comparatively evaluated against the O-D matrix generated
   by the method based on the singly constrained gravity model as well as a
   reference matrix from the local metropolitan planning organization. The
   results of this method illustrate significant improvement in reducing
   the O-D estimation errors caused by the sampling bias from the method
   based on the singly constrained gravity model.}},

Abstract = {{The development of a vehicle fleet composition and utilization model
   system that may be incorporated into a larger activity-based travel
   demand model is described. It is of interest and importance to model
   household vehicle fleet composition and utilization behavior because the
   energy and environmental impacts of personal travel are dependent not
   only on the number of vehicles but also on the mix of vehicles that a
   household owns and the extent to which different vehicles are used. A
   vehicle composition (fleet mix) and utilization model system was
   developed for integration into the activity-based travel demand model
   that was being developed for the greater Phoenix metropolitan area in
   Arizona. At the heart of the vehicle fleet mix model system is a
   multiple discrete continuous extreme value model capable of simulating
   vehicle ownership and use patterns of households. Vehicle choices are
   defined by a combination of vehicle body type and age category and the
   model system is capable of predicting vehicle composition and
   utilization patterns at the household level. The model system is
   described and results are presented of a validation and policy
   sensitivity analysis exercise demonstrating the efficacy of the model.}},

Abstract = {{The application of a comprehensive model system of vehicle fleet
   composition and evolution is described; this model system is capable of
   taking a base-year vehicle fleet and making it evolve over time in
   annual time steps through the events of vehicle disposal, replacement,
   and acquisition. The model system is sensitive to a host of
   socioeconomic, demographic, built environment, and vehicle technology
   and price variables; this sensitivity makes it ideally suited for such
   an application. Coupled with a demographic forecasting model system that
   causes the population to evolve over time, the vehicle evolution
   simulator is able to predict changes in vehicle fleet composition, miles
   of travel, fuel consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions under a wide
   range of scenarios. On the basis of the findings from this study, future
   technological innovations (e.g., increase of driving range) and pricing
   levels (doubling of gas cost) will have greater impacts on vehicle fleet
   composition, utilization, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas
   emissions than more incentive-based approaches such as free access to
   high-occupancy vehicle lanes for alternative-fuel vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Web browsing on mobile devices is undoubtedly the future. However, with
   the increasing complexity of webpages, the mobile device's computation
   capability and energy consumption become major pitfalls for a

   performance and energy consumption of mobile web browsing. This
   mechanism explores the performance and energy tradeoff in webpage
   loading, and schedules webpage loading according to the webpages'
   characteristics, using the different frequencies. The proposed solution
   achieves 20.3\% energy saving compared to the performance mode, and
   improves webpage loading performance by 37.1\% compared to the battery

Abstract = {{A Marangoni flow is shown to occur when a polymer film possessing a
   spatially-defined surface energy pattern is heated above its glass
   transition to the liquid state. This can be harnessed to rapidly
   manufacture polymer films possessing prescribed height profiles. To
   quantify and verify this phenomenon, a model is described here which
   accurately predicts the formation, growth, and eventual dissipation of
   topographical features. The model predictions, based on numerical
   solutions of equations governing thin film dynamics with a Marangoni
   stress, are quantitatively compared to experimental measurements of thin
   polystyrene films containing photochemically patterned surface energy
   gradients. Good agreement between the model and the data is achieved at
   temperatures between 120 and 140 degrees C for a comprehensive range of
   heating times using reasonable physical properties as parameter inputs.
   For example, thickness variations that measure 102\% of the starting
   film thickness are achieved in only 12 minutes of heating at 140 degrees
   C, values that are predicted by the model are within 6\% and 3 min,
   respectively. The photochemical pattern that directed this flow
   possessed only a 0.2 dyne cm(-1) variation in surface tension between
   exposed and unexposed regions. The physical insights from the validated
   model suggest promising strategies to maximize the aspect ratio of the
   topographical features and minimize the processing time necessary to
   develop them.}},

Title = {{Filtration in Frac Packs and Its Impact on Injector Performance}},
Journal = {{SPE PRODUCTION \& OPERATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{204-215}},
Abstract = {{The filtration of solids in the injection water in a frac pack is the
   primary factor controlling the injectivity decline in frac-packed
   water-injection-well completions. The injectivity may decline rapidly or
   much more slowly, depending on the degree of frac-pack filtration. The
   widening and lengthening of frac packs and the associated loss of sand
   control are affected also. However, there are no experimental data
   available for the filtration coefficient at high velocities that are
   typical in frac packs. In this research, the filtration coefficients
   were measured experimentally in high-velocity flows encountered in frac
   packs. The solid concentrations and pressure drops across proppant-pack
   sections were measured and correlated with earlier filtration theory and
   permeability-decline models. The filtration coefficients were measured
   at various flow rates and for different proppant sizes. Our experiments
   show that at high fluid velocities, the filtration coefficient is
   significantly lower than that estimated from prior correlations that are
   based on low-velocity filtration.
   We have developed new empirical correlations for filtration coefficients
   at high flow rates in frac packs. The improved filtration coefficients
   were used as the primary input into a well-injectivity model. The proper
   estimation of the filtration enabled us to more accurately analyze the
   impact of injection rates and proppant selection on injector performance
   (i.e., predict long-term injection-well behavior). The effect of
   particle filtration in the frac pack, and its effect on injector
   performance, was captured accurately for the first time. The newly
   presented empirical correlations coupled with a model for frac-pack
   growth in the injection well allowed us to estimate accurately the
   fracture dimensions and the long-term water injectivity of frac-packed
   injectors. These results can be used for frac-pack design, proppant
   selection, and specification of injection-water quality.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing in shale formations induces microseismic events in
   a region we refer to as the microseismic volume. Many of these
   microseismic events are signatures of failure in the formation that are
   believed to be a result of induced unpropped (IU) fractures beyond the
   primary propped fracture. Areally extensive microseismicity may be
   evidence that these IU fractures occur and extend spatially beyond the
   propped fracture during pumping in many unconventional reservoirs. We
   present evidence that these fractures close over time after pumping is
   stopped and that this closure of IU fractures can have a significant
   impact on stress interference between fractures.
   To illustrate these effects, microseismic and radioactive-tracer data
   are presented for four laterals drilled and fractured from a single pad.
   Two wells on this pad were fractured with the consecutive-fracturing
   sequence, and the other two wells were fractured with the
   zipper-fracturing sequence. Geomechanical simulations were performed to
   model the pad scenario and explain the microseismic and tracer
   observations, with emphasis on the two different fracturing sequences.
   Our simulations show that the opening of the IU fractures results in
   significant temporary changes to the stress field in the rock. One
   consequence of this is that later fracture stages tend to propagate into
   the open-fracture networks of IU fractures created earlier because of
   stress reorientation. This can lead to inefficient usage of fluid,
   proppant, and capital because the region that is being stimulated has
   already been stimulated by the previous stage. By analyzing the net
   pressure, radioactive-tracer data, and microseismic data from the
   four-well pad, we show that these IU fractures close over time because
   the fracture fluid leaks off. This reduces the stress shadow, and
   subsequent induced fractures are no longer subjected to the
   significantly altered stresses, allowing for more-efficient
   fracture-network coverage by subsequent fractures in a horizontal well.
   On the basis of the data presented and computer simulations, we propose
   the idea of maximizing the time between fracturing in the microseismic
   volume of a recently fractured region (within operational constraints).
   The time required for the IU fractures to close can be estimated from
   our models and varies on the basis of the reservoir and fluid properties
   from several hours to days. One example of how this is accomplished in
   practice is zipper fractures. However, our work suggests that there also
   may be other fracture-sequencing strategies for accomplishing this.}},

   the lithium sulfide is non-cycling, the low weight percentage of sulfur

   reduce the specific lithium storage capacity of the films relative to
   that of germanium. In addition to high capacity and superior lithium

Abstract = {{Stem cell-based therapies have demonstrated improved outcomes in
   preclinical and clinical trials for treating cardiovascular ischemic
   diseases. However, the contribution of stem cells to vascular repair is
   poorly understood. To elucidate these mechanisms, many have attempted to
   monitor stem cells following their delivery in vivo, but these studies
   have been limited by the fact that many contrast agents, including
   nanoparticles, are commonly passed on to non-stem cells in vivo.
   Specifically, cells of the reticuloendothelial system, such as
   macrophages, frequently endocytose free contrast agents, resulting in
   the monitoring of macrophages instead of the stem cell therapy. Here we
   demonstrate a dual gold nanoparticle system which is capable of
   monitoring both delivered stem cells and infiltrating macrophages using
   photoacoustic imaging. In vitro analysis confirmed preferential labeling
   of the two cell types with their respective nanoparticles and the
   maintenance of cell function following nanoparticle labeling. In
   addition, delivery of the system within a rat hind limb ischemia model
   demonstrated the ability to monitor stem cells and distinguish and
   quantify macrophage infiltration. These findings were confirmed by
   histology and mass spectrometry analysis. This work has important
   implications for cell tracking and monitoring cell-based therapies.}},

Abstract = {{We address the numerical solution of infinite-dimensional inverse
   problems in the framework of Bayesian inference. In Part I of this paper
   {[}T. Bui-Thanh, O. Ghattas, J. Martin, and G. Stadler, SIAM J. Sci.
   Comput., 35 (2013), pp. A2494-A2523] we considered the linearized
   infinite-dimensional inverse problem. In Part II, we relax the
   linearization assumption and consider the fully nonlinear
   infinite-dimensional inverse problem using a Markov chain Monte Carlo
   (MCMC) sampling method. To address the challenges of sampling
   high-dimensional probability density functions (pdfs) arising upon
   discretization of Bayesian inverse problems governed by PDEs, we build
   upon the stochastic Newton MCMC method. This method exploits problem
   structure by taking as a proposal density a local Gaussian approximation
   of the posterior pdf, whose covariance operator is given by the inverse
   of the local Hessian of the negative log posterior pdf. The construction
   of the covariance is made tractable by invoking a low-rank approximation
   of the data misfit component of the Hessian. Here we introduce an
   approximation of the stochastic Newton proposal in which we compute the
   low-rank-based Hessian at just the maximum a posteriori (MAP) point, and
   then reuse this Hessian at each MCMC step. We compare the performance of
   the proposed method to the original stochastic Newton MCMC method and to
   an independence sampler. The comparison of the three methods is
   conducted on a synthetic ice sheet inverse problem. For this problem,
   the stochastic Newton MCMC method with a MAP-based Hessian converges at
   least as rapidly as the original stochastic Newton MCMC method, but is
   far cheaper since it avoids recomputing the Hessian at each step. On the
   other hand, it is more expensive per sample than the independence
   sampler; however, its convergence is significantly more rapid, and thus
   overall it is much cheaper. Finally, we present extensive analysis and
   interpretation of the posterior distribution and classify directions in
   parameter space based on the extent to which they are informed by the
   prior or the observations.}},

Title = {{Field performance of retaining walls reinforced with woven and nonwoven

Journal = {{GEOSYNTHETICS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{270-284}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an evaluation of the performance of two instrumented
   sections of a geosynthetic-reinforced soil wall, 5.6 m high, constructed
   using a lateritic fine-grained soil. Two sections with identical layout
   of a nonwoven and a woven geotextile were monitored for comparison
   purposes. The unconfined tensile stiffness of the nonwoven geotextile
   was three times smaller than that of the woven geotextile. This allowed
   direct evaluation of the effect of soil confinement on geotextile
   stiffness. Instrumentation was used to measure face displacements,
   reinforcement displacement and strains, and soil matric suction.
   Rainfall occurred both during and after construction, which facilitated
   evaluation of the effect of soil wetting on the walls performance.
   Ultimate and serviceability limit state analyses were conducted to gain
   further insight into the performance of the two walls. The results show
   that the performance of the section reinforced with nonwoven geotextile
   was equivalent to the one reinforced with woven geotextile, even after
   the observed reduction in matric suction after rainfall. For both
   sections, the overall deformations occurred during construction.
   Negligible deformations were observed during service. Maximum face
   displacements were measured in the lowest instrumented layer for the
   nonwoven geotextile section whereas it was in the highest layer for the
   woven geotextile section. These behaviours of face displacement
   distributions can be the result of the significant differences in global
   stiffness of the sections. Design analyses and field performance show
   that soil confinement has a beneficial effect on the nonwoven geotextile
   stiffness. The significant contribution of the soil cohesion of the
   lateritic soil played an important role in the behaviour of the nonwoven
   geotextile-reinforced wall.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular relaxations of chitosan films have been investigated in the
   wide frequency range of 0.1 to 3 x 10(9) Hz from 10 degrees C to 110
   degrees C using dielectric spectroscopy. For the first time, two
   high-frequency relaxation processes (in the range 10(8) to 3 x 10(9) Hz)
   are reported in addition to the low frequency relaxations alpha and
   beta. These two relaxation processes are related to the vibrations of OH
   and NH2/NH3+, respectively. The high-frequency relaxations exhibit
   Arrhenius-type dependencies in the temperature range 10 degrees C to 54
   degrees C with negative activation energy; this observation is traceable
   to hydrogen bonding reorientation. At temperatures above the glass
   transition temperature (54 degrees C), the activation energy changes
   from negative to positive values due to breaking of hydrogen bonding and
   water loss. Upon cooling in a sealed environment, the activation
   energies of two relaxation processes are nearly zero. FTIR and XRD
   analyses reveal associated structural changes upon heating and cooling.
   These two new high-frequency relaxation processes can be attributed to
   the interaction of bound water with OH and NH2/NH3+, respectively. A
   plausible scenario for these high-frequency relaxations is discussed in
   light of impedance spectroscopy, TGA, FTIR and XRD measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Permeation grouting using weak grouts such as bentonite grout is one of
   the effective methods to mitigate liquefaction in loose saturated sand
   deposits. While a flow parameter of the grout such as yield stress
   determines its penetrability into the deposit and resistance to
   groundwater flow, a dynamic parameter such as critical storage modulus
   evaluates post-grouting performance of the treated soils under cyclic
   loading condition. However, the yield stress and critical storage
   modulus should be obtained through two different types of rheological
   tests: drag and oscillatory shear test. Although previous research has
   suggested a method to evaluate yield stress from an oscillatory shear
   test, the conventional method does not consider the time-dependent
   nature of bentonite grout, which is one of its crucial properties as a
   grout. In this study, flow and dynamic rheological properties of
   bentonite suspensions were measured using drag (stress ramp) and
   oscillatory shear (strain sweep) tests with a vane geometry for various
   weight fractions of bentonite suspensions (5, 7.5, 10, and 12 \%) and
   resting times (0 to 480 h). At different resting times, elastic and
   crossover stresses from strain sweep tests were compared to yield
   stresses obtained from stress ramp tests. The results showed that both
   the elastic and crossover stresses from strain sweep tests were
   significantly lower (40 \%-60 \%) than the yield stresses measured by
   stress ramp tests. The comparison also showed a dependency on particle
   fractions. In order to evaluate yield stress from the oscillatory shear
   test, a time-independent relationship between yield stress and critical
   storage modulus was proposed. This study suggests an economical approach
   to evaluate an important design parameter ({''}undisturbed{''} yield
   stress) in permeation grouting using bentonite grout.}},

Abstract = {{The Web browser is undoubtedly the single most important application in
   the mobile ecosystem. An average user spends 72 minutes each day using
   the mobile Web browser. Web browser internal engines (e.g., Web Kit) are
   also growing in importance because they provide a common substrate for
   developing various mobile Web applications. In a user-driven,
   interactive, and latency-sensitive environment, the browser's
   performance is crucial. However, the battery-constrained nature of
   mobile devices limits the performance that we can deliver for mobile Web
   browsing. As traditional general-purpose techniques to improve
   performance and energy efficiency fail short, we must employ
   domain-specific knowledge while still maintaining general-purpose
   flexibility.
   In this paper, we first perform design-space exploration to identify
   appropriate general-purpose architectures that uniquely fit the
   characteristics of a popular Web browsing engine. Despite our best
   effort, we discover sources of energy inefficiency in these customized
   general-purpose architectures, To mitigate these inefficiencies, we
   propose, synthesize, and evaluate two new domain-specific
   specializations, called the Style Resolution Unit and the Browser Engine
   Cache. Our optimizations boost energy efficiency and at the same time
   improve mobile Web browsing performance. As emerging mobile workloads
   increasingly rely more on Web browser technologies, the type of
   optimizations we propose will become important in the future and are
   likely to have lasting widespread impact.}},

Abstract = {{Undetectable data attacks on the power grid produces errors in the state
   estimation that can potentially affect electricity prices as well as
   make the grid vulnerable to failures. A new hidden attack framework is
   presented for power grids where all meter measurements are secure from
   injection of malicious data. An adversary here only jams or blocks meter
   data from being sent to the control center. Additionally the adversary
   causes errors in the status of breakers in the grid to change the
   topological estimate of the grid. Necessary and sufficient conditions
   for a successful hidden attack in this regime are discussed and an
   algorithm to determine an optimal attack involving the minimum set of
   breaker status errors is developed. The efficacy of this novel attack
   strategy that does not require corruption of any meter data is shown
   through examples.}},

Abstract = {{Process intensification principles have been applied to a large set of
   systems, from miniature devices to full-scale industrial plants.
   Focusing on the macroscopic realm, this paper reviews principles and
   pathways for intensifying industrial processes, starting with a core
   reaction-separation-recycle process structure and continuing with
   energyintegrated systems. An emphasis is placed on describing the
   interplay between economic, safety and environmental benefits, and the
   constraints and demands that intensification places on process design
   and process control by reducing the respective available degrees of
   freedom. Specific application examples are introduced to support these
   ideas. The paper concludes with an account of potential future
   development directions for theory and applications.}},

Abstract = {{Air separation processes are significant electricity consumers.
   Operating air separation units (ASUs) at variable capacity can be
   economically beneficial (in time varying electricity price scenarios)
   and can serve as a means for mitigating grid load during peak times.
   Process design should thus account for such operational fluctuations. In
   this paper, we study the optimal design of ASUs assumed to be operating
   at variable capacity under variable electricity price. We introduce a
   novel pseudo-transient equation-oriented framework for process
   modelling, and use the developed models together with a time
   relaxation-based optimization algorithm to optimize the design of the
   plant subject to a time-of-day price scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Microchannel reactors are one of the most successful implementations of
   the concept of process intensification in the chemical industry.
   However, combining unit operations at miniature scales reduces the
   number of measurements and actuators available, and poses specific
   control challenges for the resulting system. In this paper, we discuss
   the integration of two novel microchannel reactor design concepts that
   yield significant operational and control benefits. Specifically, we
   consider a segmented catalyst macromorphology along with confining a
   phase change material layer in the reactor structure, as the means for
   optimizing both the steady-state and transient temperature profiles in
   the reactor. Using an autothermal reactor for steam-methane reforming as
   a simulation case study, we show that the synergy of these concepts
   leads to improved temperature distribution and conversion, and increased
   resilience to disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Customarily, it is likely that irradiated graphene yield indication of
   perturbations induced by irradiation. High Resolution Transmission
   Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) analysis has been performed on proton
   irradiated graphene. The analysis indicates the existence of Moire
   patterns produced by the rotations induced by the irradiation in between
   planes. The rotations measured fluctuate between 3 and 5 degrees
   respectively. These rotations may influence the electronic properties of
   the material under investigation. In order to explain the observed
   rotations in between planes, theoretical analysis were performed under
   the scheme of extended Huckel tight-binding method. Average total energy
   of the system was careful analyzed throughout the experiment composed of
   two graphene layers with two carbon vacancies and then the replaced
   carbons were intercalated in between the two layers. The results
   obtained indicate that the system remain semi metallic. Moreover, the
   theoretical results yielded that the 3 degree rotation is favored,
   although the 5 degree rotation is not discarded. Furthermore, energy
   bands as well as total and projected DOS were performed in order to
   provide more information about the electronic changes induced by the
   rotations applied to the system.}},

Title = {{Numerical Well Testing Interpretation Model and Applications in
   Crossflow Double-Layer Reservoirs by Polymer Flooding}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{This work presents numerical well testing interpretation model and
   analysis techniques to evaluate formation by using pressure transient
   data acquired with logging tools in crossflow double-layer reservoirs by
   polymer flooding. A well testing model is established based on rheology
   experiments and by considering shear, diffusion, convection,
   inaccessible pore volume (IPV), permeability reduction, wellbore storage
   effect, and skin factors. The type curves were then developed based on
   this model, and parameter sensitivity is analyzed. Our research shows
   that the type curves have five segments with different flow status: (I)
   wellbore storage section, (II) intermediate flow section (transient
   section), (III) mid-radial flow section, (IV) crossflow section (from
   low permeability layer to high permeability layer), and (V) systematic
   radial flow section. The polymer flooding field tests prove that our
   model can accurately determine formation parameters in crossflow
   double-layer reservoirs by polymer flooding. Moreover, formation damage
   caused by polymer flooding can also be evaluated by comparison of the
   interpreted permeability with initial layered permeability before
   polymer flooding. Comparison of the analysis of numerical solution based
   on flow mechanism with observed polymer flooding field test data
   highlights the potential for the application of this interpretation
   method in formation evaluation and enhanced oil recovery (EOR).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study related to the development of a simple,
   compact thermal storage unit suitable for use in small to medium
   commercial applications that utilize chilled water cooling coils. This
   thermal store design is based on the use of a technical grade paraffin
   phase change material (PCM), macro-encapsulated into cylindrical tubes
   that are densely packed into a containment tank. An experimental scale
   model of this thermal store is constructed for testing purpose, and
   tests are conducted to determine the feasibility of this design and also
   to characterize its operation. The experimental thermal store proved
   capable of supplying usable energy for cooling purposes, but the overall
   efficiency (net recovery of thermal energy at a useable temperature)
   needs to be improved. This can be accomplished by manipulating overall
   thermal store capacity, adjusting the encapsulation tube size and
   quantity, and/or adjusting heat transfer fluid flow rates. Further
   experimentation is required to determine the optimum performance
   parameters for this application, and also to determine the effective
   thermodynamic properties of the technical grade PCM utilized in these
   experiments. Future work will use the findings from this study to
   develop a numeric model of the thermal store so that critical parameters
   of the design can be identified and optimized. A larger scale (6.25kWh)
   thermal store is under construction to support additional experiments
   and numeric model validation.}},

   Photocurrent measurements showed a 30\% increase in the presence of
   alloy nanoparticles, as well as a 50\% reduction in charge transfer
   resistance of the electrodes. These observations are attributed to
   adjusting a suitable Schottky barrier in the junction of TiO2/metal
   particles, which introduces applying alloy noble metallic particles as a
   new effective strategy for energy and environmental purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Internal stresses might induce microscopic cracks in concrete, which can
   provide pathways for ingress of harmful chemicals and can lead to loss
   of strength. Recent research in concrete materials suggests that it
   might be possible to develop a smart cement-based material that is
   capable of self-healing by leveraging the metabolic activity of
   microorganisms to provide biomineralization. Limited research on
   biomineralization in cement-based systems has shown promising results
   that healing of cracks can occur on the surface of concrete and reduce
   permeability. This paper presents the results from an investigation
   regarding the potential for a cement-based material to repair itself
   internally through biomineralization. Compressive strength test and coda
   wave interferometry (CWI) analyses were conducted on mortar samples that
   were loaded to 70\% of their compressive strength and cured in different
   conditions. Experimental results indicate that the damaged mortar
   samples with microorganisms showed significantly higher strength
   development and higher increase of ultrasonic wave velocity compared to
   samples without microorganisms at 7 and 28 days.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional atomic sheets have emerged as near ideal nanomaterials
   to overcome the long running challenge of achieving Si CMOS like
   performance on soft substrates at scales that can be suitable for large
   integration. For instance, the high mobility and velocity accessible in
   monolayer graphene affords GHz analog transistor devices while the large
   bandgap of graphene's semiconducting analogues (MoS2 and similar
   dichalcogenides) naturally lead to near ideal digital transistors with
   high on/off current ratio and low subthreshold slope while sustaining
   mobilities much larger than organic semiconductors or amorphous bulk
   semiconductors. Together, these physically similar atomic layers with
   vastly different electronic properties can serve as the electronic
   platform for low-power digital, high-speed mixed-signal, and
   high-frequency analog transistor building blocks for flexible
   nanoelectronic systems. Here we report GHz graphene transistors
   operating in the microwave frequency range, and address mobility and
   contact resistance extraction in semiconducting atomic sheets. Further
   progress on heterogeneous integration of graphene and 2D semiconducting
   crystals can enable future flexible nanosystems.}},

Abstract = {{We report an innovative mechanism for the synthesis of 3-D multilevel
   porous graphite superstructures using strategically engineered Cu-Ni
   catalysts. The 3-D thin-graphite nanostructures with two levels of
   porosity were synthesized by using porous nickel-copper (Ni-Cu)
   catalysts-engineered from Ni foams via an electrodeposition/etching
   process. The as-grown graphite is 3-D, multilevel porous, freestanding,
   and flexible after selective etching of the catalysts. The graphite
   coated with thin nickel hydroxide nanoplates {[}Ni(OH)(2)] was applied
   as electrodes for alkaline batteries. The electrodes are binder-free and
   offer a remarkable discharge capacity of similar to 480 mA h g(-1) at a
   rate of 1.5 A g(-1). Compared to previous reports, they also exhibit
   excellent cyclability with 97.5\% capacitance retention after 4000
   cycles. The high performance of the electrodes of porous
   graphite/Ni(OH)(2) could be attributed to the large specific surface
   area, excellent crystalline quality, controlled Ni(OH)(2)
   nanocrystalline assemblies, and high electric conductivity. Overall, the
   reported mechanism for the synthesis of 3-D porous graphite is the first
   of its kind, which may potentially spur a new paradigm for manufacturing
   3-D porous graphene/graphite materials for an array of energy storage
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon (Si) has a very high lithium storage capacity and is being
   explored as a negative electrode material in lithium-ion batteries
   (LIBs). Si nanowires can exhibit relatively stable performance for many
   cycles of charging; however, conductive carbon must often be added to
   the electrode layer to improve the rate capability due to the relatively
   low electrical conductivity of Si. The added carbon lowers the capacity
   of the electrode. Here, we show that the rate capability of Si in LIBs
   can be substantially enhanced by incorporating tin (Sn) into Si
   nanowires. The solubility of Sn in Si is very low (0.015 at\%), yet, Sn
   used as a seed for supercritical fluid-liquid-solid (SFLS) growth can be
   trapped in Si nanowires with relatively high concentration (10 at\%).
   Such Sn-containing Si nanowires and no added conductive carbon in the
   electrode layer, could be cycled in LIBs with high capacity (similar to
   1000 mA h g(-1) over 100 cycles) at a current density of 2.8 A g(-1) (1
   C). Capacities exceeding that of graphite could still be reached at
   cycle rates as high as 2 C. Real-time in situ transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) revealed that lithiation occurs five times faster in Si
   nanowires with significant amounts of Sn than in the Si nanowires
   without Sn, and twice as fast as in nanowires that were coated with
   carbon.}},

Abstract = {{Through-silicon via (TSV) is a critical element connecting stacked dies
   in three-dimensional (3D) integration. The mismatch of thermal expansion
   coefficients between the Cu via and Si can generate significant stresses
   in the TSV structure to cause reliability problems. In this study, the
   thermal stress in the TSV structure was measured by the wafer curvature
   method and its unique stress characteristics were compared to that of a
   Cu thin film structure. The thermo-mechanical characteristics of the Cu
   TSV structure were correlated to microstructure evolution during thermal
   cycling and the local plasticity in Cu in a triaxial stress state. These
   findings were confirmed by microstructure analysis of the Cu vias and
   finite element analysis (FEA) of the stress characteristics. In
   addition, the local plasticity and deformation in and around individual
   TSVs were measured by synchrotron x-ray microdiffraction to supplement
   the wafer curvature measurements. The importance and implication of the
   local plasticity and residual stress on TSV reliabilities are discussed
   for TSV extrusion and device keep-out zone (KOZ).}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating the coverage of tests for large circuits is computationally
   very intensive, particularly for logic BIST, software-based self test
   and on-line test schemes. This has led to research into techniques for
   rapidly evaluating the coverage of proposed test. We introduce a new
   metric which is highly correlated with fault coverage measured by
   gate-level simulators. Based on this metric, we estimate the time when
   the fault coverage saturates. This is done with only one pass of
   simulation and it provides a measure of the effectiveness of the test
   sequence when applied to the circuit-under-test; additionally, the fault
   coverage can be estimated with a relatively small number of test
   vectors. Experimental results on the ISCAS'85 and ISCAS'89 benchmarks,
   and a RISC processor (OR1200), show an average error of 2.85\% in the
   estimated fault coverage compared with the fault coverage from full
   fault simulation, with an average speedup over 8x for large circuits.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a multi-frontal solver algorithm for the
   adaptive finite element method expressed by graph grammar productions.
   The graph grammar productions construct first the binary elimination
   tree, and then process frontal matrices stored in distributed manner in
   nodes of the elimination tree. The solver is specialized for a class of
   one, two and three dimensional h refined meshes whose elimination tree
   has a regular structure. In particular, this class contains all one
   dimensional grids, two and three dimensional grids refined towards point
   singularities, two dimensional grids refined in an anisotropic way
   towards edge singularity as well as three dimensional grids refined in
   an anisotropic way towards edge or face singularities. In all these
   cases, the structure of the elimination tree and the structure of the
   frontal matrices are similar. The solver is implemented within the
   Galois environment, which allows parallel execution of graph grammar
   productions. We also compare the performance of the Galois
   implementation of our graph grammar based solver with the MUMPS solver.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{34-44}},
Abstract = {{Research on travel demand modeling has primarily focused on weekday
   activity travel patterns. However, weekend activities and travel
   constitute a major component of individuals' overall weekly activity
   travel participation. This paper describes a modeling effort that
   focuses on weekend activity travel demand for discretionary events. This
   study bridges the gap in the literature by modeling participation in
   discretionary types of events, the duration of participation, and
   accompaniment type jointly in a simultaneous equations model system. A
   joint discrete continuous modeling framework is formulated for analysis
   of these dimensions as a choice bundle. Specifically, the combination of
   event type and accompaniment type constitutes the discrete component,
   whereas the duration of participation constitutes the continuous
   component. The model uses a copula-based sample selection approach that
   ties the discrete choice error component with the duration error
   component in a flexible manner. The data used in the paper are drawn
   from the 2008-2009 National Household Travel Survey sample of the
   greater Phoenix metropolitan area in Arizona. The results from the
   estimation process highlight the presence of sample selection in the
   joint modeling context. Furthermore, the results also highlight the
   flexibility of copula models in capturing such sample selection. The
   best copula model results are used to generate hazard profiles for
   various alternative related duration intervals. The generated profiles
   highlight the inaccurate predictions obtained by the use of approaches
   that ignore the presence of sample selection.}},

Abstract = {{This paper showcases MadApp, an application-level development framework
   that supports the expressive development and flexible deployment of
   applications for web applications in delay-tolerant networks. MadApp
   allows web applications to be developed in two pieces. First, a static
   piece that contains unchanging content can be downloaded from a
   traditional web server. This static piece may specify ``holes{''} that
   designate places in which dynamically collected content can be
   integrated into the web application as this content is opportunistically
   collected from the pervasive computing environment. MadApp supports both
   the development of these web applications by making is easy to specify
   this missing content and how it is dynamically integrated and the
   deployment of the web applications by providing middleware support for
   collecting and integrating content on the fly. This demonstration
   showcases how MadApp can be used to support such opportunistic web
   applications through a webpage integrated with the demonstration event
   itself. Users will be able to download a webpage that contains a static
   map and a listing of the demonstrations. As users move through the
   demonstration space, they can generate content, e. g., photos of
   demonstrations, which their app will then share opportunistically with

Abstract = {{Electrochromic devices, which dynamically change colour under applied
   potential, are widely studied for use in energy-efficient smart windows.
   To improve the viability of smart windows, many researchers are
   utilizing nanomaterials, which can provide electrochromic devices with
   improved colouration efficiencies, faster switching times, longer cycle
   lives, and potentially reduced costs. In an effort to demonstrate a new
   type of electrochromic device that goes beyond the capabilities of
   commonly used electrochromic materials, researchers have turned to
   plasmonic transparent conductive oxide (TCO) nanocrystals.
   Electrochemical injection of electrons into plasmonic TCO nanocrystal
   films induces a shift in the plasmon frequency and gives rise to the new
   functionality of selective optical modulation in the near-infrared
   region of the solar spectrum. These nanocrystals can be used as building
   blocks to enable creation of advanced electrochromic devices containing
   mesoporous electrodes or nanocrystal-in-glass composites. Such devices
   have been important in advancing the field towards achieving the ideal
   smart window with independent control over visible and NIR
   transmittance.}},

Abstract = {{High surface area (367 m(2) g(-1)) meso-porous Co3O4 was investigated as
   the precursor of the anode material for lithium and also sodium ion
   batteries. Co3O4 is considered a potential anode material due to its
   theoretical capacity of 890 mA h g(-1), over twice that of graphite.
   This comparatively higher capacity can be safely charged at rapid rates
   owing to a relatively high Li-insertion potentials, but, consequently,
   the discharged energy is yielded at an average potential near 2 V vs.
   Li/Li+, with full Li-extraction achieved over a continuum of potentials
   up to 3 V. The products of the lithium reduction of Co3O4 cycle stably
   from 0.01-3.0 V vs. Li/Li+ with 600-900 mA h g(-1) capacity retention at
   C rates from 1-5; the products of its sodium reduction cycle stably from
   0.01-3.0 V vs. Na/Na+ at C-rates up to 1 C with a lower 150-400 mA h
   g(-1) capacity retention owing to greater ionic impedance. TEM, SAED and
   XRD were used to examine the cycled material and the stable performance
   is attributed to finding that the mesoporous structure is retained.
   Evaluation of five electrolyte formulations testing EC, FEC and Cl-EC
   showed that the stable meso-porous structure was best cycled with 5\%
   FEC in EC:DEC at high charge/discharge rates, retaining 77\% of its
   initial capacity at 5 C in a rate test. Comparison of the AC impedance
   spectra and of the XPS of the SEIs formed in the presence and in the
   absence of 5 vol\% FEC shows that the SEI formed in the presence of FEC
   contains lithium fluoride and its carbonate layer is thinner than that
   formed in its absence, resulting in lesser impedance to Li migration
   through the SEI and facile ion desolvation, improving the cycling
   performance. In cycling stability tests with EC: DEC, irregular cycling
   behaviour attributable to abrupt rises in cell resistance was regularly
   observed after testing over a few hundred cycles. Long-term cycling
   irregularities are inhibited by halogenated solvents and completely
   eliminated by adding fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC).}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a modeling approach for evaluating the effect of a

   using a light rail service (versus that of not using it) by means of
   daily individual panel observations collected in the context of a
   program of voluntary travel behavior change (VTBC) before and after the
   provision of a personalized travel plan. In this regard, a VTBC program
   was a policy measure that used communication and information to
   encourage individuals to use more sustainable travel modes. In this
   study, the VTBC program was implemented by providing car users with
   personalized information about how to introduce the light rail service

Abstract = {{The US Energy Information Administration projects that hydraulic
   fracturing of shale formations will become a dominant source of domestic
   natural gas supply over the next several decades, transforming the
   energy landscape in the United States. However, the environmental
   impacts associated with fracking for shale gas have made it
   controversial. This review examines emissions and impacts of air
   pollutants associated with shale gas production and use. Emissions and
   impacts of greenhouse gases, photochemically active air pollutants, and
   toxic air pollutants are described. In addition to the direct
   atmospheric impacts of expanded natural gas production, indirect effects
   are also described. Widespread availability of shale gas can drive down
   natural gas prices, which, in turn, can impact the use patterns for
   natural gas. Natural gas production and use in electricity generation
   are used as a case study for examining these indirect consequences of
   expanded natural gas availability.}},

Abstract = {{We have built an Anatomically Correct Testbed (ACT) hand with the
   purpose of understanding the intrinsic biomechanical and control
   features of the human hands that are critical for achieving robust,
   versatile, and dexterous movements as well as object and world
   exploration. By mimicking the underlying mechanics and controls of the
   human hand in a hardware platform, our goal is to achieve previously
   unmatched grasping and manipulation capabilities. In this chapter we
   present distinguishing design philosophy and features of the ACT Hand
   compared to the existing robotic hands, and the details of the design
   and assembly of the finger bones, joints, tendons and actuators. We
   derive and analyze the unique muscle-to-joint relationships, called the
   moment arms, in the ACT Hand index finger, and present a software
   architecture for the control of the hand movement and forces by
   controlling the numerous muscle actuators. We also illustrate the
   grasping and manipulation abilities of the ACT Hand. The fully
   functional ACT Hand platform allows us to experiment with novel control
   algorithms to develop a deeper understanding of human dexterity.}},

   crystallography in being able to image frozen-hydrated biological
   complexes in their ``native{''} state, in solution. For years the
   ribosome has been the benchmark sample for particles without symmetry.
   It has witnessed steady improvement in resolution from the very first
   single-particle 3D reconstruction to today's reconstructions at

   of sample preparation, data collection, data processing, and modeling
   that led to the 5 structure of the T. brucei ribosome {[}32]. A local
   resolution estimation demonstrates the extent to which resolution can be
   anisotropic and pinpoints regions of higher heterogeneity or structural

Series = {{Neuromethods}},

Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{33-51}},
Abstract = {{The optical properties of neural tissues play critical roles in all
   types of optical imaging methods. The wavelength-dependent absorption
   and scattering properties of tissue influence imaging resolution,
   penetration depth, and often provide sources of contrast. Therefore,
   quantitative interpretation of imaging data requires knowledge of the
   optical properties of neural tissues. Light scattering in tissue arises
   from nanometer-scale spatial variations in refractive index and requires
   a thorough electromagnetic description of light propagation through this
   complex medium. Unfortunately, the complexity of neural tissues and the
   difficulty in measuring refractive index values make such a complete
   description unrealistic. Therefore, approximations must be made in order
   to characterize the light scattering properties of neural tissue. This
   chapter summarizes the various approaches to assess and describe the
   optical properties of neural tissue and discusses their role for
   cortical imaging.}},

Abstract = {{The technique of geosteering has been widely adopted in the petroleum
   industry for proper wellbore positioning. The benefits of geosteering
   have become more pronounced as drilling environments have become more
   complex. Geosteering-related technologies, such as downhole
   information-gathering tools and real-time data-transmission and
   data-analysis applications, have been continuously and significantly
   improved to support geosteering decisions. However, the full value of
   these advancements has yet to be realized.
   Because of uncertainties in predrill geological models, information
   gathered while drilling is applied in making real-time
   reservoir-navigation decisions. To achieve an optimal result requires a
   series of high-quality decisions regarding well-trajectory adjustment.
   Interestingly, geosteering-related literature does not demonstrate that
   the industry has applied a logically consistent approach for making
   geosteering decisions. Common practice, as described in the literature,
   does not clearly and quantitatively state measurable objectives, key
   underlying uncertainties, or relevance between underlying uncertainties
   and real-time information. Furthermore, it is unclear how a specific
   geosteering decision is being reached. Lacking a systematic and
   transparent framework for supporting geosteering decisions, the current
   approach is unlikely to result in optimal decisions for placing the well
   in the best possible location.(1)
   In this paper, we introduce and discuss a decision-driven approach to
   the geosteering process. The main contributions of the paper are
   threefold: (1) a review of 46 SPE papers on geosteering, including a
   discussion of the main features of current geosteering methods; (2) the
   development and discussion of a decision analytic framework to support
   high-quality geosteering decisions; and (3) implementation of Bayesian
   inference techniques to consistently update ahead-of-the-bit reservoir
   uncertainties while behind-the-bit data are gathered in real time. The
   new framework relates real-time information to the key reservoir
   uncertainties and provides an unbiased and consistent approach for
   making high-quality geosteering decisions.}},

   Wells}},

Abstract = {{A proppant-filled fracture induces mechanical stresses in the
   surrounding rock that cause a reduction in the horizontal-stress
   contrast and stress reorientation around the open fracture. A 3D
   geomechanical model is used to simulate the stress reorientation caused
   by open fractures and to generate horizontal-stress-contrast contour
   maps. The reduction in horizontal-stress contrast can lead to increased
   fracture complexity. This paper describes ways to increase fracture
   complexity by varying the completion design.
   In this paper, we identify the impact of operator-controllable variables
   in a completion design on fracture complexity. This can lead to
   more-effective completion designs that improve well productivity,
   reservoir drainage, and, ultimately, the estimated ultimate recovery
   (EUR).
   The possibility of greater fracture complexity and reduced/effective
   fracture spacing and, thus, a higher drainage area is demonstrated for
   the alternate fracturing sequence in comparison to the conventional
   fracturing sequence. The Young's-modulus value of the shale and the
   in-situ horizontal-stress contrast are shown to be significant factors
   controlling the extent of fracture complexity generated in a given
   reservoir. In addition, the effect of proppant mass injected per stage
   is also shown to significantly impact fracture complexity. We provide
   optimal ranges of fracture spacing and proppant volume for the various
   shale formations analyzed.
   The use of these guidelines should result in more fracture complexity
   than would otherwise be observed. The results presented in the paper
   provide the operator with the knowledge to design completions and
   fracture treatments (proppant volume, fracture spacing, and sequencing)
   to maximize reservoir drainage and to increase EURs. This should lead to
   more-effective completion designs.}},

Abstract = {{Reactions between hydrocarbons and ozone or hydroxyl radicals lead to
   the formation of oxidized species, including reactive oxygen species
   (ROS), and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the troposphere. ROS can
   be carried deep into the lungs by small aerodynamic particles where they
   can cause oxidative stress and cell damage. While environmental studies
   have focused on ROS in the gas phase and rainwater, it is also important
   to determine concentrations of ROS on respirable particles. Samples of
   PM2.5 collected over 3 h at midday on 40 days during November 2011 and
   September 2012 show that the particulate ROS concentration in Austin,
   Texas, ranged from a minimum value of 0.02 nmoles H2O2 m(-3) air in
   December to 3.81 nmoles H2O2 m(-3) air in September. Results from
   correlation tests and linear regression analysis on particulate ROS
   concentrations and environmental conditions (which included ozone and
   PM2.5 concentrations, temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and
   solar radiation) indicate that ambient particulate ROS is significantly
   influenced by the ambient ozone concentration, temperature and incident
   solar radiation. Particulate ROS concentrations measured in this study
   were in the range reported by other studies in the US, Taiwan and
   Singapore. This study is one of the first to assess seasonal variations
   in particulate ROS concentrations and helps explain the influence of
   environmental conditions on particulate ROS concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigated the extent of fluoride contamination in the
   Bongo District of northeast Ghana and the relationships of this fluoride
   contamination to the underlying geology and precipitation patterns,
   social and cultural attitudes towards water, and age divisions inherent
   in water usage patterns and the consequent demands placed on a borehole.
   The fluoride concentrations measured in the area are higher than
   reported in earlier literature. High fluoride levels are geographically
   confined to one geologic formation and appear to be inversely correlated
   to regional precipitation. Fluoride variation studies, tracking
   concentrations over 8 months, also reflect this link to local
   precipitation patterns. This localized analysis of water contamination
   issues addresses broader gender and policy issues inherent in supplying
   potable water.}},

Title = {{BRIDGING FROM PORE TO CONTINUUM: A HYBRID MORTAR DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION
   FRAMEWORK FOR SUBSURFACE FLOW AND TRANSPORT}},
Journal = {{MULTISCALE MODELING \& SIMULATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{667-693}},
Abstract = {{Flow and transport in the subsurface occurs over a wide range of spatial
   scales (nanometer to kilometer). Modeling at the pore scale becomes
   imperative where scales are not separable. Since pore-scale models are
   computationally limited to small domain sizes, accurate field-scale
   modeling requires simulating parts of the reservoir at the pore scale
   and other parts at the continuum. The need for modeling large pore-scale
   domains for ascertaining macroscopic parameters is prevalent in the
   literature. We develop a hybrid mortar domain decomposition framework
   for parallel modeling (linear and nonlinear) flow and transport across
   scales and in large pore-scale domains. Novel and efficient mortar
   methods for coupling flow and transport are adapted and developed and
   comparisons are presented. Mortars are developed for pore-to-pore and
   pore-to-continuum interfaces and shown to be more suitable than the
   commonly used Lagrangian mortars for these interfaces. The methods are
   shown to produce accurate results and demonstrated to be much more
   efficient than solving the problem as a single domain even in the
   absence of parallelism (especially for transport). The coupling
   algorithms are also extended to include diffusive transport. The methods
   are further applied and validated for coupling pore-scale to
   continuum-scale subdomains. Finally, the methods are shown to be
   computationally efficient for nonlinear flow problems. The results of
   this work provide a promising step forward in closing the spatial gap
   between the pore scale and the continuum.}},

Title = {{A POSTERIORI ERROR CONTROL FOR DPG METHODS}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1335-1353}},
Abstract = {{A combination of ideas in least-squares finite element methods with
   those of hybridized methods recently led to discontinuous
   Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) finite element methods. They minimize a residual
   inherited from a piecewise ultraweak formulation in a nonstandard,
   locally computable, dual norm. This paper establishes a general a
   posteriori error analysis for the natural norms of the DPG schemes under
   conditions equivalent to a priori stability estimates. It is proven that
   the locally computable residual norm of any discrete function is a lower
   and an upper error bound up to explicit data approximation errors. The
   presented abstract framework for a posteriori error analysis applies to
   known DPG discretizations of Laplace and Lame equations and to a novel
   DPG method for the stress-velocity formulation of Stokes flow with
   symmetric stress approximations. Since the error control does not rely
   on the discrete equations, it applies to inexactly computed or otherwise
   perturbed solutions within the discrete spaces of the functional
   framework. Numerical illustrations show that the error control is
   practically feasible.}},

Abstract = {{A lattice-type Monte Carlo-based mesoscale model and simulation of the
   lithography process have been adapted to study the insoluble particle
   generation that arises from statistically improbable events. These
   events occur when there is a connected pathway of soluble material that
   envelops a volume of insoluble material due to fluctuations in the
   deprotection profile. The simulation shows that development erodes the
   insoluble material into the developer stream and produces a cavity on
   the line edge that can be far larger than a single polymer molecule. The
   insoluble particles can coalesce to form aggregates that deposit on the
   wafer surface. The effect of the resist formulation, exposure,
   postexposure bake, and development variables on particle generation was
   analyzed in both low- and high-frequency domains. It is suggested that
   different mechanisms are dominant for the formation of line-edge
   roughness (LER) at different frequencies. The simulations were used to
   assess the commonly proposed measures to reduce LER such as the use of
   low molecular weight polymers, addition of quenchers, varying acid
   diffusion length, etc. The simulation can be used to help set process
   variables to minimize the extent of particle generation and LER. (C)

   reliability-based foundation design}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{18-26}},
Abstract = {{Design of foundations for offshore energy production typically requires
   soil characterization over large areas. Often, in uniform geological
   settings, it is neither practical nor economical to acquire geotechnical
   data at every foundation location. Additionally, the zone of interest
   for the foundation may extend deeper than the available geotechnical
   data. This paper describes a model of spatial variability in
   geotechnical properties for foundation design in deep water Gulf of
   Mexico. The geology consists of normally to slightly over-consolidated
   marine clays. Data are available for about 100 locations with soil
   borings, jumbo piston cores and cone penetration tests. A random field
   model that describes spatial variations in the design undrained shear
   strength is formulated and calibrated. This model is incorporated into a
   reliability-based framework to account for uncertainty due to spatial
   variability in foundation design. In this setting, depth-averaged values
   of design undrained shear strength are correlated over longer distances
   than point values due to stratigraphic features. There is less variation
   and greater spatial correlation in the design undrained shear strength
   for deeper versus shallower deposits and along the continental shelf
   versus off from the shelf. The increased conservatism required in
   foundation design due to spatial variability when site-specific strength
   data are not available is generally small. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Stereoscopic viewing of 3D medical imaging data has the potential to
   increase the detection of abnormalities. We present a new stereo model
   observer inspired by the characteristics of stereopsis in human vision.
   Given a stereo pair of images of an object (i.e., left and right images
   separated by a small displacement), the model observer first finds the
   corresponding points between the two views, and then fuses them together
   to create a 2D cyclopean view. Assuming that the cyclopean view has
   extracted most of the 3D information presented in the stereo pair, a
   channelized Hotel ling observer (CHO) can be utilized to make decisions.
   We conduct a simulation study that attempts to mimic the detection of
   breast lesions on stereoscopic viewing of breast tomosynthesis
   projection images. We render voxel datasets that contain random 3D
   power-law noise to model normal breast tissues with various breast
   densities. 3D Gaussian signal is added to some of the datasets to model
   the presence of a breast lesion. By changing the separation angle
   between the two views, multiple stereo pairs of projection images are
   generated for each voxel dataset. The performance of the model is
   evaluated in terms of the accuracy of binary decisions on the presence
   of the simulated lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Crystalline lanthanum aluminate (LAO) films were grown epitaxially on
   SrTiO3(001) and on Si(001) with a buffer layer of four unit cells of
   SrTiO3 by atomic layer deposition. The SrTiO3 buffer layer was grown by
   molecular beam epitaxy. Tris(N,N'-diisopropylformamidinate)-lanthanum,
   trimethylaluminum, and water as co-reactants were employed at 250
   degrees C for atomic layer deposition. Films were characterized using
   ex-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction, X-ray diffraction
   and in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The as-deposited LAO films
   were amorphous. Different annealing conditions were necessary to realize
   crystalline films because of different degrees of tensile strain between
   crystalline LAO and the SrTiO3 or the Si(001) substrate. When grown on
   SrTiO3(001), with a lattice mismatch of 2.9\%, annealing temperatures of
   750 degrees C for 2 h were necessary. Crystalline films were realized at
   600 degrees C under vacuum at 2 h for SrTiO3-buffered Si(001), with a
   lattice mismatch of 1.3\%. By keeping the annealing temperature
   relatively low (2 h at 600 degrees C under vacuum), the interfacial
   amorphous layer at the STO/Si interface was minimized to about one
   monolayer and an abrupt interface between SrTiO3 and LAO was maintained.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate several building blocks of true-time-delay (TTD) network,
   including subwavelength grating couplers, photonic crystal waveguide TTD
   lines, and multimode interferometer (MMI) power splitters fabricated on
   silicon nanomembrane (SiNM) transferred onto unconventional substrates,
   such as glass, Kapton. Bending tests performed on flexible gratings
   demonstrate operation even at similar to 15mm bending radius, with about
   5dB loss. The 1x16 cascaded multimode interference (MMI) based power
   splitter demonstrates uniformity of 0.96dB across all the 16 output
   channels, and an insertion loss of 0.56dB. The photonic crystal
   waveguides are designed to provide large time delay values within a
   short length. Photonic crystal tapers are implemented at the
   strip-photonic crystal waveguide interfaces to minimize loss and provide
   larger time delay values. A large group index of similar to 28.5 is
   calculated from the measurement data, thus indicating achievability of
   time delay larger than 58ps per millimeter length of the delay line
   within a tuning range of 20nm. The demonstrated building blocks present
   a viable path for obtaining scalable TTD modules on unconventional

Abstract = {{Gold plasmonic nanoparticles are receiving attention for a variety of
   types of NIR optical biomedical imaging including photoacoustic imaging.
   Herein we present a novel method to assemble equilibrium gold
   nanoclusters from 5 nm primary gold nanospheres, which exhibit high
   near-infrared (NIR) absorbance and subsequently fully dissociate back to
   primary particles, which has the potential to enable renal clearance.
   The nanoparticle assembly is manipulated via controlling colloidal
   interactions, specifically electrostatic repulsion and depletion
   attraction. The charge on the primary similar to 5 nm gold nanospheres
   is tailored via place exchange reactions with a variety of biocompatible
   ligands such as citrate, lysine and cysteine. The primary particles form
   clusters upon addition of a biodegradable polymer,
   PLA(1k)-b-PEG(10k)-b-PLA(1k), followed by controlled solvent
   evaporation. The cluster size may be tuned from 20-40 nm in diameter by
   manipulating the gold and polymer concentrations along with the solvent
   evaporation extent. Salt is also added to increase the NIR absorbance
   and reduce the nanocluster size by reducing polymer adsorption. The
   adsorption of the polymer onto the Au surfaces effectively quenches the
   nanoclusters. High NIR absorption facilitates photoacoustic imaging,
   even for the small cluster sizes. In response to acidic cellular pH
   environments, the polymer degrades and the clusters dissociate back to
   primary particle on the order of 5 nm, which are small enough for renal
   clearance.}},

   Electrochemical charge-discharge cycling at various rates and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements have been carried
   out with and without 2 vol\% of the fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)

   structures, the FeSb-TiC-C nanocomposite anodes demonstrate superior
   rate capability with good capacity retention at 10 000 mA g(-1) for
   sodium-ion storage, which could be ascribed to the novel nanocomposite
   structure consisting of a good metal (Fe) framework and a combination of
   conductive TiC and carbon as a matrix. The FEC additive particularly
   leads to a longer cycle life with high rate capability due to the
   formation of a stable, thin SEI layer and a smaller charge-transfer

Abstract = {{The electrochemical performance of lithium-rich layered oxide cathode
   materials coated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/AlPO4 hybrid coatings
   has been investigated. The amount of graphene was varied from 0.5 to 4.0
   wt\%, while AlPO4 was maintained at 2.0 wt\%. The structure and
   morphology of the samples have been investigated using X-ray
   diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron
   microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Compared to the
   pristine cathode, the rGO/AlPO4-coated cathodes exhibit higher discharge
   capacity with lower irreversible capacity loss, better cyclability, and
   higher rate capability. Specifically, the rGO (0.5 wt\%)/AlPO4 (2.0
   wt\%)- and rGO (1.0 wt\%)/AlPO4 (2.0 wt\%)-coated samples exhibit high
   discharge capacities of 235 mA h g(-1) and 240 mA h g(-1), respectively,
   at C/10 rate with capacity retentions of 94\% and 95\%, respectively, at
   100 cycles. Moreover, the rGO/AlPO4-coated cathodes show better
   cyclability than the pristine cathode at an elevated temperature (55
   degrees C). The superior electrochemical performances of the
   rGO/AlPO4-coated electrodes could be attributed to the decrease in the
   Li content in the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and
   facilitation of faster charge transfer as suggested by XPS and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).}},

Title = {{Synthesis of BiVO4 nanoflake array films for photoelectrochemical water

Abstract = {{Because of the potential for application in photoelectrochemical cells
   for water splitting, the synthesis of nanostructured BiVO4 is receiving
   increasing attention. Here we report a simple new drop-casting method
   for the first time to synthesize un-doped and doped bismuth vanadate
   (BiVO4) nanoflake array films. Synthesis parameters such as the amount
   of polyethylene glycol 600 (PEG-600) and the precursor solution drying
   time are investigated to optimize the films for photoelectrochemical
   water oxidation. The BiVO4 films consisting of nanoflakes with an
   average thickness of 20 nm and length of 2 mu m were synthesized from a
   precursor solution containing Bi3+, V3+ and PEG-600 with a Bi : V:
   PEG-600 volume ratio of 2 : 2 : 1, dried at 135 degrees C for 55 min.
   Photoelectrochemical measurements show that the BiVO4 nanoflake array
   films have higher photoelectrochemical activity than the BiVO4
   nanoparticle films. Additionally, the nanoflake arrays were tested after
   incorporating W and Mo to enhance the photoelectrochemical activity. The
   2\% W, 6\% Mo co-doped BiVO4 nanoflake array films demonstrate the best
   photoelectrochemical activity with photocurrent densities about 2 times
   higher than the un-doped BiVO4 nanoflake films and greater than the
   photocurrents of individually Mo doped or W doped BiVO4 films. The
   origin of enhanced photoelectrochemical activity for the co-doped film
   may be due to the improved conductivity through the BiVO4 or slightly
   enhanced water oxidation kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops an approach that uses GIS and an unlabeled
   multinomial logit (MNL) model to estimate the impact bridge facility
   attributes have on bicycle travel behavior. The data used to estimate
   the model were collected from May to October 2011 in Austin, TX via a
   GPS-based smartphone application that allowed trips to be tracked in
   real time. Demographic (age, gender, and cycle frequency) and trip
   purpose information was also collected. Three attributes are analyzed in
   the model: bridge accessibility to the bicycle network, vehicular
   volume, and bicycle separation from traffic. Accessibility and bicycle
   separation significantly impacted bicyclists' behavior, especially for
   female and infrequent bicyclists as well as for trips where travel time
   is not a significant issue. Distance was also analyzed and found to be
   the most significant factor, particularly for time-constrained trips
   (trips during the peak period and commute trips). Distance was less
   important for recreational trips as well as for female bicyclists.}},

Abstract = {{Grating couplers are ideal for coupling into the tightly confined
   propagation modes of semiconductor waveguides. In addition, nonlinear
   optics has benefited from the sub-diffraction limit confinement of
   horizontal slot waveguides. By combining these two advancements,
   slot-based nonlinear optics with mode areas less than 0.02 mu(2) can
   become as routine as twisting fiber connectors together. Surface normal
   fiber alignment to a chip is also highly desirable from time, cost, and
   manufacturing considerations. To meet these considerable design
   challenges, a custom genetic algorithm is created which, starting from
   purely random designs, creates a unique four stage grating coupler for
   two novel horizontal slot waveguide platforms. For horizontal
   multiple-slot waveguides filled with silicon nanocrystal, a theoretical
   fiber-to-waveguide coupling efficiency of 68\% is obtained. For thin
   silicon waveguides clad with optically active silicon nanocrystal, known
   as cover-slot waveguides, a theoretical fiber-to-waveguide coupling
   efficiency of 47\% is obtained, and 1 dB and 3 dB theoretical bandwidths
   of 70 nm and 150 nm are obtained, respectively. Both waveguide platforms
   are fabricated from scratch, and their respective on-chip grating
   couplers are experimentally measured from a standard single mode fiber
   array that is mounted surface normally. The horizontal multiple-slot
   grating coupler achieved an experimental 60\% coupling efficiency, and
   the horizontal cover-slot grating coupler achieved an experimental
   38.7\% coupling efficiency, with an extrapolated 1 dB bandwidth of 66
   nm. This report demonstrates the promise of genetic algorithm-based
   design by reducing to practice the first large bandwidth vertical
   grating coupler to a novel silicon nanocrystal horizontal cover-slot
   waveguide.}},

Abstract = {{Three dimensional single-molecule tracking (3D-SMT) has revolutionized
   the way we study fundamental cellular processes. By analyzing the
   spatial trajectories of individual molecules (e. g. a receptor or a
   signaling molecule) in 3D space, one can discern the internalization or
   transport dynamics of these molecules, study the heterogeneity of
   subcellular structures, and elucidate the complex spatiotemporal
   regulation mechanisms. Sub-diffraction localization precision,
   sub-millisecond temporal resolution and tens-of-seconds observation
   period are the benchmarks of current 3D-SMT techniques. We have recently
   built two molecular tracking systems in our labs. The first system is a
   previously reported confocal tracking system, which we denote as the
   1P-1E-4D (one-photon excitation, one excitation beam, and four
   fiber-coupled detectors) system. The second system is a whole new design
   that is based on two-photon excitation, which we denote as the 2P-4E-1D
   (two-photon excitation, four excitation beams, and only one detector)
   system. Here we compare these two systems based on Monte Carlo
   simulation of tracking a diffusing fluorescent molecule. Through our
   simulation, we have characterized the limitation of individual systems
   and optimized the system parameters such as magnification, z-plane
   separation, and feedback gains.}},

Abstract = {{We present an algorithm which computes the value function and optimal
   paths for a two-player static game, where the goal of one player is to
   maintain visibility of an adversarial player for as long as possible,
   and that of the adversarial player is to minimize this time. In a static
   game both players choose their controls at initial time and run in
   open-loop for t > 0 until the end-game condition is met. Closed-loop
   (feedback strategy) games typically require solving PDEs in high
   dimensions and thus pose insurmountable computational challenges. We
   demonstrate that, at the expense of a simpler information pattern that
   is more conservative towards one player, more memory and computationally
   efficient static games can be solved iteratively in the state space by
   the proposed PDE-based technique. In addition, we describe how this
   algorithm can be easily generalized to games with multiple evaders.
   Applications to target tracking and an extension to a feedback control
   game are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{The research team recognized the value of network-level falling weight
   deflectometer (FWD) testing to evaluate the structural condition trends
   of flexible pavements. However, practical limitations due to the cost of
   testing, traffic control and safety concerns, and the ability to test a
   large network may discourage some agencies from conducting the
   network-level FWD testing. For this reason, the surrogate measure of the
   structural condition index (SCI) is suggested for use. The main purpose
   of the research presented in this paper is to investigate data-mining
   strategies and to develop a prediction method of the structural
   condition trends for network-level applications, which do not require
   FWD testing. The research team first evaluated the existing and
   historical pavement condition, distress, ride, traffic, and other data
   attributes in the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Pavement
   Maintenance Information System (PMIS); applied data-mining strategies to
   the data; discovered useful patterns and knowledge for SCI value
   prediction; and finally provided a reasonable measure of pavement
   structural condition which is correlated to the SCI. To evaluate the
   performance of the developed prediction approach, a case study was
   conducted using the SCI data calculated from the FWD data collected on
   flexible pavements over a 5-year period (2005-2009) from 354 PMIS
   sections representing 37 pavement sections on the Texas highway system.
   The preliminary study results showed that the proposed approach can be
   used as a supportive pavement structural index in the event when FWD
   deflection data is not available and help pavement managers identify the
   timing and appropriate treatment level of preventive maintenance
   activities.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING}},

Volume = {{36}},

Pages = {{A522-A542}},
Abstract = {{We describe a nonoverlapping domain decomposition algorithm for
   nonlinear porous media flows discretized with the multiscale mortar
   mixed finite element method. There are two main ideas: (1) linearize the
   global system in both subdomain and interface variables simultaneously
   to yield a single Newton iteration; and (2) algebraically eliminate
   subdomain velocities (and optionally, subdomain pressures) to solve
   linear systems for the 1st (or the 2nd) Schur complements. Solving the
   1st Schur complement system gives the multiscale solution without the
   need to solve an interface iteration. Solving the 2nd Schur complement
   system gives a linear interface problem for a nonlinear model. The
   methods are less complex than a previously developed nonlinear mortar
   algorithm, which requires two nested Newton iterations and a forward
   difference approximation. Furthermore, efficient linear preconditioners
   can be applied to speed up the iteration. The methods are implemented in
   parallel, and a numerical study is performed to compare convergence
   behavior and parallel efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{In vitro differentiation of mouse and human stem cells into early T
   cells has been successfully demonstrated using artificial Notch
   signaling systems. However, generation of mature, antigen-specific,
   functional T cells, directly from human stem cells has remained elusive,
   except when using stromal coculture of stem cells retrovirally
   transfected with antigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs). Here we show
   that human umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived CD34+CD38-/low
   hematopoietic stem cells can be successfully differentiated into
   functional, antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells without direct
   stromal coculture or retroviral TCR transfection. Surface-immobilized
   Notch ligands (DLL1) and stromal cell conditioned medium successfully
   induced the development of CD1a+CD7+ and CD4+CD8+ early T cells. These
   cells, upon continued culture with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or influenza-A
   virus M1 (GIL) epitope-loaded human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A{*}0201
   tetramers, resulted in the generation of a polyclonal population of
   CMV-specific or GIL-specific CD8+ T cells, respectively. Upon further
   activation with antigen-loaded target cells, these antigen-specific,
   stem cell-derived T cells exhibited cytolytic functionality,
   specifically CD107a surface mobilization, interferon gamma (IFNg)
   production, and Granzyme B secretion. Such scalable, in vitro generation
   of functional, antigen-specific T cells from human stem cells could
   eventually provide a readily available cell source for adoptive transfer
   immunotherapies and also allow better understanding of human T cell
   development. Stem Cells2014;32:93-104}},

Title = {{Identification of Crucial Parameters in a Mathematical Multiscale Model
   of Glioblastoma Growth}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Glioblastomas are highly malignant brain tumours. Mathematical models
   and their analysis provide a tool to support the understanding of the
   development of these tumours as well as the design of more effective
   treatment strategies. We have previously developed a multiscale model of
   glioblastoma progression that covers processes on the cellular and
   molecular scale. Here, we present a novel nutrient-dependent multiscale
   sensitivity analysis of this model that helps to identify those reaction
   parameters of the molecular interaction network that influence the
   tumour progression on the cellular scale the most. In particular, those
   parameters are identified that essentially determine tumour expansion
   and could be therefore used as potential therapy targets. As indicators
   for the success of a potential therapy target, a deceleration of the
   tumour expansion and a reduction of the tumour volume are employed. From
   the results, it can be concluded that no single parameter variation
   results in a less aggressive tumour. However, it can be shown that a few
   combined perturbations of two systematically selected parameters cause a
   slow-down of the tumour expansion velocity accompanied with a decrease
   of the tumour volume. Those parameters are primarily linked to the
   reactions that involve the microRNA-451 and the thereof regulated
   protein MO25.}},

Title = {{High-Resolution In Vivo Imaging of Regimes of Laser Damage to the
   Primate Retina}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Purpose. To investigate fundamental mechanisms of regimes of laser
   induced damage to the retina and the morphological changes associated
   with the damage response. Methods. Varying grades of photothermal,
   photochemical, and photomechanical retinal laser damage were produced in
   eyes of eight cynomolgus monkeys. An adaptive optics confocal scanning
   laser ophthalmoscope and spectral domain optical coherence tomographer
   were combined to simultaneously collect complementary in vivo images of
   retinal laser damage during and following exposure. Baseline color
   fundus photography was performed to complement high-resolution imaging.
   Monkeys were perfused with 10\% buffered formalin and eyes were
   enucleated for histological analysis. Results. Laser energies for
   visible retinal damage in this study were consistent with previously
   reported damage thresholds. Lesions were identified in OCT images that
   were not visible in direct ophthalmoscopic examination or fundus photos.
   Unique diagnostic characteristics, specific to each damage regime, were
   identified and associated with shape and localization of lesions to
   specific retinal layers. Previously undocumented retinal healing
   response to blue continuous wave laser exposure was recorded through a
   novel experimentalmethodology. Conclusion. This study revealed increased
   sensitivity of lesion detection and improved specificity to the laser of
   origin utilizing high-resolution imaging when compared to traditional
   ophthalmic imaging techniques in the retina.}},

Abstract = {{The reversible charging of a lead chalcogenide, PbTe, was studied for
   use as the anode material in a Li-ion cell and compared to PbO. A
   similar series of Li-Pb alloys were formed but with Li2Te present
   instead of Li2O. In the presence of Li2Te, rapid Li-Pb alloying and
   dealloying were observed in the potential range of 0.01-0.7 V. In the
   potential range of 0.8-2.5 V, Li2Te formed and decomposed reversibly.
   Electrodes were cycled stably for 100 cycles at a C/5 rate in both
   potential domains. The electrodes were also cycled stably at rates up to
   10C. The presence of Li2Te reduced the overpotential required at higher
   charge and discharge rates by acting as a superionic conductor to
   improve lithium ion diffusion. These results recommend this material for
   potential use in low-power applications such as cell phones.}},

Abstract = {{For understanding the mechanisms of low level laser/light therapy
   (LLLT), accurate knowledge of light interaction with tissue is
   necessary. In this paper, we present a three dimensional, multi-layer
   Monte Carlo simulation tool for studying light penetration and
   absorption in human skin. The skin is modeled as a three-layer
   participating medium, namely epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous, where
   its geometrical and optical properties are obtained from the literature.
   Both refraction and reflection are taken into account at the boundaries
   according to Snell's law and Fresnel relations. A forward Monte Carlo
   method was implemented and validated for accurately simulating light
   penetration and absorption in absorbing and anisotropically scattering
   media. Local profiles of light penetration and volumetric absorption
   densities were simulated for uniform as well as Gaussian profile beams
   with different spreads at 155 mW average power over the spectral range
   from 1000 nm to 1900 nm. The results show the effects of beam profiles
   and wavelength on the local fluence within each skin layer.
   Particularly, the results identify different wavelength bands for
   targeted deposition of power in different skin layers. Finally, we show
   that light penetration scales well with the transport optical thickness
   of skin. We expect that this tool along with the results presented will
   aid researchers resolve issues related to dose and targeted delivery of
   energy in tissues for LLLT.}},

Abstract = {{We characterize the relaxation rates of deformations created by focused
   air puffs with the use of phasestabilized swept source optical coherence
   elastography ( PhS-SSOCE) in tissue-mimicking gelatin phantoms of

   results indicate that gelatin of varying concentrations and corneas from
   different aged mice have different relaxation rates. In addition, the
   results show that phantoms with higher concentration gelatin and corneas
   of older mice have higher relaxation rates, which can be attributed to
   stiffer material. Because this method is non-contact, noninvasive, and
   utilizes a minimal force which induces a deformation on the scale of mu
   m, this method can be used to study the biomechanical properties of
   sensitive tissues, such as the cornea.}},

   camera information, without training on human-rated judgments, and
   without dependency on salient objects such as lane markings or traffic
   signs. The proposed fog density predictor only makes use of measurable
   deviations from statistical regularities observed in natural foggy and
   fog-free images. A fog aware collection of statistical features is
   derived from a corpus of foggy and fog-free images by using a space
   domain NSS model and observed characteristics of foggy images such as
   low contrast, faint color, and shifted intensity. The proposed model not
   only predicts perceptual fog density for the entire image but also
   provides a local fog density index for each patch. The predicted fog
   density of the model correlates well with the measured visibility in a
   foggy scene as measured by judgments taken in a human subjective study
   on a large foggy image database. As one application, the proposed model
   accurately evaluates the performance of defog algorithms designed to
   enhance the visibility of foggy images.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The authors aim to propose a novel plane extraction algorithm
   for geometric 3D indoor mapping with range scan data.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed method utilizes a
   divide-and-conquer step to efficiently handle huge amounts of point
   clouds not in a whole group, but in forms of separate sub-groups with
   similar plane parameters. This method adopts robust principal component
   analysis to enhance estimation accuracy.
   Findings - Experimental results verify that the method not only shows
   enhanced performance in the plane extraction, but also broadens the
   domain of interest of the plane registration to an information-poor
   environment (such as simple indoor corridors), while the previous method
   only adequately works in an information-rich environment (such as a
   space with many features).
   Originality/value - The proposed algorithm has three advantages over the
   current state-of-the-art method in that it is fast, utilizes more inlier
   sensor data that does not become contaminated by severe sensor noise and
   extracts more accurate plane parameters.}},

Title = {{Tunable Plasmonic and Hyperbolic Metamaterials Based on Enhanced
   Nonlinear Response}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{We present here tunable and reconfigurable designs of linear and
   nonlinear plasmonic and hyperbolic metamaterials. Rich scattering
   features of multilayered composite nanoparticles are demonstrated, which
   include complex and exotic scattering signatures combining multiple
   dipolar Fano resonances and electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT)
   features. These dipole-dipole multi-Fano scattering responses can be
   further tuned through altering the plasmonic properties of the
   concentric layers or the permittivity of the core, for instance, by the
   presence of nonlinearities. Strong third-order nonlinear effects, such
   as optical bistability, may also be induced in the scattering response
   of nonlinear nanoparticles due to the highly enhanced and confined
   fields inside their core. Nonlinear hyperbolic metamaterial designs are
   also explored, which can realize tunable positive-to-negative refraction
   at the same frequency, as a function of the input intensity. Negative
   Goos-Hanchen shift is demonstrated based only on the hyperbolic
   dispersion properties of these layered metamaterials without the usual
   need of negative index metamaterials. The Goos-Hanchen shift may be
   tuned from positive-to-negative values, when the structure is
   illuminated with different frequencies. A plethora of applications are
   envisioned based on the proposed tunable metamaterials, such as
   ultrafast reconfigurable imaging devices, tunable sensors, novel nanotag
   designs, and efficient all-optical switches and memories.}},

Abstract = {{The progressive loss of accommodation of the eye, called presbyopia,
   affects people with age and can result in a complete loss of
   accommodation by about age 55 years. It is generally accepted that
   presbyopia is due to an increase in stiffness of the lens. With
   increasing age, the stiffness of the crystalline lens nucleus increases
   faster than that of the cortex. During accommodation, the deformation of
   different parts of the crystalline lens is different and likely changes
   with age. However, a direct observation of crystalline lens deformation
   and strain distribution is difficult because although imaging methods
   such as OCT or Scheimpflug imaging can distinguish cortex and nucleus,
   they cannot determine their regional deformation. Here, patterns of
   laser-induced microbubbles were created in gelatin phantoms and
   different parts of excised animal crystalline lenses and their
   displacements in response to external deformation were tracked by
   ultrasound imaging. In the animal lenses, the deformation of the lens
   cortex was greater than that of nucleus and this regional difference is
   greater for a 27-month-old bovine lens than for a 6-month-old porcine
   lens. This approach enables visualization of localized, regional
   deformation of crystalline lenses and, if applied to lenses from animal
   species that undergo accommodation, may help to understand the
   mechanisms of accommodation and presbyopia, improve diagnostics, and,
   potentially, aid in the development of new methods of lens modifying
   presbyopia treatments.}},

Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{791-824}},
Abstract = {{A theory of iterated averaging is developed for a class of highly
   oscillatory ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with three well
   separated time scales. The solutions of these equations are assumed to
   be (almost) periodic in the fastest time scales. It is proved that the
   dynamics on the slowest time scale can be approximated by an effective
   ODE obtained by averaging out oscillations. In particular, the effective
   dynamics of the considered class of ODEs is always deterministic and
   does not show any stochastic effects. This is in contrast to systems in
   which the dynamics on the fastest time scale is mixing. The systems are
   studied from three perspectives: first, using the tools of averaging
   theory; second, by formal asymptotic expansions; and third, by averaging
   with respect to fast oscillations using nested convolutions with
   averaging kernels. The latter motivates a hierarchical numerical
   algorithm consisting of nested integrators.}},

Abstract = {{Polarization multiplexed vibrational sum frequency generation (PM-VSFG)
   spectroscopy has been used to monitor the interfacial structure of
   polymer transistor interfaces in situ during thermal annealing
   treatments. The evolution of the field-effect carrier mobility is
   tracked simultaneously with the molecular orientation and ordering of
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) macromolecules on two different surface
   types. It is shown that fluorocarbon functionalized silica imparts very
   different molecular arrangements that avoid kinetic trapping during
   solution casting. In contrast, bare silica surfaces produce kinetically
   trapped polymer configurations that can be observed by PM-VSFG to
   reorient with thermal annealing. The interfacial results are compared to
   bulk structural changes in P3HT thin films as characterized by
   differential scanning calorimetry and linear spectroscopies. The
   electrical performances of these films are more closely correlated with
   interfacial parameters than the bulk properties of the polymer. In
   contrast with the bulk measurements, the PM-VSFG studies show that
   molecules at the organic/dielectric interface are actually less ordered
   after thermal annealing processes that render them with lower carrier
   mobilities.}},

Abstract = {{We present a theoretical study of degradation mechanisms for
   photoinduced oxidation in organic polymers in the condensed phase, using
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an example. Applying density functional
   theory with a hybrid density functional and periodic boundary conditions
   that account for steric effects and permit the modeling of interchain
   chemical reactions, we investigate reaction pathways that may lead to
   the oxidation of the thiophene backbone as a critical step toward
   disrupting the polymer conjugation. We calculate energy barriers for
   reactions of the P3HT backbone with oxidizing agents including the
   hydroxyl radical (OH center dot), hydroperoxide (ROOH), and the peroxyl
   radical (ROO center dot), following a UV-driven radical reaction
   starting at the alpha-carbon of the alkyl side chain as suggested by
   infrared (IR) and X-ray photoemission (XPS) spectrosocopy studies. The
   results strongly suggest that an attack of OH center dot on sulfur in
   P3HT is unlikely to be thermodynamically favored. On the other hand, an
   attack of a peroxyl radical on the side chain on the P3HT backbone may
   provide low barrier reaction pathways to photodegradation of P3HT and
   other polymers with side chains. The condensed phase setting is found to
   qualitatively affect predictions of degradation processes.}},

Abstract = {{A new Lagrangian particle-based method is presented to simulate reactive
   transport in natural porous media. This technique is based on Modified
   Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MMPS) and takes as input high-resolution
   voxel images of natural porous media. The flow field in the medium is
   computed by solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
   Moreover, a multicomponent ion transport model is coupled with a
   homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions module to handle pore-space
   alteration (i.e., pore-wall dissolution). The model is first
   successfully validated against the experimental data available in the
   literature. Subsequently, X-ray microtomographic images of two naturally
   occurring porous media are used to investigate the impact of reaction
   kinetics and pore-space topology on pore-space alteration induced by
   brine acidification in subsurface conditions. We observed that at the
   normal rates of reactions no significant change in porosity and
   permeability takes place in the short term. Whereas, higher reaction
   rates caused major changes in the macroscopic properties (e.g., porosity
   and permeability) of the rocks. We also show that these changes are
   strongly affected by the rocks' pore-scale topologies.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{60-74}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Transfer of low carbon technologies to developing countries has been
   recognized as important in global efforts to limit climate change. Yet
   the mechanics of international technology transfer, especially around
   intellectual property rights, have remained a controversial issue in
   international negotiations. Using a new dataset on international
   partnerships in China and India in three key low carbon technologies
   solar photovoltaics, electric vehicles, and coal gasification/integrated
   gasification combined cycle and complementary expert interviews we study
   the dynamics of the transfer of intellectual property and the underlying
   drivers that guide the development of business strategies and
   partnerships in the context of transitioning intellectual property
   regimes in emerging markets. We find that weak intellectual property
   regimes are indeed a hindrance to the diffusion of certain classes of
   low carbon technologies: (i) for cutting-edge technologies, (ii) for
   fully-embodied (explicitly codified) technologies, and (iii) for small
   firms. However, we also find that intellectual property issues do not
   represent a barrier to the diffusion of the relatively mature and low to
   medium cost low carbon technologies that are materially (at scale) most
   important for carbon dioxide emissions reduction in the short to medium
   term. Competitive technology supply, shifting market dynamics, and
   increasingly vigorous domestic innovation coupled with mechanisms and
   opportunities to structure credible intellectual property deals allow
   for the diffusion of key low carbon technologies to occur within the
   context of existing business, political, and institutional structures.

Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Actuators are often assumed to be perfectly aligned when designing for a
   stable closed-loop system. In practice, small actuator misalignments can
   cause the system to perform poorly, or worse, become unstable.
   Consequently, adaptive observers can be introduced that build online
   estimates for the unknown misalignments and recover closed-loop
   stability. In this paper, the problem where the control axes are
   independently misaligned in three dimensions is considered. A study of
   the problem indicates a fundamental geometric difference between
   in-plane and out-of-plane misalignments. Accordingly, special attention
   is paid to the case where two axes are independently misaligned. New
   nonlinear adaptive observers are introduced for both the in-plane and
   out-of-plane problems that guarantee that the misalignment axis
   estimates remain unit vectors. Furthermore, a Lyapunov-like stability
   analysis is performed to show convergence of the misalignment estimates
   to their true values for a wide range of misalignment angles. In
   addition, a novel control system is developed for a representative
   dynamic system containing the aforementioned actuator misalignments that
   ensures perfect asymptotic tracking of prescribed reference
   trajectories. Also, an axis decoupling method is described that helps
   alleviate some of the inherent issues in the estimation problem.
   Detailed proofs and numerical simulations are presented to help
   illustrate the technical aspects of the work.}},

Abstract = {{Coulomb forces associated with charged close-flying satellites can
   efficiently enable static formation equilibria, in which separation
   distances remain constant. However, limited Coulomb force
   controllability presents many challenges in maintaining and maneuvering
   these inherently unstable formations. This paper studies three-craft
   collinear equilibria, admitted in the presence of a central body gravity
   field. Necessary existence conditions for this class of Coulomb
   formation are given in previous research, and this paper extends these
   to be sufficient, while using a more accurate Coulomb force model.
   Stability properties of the resulting configuration cases are analyzed
   for the first time, and it is shown that each can exhibit marginal
   stability normal to the orbit plane. Also, it is demonstrated that
   in-plane perturbations can be asymptotically stabilized, using only
   craft charging, for the radially aligned configurations. A charge
   feedback law is derived for this case, and numerical results are
   provided. These stability and controllability properties correlate with
   those, previously known, for two- and three-craft (in the absence of
   gravity) formations. Lastly, invariant manifolds are generated to
   illustrate dynamic properties of these systems, and the possibility of
   exploiting the manifold flows to target minimum fuel reconfigurations
   (shape changes), is discussed.}},

   deposition (PLD) methods. The electrochemical properties of these LSCO
   cathodes for oxygen reduction reaction have been determined by
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at different interlayer
   thicknesses, temperatures, and oxygen partial pressures. The oxygen
   reduction reaction on the LSCO electrode with and without the interlayer
   has been found to be mainly limited by the surface exchange process. By
   fitting the power density data by Butler-Volmer equation, it
   demonstrates that as the thickness of the PLD interlayer increases, the
   surface exchange resistance of the cathode decreases due to a
   significant increase in the number of reaction sites obtained by

Title = {{Implementation of a robust virtual metrology for plasma etching through

Abstract = {{Virtual metrology (VM) is attracting much interest from semiconductor
   manufacturers because of its potential advantages for quality control.
   Plasma etching equipment with state-of-the-art plasma sensors are
   attractive for implementing VM. However, the plasma sensors requiring
   physical understanding make it difficult to select input parameters for
   VM. In addition, those sensors with high sensitivity frequently cause
   several issues in terms of VM performance. This paper will address
   plasma sensor issues in implementing a robust VM, where self-excited
   electron resonance spectroscopy, optical emission spectroscopy, and
   VI-probe are utilized for critical dimension prediction in a plasma
   etching process. An optimum sensor selection technique which can give
   insight into effectiveness of plasma sensors is introduced. In this
   technique, a numerical criterion, integrated squared response, is
   proposed for effective selection of important sensors for particular
   manipulated variables. Sensor data shift across equipment preventive
   maintenance (PM) and its impact on VM performance are also addressed,
   where a recursive data centering technique is introduced to handle
   PM-to-PM sensor data drift in a cost-effective way. The application of
   the technique introduced in this paper is shown to be effective in
   dynamic random access memory manufacturing. Hopefully, these results
   will encourage further implementation of robust virtual metrology in
   plasma etching for semiconductor manufacturing. (C) 2014 American Vacuum

Title = {{A spatial autoregressive multinomial probit model for anticipating

Journal = {{ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{251-278}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper develops an estimation strategy for and then applies a
   spatial autoregressive multinomial probit model to account for both
   spatial clustering and cross-alternative correlation. Estimation is
   achieved using Bayesian techniques with Gibbs and the generalized direct
   sampling (GDS). The model is applied to analyze land development
   decisions for undeveloped parcels over a 6-year period in Austin, Texas.
   Results suggest that GDS is a useful method for uncovering parameters
   whose draws may otherwise fail to converge using standard
   Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. Estimation results suggest that
   residential and commercial/civic development tends to favor more
   regularly shaped and smaller parcels, which may be related to parcel
   conversion costs and aesthetics. Longer distances to Austin's central
   business district increase the likelihood of residential development,
   while reducing that of commercial/civic and office/industrial uses.
   Everything else constant, distances to a parcel's nearest minor, and
   major arterial roads are estimated to increase development likelihood of
   commercial/civic and office/industry uses, perhaps because such
   development is more common in less densely developed locations (as
   proxied by fewer arterials). As expected, added soil slope is estimated
   to be negatively associated with residential development, but positively
   associated with commercial/civic and office/industry uses (perhaps due
   to some steeper terrains offering view benefits). Estimates of the
   cross-alternative correlations suggest that a parcel's residential use
   ``utility{''} or attractiveness tends to be negatively correlated with
   that of commercial/civic, but positively associated with that of
   office/industrial uses, while the latter two land uses exhibit some
   negative correlation. Using an inverse-distance weight matrix for each
   parcel's closest 50 neighbors, the spatial autocorrelation coefficient
   is estimated to be 0.706, indicating a marked spatial clustering pattern
   for land development in the selected region.}},

Abstract = {{The study of post-transcriptional RNA modifications has long been
   focused on the roles these chemical modifications play in maintaining
   ribosomal function. The field of ribosomal RNA modification has reached
   a milestone in recent years with the confirmation of the final unknown
   ribosomal RNA methyltransferase in Escherichia coli in 2012.
   Furthermore, the last 10 years have brought numerous discoveries in
   non-coding RNAs and the roles that post-transcriptional modification
   play in their functions. These observations indicate the need for a
   revitalization of this field of research to understand the role
   modifications play in maintaining cellular health in a dynamic
   environment. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies,
   the time is ripe for leaps and bounds forward. This review discusses
   ribosomal RNA methyltransferases and their role in responding to
   external stress in Escherichia coli, with a specific focus on knockout

Journal = {{GEOTECHNIQUE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{108-117}},
Abstract = {{The paper examines the effect of small percentages of bentonite on pore
   pressure generation in loose sands, from small strains all the way to
   liquefaction. It relies on resonant column, static triaxial and cyclic
   triaxial tests conducted on specimens prepared by dry-mixing Ottawa sand
   and bentonite, at a skeleton relative density of 35\% +/- 5\%. Two main
   variables are investigated: the percentage of bentonite (3\% and 5\% by
   dry mass of the sand), and the duration of the ageing period preceding
   shear (1 to 10 days). The presence of bentonite increases the shear
   strain needed to initiate the generation of excess pore pressures in
   resonant column tests; in cyclic tests it reduces the mean pore pressure
   generated per loading cycle and allows the specimen to sustain an
   increased loss of effective stress before liquefaction initiates, both
   effects contributing to an increased resistance to liquefaction. These
   effects are further enhanced with prolonged pre-shear ageing.
   Additionally, under static conditions, the behaviour of the sand is
   found to become increasingly stable as the ageing duration is extended.
   Given the role played by the ageing period, the effects observed cannot
   be simply ascribed to the increased bulk density of the specimens with
   bentonite. Instead, they are attributed to the pore fluid formed in
   presence of bentonite: a concentrated clay gel with solid-like
   properties. This pore fluid increases the sand's threshold shear strain,
   which is shown to have a strong correlation with the resistance to
   liquefaction.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{6407-6421}},
Abstract = {{Protein switches are made of highly similar sequences that fold to
   dramatically different structures. A structural switching system with 31
   sequence variants for alpha and alpha+beta folds has been illustrated
   experimentally by He et al., Structure, 2012, 20, 283 and is
   investigated computationally in the present study. Methods to assign a
   sequence to one of the two folds are reported and analyzed. A fast and
   accurate protocol to identify the correct fold of the 31 sequences is
   based on enriching modeled structures using short molecular dynamics
   (MD) trajectories and scoring these structures with coarse-grained
   energy functions. We examine five coarse-grained energy functions and
   illustrate that the Hinds-Levitt potential works the best for this task.
   We show that enrichment by MD significantly enhances prediction
   accuracy. Finally, we find that melting temperature correlates well with
   the energy difference between the two folds (correlation coefficient
   similar to-0.7). The correlation reduces dramatically (similar to 0.4)
   if the absolute energy of the correct fold is considered. Moreover,
   prediction of melting temperature is sensitive to the structural
   templates. We emphasize in our analyses the use of native structures as
   templates since these folds are more readily available from structural
   biology experiments.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{2693-2702}},
Abstract = {{Herein we report on the self-assembly of a family of Fmoc-depsipeptides
   into nanofibers and hydrogels. We show that fiber formation occurs in
   depsipeptide structures in which the fluorenyl group is closely
   associated and that side-chain charge and sequence affect the extent of
   self-assembly and subsequent gelation. Using fluorescence emission
   spectroscopy and circular dichroism, we show that self-assembly can be
   monitored and is observed in these slow-gelling systems prior to
   hydrogel formation. We also demonstrate that the ionic strength of
   salt-containing solutions affects the time at which self-assembly
   results in gelation of the bulk solution. From transmission electron
   microscopy, we report that morphological changes progress over time and
   are observed as micelles transitioning to fibers prior to the onset of
   gelation. Gelled depsipeptides degraded at a slower rate than non-gelled
   samples in the presence of salt, while hydrolysis in water of both gels
   and solution samples was minimal even after 14 days. Our work shows that
   while incorporating ester functionality within a peptide backbone
   reduces the number of hydrogen bonding sites available for forming and
   stabilizing supramolecular assemblies, the substitution does not

Abstract = {{The nonlinear mechanical response of monolayer graphene on polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET) is characterised using in-situ Raman spectroscopy
   and atomic force microscopy. While interfacial stress transfer leads to
   tension in graphene as the PET substrate is stretched, retraction of the
   substrate during unloading imposes compression in the graphene. Two
   interfacial failure mechanisms, shear sliding under tension and buckling
   under compression, are identified. Using a nonlinear shear-lag model,
   the interfacial shear strength is found to range between 0.46 and 0.69
   MPa. The critical strain for onset of interfacial sliding is approximate
   to 0.3\%, while the maximum strain that can be transferred to graphene
   ranges from 1.2\% to 1.6\% depending on the interfacial shear strength
   and graphene size. Beyond a critical compressive strain of around
   -0.7\%, buckling ridges are observed after unloading. The results from
   this work provide valuable insight and design guidelines for a broad
   spectrum of applications of graphene and other 2D nanomaterials, such as
   flexible and stretchable electronics, strain sensing, and
   nanocomposites.}},

   structures; the oxygen vacancies are more concentrated in the planar
   oxygen sites (O3 and O5) of corner-sharing tetrahedral units of the M3O9
   (M = Si/Ge) complexes. From thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the
   K-substituted samples lose weight above 100 degrees C and are
   hygroscopic at room temperature; the oxygen vacancies are concentrated
   at the in-plane O3 and O5 sites and those in the terminal O2 or O4 are
   responsible for a 2D oxide-ion conductivity between the M3O9 complexes.
   The Na-substituted samples lose little weight by 800 degrees C and are
   not hygroscopic; the oxygen vacancies are located at all oxygen atom
   positions, being more pronounced at the in-plane O3 and O5; those in the
   terminal oxygen sites give an excellent oxide-ion conductivity. Moreover
   the high temperature NPD data for Sr0.6Na0.4SiO2.8 disclose that the

Journal = {{ACM JOURNAL ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{With continuously shrinking technology, reliability issues such as
   Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) has resulted in
   considerable degradation of device performance, and eventually the short
   mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) of the whole multicore system. This article
   proposes a new workload balancing scheme based on device-level
   fractional NBTI model to balance the workload among active cores while
   relaxing stressed ones. Starting with NBTI-induced threshold voltage
   degradation, we define a concept of Capacity Rate (CR) as an indication
   of one core's ability to accept workload. Capacity rate captures core's
   performance variability in terms of delay and power metrics under the
   impact of NBTI aging. The proposed workload balancing framework employs
   the capacity rates as workload constraints, applies a Dynamic Zoning
   (DZ) algorithm to group cores into zones to process task flows, and then
   uses Dynamic Task Scheduling (DTS) to allocate tasks in each zone with
   balanced workload and minimum communication cost. Experimental results
   on a 64-core system show that by allowing a small part of the cores to
   relax over a short time period, the proposed methodology improves
   multicore system yield (percentage of core failures) by 20\%, while
   extending MTTF by 30\% with insignificant degradation in performance
   (less than 3\%).}},

Title = {{Degradation in the degree of polarization in human retinal nerve fiber
   layer}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Using a fiber-based swept-source (SS) polarization-sensitive optical
   coherence tomography (PS-OCT) system, we investigate the degree of
   polarization (DOP) of light backscattered from the retinal nerve fiber
   layer (RNFL) in normal human subjects. Algorithms for processing data
   were developed to analyze the deviation in phase retardation and
   intensity of backscattered light in directions parallel and
   perpendicular to the nerve fiber axis (fast and slow axes of RNFL).
   Considering superior, inferior, and nasal quadrants, we observe the
   strongest degradation in the DOP with increasing RNFL depth in the
   temporal quadrant. Retinal ganglion cell axons in normal human subjects
   are known to have the smallest diameter in the temporal quadrant, and
   the greater degradation observed in the DOP suggests that higher
   polarimetric noise may be associated with neural structure in the
   temporal RNFL. The association between depth degradation in the DOP and
   RNFL structural properties may broaden the utility of PS-OCT as a
   functional imaging technique. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a

Abstract = {{This article presents a multispectral image analysis approach for
   probing the spectral backscattered irradiance from algal cultures. It
   was demonstrated how this spectral information can be used to measure
   algal biomass concentration, detect invasive species, and monitor
   culture health in real time. To accomplish this, a conventional RGB
   camera was used as a three band photodetector for imaging cultures of
   the green alga Chlorella sp. and the cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis.
   A novel floating reference platform was placed in the culture, which
   enhanced the sensitivity of image color intensity to biomass
   concentration. Correlations were generated between the RGB color vector
   of culture images and the biomass concentrations for monocultures of
   each strain. These correlations predicted the biomass concentrations of
   independently prepared cultures with average errors of 22 and 14\%,
   respectively. Moreover, the difference in spectral signatures between
   the two strains was exploited to detect the invasion of Chlorella sp.
   cultures by A. variabilis. Invasion was successfully detected for A.
   variabilis to Chlorella sp. mass ratios as small as 0.08. Finally, a
   method was presented for using multispectral imaging to detect thermal
   stress in A. variabilis. These methods can be extended to field
   applications to provide delay free process control feedback for
   efficient operation of large scale algae cultivation systems. (c) 2013

   volumetrically illuminated channels}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This study estimates the spatial resolution and accuracy of dual-tracer
   fluorescence thermometry (DFT) for measuring water temperature fields in
   channels where the entire channel is illuminated as is typical in
   microfluidics. Temperature fields are measured in heated laminar
   Poiseuille flow through a 1 mm 2 channel. The working fluid, an aqueous
   solution of the temperature-sensitive fluorophores fluorescein (Fl) and
   sulforhodamine B (SrB), is volumetrically illuminated over the entire
   channel cross-section at a wavelength of 514 nm, and the temperature of
   the solution is estimated from images of the longer-wavelength
   fluorescence from Fl and SrB. These temperature data are compared with
   numerical simulations of the same flow where the heat transferred to the
   water is estimated from independent measurements of wall surface
   temperature to determine the accuracy and the spatial resolution of the
   DFT results. The results suggest that temperature measurements in the
   volumetrically illuminated channel are significantly corrupted by the
   fluorescence emissions from beyond the focal plane. A model based on the
   point spread function for an aberration-free lens is employed to
   estimate the effect of the background ``noise,'' i.e., the signal from
   beyond the object plane, on the accuracy of these DFT measurements. The
   results show that this background is about 30 times the signal from the
   focal plane. Further experiments where the channel is illuminated by a
   light sheet over about 40 \% of the channel cross-section give estimates
   of the water temperature field that are on average within about 0.3
   degrees C of the numerical predictions at an in-plane spatial resolution
   of 50 mu m. The model is used to estimate the signal-to-background ratio
   for this case, as well as for a variety of commercially available
   microscope objectives.}},

Abstract = {{We study the effect of random injection rate fluctuations on pressure
   and geomechanical stresses during geological sequestration of carbon
   dioxide (CO2). We first derive analytical solutions for the mean and
   variance of the pressure of CO2 in the reservoir. Next, we use the Monte
   Carlo simulation (MCS) method to obtain the mean and variance of
   geomechanical deformation stresses and the maximum sustainable injection
   pressure based on shear-slip failure analysis. The MCS method is
   validated using the analytical solutions for mean and variance of the
   pressure. We demonstrate that for any Gaussian distribution of injection
   rate Q with given mean (Q) over bar and standard deviation epsilon(Q),
   the coefficients of variation of the CO2 pressure (epsilon(p) =
   epsilon(p)/(p) over bar), deformation (epsilon(u) = epsilon(u)/(u) over
   bar), and stresses (epsilon(sigma) = epsilon(sigma)/(sigma) over bar)
   increase linearly with the coefficient of variation of the injection
   rate (epsilon(Q) = epsilon(Q)/(Q) over bar). We calculate coefficients
   of variation and show that the fluctuations have the most pronounced
   effect on the geomechanical stresses and, therefore, on the potential
   fracturing of the aquifer and caprock layers.
   We demonstrate that the maximum sustainable injection pressure can be
   determined based on shear-slip analysis with a given expected risk due
   to the injection rate fluctuations. We show that the injection rate
   fluctuations decrease the maximum sustainable injection pressure. (C)

Abstract = {{Time-lapse surface seismic surveys have been used for CO2 sequestration
   monitoring at Cranfield, Mississippi. The 3D time-lapse seismic data
   were recorded both before (2007) and after (2010) CO2 injection. The
   injection interval is the lower Tuscaloosa sandstone formation, which
   appears as a thin layer and displays weak signature due to CO2 injection
   in the post-stack seismic amplitudes. Previous studies have reported
   inversion of time-lapse acoustic impedances for CO2 plume mapping.
   However, the acoustic impedances lack elastic information, which are
   more sensitive to the fluid variation. To address this, we applied a
   basis pursuit pre-stack inversion on time-lapse Amplitude Versus Angle
   (AVA) datasets to obtain elastic properties (V-p, V-s, density and
   V-p-V-s ratio). The inverted elastic properties show improved resolution
   and provide reasonable fits to the well-log data. The temporal changes
   of inverted elastic properties provide a basis for mapping the CO2 plume
   after three years' injection, demonstrating their effectiveness for a
   CO2 sequestration study. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Texas City refinery accident: Case study in breakdown of
   defense-in-depth and violation of the safety-diagnosability principle in
   design}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{121-133}},

Abstract = {{In 2005 an explosion rocked the BP Texas City refinery, killing 15
   people and injuring 180. The company incurred direct and indirect
   financial losses on the order of billions of dollars for victims'
   compensation as well as significant property damage and loss of
   production. The internal BP accident investigation and the Chemical
   Safety Board investigation identified a number of factors that
   contributed to the accident. In this work, we first examine the accident
   pathogens or lurking adverse conditions at the refinery prior to the
   accident. We then analyze the sequence of events that led to the
   explosion, and we highlight some of the provisions for the
   implementation of defense-in-depth and their failures. Next we identify
   a fundamental failure mechanism in this accident, namely the absence of
   observability or ability to diagnose hazardous states in the operation
   of the refinery, in particular within the raffinate splitter tower and
   the blowdown drum of the isomerization unit. We propose a general
   safety-diagnosability principle for supporting accident prevention,
   which requires that all safety-degrading events or states that
   defense-in-depth is meant to protect against be diagnosable, and that
   breaches of safety barriers be unambiguously monitored and reported. The
   safety-diagnosability principle supports the development of a
   ``living{''} or online quantitative risk assessment, which in turn can
   help re-order risk priorities in real time based on emerging hazards,
   and re-allocate defensive resources. We argue that the
   safety-diagnosability principle is an essential ingredient for improving
   operators' situation awareness. Violation of the safety-diagnosability
   principle translates into a shrinking of the time window available for
   operators to understand an unfolding hazardous situation and intervene
   to abate it. Compliance with this new safety principle provides one way
   to improve operators' sensemaking and situation awareness and decrease
   the conditional probability that an accident will occur following an
   adverse initiating event. We suggest that defense-in-depth be augmented
   with this principle, without which it can degenerate into an ineffective
   defense-blind safety strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Modeling chromatographic separation of produced gas in shale wells}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{110-122}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Field evidence exists showing temporal variation in produced gas
   composition in shale wells. Preferential gas flow and sorption of the
   species in shale formations cause compositional variations in the gas
   produced from shale. This process is similar to gas chromatographic (GC)
   separation, in which the size of gas molecules and their affinity for
   walls cause separation. As in gas chromatography, shale gas contains
   molecules of different gases (methane, ethane, propane, carbon dioxide,
   etc.). When reservoir pressure is greater than critical sorption
   pressure, sorption process is negligible and the separation process is
   mainly due to differences in gas molecule speeds in pores. The extremely
   small size of the pores in shale adds different flow physics, such as
   Knudsen diffusion and slip flow that intensifies separation of gas
   components. Understanding and modeling chromatographic separation (CS)
   in shale can improve our knowledge and help us produce more valuable gas
   from gas shale. We have developed a numerical model to study temporal
   variations of the composition of gas produced from shale gas wells. The
   model is a physical transport model of single-phase multicomponent gas
   flow in nanoporous media. The governing equations are implemented into a
   one-dimensional numerical model and solved using a fully implicit
   solution method. A sensitivity study of the effect of different
   parameters such as reservoir pressure, length of the system, tortuosity,
   and permeability on the CS process is performed. The model results
   confirm strong CS process in shale. In an early stage of production, the
   component with the highest Knudsen diffusivity and slip coefficient is
   produced with a higher mole fraction than its in-situ composition. At a
   later time, the same component comprises a smaller mole fraction than
   its in-situ composition in the gas production stream. Lower Darcy
   permeability, a longer system, and higher reservoir pressure intensify
   the CS process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Smart design of lithium-rich layered oxide cathode compositions with
   suppressed voltage decay}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3932-3939}},
Abstract = {{The lithium-rich layered oxide cathodes offer a high capacity of similar
   to 250 mA h g(-1), but their commercialization is prevented by the
   problem of voltage decay during cycling, originating from a phase
   transformation to a 3 V spinel-like phase. With an aim of understanding
   the factors that govern the voltage decay, the effect of the length of
   the plateau region during first charge and the octahedral-site
   stabilization energy of the transition metal (TM) ions has been
   investigated by designing various compositions of lithium-rich layered
   oxides. Charge-discharge profile and dQ/dV plot variations during
   cycling confirm that the length of the plateau region during first
   charge is the primary governing factor in the voltage decay process. The
   voltage decay is enhanced by a lengthened plateau region that increases
   the kinetics of the phase transformation to the spinel-like phase due to
   the (i) formation of Li-tet-V(TM)(Li)-Li-tet dumbbells (Li-tet refers to
   the lithium ion in a tetrahedral site and V(TM)(Li) refers to the
   lithium-ion vacancy in the TM layer) because of the increased
   lithium-ion extraction from the TM layer and (ii) TM migration to the
   lithium layer assisted by a higher oxygen vacancy concentration. Based
   on this understanding, a new series of compositions
   Li1.2-xMn0.54Ni0.13+2xCo0.13-xO2 have been designed to minimize the
   plateau region during first charge without sacrificing the energy
   density. The optimized composition Li1.15Mn0.54Ni0.23Co0.08O2 exhibits
   superior electrochemical performance with a marked decrease in voltage
   decay during cycling compared to the well-known composition
   Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2.}},

Abstract = {{During air-gap formation in interconnects, decomposition process of the

   For analysis of ensuing structural instability, a logistic kinetics
   model is introduced to describe the removal process of the sacrificial
   layer, and finite difference method (FDM) is applied to evaluate the
   deformation behavior of the cap layer. The instability of the cap layer
   depends on its span length and the degree of adhesion between the cap
   layer and sacrificial layer. During decomposition, strong adhesion
   causes the collapse of the cap layer, while the cap deformation remains
   small and stable with weak adhesion. For intermediate adhesion, a
   snap-back instability is predicted as the cap layer suddenly detaches
   from the sacrificial layer at a critical deflection. The critical
   adhesion energy is predicted as a function of the air gap width.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental studies by Poehlmann et al. {[}Phys. Plasmas 17(12), 123508
   (2010)] on a coaxial electrode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma
   accelerator have revealed two modes of operation. A deflagration or
   stationary mode is observed for lower power settings, while higher input
   power leads to a detonation or snowplow mode. A numerical modeling study
   of a coaxial plasma accelerator using the non-ideal MHD equations is
   presented. The effect of plasma conductivity on the axial distribution
   of radial current is studied and found to agree well with experiments.
   Lower conductivities lead to the formation of a high current density,
   stationary region close to the inlet/breech, which is a characteristic
   of the deflagration mode, while a propagating current sheet like feature
   is observed at higher conductivities, similar to the detonation mode.
   Results confirm that plasma resistivity, which determines magnetic field
   diffusion effects, is fundamentally responsible for the two modes. (C)

Abstract = {{This study investigates surface waves propagating across a partially
   closed surface-breaking crack in concrete. The experimental program
   includes three concrete specimens and three test phases. In the first
   and second test phases, effects of compression and bending on the

   in crack-free specimens. In the third phase, the surface wave parameters
   were measured on the specimens with a surface-breaking crack when a
   compressive load was applied to partially close the crack. Experimental
   results showed that both the wave transmission and velocity are
   sensitive to the compressive load when the crack is gradually closed.
   Variations of the surface wave parameters are presented with the
   compressive and tensile loads, and crack mouth opening displacement
   (CMOD). Findings in this study will provide useful information for
   studying stress wave propagation across a partially closed crack and for
   applying the surface wave based nondestructive testing methods to actual

   distributions, in the form of contour plots, are, in our

   that the concept of ``mesh locking{''}, which has dominated
   investigations of low-order elements, is not a relevant issue for
   higher-order NURBS elements for problems of large-deformation
   plasticity. However, standard higher-order NURBS elements of type Qk, of

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a recently completed experimental
   research program on the performance of simple beam end framing
   connections at elevated temperatures. Connections are critical elements
   in maintaining the integrity of a structure during a fire, but the
   strength and deformation capacity of connections in fire are not well

   framing connections is the single plate connection, which was the
   subject of this study.
   In this research investigation, a series of experiments were conducted
   on connection subassemblies at elevated temperatures to understand and
   characterize connection stiffness, strength, and deformation capacity,
   as well as failure modes. This paper first describes the testing
   facilities and procedures used for these experiments. The results of a
   series of tests are then described. The measured and observed
   performance of selected specimens is compared to the predictions from a
   finite element model, and the test results are also evaluated using
   simplified equations provided in the AISC Specification. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Palladium nanoparticles supported on carbon black (Pd/C) have been
   successfully synthesized in a dispersion of sodium hydroxide, ethylene
   glycol, and carbon black (NaOH/EG/C) at room temperature without any
   protection with an inert gas atmosphere. Carbon black and EG dehydrated
   by NaOH (0.02 M) synergistically reduce Na2PdCl4 to metallic Pd at room
   temperature with a conversion efficiency of >99\%. The capability of
   carbon black to provide the reducing function in the synthesis was
   verified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic data. When
   the NaOH concentration is <0.01 M, the reduction reaction is far from
   completion due to the very low degree of dehydration of EG. When the
   NaOH concentration is >0.05 M, the reduction reaction rate is slow owing
   to strong complexation between Pd2+ and OH and the oxidative etching of
   the formed Pd nanoparticles by air and OH . The synthesized Pd/C samples
   with Pd loadings of 20 and 40 wt\% have Pd particle sizes of,
   respectively, 3.35 +/- 0.73 nm and 3.86 +/- 0.74 nm, uniformly loaded
   onto the carbon black support. Compared to commercial Pt/C (40 wt\%)
   catalysts, the Pd/C (40 wt\%) catalyst synthesized here shows superior
   methanol tolerance and performance as a cathode catalyst in a direct

Journal = {{THERANOSTICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Recently, combined intravascular ultrasound and photoacoustic
   (IVUS/IVPA) imaging has been demonstrated as a novel imaging modality
   capable of visualizing both morphology (via IVUS) and cellular/molecular
   composition (via IVPA) of atherosclerotic plaques, using both endogenous
   tissue absorbers and exogenous contrast agents. Plasmonic gold
   nanoparticles were previously utilized as IVPA contrast agents which
   co-localize with atherosclerotic plaques, particularly phagocytically
   active macrophages. The present work demonstrates the use of IVUS/IVPA
   imaging as a tool for localized temperature monitoring during laser
   heating. The temperature dependent change in IVPA signal intensity of
   silica-coated gold nanorod contrast agents absorbing within the
   near-infrared optical wavelength range is evaluated and shown to have a
   linear relationship, with a slope greater than that of endogenous
   tissue. A continuous wave laser was subsequently incorporated into the
   IVUS/IVPA integrated catheter and utilized to selectively heat the
   nanoparticles with simultaneous IVPA temperature monitoring. IVUS/IVPA,
   therefore, provides a platform for detection and temperature monitoring
   of atherosclerotic plaques through the selective heating of plasmonic
   gold nanoparticle contrast agents.}},

Abstract = {{Shock wave/boundary layer interactions occur in a wide range of
   supersonic internal and external flows, and often these interactions are
   associated with turbulent boundary layer separation. The resulting
   separated flow is associated with large-scale, low-frequency
   unsteadiness whose cause has been the subject of much attention and
   debate. In particular, some researchers have concluded that the source
   of low-frequency motions is in the upstream boundary layer, whereas
   others have argued for a downstream instability as the driving
   mechanism. Owing to substantial recent activity, we are close to
   developing a comprehensive understanding, albeit only in simplified flow
   configurations. A plausible model is that the interaction responds as a
   dynamical system that is forced by external disturbances. The
   low-frequency dynamics seem to be adequately described by a recently
   proposed shear layer entrainment-recharge mechanism. Upstream boundary
   layer fluctuations seem to be an important source of disturbances, but
   the evidence suggests that their impact is reduced with increasing size
   of the separated flow.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure sensing is an important function of electronic skin devices.
   The development of pressure sensors that can mimic and surpass the
   subtle pressure sensing properties of natural skin requires the rational
   design of materials and devices. Here we present an ultra-sensitive
   resistive pressure sensor based on an elastic, microstructured
   conducting polymer thin film. The elastic microstructured film is
   prepared from a polypyrrole hydrogel using a multiphase reaction that
   produced a hollow-sphere microstructure that endows polypyrrole with
   structure-derived elasticity and a low effective elastic modulus. The
   contact area between the microstructured thin film and the electrodes
   increases with the application of pressure, enabling the device to
   detect low pressures with ultra-high sensitivity. Our pressure sensor
   based on an elastic microstructured thin film enables the detection of
   pressures of less than 1 Pa and exhibits a short response time, good
   reproducibility, excellent cycling stability and temperature-stable
   sensing.}},

Abstract = {{The production of colloidal suspensions of graphene-based nano-platelets
   in large scale is highly important for their use in practical
   applications. In this work, we developed a new route for generation of
   colloidal suspensions of N-modified graphene-based nano-platelets
   (A-rG-O) with high concentration in water or organic solvent/water mixed
   systems by the reaction between graphene oxide and ammonium hydroxide.
   Graphene oxide was reduced by the ammonium hydroxide and N atoms (up to
   6 at\%) were introduced into A-rG-O materials using solution process
   without further thermal treatment. Such A-rG-O nano-platelets were well
   dispersed as individual layers in both systems. Macroscopic
   free-standing A-rG-O paper materials with good electrical conductivity
   were produced by filtration of such colloidal suspensions. (C) 2013

Title = {{Harnessing Yarrowia lipolytica lipogenesis to create a platform for
   lipid and biofuel production}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Economic feasibility of biosynthetic fuel and chemical production hinges
   upon harnessing metabolism to achieve high titre and yield. Here we
   report a thorough genotypic and phenotypic optimization of an oleaginous
   organism to create a strain with significant lipogenesis capability.
   Specifically, we rewire Yarrowia lipolytica's native metabolism for
   superior de novo lipogenesis by coupling combinatorial multiplexing of
   lipogenesis targets with phenotypic induction. We further complete
   direct conversion of lipid content into biodiesel. Tri-level metabolic
   control results in saturated cells containing upwards of 90\% lipid
   content and titres exceeding 25 g l(-1) lipids, which represents a
   60-fold improvement over parental strain and conditions. Through this
   rewiring effort, we advance fundamental understanding of lipogenesis,
   demonstrate non-canonical environmental and intracellular stimuli and
   uncouple lipogenesis from nitrogen starvation. The high titres and
   carbon-source independent nature of this lipogenesis in Y. lipolytica
   highlight the potential of this organism as a platform for efficient
   oleochemical production.}},

Title = {{Radon emanation fractions from concretes containing fly ash and

Abstract = {{Radon (Rn-222) and progenies emanate from soil and building components
   and can create an indoor air quality hazard. In this study, nine
   concrete constituents, including the supplementary cementitious
   materials (SCMs) fly ash and metakaolin, were used to create eleven
   different concrete mixtures. We investigated the effect of constituent
   radium specific activity, radon effective activity and emanation
   fraction on the concrete emanation fraction and the radon exhalation
   rate. Given the serious health effects associated with radionuclide
   exposure, experimental results were coupled with Monte Carlo simulations
   to demonstrate predictive differences in the indoor radon concentration
   due to concrete mixture design. The results from this study show that,
   on average, fly ash constituents possessed radium specific activities
   ranging from 100 Bq/kg to 200 Bq/kg and emanation fractions ranging from
   1.1\% to 2.5\%. The lowest emitting concrete mixture containing fly ash
   resulted in a 3.4\% reduction in the concrete emanation fraction, owing
   to the relatively low emanation that exists when fly ash is part of
   concrete. On average, the metakaolin constituents contained radium
   specific activities ranging from 67 Bq/kg to 600 Bq/kg and emanation
   fractions ranging from 8.4\% to 15.5\%, and changed the total concrete
   emanation fraction by roughly +/- 5\% relative to control samples. The
   results from this study suggest that SCMs can reduce indoor radon
   exposure from concrete, contingent upon SCM radionucleotide content and
   emanation fraction. Lastly, the experimental results provide
   SCM-specific concrete emanation fractions for indoor radon exposure
   modeling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanodroplets were introduced as contrast
   agents for imaging and image-guided therapy. For example, in sonography,
   high-intensity ultrasound pulses were used to phase-transition liquid
   perfluorocarbon to produce gas microbubbles. More recently,
   perfluorocarbon nanodroplets with encapsulated gold nanorods were used
   as dual ultrasound/photoacoustic contrast agents. To expedite clinical
   translation, we synthesized and characterized ICG-loaded perfluorocarbon
   nanodroplets, i.e., constructs comprising biocompatible, nontoxic and
   biologically safe materials. We then demonstrated enhanced photoacoustic
   contrast through optically triggered phase transition of PFC
   nanodroplets and ultrasound contrast from the resulting PFC bubbles. We
   assessed the quality enhancement of photoacoustic and ultrasound images
   through analysis of contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio. We further
   investigated the changes in image contrast due to increased ambient
   temperature. Our studies suggest that ICG-loaded perfluorocarbon
   nanodroplets may become a valuable tool for various imaging modalities,
   and have promising therapeutic applications.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{We have devised a dielectric film with a chemical vapor deposited
   graphene interlayer and studied the effect of the graphene interlayer on
   the dielectric performance. The highly transparent and flexible film was
   a polymer/graphene/polymer `sandwich-structure' fabricated by a one-step
   transfer method that had a dielectric constant of 51, with a dielectric
   loss of 0.05 at 1 kHz. The graphene interlayer in the film forms a space
   charge layer, i.e., an accumulation of polarized charge carriers near
   the graphene, resulting in an induced space charge polarization and
   enhanced dielectric constant. The characteristic of the space charge
   layer for the graphene dielectric film, the sheet resistance of the
   graphene interlayer, was adjusted through thermal annealing that caused
   partial oxidation. The dielectric film with higher sheet resistance due
   to the oxidized graphene interlayer had a significantly lower dielectric
   constant compared to that with the graphene with lower interlayer sheet
   resistance. Oxidizing the graphene interlayer yields a smaller and
   thinner space charge density in the dielectric film, ultimately leading
   to decreased capacitance. Considering the simplicity of the fabrication
   process and high dielectric performance, as well as the high
   transparency and flexibility, this film is promising for applications in
   plastic electronics.}},

Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{915-922}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Silicon (Si) nanomaterials have emerged as a leading candidate for next
   generation lithium-ion battery anodes. However, the low electrical
   conductivity of Si requires the use of conductive additives in the anode
   film. Here we report a solution-based synthesis of Si nanowires with a
   conductive carbon skin. Without any conductive additive, the Si nanowire
   electrodes exhibited capacities of over 2000 mA h g(-1) for 100 cycles
   when cycled at C/10 and over 1200 mA h g(-1) when cycled more rapidly at
   1C against Li metal. In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   observation reveals that the carbon skin performs dual roles: it speeds
   lithiation of the Si nanowires significantly, while also constraining
   the final volume expansion. The present work sheds light on ways to
   optimize lithium battery performance by smartly tailoring the
   nanostructure of composition of materials based on silicon and carbon.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to go beyond resilience into the study of security and
   local-repairability for distributed storage systems (DSSs). Security and
   local-repairability are both important as features of an efficient
   storage system, and this paper aims to understand the trade-offs between
   resilience, security, and local-repairability in these systems. In
   particular, this paper first investigates security in the presence of
   colluding eavesdroppers, where eavesdroppers are assumed to work
   together in decoding the stored information. Second, this paper focuses
   on coding schemes that enable optimal local repairs. It further brings
   these two concepts together to develop locally repairable coding schemes
   for DSS that are secure against eavesdroppers. The main results of this
   paper include: 1) an improved bound on the secrecy capacity for minimum
   storage regenerating codes; 2) secure coding schemes that achieve the
   bound for some special cases; 3) a new bound on minimum distance for
   locally repairable codes; 4) code construction for locally repairable
   codes that attain the minimum distance bound; and 5)
   repair-bandwidth-efficient locally repairable codes with and without

Abstract = {{This paper characterizes the degree-of-freedom (DoF) regions for the
   multiuser vector broadcast channel with periodic channel state
   information (CSI) feedback. As a part of the characterization, a new
   transmission method called space-time interference alignment is
   proposed, which exploits both the current and past CSI jointly. Using
   the proposed alignment technique, an inner bound of the sum-DoF region
   is characterized as a function of a normalized CSI feedback frequency,
   which measures CSI feedback speed compared to the speed of user's
   channel variations. One consequence of the result is that the achievable
   sum-DoF gain is improved significantly when a user sends back both
   current and outdated CSI compared to the case where the user sends back
   current CSI only. Then, a tradeoff between CSI feedback delay and the
   sum-DoF gain is characterized for the multiuser vector broadcast channel
   in terms of a normalized CSI feedback delay that measures CSI
   obsoleteness compared to channel coherence time. A crucial insight is
   that it is possible to achieve the optimal DoF gain if the feedback
   delay is less than a derived fraction of the channel coherence time.
   This precisely characterizes the intuition that a small delay should be
   negligible.}},

Abstract = {{Building on past work seeking to value emerging energy storage
   technologies in grid-based applications, this paper introduces a dynamic
   model-based framework to value a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB)
   participating in Texas' organized electricity market. Our model
   describes the dynamic behavior of a VRFB system's voltage and state of
   charge based on the instantaneous charging or discharging power required
   from the battery. We formulate an optimization problem that incorporates
   the model to show the potential value of a VRFB used for frequency
   regulation service in Texas. The optimization is implemented in Matlab
   using the large-scale, interior-point, nonlinear optimization algorithm,
   with the objective function gradient, nonlinear constraint gradients,
   and Hessian matrix specified analytically. Utilizing market prices and
   other relevant data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas
   (ERCOT), we find that a VRFB system used for frequency regulation
   service could be worth approximately \$15001kW. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Cold rich bypass to the stripper in CO2 capture by alkanolamines will
   usually reduce the total heat duty. Bypass reduces the stripping steam
   in the overhead vapor and balances the temperature approach in the main
   cross exchanger. This process improvement reduces the energy requirement
   of any configuration, but it is most beneficial when the overhead vapor
   is not already countercurrently contacted with incoming rich solution.
   Therefore, the 2-stage flash configuration was evaluated in this work,
   and it had an improvement of 11\% over the no bypass case. Its
   improvement was better than what was observed with a simple stripper and
   interheated column. An optimized cool rich bypass for a pilot scale
   2-stage reduces the equivalent work.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{99-107}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for developing a probabilistic-based
   occupancy model that focuses on occupants' long vacancy activities
   (greater than 1 week) and other potential building underutilization that
   is further integrated with a building energy simulation model. The
   combined model is then applied toward an existing Leadership in Energy
   and Environmental Design (LEED) certified military dormitory and later
   compared with corresponding values from the energy model's original
   prediction as well as actual building energy data. The occupancy model
   simulates annual building occupancy rates comprised of weekly values
   based on the frequency, duration, and seasonality of occupants' long
   vacancy activities. The energy model uses the simulated occupancy rates
   to yield the building's predicted range of energy performance. Applying
   the combined model to the existing LEED building resulted in an
   improved, predicted Energy Use Intensity (EUI) mean value of 612 MJ/m(2)
   as compared to the original model and actual EUI values of 691 and 590,
   respectively. While the model also demonstrated its utility in
   describing the change in predicted performance over a range of
   probabilities associated with certain long vacancy activities, efforts
   to incorporate other occupant behavior-related aspects such occupant
   schedules and thermal set points could further improve modeling efforts.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GLAUCOMA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},

Pages = {{E45-E52}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose:Compare performance of normalized reflectance index (NRI) and
   retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) parameters determined from
   optical coherence tomography (OCT) images for glaucoma and glaucoma
   suspect diagnosis.Methods:Seventy-five eyes from 71 human subjects were
   studied: 33 controls, 24 glaucomatous, and 18 glaucoma-suspects. RNFLT
   and NRI maps were measured using 2 custom-built OCT systems and the
   commercial instrument RTVue. Using area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve, RNFLT and NRI measured in 7 RNFL locations were
   analyzed to distinguish between control, glaucomatous, and
   glaucoma-suspect eyes.Results:The mean NRI of the control group was
   significantly larger than the means of glaucomatous and glaucoma-suspect
   groups in most RNFL locations for all 3 OCT systems (P<0.05 for all
   comparisons). NRI performs significantly better than RNFLT at
   distinguishing between glaucoma-suspect and control eyes using RTVue OCT
   (P=0.008). The performances of NRI and RNFLT for classifying
   glaucoma-suspect versus control eyes were statistically
   indistinguishable for PS-OCT-EIA (P=0.101) and PS-OCT-DEC (P=0.227). The
   performances of NRI and RNFLT for classifying glaucomatous versus
   control eyes were statistically indistinguishable (PS-OCT-EIA: P=0.379;
   PS-OCT-DEC: P=0.338; RTVue OCT: P=0.877).Conclusions:NRI is a promising
   measure for distinguishing between glaucoma-suspect and control eyes and
   may indicate disease in the preperimetric stage. Results of this pilot
   clinical study warrant a larger study to confirm the diagnostic power of
   NRI for diagnosing preperimetric glaucoma.}},

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-42}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Fundamental water and salt transport properties of polymers are critical
   for applications such as reverse osmosis (RO), nanofiltration (NF),
   forward osmosis (FO), pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO), and membrane
   capacitive deionization (MCDI) that require controlled water and salt
   transport. Key developments in the field of water and salt transport in
   polymer membranes are reviewed, and a survey of polymers considered for
   such applications is provided. Many polymers considered for such
   applications contain charged functional groups, such as sulfonate
   groups, that can dissociate in the presence of water. Water and ion
   transport data from the literature are reviewed to highlight the
   similarities and differences between charged and uncharged polymers.
   Additionally, the influence of other polymer structure characteristics,
   such as cross-linking and morphology in phase separated systems, on
   water and salt transport properties is discussed. The role of free
   volume on water and salt transport properties is discussed. The
   solution-diffusion model, which describes the transport of water and
   ions in nonporous polymers, is used as a framework for discussing
   structure/property relations in polymers related to water and salt
   transport properties. Areas where current knowledge is limited and
   opportunities for further research are also noted. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Hydrogels are hydrophilic polymer-based materials with high water
   content and physical characteristics that resemble the native
   extracellular matrix. Because of their remarkable properties, hydrogel
   systems are used for a wide range of biomedical applications, such as
   three-dimensional (3D) matrices for tissue engineering, drug-delivery
   vehicles, composite biomaterials, and as injectable fillers in minimally
   invasive surgeries. In addition, the rational design of hydrogels with
   controlled physical and biological properties can be used to modulate
   cellular functionality and tissue morphogenesis. Here, the development
   of advanced hydrogels with tunable physiochemical properties is
   highlighted, with particular emphasis on elastomeric, light-sensitive,
   composite, and shape-memory hydrogels. Emerging technologies developed
   over the past decade to control hydrogel architecture are also discussed
   and a number of potential applications and challenges in the utilization
   of hydrogels in regenerative medicine are reviewed. It is anticipated
   that the continued development of sophisticated hydrogels will result in
   clinical applications that will improve patient care and quality of
   life.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, Carbon Capture and Storage (Sequestration) (CCS) has
   been proposed as a potential method to allow the continued use of
   fossil-fuelled power stations whilst preventing emissions of CO2 from
   reaching the atmosphere. Gas, coat (and biomass)-fired power stations
   can respond to changes in demand more readily than many other sources of
   electricity production, hence the importance of retaining them as an
   option in the energy mix. Here, we review the leading CO2 capture
   technologies, available in the short and long term, and their
   technological maturity, before discussing CO2 transport and storage.
   Current pilot plants and demonstrations are highlighted, as is the
   importance of optimising the CCS system as a whole. Other topics briefly
   discussed include the viability of both the capture of CO2 from the air
   and CO2 reutilisation as climate change mitigation strategies. Finally,
   we discuss the economic and legal aspects of CCS.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a reliable intersection algorithm for manifold surface
   meshes. The proposed algorithm builds conforming surface meshes from a
   set of intersecting triangulated surfaces. This algorithm effectively
   handles all degenerate triangle-triangle intersection cases. The key
   idea of the algorithm is based on an extensive set of triangle-edge
   intersection cases, combined with an intersection curve tracking method.
   The intersection operations do not rely on global spatial search
   operations and no remeshing steps are needed. The intersection curves
   are introduced into each surface mesh using a unique curve imprinting
   algorithm. The imprinting algorithm naturally handles degenerate
   intersection cases of many surfaces at an edge or at a point. The
   algorithm produces a consistent mesh data structure for subsequent mesh
   optimization operations. The mesh intersection algorithm is used within
   a general framework for modelling and meshing of geological formations,
   which are essential for reliable mathematical modelling of oil
   reservoirs.}},

Title = {{Dynamic Demand Response Controller Based on Real-Time Retail Price for

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Demand response and dynamic retail pricing of electricity are key
   factors in a smart grid to reduce peak loads and to increase the
   efficiency of the power grid. Air-conditioning and heating loads in
   residential buildings are major contributors to total electricity
   consumption. In hot climates, such as Austin, Texas, the electricity
   cooling load of buildings results in critical peak load during the
   on-peak period. Demand response (DR) is valuable to reduce both
   electricity loads and energy costs for end users in a residential
   building. This paper focuses on developing a control strategy for the
   HVACs to respond to real-time prices for peak load reduction. A proposed
   dynamic demand response controller (DDRC) changes the set-point
   temperature to control HVAC loads depending on electricity retail price
   published each 15 minutes and partially shifts some of this load away
   from the peak. The advantages of the proposed control strategy are that
   DDRC has a detailed scheduling function and compares the real-time
   retail price of electricity with a threshold price that customers set by
   their preference in order to control HVAC loads considering energy cost.
   In addition, a detailed single family house model is developed using
   OpenStudio and Energyplus considering the geometry of a residential
   building and geographical environment. This HVAC modeling provides
   simulation of a house. Comfort level is, moreover, reflected into the
   DDRC to minimize discomfort when DDRC changes the set-point temperature.
   Our proposed DDRC is implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK and connected to the
   EnergyPlus model via building controls virtual test bed (BCVTB). The
   real-time retail price is based on the real-time wholesale price in the
   ERCOT market in Texas. The study shows that DDRC applied in residential
   HVAC systems could significantly reduce peak loads and electricity bills
   with a modest variation in thermal comfort.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{490-500}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Scenarios of near future wind power are synthesized by considering the
   power spectral density (PSD), statistical characteristics, and the
   future capacity. The PSD of the wind power follows different power laws
   over different frequency ranges and is approximated by a piecewise
   function. A scaling exponent of the power law for a particular piece can
   be approximated by the slope of an affine function fitted to a
   logarithmic plot of the PSD. Each piece of the function has a different
   trend as the total capacity increases. Slope trends, the first PSD
   value, and the last PSD value are trained to forecast the PSD. Then,
   future wind power scenarios are synthesized from the forecasted PSD. In
   this process, phase angles are searched using a genetic algorithm while
   satisfying forecasted statistical characteristics for the given
   capacity. Our approach is simulated and validated for wind power for
   seven years in ERCOT and is used to synthesize a future wind power
   scenario at 10,000 MW capacity. Our approach could also be used to
   generate wind power scenarios at present capacity for many stochastic
   optimization problems in power systems.}},

Title = {{Optimization of capillary flow through square micropillar arrays}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{39-51}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This work compares several models for fluid flow through micropillar
   arrays to numerical simulations and uses them to optimize pillar
   dimensions for maximum fluid flow in a heat pipe application.
   Micropillar arrays are important for controlling capillary flow in
   microfluidic devices, and array permeability is a key parameter in
   determining fluid flow rate. Several permeability models are considered,
   including the Brinkman equation, numerical simulations, inverse
   reciprocal sums of a cylinder bank and open flow over a flat plate, and
   an analytical solution developed by the authors derived from a
   2-dimensional velocity profile with appropriately varying boundary
   conditions. The comparison seeks to identify the models that are
   reliable over a wide range of porosities yet flexible enough to
   accommodate new pillar configurations. Numerical simulations of pillar
   permeability are the most desirable due to their accuracy. For pillars
   arranged in a square pattern, the 2-D analytical solution proposed in
   this study performs well at short pillar heights while the Brinkman
   equation is more accurate at tall pillar heights. Therefore, a hybrid
   model is formulated that uses the 2-D solution for h/d <= 5 and the
   Brinkman model for h/d > 5. The 2D solution, the Brinkman equation using
   specifically the permeability derived by Tamayol and Bahrami (2009), and
   numerical simulations are easily adapted to alternative pillar
   arrangements. A comparison of these models for pillars arranged in a
   rectangular pattern demonstrated that the authors' proposed solution is
   an excellent match to numerical results. These findings are applied to
   capillary fluid flow in heat pipes to explore the effects of pillar
   spacing, diameter, and height on the maximum fluid flow rate through the
   wick. At a given height aspect ratio, there is an optimum pillar spacing
   that balances the viscous losses and driving capillary pressure such
   that the flow rate reaches a maximum. In addition, the flow rate is
   increased by increasing pillar height if the pillar spacing is
   maintained at the corresponding optimum point. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{An analytical model for predicting LNAPL distribution and recovery from
   multi-layered soils}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{156}},
Pages = {{52-61}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{An analytical model was developed for estimating the distribution and
   recovery of light nonaqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) in heterogeneous
   aquifers. Various scenarios of LNAPL recovery may be simulated using
   LDRM for LNAPL recovery systems such as skimmer wells, water-enhanced
   wells, air-enhanced wells, and trenches from heterogeneous aquifers.
   LDRM uses multiple horizontal soil layers to model a heterogeneous
   aquifer. Up to three soil layers may be configured with unique soil
   properties for each layer. Simulation results suggest that LNAPL
   distribution and its recovery volume are highly affected by soil
   properties. In sandy soils LNAPL can be highly mobile and the recovery
   efficiency can be high. In contrast, even at high LNAPL saturations,
   LNAPL mobility is typically low in fine-grained soils. This
   characteristic of LNAPL with respect to soil texture has to be carefully
   accounted for in the model to better predict the recovery of LNAPL from
   heterogeneous soils. The impact of vertical hydraulic gradient in fine
   grain zone was assessed. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the
   formation LNAPL volume can be significantly affected by a downward
   vertical hydraulic gradient if the magnitude is near a critical amount
   (=rho(r) - 1). Sensitivity of input parameters with respect to LNAPL
   formation in soils and LNAPL recovery volume were identified through a
   sensitivity analysis. The performance of LDRM on predicting the
   distribution and recovery of LNAP was reasonably accurate for a
   short-term analysis as demonstrated in a case study. However, further
   validation is needed to ascertain the model's performance in long-term
   simulations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Parameter identification is an essential step in constructing a
   groundwater model. The process of recognizing model parameter values by
   conditioning on observed data of the state variable is referred to as
   the inverse problem. A series of inverse methods has been proposed to
   solve the inverse problem, ranging from trial-and-error manual
   calibration to the current complex automatic data assimilation
   algorithms. This paper does not attempt to be another overview paper on
   inverse models, but rather to analyze and track the evolution of the
   inverse methods over the last decades, mostly within the realm of
   hydrogeology, revealing their transformation, motivation and recent
   trends. Issues confronted by the inverse problem, such as dealing with
   multiGaussianity and whether or not to preserve the prior statistics are
   discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Sizeable amounts of connected microporosity with various origins can
   have a profound effect on important petrophysical properties of a porous
   medium such as (absolute/relative) permeability and capillary pressure
   relationships. We construct pore-throat networks that incorporate both
   intergranular porosity and microporosity. The latter originates from two
   separate mechanisms: partial dissolution of grains and pore fillings (e.
   g. clay). We then use the reconstructed network models to estimate the
   medium flow properties. In this work, we develop unique network
   construction algorithms and simulate capillary pressure-saturation and
   relative permeability-saturation curves for cases with inhomogeneous
   distributions of pores and micropores. Furthermore, we provide a
   modeling framework for variable amounts of cement and connectivity of
   the intergranular porosity and quantifying the conditions under which
   microporosity dominates transport properties. In the extreme case of a
   disconnected inter-granular network due to cementation a range of
   saturations within which neither fluid phase is capable of flowing
   emerges. To our knowledge, this is the first flexible pore scale model,
   from first principles, to successfully approach this behavior observed
   in tight reservoirs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid urban sprawl and population decentralization in recent decades
   have increased the size of the wildland-urban interface and resulted in
   higher community risk and vulnerability to wildfire. This paper
   primarily focuses on understanding grass-fueled fires common to Texas
   and improving the understanding of the physics and fire dynamics that
   are inherent in the grassland and prairie flame spread problem. Little
   bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) grass was chosen as the grassland
   fuel due to its prevalent coverage in the Texas area and its relevance
   to grassland fires in Texas. The methodology in this study relies on a
   framework to characterize fuel properties of little bluestem grass using
   small- and intermediate-scale experiments to better predict full-scale
   fire behavior. An intermediate-scale numerical flame spread model was
   developed for grass fuels that accounts for fuel moisture content to
   calculate the mass versus time of a burning little bluestem plant. The
   results of the small- and intermediate-scale experiments were used to
   develop input parameters for a field-scale numerical simulation of a
   grass field using a physics-based computational fire model,
   Wildland-urban interface Fire Dynamics Simulator (WFDS). A sensitivity
   analysis was performed to determine the effect of varying WFDS input
   parameters on the fire spread rate. The results indicate that the fuel
   moisture content had the most significant impact on the fire spread
   rate.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most challenging ongoing issues in the field of 3D visual
   research is how to perceptually quantify object and surface
   visualizations that are displayed within a virtual 3D space between a
   human eye and 3D display. To seek an effective method of quantification,
   it is necessary to measure various elements related to the perception of
   3D objects at different depths. We propose a new framework for
   quantifying 3D visual information that we call 3D visual activity
   (3DVA), which utilizes natural scene statistics measured over 3D visual
   coordinates. We account for important aspects of 3D perception by
   carrying out a 3D coordinate transform reflecting the nonuniform
   sampling resolution of the eye and the process of stereoscopic fusion.
   The 3DVA utilizes the empirical distortions of wavelet coefficients to a
   parametric generalized Gaussian probability distribution model and a set
   of 3D perceptual weights. We conducted a series of simulations that
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the 3DVA for quantifying the
   statistical dynamics of visual 3D space with respect to disparity,
   motion, texture, and color. A successful example application is also
   provided, whereby 3DVA is applied to the problem of predicting visual
   fatigue experienced when viewing 3D displays.}},

Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Intracanal disinfection is a crucial step in regenerative
   endodontic procedures. Most published cases suggest the use of sodium
   hypochlorite (NaOCl) as the primary irrigant. However, the effect of
   clinically used concentrations of NaOCl on the survival and
   differentiation of stem cells is largely unknown. In this study, we
   tested the effect of various concentrations of NaOCl on the stem cells
   of the apical papilla (SCAPs) survival and dentin sialophosphoprotein
   (DSPP) expression. Methods: Standardized root canals were created in
   extracted human teeth and irrigated with NaOCl (0.5\%, 1.5\%, 3\%, or
   6\%) followed by 17\% EDTA or sterile saline. SCAPs in a hyaluronic acid
   based scaffold were seeded into the canals and cultured for 7 days.
   Next, viable cells were quantified using a luminescence assay, and DSPP
   expression was evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain
   reaction. Results: There was a significant reduction in survival and
   DSPP expression in the group treated with 6\% NaOCl compared with the
   untreated control group. Comparable survival was observed in the groups
   treated with the lower concentrations of NaOCl, but greater DSPP
   expression was observed in the 1.5\% NaOCl group. In addition, 17\% EDTA
   resulted in increased survival and DSPP expression partially reversing
   the deleterious effects of NaOCl. Conclusions: Collectively, the results
   suggest that dentin conditioning with high concentrations of NaOCl has a
   profound negative effect on the survival and differentiation of SCAPs.
   However, this effect can be prevented with the use of 1.5\% NaOCl
   followed by 17\% ETA. The inclusion of this irrigation regimen might be
   beneficial in regenerative endodontic procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Cell migration is a highly complex, dynamical biological phenomenon that
   involves precise spatio-temporal coordination of distinctive
   sub-processes including adhesion, protrusion, and contraction of the
   cell. Observations of individual tumor cell migration reveal that cells
   generally exhibit either mesenchymal-type or amoeboid-type migration
   modes in native like environments. However, it has also been observed
   that some migrating cells are capable of morphologically adapting to
   their environment by modifying their type of migration. Recent studies
   suggest in fact that changes in biophysical and biomechanical properties
   of tumor cells can reversibly control their transition from one type of
   migration to the other. These changes may be caused by internal cell
   biomechanical mechanisms as well as mechanical and topological
   properties of the extracellular matrix. In order to understand the
   complex transition between the two modes and the role played by internal
   cellular mechanics during migration, we have developed a novel
   axisymmetric hyperviscoelastic cell model to simulate the dynamical
   behavior of a migrating cell. Numerical results from our study
   quantitatively demonstrate that the biomechanical properties of the cell
   may play an important role in the amoeboid-mesenchymal transition during
   migration. Our study will therefore not only help in creating a new
   platform for simulating cellular processes but will also provide
   insights into the role of sub-cellular mechanics in regulating various
   modes of migration during tumor invasion and metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{Pd and Pd-Au nanoparticles supported on poly(diallyldimethylammonium
   chloride) (PDDA) functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) have been
   synthesized by the ethylene glycol reduction method and characterized by
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electrochemical measurements
   for formic acid oxidation. TEM analysis shows that the Pd-Au
   nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surface of graphene
   nanoplatelets with an average particle size of 6.8 nm. The Pd-Au
   nanoparticles supported on PDDA-xGNP show higher activity for formic
   acid electro-oxidation than Pd nanoparticles supported on PDDA-xGNP and
   Pd or Pd-Au supported on traditional Vulcan XC-72 carbon. The higher
   catalytic activity of Pd-Au/PDDA-xGNP is mainly due to the alloying of
   Pd with Au. The promotional effect of Au and the absence of continuous
   Pd sites significantly suppress the poisoning effects of CO, enhancing
   the catalytic activity for formic acid oxidation and making them
   promising for direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFC).}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala is a central target of emotion regulation. It is overactive
   and dysregulated in affective and anxiety disorders and amygdala
   activity normalizes with successful therapy of the symptoms. However, a
   considerable percentage of patients do not reach remission within
   acceptable duration of treatment. The amygdala could therefore represent
   a promising target for real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (rtfMRI) neurofeedback. rtfMRI neurofeedback directly improves the
   voluntary regulation of localized brain activity. At present, most
   rtfMRI neurofeedback studies have trained participants to increase
   activity of a target, i.e. up-regulation. However, in the case of the
   amygdala, down-regulation is supposedly more clinically relevant.
   Therefore, we developed a task that trained participants to
   down-regulate activity of the right amygdala while being confronted with
   amygdala stimulation, i.e. negative emotional faces. The activity in the
   functionally-defined region was used as online visual feedback in six
   healthy subjects instructed to minimize this signal using reality
   checking as emotion regulation strategy. Over a period of four training
   sessions, participants significantly increased down-regulation of the
   right amygdala compared to a passive viewing condition to control for
   habilitation effects. This result supports the concept of using rtfMRI
   neurofeedback training to control brain activity during relevant
   stimulation, specifically in the case of emotion, and has implications
   towards clinical treatment of emotional disorders.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Left atrial appendage (LAA) is the major source of cardiac
   thrombi in atrial fibrillation (AF) and plays a major role in
   cardioembolic events.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate the correlation between LAA morphology and the
   burden of silent cerebral ischemia (SCI) as a new thromboembolic risk
   marker in patients with AF.
   METHODS A total of 348 patients with AF undergoing transcatheter
   ablation were enrolled. A cerebral magnetic resonance (MR) was performed
   to assess SCI burden, while LAA morphology was studied by MR or computed
   tomography and categorized as follows: cactus in 52 (14.9\%) patients,
   chicken wing in 177 (50.9\%), wind sock in 101 (29.0\%), and cauliflower
   in 18 (5.2\%).
   RESULTS SCIs were detected in 295 (84.8\%) patients, with a median
   number of lesions of 23. SCI burden was related to LAA complexity:
   30.8\% and 17.3\% patients with cactus, 30.5\% and 22.0\% with chicken
   wing, 13.9\% and 27.7\% with wind sock, and 16.7\% and 38.9\% with
   cauliflower LAA morphologies were in the first and fourth quartiles of
   number of SCI per patient, respectively (P = .035). After adjustment for
   potential confounders, only age (beta 0.12; 95\% CI 0.08-0.16; P <
   .001), chicken wing (beta -0.28; 95\% CI -0.51 to -0.04; P = .021), wind
   sock (beta 0.38; 95\% CI 0.12-0.65; P = .005), and cauliflower (beta
   0.61; 95\% CI 0.07-1.14; P = .026) LAA morphologies were significantly
   related to SCI burden.
   CONCLUSION LAA morphology relates to the burden of SCI in AF patients.
   Future research should corroborate if accessible methods (eg,
   echocardiography) are able to describe LAA morphology, permitting its
   use within universal thromboembolic risk predictors in AF patients.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Radiofrequency (RE) ablation to treat atrial arrhythmia is
   limited by the inability to reliably assess lesion durability and
   transmurality.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of
   photoacoustic characterization of myocardial ablation lesions in vitro.
   In this study, we investigated the feasibility of combined ultrasound
   (US) and spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging to visualize RE ablation
   lesions in three dimensions (3D) based on unique differences in the
   optical absorption spectra between normal and ablated myocardial tissue.
   METHODS Tissue samples were excised from the ventricles of fresh porcine
   hearts. Lesions were generated using an RE catheter ablation system
   using 20 to 30 W of power applied for 40 to 60 seconds. Ablated samples
   were imaged in the near-infrared regime (740-780 nm) using a combined
   PA/US imaging system. Measured PA spectra were correlated to the
   absorption spectra of deoxyhemoglobin and ablated tissue to produce a
   tissue characterization map (TCM) identifying 3D lesion location and
   extent. Tissue samples were stained and photographed for gross
   pathology. TCM and gross pathology images were coregistered to assess
   TCM accuracy.
   RESULTS TCM reliably characterized ablated and non-ablated tissue up to
   depths of 3 mm. TCM also assessed lesion position and extent with
   submillimeter accuracy in multiple dimensions. Segmented TCMs achieved
   >69\% agreement with gross pathology.
   CONCLUSION The study results suggest that spectroscopic photoacoustic
   imaging has the potential to accurately assess RE ablation Lesion size
   and position with submillimeter precision and may be well suited to
   guide transcatheter RE atrial ablation in clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-rich layered Li{[}Li1/3-2x/3Mn2/3-x/3Nix]O-2 (0 < x <= 1/2)
   oxide cathodes show promise as a potential candidate for Li-ion
   batteries due to their high capacity. However, the intricacies of the
   role of composition with increasing excess Li on the degree of oxygen
   loss during the first charge and the discharge capacity in subsequent
   cycles are not fully understood. With an aim to develop a better
   fundamental understanding, we present here an in-depth investigation of
   the Li{[}Li1/3-2x/3Mn2/3-x/3Nix]O-2 (0 < x <= 1/2) series with a range
   of different excess lithium contents prepared by two different synthesis
   methods. The oxygen loss from the lattice during the first charge and
   the discharge capacity in subsequent cycles increase with increasing
   lithium content. In-depth analysis with a combination of X-ray
   diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), aberration-corrected
   scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), diffraction-STEM
   (D-STEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) reveals that
   the samples transition from an R (3) over barm structure to a C2/m
   structure with increasing lithium content and decreasing nickel to
   manganese ratio, for both the synthesis methods, indicating that the
   maximum oxygen loss and discharge capacity are achieved with a single
   C2/m phase. We further show that within a single particle, the cation
   layers of these materials can order on different \{111\} planes in the
   basic NaCl structure.}},

Abstract = {{The direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is a promising energy conversion
   device that holds the potential to replace lithium ion batteries used in
   portable electronic devices. At present, widespread commercialization is
   impeded in part by the absence of a suitable proton exchange membrane
   (PEM). To address this need, pyridine- and pyrimidine-functionalized
   poly(sulfone) s (PPS and PMPS, respectively) were prepared in two high
   yielding post-polymerization C-H borylation/Suzuki coupling steps from
   commercially available UDEL (R) poly(sulfone). Membranes comprised of
   the aforementioned polymers blended with sulfonated poly(ether ether
   ketone) (SPEEK) were found to exhibit improved single cell performance
   and decreased methanol crossover in comparison to plain SPEEK and showed
   higher power densities than Nafion (R) 112, an exchange membrane
   commonly used in DMFCs. Blend properties and single cell performances

Abstract = {{This paper presents a control scheme for ensuring that a 3D,
   under-actuated, point-foot biped robot remains balanced while walking.
   It achieves this by observing the center of mass (COM) position error
   relative to a reference path and re-planning a new reference trajectory
   to remove this error at every step. The Prismatic Inverted Pendulum
   Model (PIPM) is used to simplify behavioral analysis of the robot. We
   use phase space techniques to plan the COM trajectories and foot
   placement. While obtaining a stable path using this simplified model is
   easy, when applied to a real robot, there will usually be deviation from
   the expected path due to modeling inaccuracies. Although fully-actuated
   robots can reduce the deviation with relatively simple feedback control
   loops, when working with under-actuated robots, it is challenging to
   design such a feedback control loop. Our approach is based on continuous
   re-planning. By planning the path of the next step based on the observed
   initial error, we can find the proper landing location of each step. For
   each step we allocate sufficient time to avoid disturbances from the
   moment induced by the moving leg, which is not modeled in the PIPM. Our
   control scheme relies on the PIPM instead of the Linear Inverted
   Pendulum Model (LIPM) to enable non-planar COM motion, which is
   essential for rough terrain locomotion. We show simulation results that
   include full multi-body dynamics, friction, and ground reaction forces.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) numerical methods utilizing octree data
   structures are an important class of HPC applications, in particular the
   solution of partial differential equations. Much effort goes into the
   implementation of efficient versions of these types of programs, where
   the emphasis is often on increasing multi-node performance when
   utilizing GPUs and coprocessors. By contrast, our analysis aims to
   characterize these workloads on traditional CPUs, as we believe that
   single-threaded intra-node performance of critical kernels is still a
   key factor for achieving performance at scale. Especially irregular
   workloads such as AMR methods, however, exhibit severe underutilization
   on general purpose processors.
   In this paper, we analyze the single core performance of two
   state-of-the-art, highly scalable adaptive mesh refinement codes, one
   based on the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) and one based on the Finite
   Element Method (FEM), when running on a x86 CPU. We examined both scalar
   and vectorized implementations to identify performance bottlenecks. We
   demonstrate that vectorization can provide a significant benefit in
   achieving high performance. The greatest bottleneck to peak performance
   is the high fraction of non-floating point instructions in the kernels.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing data demand, wireless networks are evolving to a
   hierarchical architecture where coverage is provided by both wide-area
   base-stations (BS) and dense deployments of short-range access nodes
   (AN) (e.g., small cells). The dense scale and mobility of users provide
   new challenges for scheduling: (i) High flux in mobile-to-AN
   associations, where mobile nodes quickly change associations with access
   nodes (time-scale of seconds) due to their small footprint, and (ii)
   multi-point connectivity, where mobile nodes are simultaneously
   connected to several access nodes at any time.
   We study such a densified scenario with multi-channel wireless links
   (e.g., multi-channel OFDM) between nodes (BS/AN/mobile). We first show
   that traditional algorithms that forward each packet at most once,
   either to a single access node or a mobile user, do not have good delay
   performance. We argue that the fast association dynamics between access
   nodes and mobile users necessitate a multi-point relaying strategy,
   where multiple access nodes have duplicate copies of the data, and
   coordinate to deliver data to the mobile user. Surprisingly, despite
   data replication and no coordination between ANs, we show that our
   algorithm (a distributed scheduler - DIST) can approximately stabilize
   the system in large-scale instantiations of this setting, and further,
   performs well from a queuelength/delay perspective (shown via large
   deviation bounds).}},

Abstract = {{In this work we study a noiseless broadcast link serving K users whose
   requests arise from a library of N files. Every user is equipped with a
   cache of size M files each. It has been shown that by splitting all the
   files into packets and placing individual packets in a random
   independent manner across all the caches, it requires at most N/M file
   transmissions for any set of demands from the library. The achievable
   delivery scheme involves linearly combining packets of different files
   following a greedy clique cover solution to the underlying index coding
   problem. This remarkable multiplicative gain of decentralized random
   caching has been established in the asymptotic regime when the number of
   packets per file F, scales to infinity.
   In this work, we initiate the finite-length analysis of random caching
   schemes when the number of packets F is a function of the system
   parameters M; N; K. Specifically, we show that existing random placement
   and greedy clique cover delivery schemes, while providing large gains in
   the asymptotic regime, can have at most a multiplicative gain of 2 if
   the number of packets is sub-exponential. Further, for any clique cover
   based coded delivery and a large class of random caching schemes, that
   includes the existing ones, we show that the number of packets required
   to get a multiplicative gain of 2 g is at least O ((N/M)(g)). We exhibit
   a caching and an efficient clique cover based coded delivery scheme that
   approximately achieves this lower bound. We also provide tight
   concentration results that show that the average (over the random
   caching involved) number of transmissions concentrates very well with
   only polynomial number of packets in the rest of the parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In many social networks, whether two agents incorporate each other's
   opinion or not depends on the proximity of their opinions. The bounded
   confidence model of opinion dynamics captures this by introducing a
   parameter called the influence range and by stating than an agent
   incorporates the opinion of another agent if the distance between their
   opinions is less than the influence range. We generalize the bounded
   confidence opinion dynamics model by allowing a stochastic influence
   range that varies across time and agents, and by incorporating the
   effect an additive noise on the update rule. We establish the conditions
   under which this stochastic dynamics is stable in an appropriate sense.
   Our main observation is that the the presence of heavy tailed influence
   ranges is critical for stability.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitivity analysis (SA) is a fundamental tool of uncertainty
   quantification(UQ). Adjoint-based SA is the optimal approach in many
   large-scale applications, such as the direct numerical simulation (DNS)
   of combustion. However, one of the challenges of the adjoint workflow
   for time-dependent applications is the storage and I/O requirements for
   the application state. During the time-reversal portion of the workflow,
   forward state is required in last-in-first-out order. The resulting
   requirements for storage at exascale are enormous. To mitigate this
   requirement, application state is regenerated from checkpoints over
   short windows of application time. This approach drastically reduces the
   total volume of stored data, allows the caching of state in the
   regeneration window in memory and on local SSDs, may accelerate the
   application execution by reducing output frequency, and reduces the
   power overhead from I/O. We explore variations to this workflow, applied
   to a proxy for the SA of turbulent combustion, by varying checkpoint
   number, state storage, and other regeneration options to find efficient
   implementations for minimizing compute time or power consumption.}},

Abstract = {{The landscape of contemporary engineering education is ever changing,
   adapting and evolving. As an example, finite element theory and
   application has often been included in graduate-level courses in
   engineering programs; however, current industry needs bachelor's-level
   engineering graduates with skills in applying this essential analysis
   and design technique. Engineering education is also changing to include
   more active learning. In response to the need to introduce undergrads to
   the finite element method as well as the need for engineering curricula
   to include more active learning, we have developed, implemented and
   assessed a suite of Active Learning Module (ALMs). The ALMs are designed
   to improve student learning of difficult engineering concepts while
   students gain essential knowledge of finite element analysis. We have
   used the Kolb Learning Cycle as a conceptual framework to guide our
   design of the ALMs.
   Originally developed using MSC Nastran, followed by development efforts
   in SolidWorks Simulation, ANSOFT, ANSYS, and other commercial FEA
   software packages, a team of researchers, with National Science
   Foundation support, have created over twenty-eight active learning
   modules. We will discuss the implementation of these learning modules
   which have been incorporated into undergraduate courses that cover
   topics such as machine design, mechanical vibrations, heat transfer,
   bioelectrical engineering, electromagnetic field analysis, structural
   fatigue analysis, computational fluid dynamics, rocket design, and chip
   formation during manufacturing, and large scale deformation in
   machining.
   This update on research findings includes statistical results for each
   module which compare performance on pre-and post-learning module quizzes
   to gauge change in student knowledge related to the difficult
   engineering concepts that each module addresses. Statistically
   significant student performance gains provide evidence of module
   effectiveness. In addition, we present statistical comparisons between
   different personality types (based on Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, MBTI,
   subgroups) and different learning styles (based on Felder-Solomon ILS
   subgroups) in regards to the average gains each group of students have
   made on quiz performance. Although exploratory, and generally based on
   small sample sizes at this point in our multi-year effort, the modules
   for which subgroup differences are found are being carefully reviewed in
   an attempt to determine whether modifications should be made to better
   ensure equitable impact of the modules across students from specific
   personality and / or learning styles subgroups (e.g., MBTI Intuitive
   versus Sensing; ILS Sequential versus Global).}},

Abstract = {{Experiential learning opportunities such as internships and externships
   are an important part of graduate education for many engineering
   students. Short-term off-campus training experiences can help students
   see the `real-world' impact of engineering research and broaden their
   understanding of their career opportunities. Arguably, internship and
   externship experiences are particularly valuable for students in
   interdisciplinary majors, such as biomedical engineering, which cross
   more traditional fields and career paths. Thus, interdisciplinary
   graduate training programs, such as those funded by the National
   Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), sometimes
   include an internship or externship component as a way to ensure breadth
   in the educational program. The purpose of this study is to review the
   graduate summer internship/externship practices of NIBIB funded graduate
   training programs (i.e., T32 mechanism). Our review is based on a survey
   of the principal investigators (program directors) of graduate training
   programs (T32 sites) currently funded by NIBIB. By comparing
   internship/externship practices across training programs, we hope to
   enable training program directors to reduce redundancy in developing
   policies and procedures for internships/externships, improve this
   experience for graduate trainees, and provide a baseline for internal
   continuous improvement purposes. For example, the survey results show
   that most programs have settled on a similar duration for the off-campus
   training experience (about 6 to 9 weeks), but there is more variation as
   to when during the trainee's education they participate in the
   internship/externship (summer after 1st year, 2nd year, etc.). Other
   factors reviewed include: (a) overall goals for the
   internship/externship; (b) type of internship/externship host
   institution (e.g., company, government lab, academic medical center);
   (c) source of housing and travel financial support for the
   internship/externship; (d) policies for ownership of intellectual
   property generated during the internship/externship; and (e) assessment
   methods used to evaluate the effectiveness of the internship/externship.}},

Abstract = {{A new prototyping planning tool guides designers in choosing between

   This new tool was tested with a pilot experiment in which engineering
   students were tasked with optimizing the design of a four-bar linkage to
   be used to draw a specific shape. The students were then instructed to
   use the new prototyping planning tool to decide whether to create a
   virtual or physical prototype of a four- bar linkage, with the goal of
   maximizing the performance metric detailed in the design problem

Abstract = {{For clear binocular vision in the brain, the neural interaction for
   accommodation and vergence is performed via inter-operation of two
   cross-links: accommodative-vergence (AV) and vergence-accommodation
   (VA). However, when people watch stereo images on stereoscopic display,
   the neural operation is interrupted due to alternations of the
   cross-link gains, which are attributed as the main reason of visual
   discomfort on stereo images in terms of Accommodation-Vergence Mismatch
   (AVM). In this paper, we present a novel visual discomfort prediction
   algorithm dubbed 3D-AVM Predictor to quantify the visual discomfort by
   including neural responses to sensory stimuli of both accommodation and
   vergence. In particular, we define the 3D local bandwidth (BW) based on
   physiological optics of binocular vision and foveation for optical
   activity of accommodation from the perspective of the VA cross-link.
   Since the 3D-AVM Predictor encompasses the anomalous motor responses of
   both accommodation and vergence, it is demonstrated that the performance
   is statistically superior to those of conventional works which rely on
   the factor of disparity distribution only.}},

   sensed information, often via peer-to-peer links. In-network aggregation
   enables efficient distributed data collection, but the goal has been
   almost exclusively collect a single aggregate value at a single sink
   node. In contrast, we design and implement a simple protocol for
   exchanging context information in aggregate in a peer-to-peer fashion,
   where every node needs to acquire a shared view of the aggregate
   context. In our protocol, when a node receives new context information
   from a neighboring node, it aggregates the new information into its
   local view of the shared state of the world which it then subsequently
   shares with its neighbors. We demonstrate (both theoretically and
   empirically) the situations in which participants' raw context
   information is fully or partially recoverable by other participants from
   an aggregate and quantify the tradeoff in communication overhead for the
   quality of shared context knowledge. Compared with non-aggregation
   communication for sharing context values among 100 nodes in a simulated
   network, we show an overhead savings of at least 78.0\%, and an overhead
   savings of 66.0\% with 99.8\% average accuracy in a 54 node emulated
   network driven by real world data.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of sensor networks, robots, autonomous vehicles and the smart
   grid have made the dependability of circuits and systems that control
   them critical to society and national defense. While significant
   advances in the design of linear and nonlinear control systems have been
   made to allow modes of operation not possible in the past, the problem
   of resilience to errors induced by hostile operating environments
   remains largely unexplored even though the probability of such errors
   occurring during real-time operation has increased. In this talk we
   propose mechanisms for detecting transient errors in control systems and
   circuitry as well as diagnosing and correcting for their effects on
   overall system operation. It is shown how real-number checksum encodings
   of circuit function can be used to detect and correct errors in the
   plant and feedback subsystems of linear control systems. Applications to
   signal processing and control algorithms are described. It is shown how
   errors in motor control electronics can be detected and corrected using
   the proposed methodology. Finally, extensions to nonlinear control
   systems are presented.}},

   the bounded confidence opinion dynamics model by incorporating

Abstract = {{We consider a generalized Voronoi partitioning problem for a team of
   vehicles with planar rigid body dynamics. The proximity metric, that is,
   the generalized metric that determines the proximity relations between
   the vehicles and arbitrary points in the configuration space,
   corresponds to the decrease of a generalized energy metric that takes
   place during the transfer of each vehicle to its goal configuration. In
   particular, the employed proximity metric is induced by a quasi-Lyapunov
   function of a corresponding stabilization problem. One of the main
   motivations for the choice of this proximity metric is to obtain a class
   of spatial partitions whose computational cost is significantly lower
   than the one of spatial partitions whose proximity metric is the
   cost-to-go function of a corresponding optimal control problem, which
   were studied in our previous work. In particular, the structure of the
   generalized proximity metric utilized in this work allows us to develop
   simple and easily implementable partitioning algorithms that are
   applicable to problems involving vehicles with nonlinear dynamics. More
   importantly, the proposed partitioning algorithms can be implemented,
   under some mild assumptions, in a decentralized fashion that allows each
   vehicle to compute its own cell independently from its teammates.
   Numerical simulations that illustrate the theoretical developments are
   also presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a unified framework to address the problem of
   optimal nonlinear analysis and feedback control for partial stability
   and partial-state stabilization. Partial asymptotic stability of the
   closed-loop nonlinear system is guaranteed by means of a Lyapunov
   function that is positive definite and decrescent with respect to part
   of the system state which can clearly be seen to be the solution to the
   steady-state form of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and hence,
   guaranteeing both partial stability and optimality. The overall
   framework provides the foundation for extending optimal linear-quadratic
   controller synthesis to nonlinear-nonquadratic optimal partial-state
   stabilization. Connections to optimal linear and nonlinear regulation
   for linear and nonlinear time-varying systems with quadratic and
   nonlinear nonquadratic cost functionals are also provided. An
   illustrative numerical example is presented to demonstrate the efficacy

Abstract = {{We address the problem of multi-level approximate logic synthesis. Our
   strategy assumes existence of an optimized exact Boolean network, which
   is critical in practice since arithmetic blocks are rarely synthesized
   from 2-level representation automatically. The goal is to produce
   minimum cost circuits whose logic function deviates in a controlled
   manner from the exact function with deviations quantified by the
   magnitude and frequency of errors.
   We rely on network simplifications allowed by external don't cares
   (EXDCs). We formulate the error-magnitude constrained problem by using
   Boolean relations to capture the allowed error behavior in a more
   general manner compared to incompletely specified functions. Our key
   contribution is in finding sets of external don't cares that maximally
   approach the Boolean relation. The algorithm starts with an EXDC set
   that is overly relaxed and iteratively, and in a greedy fashion,
   identifies a feasible EXDC set by solving a series of conventional
   EXDC-based network optimizations. The algorithm then ensures compliance
   to error frequency constraints by recovering the correct outputs on the
   sought number of error-producing inputs while aiming to minimize the
   network cost increase.
   We applied the algorithm to several well-known adder and multiplier
   designs of varying bit-width. Even for small error magnitudes, the
   algorithm produces networks with gate count reduced by 30-50\%, when the
   error frequency constraint is loose. This is up to 20\% fewer gates than
   a naive EXDC-based approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a space-time physical-layer network coding method is
   proposed in fully-connected multi-way relay networks. The proposed
   method includes two essential steps: i) side-information learning and
   ii) space-time relay transmission. In the phase of side-information
   learning, sets of users are scheduled to transmit messages over networks
   and the remaining users and relays overhear the transmitted messages to
   learn the interference patterns. In the phase of space-time relay
   transmission, multiple relays cooperatively transmit linear combinations
   of received messages in the previous phase using space-time precoding so
   that all users simultaneously harness their side-information in
   decoding. With this transmission technique, it is shown that the sum of
   degrees of freedom of the network is improved compared to existing
   interference management methods. Our key finding is that efficiently
   exploiting both transmitted and overheard messages as side-information
   brings substantial performance gains to fully-connected multi-way relay
   networks.}},

   based on game theory. The interaction between the cellular network and a
   microgrid power controller is modeled as a two-level Stackelberg game.
   On the network level, an iterative combinatorial auction mechanism is
   proposed to solve the joint power-subcarrier allocation problem. On the
   microgrid level, an adaptive pricing mechanism is adopted for the power
   controller to balance between the transmission demand and the energy
   supply. Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation
   mechanism achieves a significant improvement in the network
   sustainability and throughput when compared with the conventional

Abstract = {{This paper studies the haplotype assembly problem from an
   information-theoretic perspective. A haplotype is a sequence of
   nucleotide bases on a chromosome, often conveniently represented by a
   binary string, that differ from the bases in the corresponding positions
   on the other chromosome in a homologous pair. Information about the
   order of bases in a genome is readily inferred using short reads
   provided by high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies. Associating
   reads that cover variant positions with specific chromosomes in a
   homologous pairs, which enables haplotype assembly, is challenging due
   to limited lengths of the reads and presence of sequencing errors. In
   this paper, the recovery of the target pair of haplotype sequences using
   short reads is rephrased as a joint source-channel coding problem. Two
   messages, representing haplotypes and chromosome memberships of reads,
   are encoded and transmitted over a channel with erasures and errors,
   where the channel model reflects salient features of high-throughput
   sequencing. The focus of this paper is on determining the required
   number of reads for reliable haplotype reconstruction, and both the
   necessary and sufficient conditions are presented with orderwise optimal
   bounds.}},

Abstract = {{The tremendous growth of video content over the Internet and evolution
   towards more personalized video applications has led to a need for a
   network and service infrastructure better suited to today's content and
   mobility needs. Quality of Experience (QoE) management is one of the
   major challenges for video delivery given the limited bandwidth for
   wireless access network causing video packet drops and the core network
   congestion impacting video service delay. In this context, the current
   TCP-based model used for HTTP streaming presents challenges due to
   throughput variation and high latency. We present a context-adaptive
   cross-layer optimization approach to enhance video streaming over TCP
   that introduces network and content awareness in TCP operation to
   provide adaptive reliability and smoother throughput. Our proposed
   solution requires implementation changes only on the receiver side
   without impacting the TCP sender implementation. We validated the
   proposed solution through OPNET simulations and the results show some
   significant performance gains in both TCP throughput and video QoE
   metrics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper characterizes the performance of coordinated beamforming with
   dynamic clustering. A downlink cellular model based on stochastic
   geometry is put forth to analyze the performance of such base station
   (BS) coordination strategy. Analytical expressions for the complementary
   cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the instantaneous
   signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) are derived in terms of relevant
   system parameters, chiefly the number of coordinated BSs, the number of
   antennas, and the path-loss exponent. Utilizing this CCDF, with pilot
   overheads further incorporated into the analysis, we formulate the
   computation of the number of coordinated BSs that maximizes the spectral
   efficiency for a given fading coherence. The results make precise the
   intuition that the slower the fading, the more beneficial the
   coordination. Simulation results verify the exactness of the SIR
   distribution derived for stochastic geometries, which is further
   compared with the corresponding distribution for a deterministic grid

Abstract = {{Index coding, initially introduced within theoretical computer science
   to address a specialized class of problems, has gained significant
   interest within communications and networking communities in recent
   years. Index coding has been shown to be analogous to a large class of
   challenging wired network coding and wireless multi-terminal problems,
   the latter class being of primary interest in this paper. Here, a
   (relaxed) rank minimization based analytic framework is presented for
   wireless index coding, which represents a first step in a systematic
   algorithmic approach to index coding for practical use. Further, the
   paper demonstrates its applicability over a real-world wireless testbed.
   The scheme operates at the network layer, and can be understood as a
   (non-trivial) generalization of existing principles of random linear
   network coding. Experimental results demonstrate that, for a class of
   network topologies, the rank-minimized index coding system presents a
   throughput gain of 50 to 100 percent greater than random linear coding
   for this system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic method for experimental
   characterization of Bowden cable friction. A novel tension measurement
   method using a motion capture system and a spring is introduced. With
   the tension measurement method, the effects of nine variables on
   friction are investigated. Experimental results show that i) a
   combination of 7x19 FEP-coated stainless steel cable and double-sheaths
   has the highest force transmission efficiency; ii) smaller coefficient
   of friction material, smaller cable moving speed, shorter cable length,
   longer clamp distance, stiffer cable/sheath all help to increase the
   force transmission efficiency; and iii) the static friction pretension
   ratio only decreases as the coefficient of friction of cable/sheath
   decreases or as cable/sheath stiffness increases. We have generated
   guidelines for the Bowden cable performance which may help robotics
   researchers in choosing materials for the Bowden cables and designing
   control systems for actuation.}},

   that the singularities in the fingers are avoided, and distal joint
   stiffness is added in the thumb for full controllability. We then
   present a higher-level object stiffness control law for explicit control

Abstract = {{Constant power loads may form a major proportion of the system loads in
   automotive power systems. Without proper control the presence of
   constant power loads in a multi-converter environment can cause system
   instability. In this paper, the concept of autonomous control of a dc
   microgrid is extended to automotive power systems. An autonomous control
   law is derived for an automotive power system which consists of system
   of parallel connected boost converters supplying a constant power load.
   The control law derived using the passivity based approach consists of
   two stages. The first, primary stage involves a non-linear droop of the
   microgrid voltage with respect to the current supplied by each of the
   converters thereby enabling current sharing. The primary controller also
   damps the oscillations in the dc microgrid caused by the presence of the
   constant power load. The secondary controller adjusts for the voltage
   deviations due to the primary controller without affecting the current
   sharing. The conditions to ensure the asymptotic stability of the
   equilibrium points are derived. Experimental results are presented to
   verify the proposed control law.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, hydrogen production from water is demonstrated via a
   p-type silicon photocathode with a thin epitaxial strontium titanate,
   SrTiO3 (STO), as capping layer by molecular beam epitaxy. The advantages
   of using STO are the ideal conduction band alignment and perfect lattice
   match between single crystalline SrTiO3 and Si, so the photogenerated
   electrons can transport through the capping layer with a reduced
   recombination rate. The STO/p-Si photocathode exhibited a maximum
   photocurrent density and open circuit potential of 35 mA/cm(2) and 450
   mV, respectively. There was no observable decrease in performance after
   10 hr operation in 0.5M H2SO4. We found the efficiency and performance
   were highly dependent on the size and spacing of the structured metal
   catalyst. Scaled down the metal catalysts feature size into nanometer
   region can greatly improve the efficiency. In addition, samples with
   graphene (Grahene/p-Si) as the lateral transport channel and capping
   layer shown an enhanced fill factor compared with that of STO/p-Si.}},

   sparsity information to acheive sub-optimal computational complexity
   over traditional radix-2 FFT. Using the sparsity information, a map of

   derived. Then the second part of the algorithm traverses this map and

   work of OFDMA baseband. This algorithm is well suited for hardware
   efficient in-place FFT computations and especially for large size FFTs.

Abstract = {{Performance of modern day computer systems greatly depends on the wide
   range of workloads, which run on the systems. Thus, a representative set
   of workloads, representing the different classes of real-world
   applications, need to be used by computer designers and researchers for
   processor design-space evaluation studies. While a number of different
   benchmark suites are available, a few common benchmark suites like the
   SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks are widely used by researchers either due to
   ease of setup, or simulation time constraints etc. However, as the
   popular benchmarks such as SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks do not capture the
   characteristics of the wide variety of emerging real-world applications,
   using them as the basis for performance evaluation may lead to either
   suboptimal designs or misleading results. In this paper, we characterize
   the behavior of the data analytics workloads, an important class of
   emerging applications, and perform a systematic similarity analysis with
   the popular SPEC CPU2006 \& SPECjbb2013 benchmarks suites. To
   characterize the workloads, we use hardware performance counter based
   measurements and a variety of extracted micro-architecture independent
   workload characteristics. Then, we use statistical data analysis
   techniques, namely principal component analysis and clustering
   techniques, to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity among these
   different classes of applications. In this paper, we demonstrate the
   inherent differences between the characteristics of the different
   classes of applications and how to arrive at meaningful subsets of
   benchmarks, which will help in faster and more accurate targeted early
   hardware system performance evaluation.}},

   The computation cost is even more pronounced in software-based self

   model for estimating stuck-at fault coverage. This model is built based
   on partial fault simulation along with a statistical metric, which is
   calculated by a single pass of fault-free simulation. Our results on
   ISCAS'85, ISCAS'89, and the OR1200 processor show that by only fault
   simulating 7.6\% of the test vectors, on average, over 94\% of the fault

Abstract = {{Scan feedforward techniques are proposed for improving test compression
   for both sequential linear decompressors based on solving linear
   equations and for broadcast scan based decompressors in which the
   decompressor constraints are included in the automatic test pattern
   generation (ATPG) backtrace. The conventional approach is to first
   pre-load a sequential linear decompressor with free variables from the
   tester for some number of clock cycles before beginning to shift the
   scan chain. A scan feedforward scheme is proposed here which can shorten
   or eliminate the need for pre-loading the decompressor. More
   importantly, even if the pre-load phase is not changed, the proposed
   scheme significantly expands the free-variable dependence of each scan
   cell, which increases the probability of encoding a test cube. This
   permits more faults to be targeted by each test cube generated during
   ATPG (i.e., improved dynamic compaction) thereby leading to fewer test
   cubes for the same fault coverage. For broadcast scan based schemes, a
   methodology is presented for using both feedforward and feedback in the
   scan chains to increase encoding flexibility. The proposed scheme is
   effective even when narrow TAMs (even 1-bit TAMs) are feeding the
   decompressor. There is no need to pre-load pipeline flip-flops as is
   conventionally required in existing solutions thereby reducing test time
   and improving compression. Experimental results are presented
   demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Identity theft, fraud, and abuse are problems affecting all market
   sectors in society. Identity theft is often a gateway crime, as
   criminals use stolen or fraudulent identities to steal money, claim
   eligibility for services, hack into networks without authorization, and
   so on. The available data describing identity crimes and their aftermath
   is often in the form of recorded stories and reports by the news press,
   fraud examiners, and law enforcement. All of these sources are
   unstructured. Hence, in order to analyze identity theft data, this
   research proposes an approach which involves the collection of online
   news stories and reports on the topic of identity theft. Our approach
   preprocesses the raw text and extracts semi-structured information
   automatically, using text mining techniques. This paper presents
   statistical analysis of behavioral patterns and resources used by
   thieves and fraudsters to commit identity theft, including the identity
   attributes commonly linked to identity crimes, resources thieves employ
   to conduct identity crimes, and temporal patterns of criminal behavior.
   Analyses of these results increase empirical understanding of identity
   threat behaviors, offer early warning signs of identity theft, and
   thwart future identity theft crimes.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative analysis of effects of electric vehicle (EV) charging on
   primary and secondary circuit voltages is presented in this work. The EV
   charging effects are evaluated for increase in EV load penetration and
   EV load clustering. The voltage analysis is carried out using a 13.8-kV
   distribution feeder dominated by residential loads. The study reveals
   that EV charging affects the secondary voltages more significantly than
   the primary voltages. The percentage voltage drop recorded at the
   primary wire increases with the increase in EV load penetration. As
   expected due to the additional voltage drops in the secondary wires, the
   secondary circuit records even higher voltage drops. EV load clustering
   leads to an imbalance in the primary wire voltages. This causes
   significant voltage drops in a few secondary services while other record
   an increase in the voltage.}},

Abstract = {{An unconventional acoustic sensor is presented with audio and ultrasound
   applications. The structure is a synthesis of capacitive micromachined
   ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) technology and biologically inspired
   microphones which use rotational or rocking modes of vibration to
   directly sense acoustic pressure gradient. A pivoting beam structure is
   sealed under vacuum, and the top surface of the beam is driven into
   motion by external pressure gradients. Vvacuum sealing eliminates the
   introduction of excessive damping, stiffness, and thermal mechanical
   noise into the system. Motion of the beam is transduced capacitively at
   each end of the beam using gap-closing parallel plate electrodes.
   Surface-micromachined prototypes are presented that are 470 mu m x 718
   mu m in size and exhibit a fundamental rocking resonance at 480 kHz, and
   a second flapping mode at 630 kHz, for which both ends of the beam
   vibrate in phase.}},

Abstract = {{Robotic grasping of a target object without advance knowledge of its
   three-dimensional model is a challenging problem. Many studies indicate
   that robot learning from demonstration (LfD) is a promising way to
   improve grasping performance, but complete automation of the grasping
   task in unforeseen circumstances remains difficult. As an alternative to
   LfD, this paper leverages limited human supervision to achieve robotic
   grasping of unknown objects in unforeseen circumstances. The technical
   question is what form of human supervision best minimizes the effort of
   the human supervisor. The approach here applies a human-supplied
   bounding box to focus the robot's visual processing on the target
   object, thereby lessening the dimensionality of the robot's computer
   vision processing. After the human supervisor defines the bounding box
   through the man-machine interface, the rest of the grasping task is
   automated through a vision-based feature-extraction approach where the
   dexterous hand learns to grasp objects without relying on pre-computed
   object models through the NEAT neuroevolution algorithm. Given only
   low-level sensing data from a commercial depth sensor Kinect, our
   approach evolves neural networks to identify appropriate hand positions
   and orientations for grasping novel objects. Further, the machine
   learning results from simulation have been validated by transferring the
   training results to a physical robot called Dreamer made by the Meka
   Robotics company. The results demonstrate that grasping novel objects
   through exploiting neuroevolution from simulation to reality is
   possible.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the influence of 3 dimensional (3D) base station
   (BS) antenna patterns on the of downlink random heterogeneous cellular
   networks. To assess the impact of downtilt and vertical beamwidth, we
   propose a mathematical framework based on stochastic geometry (to model
   BS locations) and random shape theory (to model building geometry).
   Using this framework, we study the impact of different. antenna
   parameters at the pico cell on the coverage and area spectral efficiency
   of the network. Through simulations we find that narrowing the vertical
   beamwidth of the pico cell must. be accompanied by downtilt to result in
   improved coverage and capacity. We also find that high building density
   leads to improved network performance, motivating the deployment of
   heterogeneous networks in dense urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{The degrees of freedom (DoF) of multiantenna interfering broadcast
   channels is studied in which the first base station (BS) with M-1
   antennas wishes to send independent messages to its N-1 serving users
   and the second BS with M-2 antennas wishes to send independent messages
   to its N-2 serving users. Each user is assumed to be equipped with a
   single antenna. For max(M-1, M-2) <= min(N-1, N-2), the sum DoF is shown
   to be upper bounded by N-1(M1N2-M1M2)+ N-2(M2N1-M1M2)/N1N2-M1M2 and
   lower bounded by N1N2(M-1+M-2)/max(M1N2, M2N1)+N1N2. The results
   characterize the optimal sum DoF if M1N2 = M2N1 and further characterize
   the asymptotically optimal sum DoF when both N-1 and N-2 tend to
   infinity. Specifically, the optimal sum DoF converges to M-1+ M-2 as N-1
   and N-2 tend to infinity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces iProperty, a novel approach that facilitates
   incremental checking of programs based on a property differencing
   technique. Specifically, iProperty aims to reduce the cost of checking
   properties as they are initially developed and as they co-evolve with
   the program. The key novelty of iProperty is to compute the differences
   between the new and old versions of expected properties to reduce the
   number and size of the properties that need to be checked during the
   initial development of the properties. Furthermore, property
   differencing is used in synergy with program behavior differencing
   techniques to optimize common regression scenarios, such as detecting
   regression errors or checking feature additions for conformance to new
   expected properties. Experimental results in the context of symbolic
   execution of Java programs annotated with properties written as
   assertions show the effectiveness of iProperty in utilizing change
   information to enable more efficient checking.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial laser sintering (LS) machines have been used for years in a
   variety of rapid prototyping applications. Emphasis in the LS research
   community has moved towards rapid manufacturing: the creation of
   engineered structural components. However, the mechanical properties of
   LS parts are often inconsistent compared to their molded counterparts.
   This is due to a variety of factors including feedstock uniformity,
   microstructure evolution due to LS processing, and the overall ability
   of commercial LS machines to reliably form structural parts without
   thermal degradation of the feedstock powder. This paper will review the
   current state of the art of commercial LS machines, and discuss the
   resulting implications for rapid manufacturing. Particular focus will be
   paid to the role of part bed temperature variations due to non-uniform
   heating, unsteady cooling due to natural convection currents in the part
   chamber, and how these and other phenomena may impact the design of
   laser control systems. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Preferential injection into high permeability thief zones or fractures
   can result in early breakthrough at production wells and large unswept
   areas of high oil saturation, which impact the economic life of a well.
   A variety of conformance control techniques, including polymer and
   silica gel treatments, have been designed to block flow through the
   swept zones. Over a certain range of salinities, silica nanoparticle
   suspensions form a gel in bulk phase behavior tests. These gels have
   potential for in situ flow diversion, but in situ flow tests are
   required to determine their applicability. To determine the appropriate
   scope of the in situ tests, it is necessary to obtain an accurate
   description of nanoparticle phase behavior and gel rheology. In this
   paper, the equilibrium phase behavior of silica nanoparticle solutions
   in the presence of sodium chloride (NaCl) is presented with four phase
   regions classified as a function of salinity and nanoparticle
   concentration. Once the gelation window was clearly defined, rheology
   experiments of silica nanoparticle gels were also carried out. Gelation
   time decreases exponentially as a function of silica concentration,
   salinity, and temperature. Following a power law behavior, the storage
   modulus, G', increases with particle concentration. Steady shear
   measurements show that silica nanoparticle gels exhibit non-Newtonian,
   shear thinning behavior. This comprehensive study of the silica
   nanoparticle gels has provided a clear path forward for in situ tests to
   determine the gel's applicability for conformance control operations.}},

Abstract = {{The stress field in and around bulges in cylindrical and oval pressure
   vessels is examined using linear elastic finite element models. The
   effects of bulge size and shape on axial and hoop stresses are examined
   under internal pressure loading. Stress components at the center of the
   bulge, in the entire bulge, and in the vessel outside the bulge are
   analyzed both on the inside and outside surfaces of the vessel wall. In
   addition, the effects of vessel ovality (out-of-roundness) and the
   location of a bulge relative to ovality on these stress components are
   studied. This study provides engineers with a detailed look at bulging
   induced stresses and the limitations of stress-based fitness-for-service
   assessment of bulges in pressure vessels such as refinery coke drums.}},

Abstract = {{The classic F and G Taylor series of Keplerian motion are extended to
   solve the Stark problem and to use the generalized Sundman
   transformation. Exact recursion formulas for the series coefficients are
   derived, and the method is implemented to high order via a symbolic
   manipulator. The results lead to fast and accurate propagation models
   with efficient discretizations. The new F and G Stark series solutions
   are compared to the Modern Taylor Series (MTS) and 8th order
   Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF8) solutions. In terms of runtime, the F and G
   approach is shown to compare favorably to the MTS method up to order 18,
   and both Taylor series methods enjoy approximate order of magnitude
   speedups compared to RKF8 implementations. Actual runtime is shown to
   vary with eccentricity, perturbation size, prescribed accuracy, and the
   Sundman power law. The effects of the generalized Sundman transformation
   on the accuracy of the propagation are analyzed, and the results are
   valid for both the Stark and Kepler problems. The Taylor series
   solutions are shown to be exceptionally efficient when the unity power
   law from the classic Sundman transformation is applied. An example
   low-thrust trajectory propagation demonstrates the utility of the F and
   G Stark series solutions.}},

Abstract = {{A new universal variable is introduced to improve solution performance
   for the multiple revolution Lambert problem. The formulation, motivated
   by the approach of Bate, Mueller and White, is based on the cosine of
   the change in eccentric anomaly and uses a new geometry parameter to
   simplify the the universal time of flight equation and the associated
   partial derivatives. Judicious initial guesses and a second order
   correction step lead to rapid root solving and a reduction in the number
   of minimization calls typically required to bound the multiple
   revolution case. The proposed method is demonstrated to be statistically
   as accurate as the Gooding method, while achieving 40-60\% reductions in

Abstract = {{Adaptive control schemes for spacecraft attitude tracking are abundant
   in controls literature. However, very few are designed to guarantee
   consistent performance for a spacecraft with both rigid and non-rigid
   (time-varying) inertia components. Since inertia matrix changes are a
   common occurrence due to phenomena like fuel depletion or mass
   displacement in a deployable spacecraft, an adaptive control algorithm
   that takes explicit account of such information is of significant
   interest. In the present investigation, a certainty-equivalence based
   adaptive control scheme is proposed for the attitude control of a
   spacecraft characterized by a time-varying inertia matrix with known
   time-variation but unknown bounds. A smooth-projection scheme is
   implemented to ensure that parameter estimates stay bounded within a
   convex set. The variable inertia components may have time and/or state
   dependencies, or may be purely input dependent. Detailed derivations of
   the control law are provided along with a thorough analysis for the
   associated stability and error convergence properties. In addition,
   numerical simulations are presented for a spacecraft experiencing fuel
   depletion to highlight the performance benefits when compared with an
   adaptive control scheme that does not account for inertia variations.}},

Abstract = {{Coordinated control of multiple autonomous spacecraft and unmanned air
   vehicles (UAVs) have many potential applications, including space-based
   interferometry, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, as well as
   distributed sensor networks. Many of these applications are feasible
   only through decentralized formations that employ cooperative control
   protocols. Among these, rotating formations are of significant interest
   for aerospace engineering applications. While various results are
   available for circular planar formations, few results exist for
   three-dimensional formations. In this paper, we focus on collective 3D
   motions where agents, governed by double-integrator dynamics, converge
   on a common plane in desired circular orbits. Specifically, we propose a
   decentralized, globally stabilizing control protocol with inter-agent
   communication described by a connected, undirected acyclic graph.
   Analytical closed-loop solutions are derived to show exponential
   convergence of the vehicles to circular orbits of prescribed radius,
   while Lyapunov-like stability analysis is used to show asymptotic
   convergence to a common plane. Finally, numerical simulations are used
   to validate the theoretical results.}},

   trajectory to reach a near-Earth asteroid in a fuel-optimal sense with
   emphasis on manned-mission risk reduction. The trajectory is designed
   such that the departing vehicle will return to Earth with no extra
   maneuvers, and incorporates a lunar flyby on the outbound segment to
   reduce fuel cost. The nominal mission departs the free-return trajectory
   to rendezvous with the asteroid for a minimum period of time before
   returning to Earth. The optimization scheme incorporates a full
   ephemeris model and analytical gradients for accurate convergence. The
   method is useful for fuel cost reduction of interplanetary trajectories

   rendezvous with asteroid 2000 SG344 that departs Earth on 30 March 2028
   and returns from the nominal mission on 24 March 2029 for a total

Abstract = {{Current treatment options for ischemia include percutaneous
   interventions, surgical bypass or pharmacological interventions aimed at
   slowing the progression of vascular disease. Unfortunately, while each
   of these treatment modalities provides some benefit for patients in the
   short-term, many patients have resistant or recurrent disease that is
   poorly managed by these therapies. A highly appealing strategy for
   treating ischemic disease is to stimulate the revascularization of the
   tissue to restore blood flow. While many techniques have been explored
   in this regard, clinically effective angiogenic therapies remain
   elusive. Here, we hypothesized that the presence of co-morbid disease
   states inherently alters the ability of the body to respond to
   angiogenic therapies. Using a mouse model of diabetes and obesity, we
   examined alterations in the major components for the signaling pathways
   for FGF-2, VEGF-A and PDGF under normal and high fat dietary conditions.
   In skeletal muscle, a high fat diet increased levels of growth factor
   receptors and co-receptors including syndecan-1, syndecan-4 and
   PDGFR-alpha in wild-type mice. These increases did not occur in Ob/Ob
   mice on a high fat diet and there was a significant decrease in protein
   levels for neuropilin-1 and heparanase in these mice. With the aim of
   increasing growth factor effectiveness in the context of disease, we
   examined whether local treatment with alginate gel-delivered FGF-2 and
   syndecan-4 proteoliposomes could overcome the growth factor resistance
   in these mice. This treatment enhanced the formation of new blood
   vessels in Ob/Ob mice by 6 fold in comparison to FGF-2 delivered alone.
   Our studies support that disease states cause a profound shift in growth
   factor signaling pathways and that co-receptor-based therapies have
   potential to overcome growth factor resistance in the context of
   disease. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose two real-time motion smoothing algorithms for video
   stabilization using a pure 3D rotation motion model with known camera
   projection parameters. Both proposed algorithms aim at smoothing 3D
   rotation matrix sequences in a causal way. The first algorithm smooths
   the 3D rotation sequences in a way similar to 1st-order IIR filtering.
   The second algorithm uses sequential probabilistic estimation under a
   constant angular velocity model. These two algorithms are generalized
   from classical 2D motion smoothing algorithms. We exploit the manifold
   structure of the rotation matrices so that the proposed algorithms
   directly smooth the 3D rotation sequences on the manifold. In addition,
   we introduce a simple projection step in order to guarantee that no
   black borders intrude into the stabilized video frames. Experimental
   results show that the proposed algorithms are able to effectively
   stabilize video sequences and outperform their 2D counterparts with less
   jitter and distortion.}},

   improve its performance, two new approaches are proposed here. For the
   first proposed approach, a novel method to find a square root bit for
   every iteration, which hides the total delay of the multiplexer with
   dual path calculation is presented. Secondly, a new method uses the
   modified Most Significant Carry (MSC) generator, which determines the
   sign of each remainder faster than a carry lookahead adder, which
   reduces the total delay.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a series of human subjective studies where we found that
   the visibility of flicker distortions on naturalistic videos is strongly
   reduced when the speed of coherent object motion is large. Based on

   The model predicts target-related activation levels in the excitatory
   layer of neurons for a video using spatiotemporal backward masking. The
   target-related activation level is then shifted and scaled according to
   video quality level changes that cause flicker distortions. Finally,
   flicker visibility is predicted based on neural flicker adaptation
   processes. Results show that the predicted flicker visibility using the
   model correlates well with human perception of flicker distorations on
   naturalistic videos.}},

Abstract = {{Stroke has significant impact on dynamic balance during locomotion, with
   a 73\% incidence rate for falls post-stroke. Current clinical
   assessments often rely on tasks and/or questionnaires that relate to the
   statistical probability of falls and provide little insight into the
   mechanisms that impair dynamic balance. Current quantitative measures
   that assess medial-lateral balance performance do not consider the
   angular motion of the body, which can be particularly impaired after
   stroke. Current control methods in bipedal robotics rely on the
   regulation of angular momentum (H) to maintain dynamic balance during
   locomotion. This study tests whether frontal-plane H is significantly
   correlated to clinical balance tests that could be used to provide a
   detailed assessment of medial-lateral balance impairments in hemiparetic
   gait. H was measured in post-stroke (n = 48) and control (n = 20)
   subjects. Post-stroke there were significant negative relationships
   between the change in frontal-plane H during paretic single-leg stance
   and two clinical tests: the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) (r = -0.57, p <
   0.001) and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) (r = -0.54, p < 0.001). Control
   subjects showed timely regulation of frontal-plane H during the first
   half of single-leg stance, with the level of regulation depending on the
   initial magnitude. In contrast, the post-stroke subjects who made poorer
   adjustments to frontal-plane H during initial paretic leg single stance
   exhibited lower DGI and BBS scores (r = 0.45, p = 0.003). We conclude
   that H is a promising balance indicator during steady-state hemiparetic
   walking and that paretic single-leg stance is a period with higher
   instability for stroke patients. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The second-order-generalized-integrator frequency-locked loop (SOGI-FLL)
   is typically employed to synchronize with the grid in the single-phase
   grid-connected converter. The SOGI creates two orthogonal signals from
   an input grid voltage, and estimates the magnitude while the frequency
   locked-loop identifies the grid frequency. If there is a DC component in
   the grid voltage due to the measurement process, it degrades the
   accuracy of SOGI-FLL estimates. The SOGI-FLL, therefore, cannot identify
   accurate information of the grid voltage. This paper introduces an
   improved control method for the SOGI-FLL when the grid contains a DC
   component. The value of the DC component voltage is estimated online and
   totally removed from the frequency control loop. The controller, thus,
   responses faster and more precisely detects both the magnitude and
   frequency of the input voltage. Simulation results are presented to
   verify the theoretical analyses.}},

   Application}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{537-557}},
Abstract = {{A number of impedance-based fault location algorithms have been
   developed for estimating the distance to faults in a transmission
   network. Each algorithm has specific input data requirements and makes
   certain assumptions that may or may not hold true in a particular fault
   location scenario. Without a detailed understanding of the principle of
   each fault-locating method, choosing the most suitable fault location
   algorithm can be a challenging task. This paper, therefore, presents the
   theory of one-ended (simple reactance, Takagi, modified Takagi,
   Eriksson, and Novosel et al.) and two-ended (synchronized,
   unsynchronized, and current-only) impedance-based fault location
   algorithms and demonstrates their application in locating real-world
   faults. The theory details the formulation and input data requirement of
   each fault-locating algorithm and evaluates the sensitivity of each to
   the following error sources: 1) load; 2) remote infeed; 3) fault
   resistance; 4) mutual coupling; 5) inaccurate line impedances; 6) DC
   offset and CT saturation; 7) three-terminal lines; and 8) tapped radial
   lines. From the theoretical analysis and field data testing, the
   following criteria are recommended for choosing the most suitable
   fault-locating algorithm: 1) data availability and 2) fault location
   application scenario. Another objective of this paper is to assess what
   additional information can be gleaned from waveforms recorded by
   intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) during a fault. Actual fault event
   data captured in utility networks is exploited to gain valuable feedback
   about the transmission network upstream from the IED device, and
   estimate the value of fault resistance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method to control the density distribution of a
   large number of autonomous agents. Our approach leverages from the fact
   that there are a large number of agents in the system, and hence the
   time evolution of the probabilistic density distribution of agents can
   be described as a Markov chain. Once this description is obtained, a
   Markov chain matrix is synthesized to drive the multi-agent system
   density to a desired steady-state density distribution, in a
   probabilistic sense, while satisfying some motion and conflict avoidance
   constraints. Later, we introduce an adaptive density control method
   based on real time density feedback to synthesize a time-varying Markov
   matrix, which leads to better convergence to the desired density
   distribution. This paper also introduces a decentralized density
   computation method, which guarantees that all agents will have a best,
   and common, density estimate in a finite, with an explicit bound, number
   of communication updates.}},

Abstract = {{Even as the use of sensor networks to support mobile applications grows,
   our ability to seamlessly and efficiently incorporate sensor network
   capabilities into our mobile applications remains astoundingly
   difficult. Today, accessing remote sensing data and integrating this
   data into the adaptive behavior of a dynamic user-facing mobile
   application requires interacting with multiple platforms, languages,
   data formats, and communication paradigms. We present Brace Force, an
   open and extensible middleware that allows developers to access the
   myriad remote sensing capabilities inherent to today's mobile computing
   spaces (where mobile devices and sensors are closely integrated) using
   very minimal code. Further, BraceForce incorporates event- and
   model-driven data acquisition as first-class concepts to provide
   efficient access to sensing while retaining expressiveness and
   flexibility for applications. We present the BraceForce architecture and
   key abstractions, describe their implementations, and provide an
   empirical study using BraceForce to support mobile applications
   integrating sensing.}},

Abstract = {{In manufacturing process planning, it is critical to ensure that the
   part generated from a process plan complies with tolerances specified by
   designers to meet engineering constraints. Manufacturing errors are
   stochastic in nature and are introduced at almost every stage of
   executing a plan, for example due to inaccuracy of tooling, misalignment
   of location, distortion of clamping etc. Furthermore, these errors
   accumulate or `stack-up' as the manufacturing process progresses to
   inevitably produce a part that varies from the designed model. The
   resultant variation should be within prescribed design tolerances. In
   this work, we present a novel approach for validating process plans
   using 3D tolerance stack-up analysis by representing variations of
   nominal features in terms of extents of their degrees of freedom within
   design and manufacturing tolerance zones. We will show how the
   manufacturing error stack-up can be effectively represented by
   composition and intersection of these transformations. We demonstrate
   several examples with different tolerance specifications to show the
   applicability of our approach for process planning.}},

Abstract = {{A set-based approach is presented for solving multi-scale or multi-level
   design problems. The approach incorporates Bayesian network classifiers
   (BNC) for mapping design spaces at each level and flexibility metrics
   for intelligently narrowing the design space as the design process
   progresses. The approach is applied to a hierarchical composite
   materials design problem, specifically, the design of composite
   materials with macroscopic mechanical stiffness and loss properties
   surpassing those of conventional composites. This macroscopic
   performance is achieved by embedding small volume fractions of negative
   stiffness (NS) inclusions in a host material. To design these materials,
   the set-based, multilevel design approach is coupled with a hierarchical
   modeling strategy that spans several scales, from the behavior of
   microscale NS inclusions to the effective properties of a composite
   material containing those inclusions and finally to the macroscopic
   performance of components. The approach is shown to increase the
   efficiency of multi-level design space exploration, and it is
   particularly appropriate for top-down, performance-driven design, as
   opposed to bottom-up, trial and-error modeling. The design space
   mappings also build intuitive knowledge of the problem and promising
   regions of the design space, such that it is almost trivial to identify
   designs that yield preferred system-level performance.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation is considered a key to competitiveness of the nation. In
   order to ensure that graduating students are equipped with innovation
   skills to meet this challenge, we must ensure that engineering curricula
   are enhancing students' innovation capabilities. In this paper we
   investigate if the undergraduate engineering curriculum can have a
   significant positive effect on students' innovation capabilities. In
   addition, we investigate if individual difference factors, such as
   engineering design self efficacy and self-reported GPA, can be
   correlated with innovation capabilities. To test this, we assessed
   students' solutions to specific open ended problems for their level of
   innovation, or more specifically, originality and technical feasibility.
   The experiments were replicated at two universities and with a variety
   of cohorts, including freshman students before and after an introductory
   engineering course and senior mechanical engineering students before and
   after a capstone course. We found that that students' innovation
   capabilities were enhanced by the senior-level capstone course at both
   universities. Similar positive results can be found for the overall four
   year curriculum at both schools. While individual differences in
   academic performance and engineering design self-efficacy did not
   predict seniors' performance, these individual difference factors did
   interact to influence originality in the freshmen students. At high
   levels of GPA, increased self efficacy led to increased originality, but
   at low levels of GPA, increased self-efficacy led to lower originality
   scores. Results are discussed in relation to prior research and
   suggestions are made to track freshmen students to better train future
   engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Descriptions of a product's usage context are easily understood and
   often provide useful information for reducing energy consumption of
   products. Such descriptions help inspire concept generation, explore
   operational issues, and evaluate prototypes. Nevertheless,
   characterizing the usage context as a concise but comprehensive set of
   factors is not a trivial task. This paper presents a taxonomy and method
   for characterizing the usage context and its various scenarios as sets
   of factors relevant to energy consumption. The taxonomy defines a
   general usage context as a set of human, product and situational factors
   that can be specified individually to create unique scenarios. The
   method for identifying relevant factors is grounded by first assessing
   variables in the fundamental physical equations that govern product
   operation. Then, activity diagrams reveal the elements influencing user
   habits and procedures. The method is demonstrated through the example of
   an automobile and the results are compared with existing automobile
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Customer Needs Analysis (CNA) is a common method used to help non-user
   designers to identify latent user needs. However, efforts by engineers
   in developed countries to conduct CNA with lead users from developing
   countries is complicated by differences in culture, geographical
   location, and language among participants. To overcome these issues, we
   present in this paper an alternative strategy to create Empathic Lead
   Users (ELU) from non-user product design engineers through the use of
   simulated lead user experiences.
   The strategy for creating ELU includes two exercises to build empathic
   understanding of the needs of lead users. The problem selected for this
   case study was to improve lower-limb prosthetics for amputees in
   developing countries. The first exercise was an academic, lecture-style
   training session based on videos, photos, and literature to build
   understanding of the needs of amputees worldwide and in a particular
   developing country, Bolivia. The second exercise simulated the
   experiences of lead users by allowing participants to don, ambulate, and
   doff a mock-prosthetic limb. Each participant was interviewed before,
   between, and after the experiences and customer needs were interpreted
   from their responses. For comparison, lead users in Bolivia and typical
   users in the United States were similarly interviewed and customer needs
   interpreted from their responses.
   The ELU participants were able to identify a majority of the lead user
   group's needs and the traditional user group's needs, 95\% and 95\%
   respectively. Further, by completing a CNA with the ELU group, there was
   a 100\% increase in the number of latent needs that could be utilized in
   future design efforts in this study, relative to the 5 latent needs
   identified by the lead users themselves. As a result of this study, it
   appears that customer needs analysis with ELU helps to identify more
   latent needs, and possibly more avenues for product innovations, than
   interviewing lead or traditional users alone.}},

Abstract = {{Many sparse matrix computations can be speeded up if the matrix is first
   reordered. Reordering was originally developed for direct methods but it
   has recently become popular for improving the cache locality of parallel
   iterative solvers since reordering the matrix to reduce bandwidth and
   wavefront can improve the locality of reference of sparse matrix-vector
   multiplication (SpMV), the key kernel in iterative solvers.
   In this paper, we present the first parallel implementations of two
   widely used reordering algorithms: Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) and
   Sloan. On 16 cores of the Stampede supercomputer, our parallel RCM is
   5.56 times faster on the average than a state-of-the-art sequential
   implementation of RCM in the HSL library. Sloan is significantly more
   constrained than RCM, but our parallel implementation achieves a speedup
   of 2.88X on the average over sequential HSL-Sloan. Reordering the matrix
   using our parallel RCM and then performing 100 SpMV iterations is twice
   as fast as using HSL-RCM and then performing the SpMV iterations; it is
   also 1.5 times faster than performing the SpMV iterations without
   reordering the matrix.}},

Abstract = {{We present and analyze an infinite dimensional Bayesian inference
   formulation, and its numerical approximation, for the inverse problem of
   inferring the shape of an obstacle from scattered acoustic waves. Given
   a Gaussian prior measure on the shape space, whose covariance operator
   is the inverse of the Laplacian, the Bayesian solution of the inverse
   problem is the posterior measure given by the Radon-Nikodym derivative
   with respect to the Gaussian prior measure. The well-posedness of the
   Bayesian formulation in infinite dimensions is proved, including the
   justification of the Radon-Nikodym derivative and the continuous
   dependence of the posterior measure on the observation data via the
   Hellinger distance. The proof is made possible by a suitable shape
   parametrization in a Banach space setting and the regularity of the
   forward solution with respect to the smoothness of the shape. This also
   facilitates proving the Lipschitz continuity of the observation operator
   with respect to the scatterer shape via the shape derivative of the
   forward solution. Next, a finite dimensional approximation to the
   Bayesian posterior is proposed and the corresponding approximation error
   is quantified. The approximation strategy involves a Nystrom scheme for
   approximating a boundary integral formulation of the forward Helmholtz
   problem and a Karhunen-Loeve truncation for approximating the prior
   measure. Weak convergence of the resulting finite dimensional
   approximation, as well as convergence in the Hellinger distance, are
   investigated. In particular, we determine the convergence rate as a
   function of the number of Nystrom quadrature points and the number of
   truncated terms in the Karhunen-Loeve series. Finally, we estimate the
   error between the exact posterior moments, e.g., posterior mean and
   variance, and their finite dimensional approximate counterparts in terms
   of the errors due to forward equation approximation and prior
   approximation. The main result of this work is that the convergence rate
   for approximating the Bayesian inverse problem is spectral, and this
   directly inherits the spectral convergence rates of the approximations
   of both the prior and the forward problems.}},

Abstract = {{The inclusion of heptagonal, octagonal, or larger rings in an
   sp(2)-bonded carbon network introduces negative Gaussian curvature that
   can lead to a high network porosity. Here we investigated a particular
   negatively curved nonplanar sp(2)-carbon structure namely 688P
   schwarzite, with a view toward the possible use of negatively curved
   carbons as lithium ion battery anodes. Our first principles
   calculations, show that the presence of pores in schwarzites can lead to
   three-dimensional Li ion diffusion paths with relatively small energy
   barriers. We calculated the binding energy of Li (which donates 1
   electron to the schwarzite) in different positions in the schwarzite
   structure, and the open-circuit voltage (OCV) with respect to Li metal
   and found that this schwarzite has a positive OCV for a Li concentration
   as high as LiC4. The advantages of the particular schwarzite studied
   here for use as an anode are expected to be present in other sp2-bonded
   carbon networks that feature large polygonal rings. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   and morphology in polymer nanocomposites}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{13-38}},
Abstract = {{Polymer nanocomposites are a class of materials that consist of a
   polymer matrix filled with inorganic/organic nanoscale additives that
   enhance the inherent macroscopic (mechanical, optical and electronic)
   properties of the polymer matrix. Over the past few decades such
   materials have received tremendous attention from experimentalists,
   theoreticians, and computational scientists. These studies have revealed
   that the macroscopic properties of polymer nanocomposites depend
   strongly on the (microscopic) morphology of the constituent nanoscale
   additives in the polymer matrix. As a consequence, intense research
   efforts have been directed to understand the relationships between
   interactions, morphology, and the phase behavior of polymer
   nanocomposites. Theory and simulations have proven to be useful tools in
   this regard due to their ability to link molecular level features of the
   polymer and nanoparticle additives to the resulting morphology within
   the composite. In this article we review recent theory and simulation
   studies, presenting briefly the methodological developments underlying
   PRISM theories, density functional theory, self-consistent field theory
   approaches, and atomistic and coarse-grained molecular simulations. We
   first discuss the studies on polymer nanocomposites with bare or
   un-functionalized nanoparticles as additives, followed by a review of
   recent work on composites containing polymer grafted or functionalized
   nanoparticles as additives. We conclude each section with a brief
   outlook on some potential future directions.}},

Title = {{Ensembles of alpha-Trees for Imbalanced Classification Problems}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{131-143}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces two kinds of decision tree ensembles for
   imbalanced classification problems, extensively utilizing properties of
   alpha-divergence. First, a novel splitting criterion based on
   alpha-divergence is shown to generalize several well-known splitting
   criteria such as those used in C4.5 and CART. When the alpha-divergence
   splitting criterion is applied to imbalanced data, one can obtain
   decision trees that tend to be less correlated (alpha-diversification)
   by varying the value of alpha. This increased diversity in an ensemble
   of such trees improves AUROC values across a range of minority class
   priors. The second ensemble uses the same alpha trees as base
   classifiers, but uses a lift-aware stopping criterion during tree
   growth. The resultant ensemble produces a set of interpretable rules
   that provide higher lift values for a given coverage, a property that is
   much desirable in applications such as direct marketing. Experimental
   results across many class-imbalanced data sets, including BRFSS, and
   MIMIC data sets from the medical community and several sets from UCI and
   KEEL are provided to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed
   ensembles over a wide range of data distributions and of class
   imbalance.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of quantitative photoacoustic tomography (QPAT) is to
   reconstruct optical and thermodynamic properties of heterogeneous media

   There have been extensive theoretical and computational studies on the
   inverse problem in QPAT, although most were in the diffusive regime. We
   present in this work some numerical reconstruction algorithms for
   multi-source QPAT in the radiative transport regime with energy data
   collected at either single or multiple wavelengths. We show that when
   the medium to be probed is non-scattering, explicit reconstruction
   schemes can be derived to reconstruct the absorption and the Gruneisen
   coefficients. When data at multiple wavelengths are utilized, we can
   reconstruct simultaneously the absorption, scattering, and Gruneisen
   coefficients. We show by numerical simulations that the reconstructions
   are stable.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling the morphology, domain orientation, and domain size of block
   copolymer (BCP) thin films is desirable for many applications in
   nanotechnology. These properties can be tuned during solvent annealing
   by varying the solvent choice and degree of swelling which affect the
   effective miscibility and volume fraction of the BCP domains. In this
   work, we demonstrate with a bulk lamellae-forming BCP,
   poly(4-trimethylsilylstyrene-block-D,L-lactide) (PTMSS-b-PLA), that
   varying the composition of a mixture of solvent vapors containing
   cyclohexane (PTMSS-selective) and acetone (PLA-selective), enables
   formation of perpendicularly oriented lamellae with sub-20-nm pitch
   lines. The BCP domain periodicity was also observed to increase by 30\%,
   compared to bulk, following solvent annealing. Furthermore, solvent
   annealing alone is shown to induce a transition from a disordered to an
   ordered BCP. We rationalize our observations by hypothesizing that the
   use of a combination of domain selective solvent mixtures serves to
   increase the effective repulsion between the blocks of the copolymer. We
   furnish results from self-consistent field theory calculations to
   support the proposed mechanism. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

   We provide necessary conditions for achieving jointly optimal dispatch
   across multiple RTOs and develop a basic coordination algorithm from the

   for Li+-intercalation. However, both 2H-Li0.7NbS2 and 3R-NbS2 show
   reversible charge/discharge reactions based on the Nb(IV)/Nb(III) redox
   couple. They present distinctive differences in the voltage curves as a
   result of local structural differences. Galvanostatic charge/discharge
   tests between 1.0 and 3.0 V versus Li showed that discharge capacities
   were 169.5 mAh g(-1) for 2H-LixNbS2 and 169.0 mAh g(-1) for 3R-LixNbS2
   at 0.05 C rate and room temperature. At 10 C rate, 2H-LixNbS2 delivered
   a discharge capacity of 84.0 mAh g(-1) while 3R-LixNbS2 kept 74.9 mAh
   g(-1). After 200 cycles at 1 C, 9\% of capacity fade was observed for
   2H-LixNbS2 (from 141.5 to 129.4 mAh g(-1)) and 3R-LixNbS2 showed 14\%
   fade from 139.4 to 120.1 mAh g(-1). The key to improvement of the
   electrochemical performance of the 2H-LixNbS2 electrode is an initial
   synthesis of Li0.7NbS2. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A normal-incident flattop laser with a tapered end is proposed as an
   optical undulator to achieve a high-gain and high-brightness X-ray free
   electron laser (FEL). The synchronic interaction of an electron bunch
   with the normal incident laser is realized by tilting the laser pulse
   front. The intensity of the flattop laser is kept constant during the
   interaction time of the electron bunch and the laser along the focal
   plane of a cylindrical lens. Optical shaping to generate the desired
   flattop pulse with a tapered end from an original Gaussian pulse
   distribution is designed and simulated. The flattop laser with a tapered
   end can enhance the X-ray FEL beyond the exponential growth saturation
   power by one order to reach 1 Gigawatt as compared to that without a
   tapered end. The peak brightness can reach 10(30)
   photons/mm(2)/mrad(2)/s/0.1\% bandwidth, more than 10 orders brighter
   than the conventional incoherent Thompson Scattering X-ray source. (C)

Abstract = {{The long time persistence of mechanical stresses is a generic property
   of glassy materials. Here we identify the microscopic mechanisms that
   control internal stresses in highly concentrated suspensions of soft
   particles brought to rest from steady flow. The persistence of the
   asymmetric angular distortions which characterize the pair distribution
   function during flow is at the origin of the internal stresses. Their
   long time evolution is driven by in-cage rearrangements of the elastic
   contacts between particles. The trapped macroscopic stress is related to
   the solvent viscosity, particle elasticity and volume fraction through a
   universal scaling derived from simulations and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The electric field created by a condensed-phase environment is a
   powerful and convenient descriptor for intermolecular interactions. Not
   only does it provide a unifying language to compare many different types
   of interactions, but it also possesses clear connections to experimental
   observables, such as vibrational Stark effects. We calculate here the
   electric fields experienced by a vibrational chromophore (the carbonyl
   group of acetophenone) in an array of solvents of diverse polarities
   using molecular dynamics simulations with the AMOEBA polarizable force
   field. The mean and variance of the calculated electric fields correlate
   well with solvent-induced frequency shifts and band broadening,
   suggesting Stark effects as the underlying mechanism of these key
   solution-phase spectral effects. Compared to fixed-charge and continuum
   models, AMOEBA was the only model examined that could describe nonpolar,
   polar, and hydrogen bonding environments in a consistent fashion.
   Nevertheless, we found that fixed-charge force fields and continuum
   models were able to replicate some results of the polarizable
   simulations accurately, allowing us to clearly identify which properties
   and situations require explicit polarization and/or atomistic
   representations to be modeled properly, and to identify for which
   properties and situations simpler models are sufficient. We also discuss
   the ramifications of these results for modeling electrostatics in
   complex environments, such as proteins.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge for applications of graphene is the creation of a
   tunable electronic band gap. Hexagonal boron nitride has a lattice very
   similar to that of graphene and a much larger band gap, but B-N and C do
   not alloy: B-C-N materials tend to phase separate into h-BN and C
   domains. Quantum confinement within the finite-sized C domains of a
   mixed B-C-N system can create a band gap, albeit within an inhomogeneous
   system. Here we investigate the properties of hybrid h-BN/C sheets with
   real-space pseudopotential density functional theory. We find that the
   electronic properties are determined not just by geometrical
   confinement, but also by the bonding character at the h-BN/C interface.
   B-C terminated carbon regions tend to have larger gaps than N-C
   terminated regions, suggesting that boron-carbon bonds are more stable.
   We examine two series of symmetric structures that represent different
   kinds of confinement: a graphene dot within a h-BN background and a h-BN
   antidot within a graphene background. The gaps in both cases vary
   inversely with the size of the graphenic region, as expected, and can be
   fit by simple empirical expressions.}},

Abstract = {{Combustion-based synthesis is the prominent technique for large-scale
   production of commercial-grade nanoparticles, such as titanium dioxide
   (titania or TiO2). Both time and economic constraints have led to an
   increase in the sophistication of the models for such chemical
   processes. State-of-the-art models for combustion-based nanoparticle
   synthesis incorporate highly detailed gas-phase kinetic models to
   describe the effects of the complex chemical reactions on particle
   formation and growth. Accurate models for particle evolution must be
   coupled with the detailed gas-phase kinetics in order to predict the
   particle properties. In this work, a bivariate population balance model
   for titania nanoparticle produced in flame reactors is used to
   investigate the role of gas-phase and surface chemistry in the
   determination of particle properties. The model considers all relevant
   particle evolution events including nucleation, surface growth,
   aggregation and sintering. In order to focus on the relative importance
   of the gas-phase mechanism, the flow field is modeled using a simple
   multi-environment plug-flow reactor model. Both one-step and detailed
   chemistry for Ti oxidation from the precursor, TiCl4, are compared for
   two different flame configurations. The simulation results demonstrate
   the importance of the location of nuclei formation in the flame, which
   depends strongly on the gas-phase and surface growth kinetic models, and
   their effect on the final product properties. These results suggest that
   detailed gas-phase chemical kinetics combined with a detailed surface
   growth model are required to accurately describe the combustion-based
   synthesis of nanoparticles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and analyze a graphene-based cloaking metasurface aimed at
   achieving widely tunable scattering cancelation in the terahertz (THz)
   spectrum. This `one-atom-thick' mantle cloak is realized by means of a
   patterned metasurface comprised of a periodic array of graphene patches,
   whose surface impedance can be modeled with a simple yet accurate
   analytical expression. By adjusting the geometry and Fermi energy of
   graphene nanopatches, the metasurface reactance may be tuned from
   inductive to capacitive, as a function of the relative kinetic
   inductance and the geometric patch capacitance, enabling the possibility
   of effectively cloaking both dielectric and conducting objects at THz
   frequencies with the same metasurface. We envision applications for
   low-observable nanostructures and efficient THz sensing, routing and
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial arrangement of the side chains of conjugated polymer
   backbones has critical effects on the morphology and electronic and
   photophysical properties of the corresponding bulk films. The effect of
   the side-chain-distribution density on the conformation at the isolated
   single-polymer-chain level was investigated with regiorandom (rra-)
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly(3-hexyl-2,5-thienylene vinylene)
   (P3HTV). Although pure P3HTV films are known to have low fluorescence
   quantum efficiencies, we observed a considerable increase in
   fluorescence intensity by dispersing P3HTV in poly(methyl methacrylate)
   (PMMA), which enabled a single-molecule spectroscopy investigation. With
   single-molecule fluorescence excitation polarization spectroscopy, we
   found that rra-P3HTV single molecules form highly ordered conformations.
   In contrast, rra-P3HT single molecules, display a wide variety of
   different conformations from isotropic to highly ordered, were observed.
   The experimental results are supported by extensive molecular dynamics
   simulations, which reveal that the reduced side-chain-distribution
   density, that is, the spaced-out side-chain substitution pattern, in
   rra-P3HTV favors more ordered conformations compared to rra-P3HT. Our
   results demonstrate that the distribution of side chains strongly
   affects the polymer-chain conformation, even at the single-molecule
   level, an aspect that has important implications when interpreting the
   macroscopic interchain packing structure exhibited by bulk polymer
   films.}},

   waveguides: a general framework of selection rules and calculating SBS

Abstract = {{We develop a general framework of evaluating the Stimulated Brillouin
   Scattering (SBS) gain coefficient in optical waveguides via the overlap
   integral between optical and elastic eigen-modes. This full-vectorial
   formulation of SBS coupling rigorously accounts for the effects of both
   radiation pressure and electrostriction within micro- and nano-scale
   waveguides. We show that both contributions play a critical role in SBS
   coupling as modal confinement approaches the sub-wavelength scale.
   Through analysis of each contribution to the optical force, we show that
   spatial symmetry of the optical force dictates the selection rules of
   the excitable elastic modes. By applying this method to a rectangular
   silicon waveguide, we demonstrate how the optical force distribution and
   elastic modal profiles jointly determine the magnitude and scaling of
   SBS gains in both forward and backward SBS processes. We further apply
   this method to the study of intra-and inter-modal SBS processes, and
   demonstrate that the coupling between distinct optical modes are
   necessary to excite elastic modes with all possible symmetries. For
   example, we show that strong inter-polarization coupling can be achieved
   between the fundamental TE- and TM-like modes of a suspended silicon
   waveguide. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

   for Tagetes erecta L.-Glomus intraradices and Aldama dentata using
   atomic absorption spectrometry, neutron activation analysis, and

   statistical validation. The intertechnique absolute concentration
   differences at each C-s were statistically significant with the global
   average relative deviations being 0.5 +/- 0.3 to 1.1 +/- 0.9. However,
   the intertechnique C-p correlations across the C-s, were excellent.
   Therefore, the relative concentration variation is a robust index,
   reliably measured by all analytical methods as long as the techniques
   are applied self-consistently. The absolute concentration exactitudes
   are discussed with respect to the measurement aspects of each technique,
   sample presentation, and sample matrix effects. The findings also

Abstract = {{Phase instabilities of the RBaCo2O5+delta (R = Y and Ho)
   layered-perovskites and their decompositions into RCoO3 and BaCoO3-z at
   800 degrees in air were investigated. The phase instability will
   restrict their high temperature applications such as cathodes in solid
   oxide fuel cells (SOFC). However, appropriate amount of Sr substitution
   (>= 60\% for R = Y and >= 70\% for R = Ho) for Ba successfully
   stabilized the R(Ba1-xSrx)Co2O5+delta phase at elevated temperatures.
   This can be explained to be due to the decrease in oxygen vacancies in
   the R-O layer, decrease in R-O bond length, and consequent improvement
   in structural integrity. In addition, the Sr substitution (x = 0.6-1.0)
   for Ba provided added benefit with respect to the chemical stability
   against Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC) electrolyte, which is a critical
   requirement for the cathodes in SOFC. Among the various compositions
   investigated, the Y(Ba0.3Sr0.7)Co2O5+delta + GDC composite cathode
   delivered the optimum electrochemical performances with a stable phase,
   demonstrating the potential as a cathode in SOFC. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

   La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM) and Zr0.32Y0 O-08(1.96) (YSZ) between the
   oxygen electrode and the electrolyte has been fabricated by a pulsed
   laser deposition (PLD) technique for solid oxide reversible fuel cells
   (SORFCs). The high quality epitaxial growth of VAN structured LSM/YSZ
   has been achieved on single crystal SrTiO3 substrate at high-deposition
   temperatures. The symmetric cells with the VAN interlayer are found to
   have a lower area specific resistance compared to that without the
   interlayer. The enhancement in performance has been demonstrated by
   increased oxygen electrode catalytic properties and porous oxygen
   electrode microstructure. The cell with the VAN interlayer shows an open
   circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.00 V at 650 degrees C and maximum power
   densities of 0.22, 0.32, 0.43 and 0.55 W cm(-2) at 650, 700, 750 and 800

Abstract = {{Perovskite oxides ABO(3) are important materials used as components in
   electronic devices. The highly compact crystal structure consists of a
   framework of corner-shared BO6 octahedra enclosing the A-site cations.
   Because of these structural features, forming a strong bond between A
   and B cations is highly unlikely and has not been reported in the
   literature. Here we report a pressure-induced first-order transition in
   PbRuO3 from a common orthorhombic phase (Pbnm) to an orthorhombic phase
   (Pbn2(1)) at 32 GPa by using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. This
   transition has been further verified with resistivity measurements and
   Raman spectra under high pressure. In contrast to most well-studied
   perovskites under high pressure, the Pbn2(1) phase of PbRuO3 stabilized
   at high pressure is a polar perovskite. More interestingly, the Pbn2(1)
   phase has the most distorted octahedra and a shortest Pb-Ru bond length
   relative to the average Pb-Ru bond length that has ever been reported in
   a perovskite structure. We have also simulated the behavior of the
   PbRuO3 perovskite under high pressure by first principles calculations.
   The calculated critical pressure for the phase transition and evolution
   of lattice parameters under pressure match the experimental results
   quantitatively. Our calculations also reveal that the hybridization
   between a Ru:t(2g) orbital and an sp hybrid on Pb increases dramatically
   in the Pbnm phase under pressure. This pressure-induced change
   destabilizes the Pbnm phase to give a phase transition to the Pbn2(1)
   phase where electrons in the overlapping orbitals form bonding and
   antibonding states along the shortest Ru-Pb direction at P > P-c.}},

Abstract = {{Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the thermal
   conductance of Si nanowires with periodic corrugations is lower than
   that of smooth wires with cross-sections equivalent to the constricted
   portions. This reduction in conductance is up to 30\% and tends to
   plateau with increasing corrugation height. Spatially resolved
   temperature and heat current maps provide a microscopic understanding of
   this effect; we find that 80\% of the heat current is carried through
   the constricted area even for high-amplitude corrugations. More
   importantly, we show that temperature gradient inversion and heat
   current vortices at the ridge peaks establish fundamental limits on
   maximum conductance reduction. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Using single chain in mean field simulation approach, we examine the

   molecular weight polydisperse systems represented by AB diblock
   copolymer melts having monodisperse A blocks and polydisperse B blocks;
   and (ii) compositionally polydisperse symmetric diblock copolymer
   systems. In each case, we present results for the fluctuation-induced
   shift in the ODT from the corresponding mean-field predictions. In both
   models, an increase in polydispersity enhances the influence of
   fluctuations. Moreover, for compositionally polydisperse systems, we
   observe that the effects of fluctuations show similar trends in systems

Abstract = {{A total of 35 elements were investigated as single component metal
   oxides and as dopants for TiO2 for use in dye-sensitized solar cells
   (DSCs). An array dispenser and scanner system was utilized for
   high-throughput testing of the single component metal oxides and
   hundreds of doped TiO2 compositions. The optimal dopant concentrations
   were identified and summarized according to their effect on short
   circuit current (I-sc) and open circuit voltage (V-oc). New dopant
   candidates were discovered, including several post-transition metals,
   which showed improvements in DSC performance when incorporated at
   compositions of 6\% In TiO2, 6\% Sn TiO2, and 6\% Sb TiO2 (metals
   basis). These compositions were used to synthesize scaled-up DSC devices
   for detailed characterization. Incorporation of 6\% In into TiO2
   enhanced V-oc substantially and increased I-sc slightly, 6\% Sn improved
   I-sc while preserving V-oc, and 6\% Sb increased I-sc significantly but
   decreased V-oc. When coincorporated, Cr and Sb showed a complementary
   interaction, which reduced resistance to charge transport in the DSC
   device. The 2\% Cr, 6\% Sb TiO2, showed higher I-sc and V-oc values than
   6\% Sb TiO2 and considerably higher I-sc than 2\% Cr TiO2. The
   fill-factor for 2\% Cr, 6\% Sb TiO2 was relatively low, but the maximum
   power was higher than the other compositions due to the higher currents.
   The V-oc values for DSC devices with different compositions correlated
   linearly with the measured flat-band potentials (E-FB).}},

Abstract = {{Rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have the potential to meet
   the high-energy demands of the next generation of batteries. However,
   the lack of lithium in the sulfur cathode requires the use of lithium
   metal anode, posing safety hazards. Use of Li2S as the cathode can
   eliminate this problem, but it is hampered by intrinsic challenges
   (e.g., high electrical resistivity and reactivity in air). We report
   here the use of a lithiated graphite electrode to chemically reduce in
   situ the polysulfide Li2S6 in liquid electrolyte to insoluble Li2S. The
   chemical reduction slowly draws lithium out of graphite, resulting in a
   reduction of the d(002) spacing of graphite from 3.56 to 3.37 angstrom
   and an increase in the open-circuit voltage of cells from 60 mV to 2.10
   V after stabilizing over 6 days. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic
   analysis shows 48.4\% of sulfur in the polysulfide was converted to
   Li2S. The formed amorphous Li2S shows good cyclability with low charge
   overpotential. The results demonstrate that lithiated graphite can serve
   as a lithium donor in lithium-deficient cathodes, which could enable
   lithium metal-free Li-S, Li-air, or Li-organic batteries.}},

Abstract = {{A propagating-arc magnetohydrodynamic plasma actuator for aerodynamic
   flow control is reported. The actuator comprises two rail electrodes
   flush mounted on an aerodynamic surface. A pulsed arc is propelled down
   the length of the rails by Lorentz forces supported by a self-induced

   to the pushing and entrainment actions. Experiments in quiescent air
   demonstrate that the plasma arc achieves a peak velocity of around 100 m
   s(-1) and requires a discharge energy on the order of 300 J per pulse.
   Wind tunnel tests on a 14.5 inch chord airfoil section, at a Reynolds
   number of 0.45 million show induced flow velocities on the order of 10's

Abstract = {{The results of the effects of electrolyte type and concentration,
   nanoparticle concentration, pH, and temperature on the mobility and
   aqueous stability of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated silica
   nanoparticles are presented. Nanoparticle mobility was evaluated based
   on the ability to inhibit montmorillonite swelling in aqueous solutions
   through visual swelling tests, and the results were quantified in terms
   of the swelling index. The presence of PEG-coated silica nanoparticles
   was found to have a positive influence on the inhibition of clay
   swelling only in the presence of electrolytes. Quantification of
   nanoparticle stability in the presence of montmorillonite particles was
   achieved using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry. At the
   highest concentration of montmorillonite dispersion studied, interaction
   between the dispersed montmorillonite particles and PEG-coated silica
   nanoparticles resulted in nanoparticle aggregation as indicated by
   increased turbidity and absorbance readings. Both nanoparticle
   concentration and montmorillonite dispersion concentration, in addition
   to the presence and concentration of NaCl, were found to strongly
   influence the stability of the mixture.}},

Abstract = {{Natural gas from tight shale formations will provide the United States
   with a major source of energy over the next several decades. Estimates
   of gas production from these formations have mainly relied on formulas
   designed for wells with a different geometry. We consider the simplest
   model of gas production consistent with the basic physics and geometry
   of the extraction process. In principle, solutions of the model depend
   upon many parameters, but in practice and within a given gas field, all
   but two can be fixed at typical values, leading to a nonlinear diffusion
   problem we solve exactly with a scaling curve. The scaling curve
   production rate declines as 1 over the square root of time early on, and
   it later declines exponentially. This simple model provides a
   surprisingly accurate description of gas extraction from 8,294 wells in
   the United States' oldest shale play, the Barnett Shale. There is good
   agreement with the scaling theory for 2,057 horizontal wells in which
   production started to decline exponentially in less than 10 y. The
   remaining 6,237 horizontal wells in our analysis are too young for us to
   predict when exponential decline will set in, but the model can
   nevertheless be used to establish lower and upper bounds on well
   lifetime. Finally, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the gas that will
   be produced by the wells in our sample, individually and in total. The
   estimated ultimate recovery from our sample of 8,294 wells is between 10
   and 20 trillion standard cubic feet.}},

Abstract = {{A major limitation of high-throughput DNA sequencing is the high rate of
   erroneous base calls produced. For instance, Illumina sequencing
   machines produce errors at a rate of similar to 0.1-1 x 10(-2) per base
   sequenced. These technologies typically produce billions of base calls
   per experiment, translating to millions of errors. We have developed a
   unique library preparation strategy, ``circle sequencing,{''} which
   allows for robust downstream computational correction of these errors.
   In this strategy, DNA templates are circularized, copied multiple times
   in tandem with a rolling circle polymerase, and then sequenced on any
   high-throughput sequencing machine. Each read produced is
   computationally processed to obtain a consensus sequence of all linked
   copies of the original molecule. Physically linking the copies ensures
   that each copy is independently derived from the original molecule and
   allows for efficient formation of consensus sequences. The
   circlesequencing protocol precedes standard library preparations and is
   therefore suitable for a broad range of sequencing applications. We
   tested our method using the Illumina MiSeq platform and obtained errors
   in our processed sequencing reads at a rate as low as 7.6 x 10(-6) per
   base sequenced, dramatically improving the error rate of Illumina
   sequencing and putting error on par with low-throughput, but highly
   accurate, Sanger sequencing. Circle sequencing also had substantially
   higher efficiency and lower cost than existing barcode-based schemes for
   correcting sequencing errors.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of nanoconfined fluids can be strikingly different from
   those of bulk liquids. A basic unanswered question is whether the
   equilibrium and dynamic consequences of confinement are related to each
   other in a simple way. We study this question by simulation of a liquid
   comprising asymmetric dumbbell-shaped molecules, which can be deeply
   supercooled without crystallizing. We find that the dimensionless
   structural relaxation times-spanning six decades as a function of
   temperature, density, and degree of confinement-collapse when plotted
   versus excess entropy. The data also collapse when plotted versus excess
   isochoric heat capacity, a behavior consistent with the existence of
   isomorphs in the bulk and confined states.}},

Abstract = {{RNAs have many important functional properties, including that they are
   independently controllable and highly tunable. As a result of these
   advantageous properties, their use in a myriad of sophisticated devices
   has been widely explored. Yet, the exploitation of RNAs for synthetic
   applications is highly dependent on the ability to characterize the many
   new molecules that continue to be discovered by large-scale sequencing
   and high-throughput screening techniques. In this review, we present an
   exhaustive survey of the most recent synthetic bacterial riboswitches
   and small RNAs while emphasizing their virtues in gene expression
   management. We also explore the use of these RNA components as building
   blocks in the RNA synthetic biology toolbox and discuss examples of
   synthetic RNA components used to rewire bacterial regulatory circuitry.
   We anticipate that this field will expand its catalog of smart devices
   by mimicking and manipulating natural RNA mechanisms and functions.}},

Abstract = {{Physical dispersion is one of the most important key parameters in
   compositional reservoir simulation. It is a phenomenon of mixing with
   mass transfer occurring when gradients in composition arise or exist
   This process tends to homogenize the composition of the phases. When the
   dispersion term is included in the material balance equations, we obtain
   a full tensor structure. However, most of the reservoir simulators
   neglect such an important physical term. In this work, we investigate
   the governing partial differential equations for modeling miscible
   flooding by adding dispersion to the material balance equations. The
   equations are solved by the Element-based Finite-Volume method (EbFVM)
   in conjunction with unstructured meshes. Results of several
   compositional reservoir simulation case studies are presented to
   demonstrate the application of the method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Coupled solid and fluid mechanics modeling of formation damage near

Abstract = {{The infiltration of drilling mud below the bit and into the wellbore
   wall causes pressure gradients that significantly degrade drilling
   performance, wellbore stability and production. Due to heterogeneity,
   standard constitutive relationships and models yield poor predictions
   for flow (e.g. permeability) and rock properties (e.g. elastic moduli)
   of the invaded (damaged) formations. This severely reduces our ability
   to, for instance, estimate pressure build-up, optimize the mud cake
   properties or predict rock mechanical behavior.
   We propose a numerical model for permeability estimation in damaged
   formations near wellbore (e.g. sediments invaded by fines or sand
   crushing remnants). Grains of two length scales are present, but only
   larger ones are load-bearing. Detailed cemented granular packs were
   modeled using a discrete element method software, and ensuring
   mechanical stability. The particle positions and arrangement were
   available for subsequent pore throat network analysis. The standard
   network modeling approach for analysis of packing of nearly equal grains
   (Delaunay tessellation) cannot be used since grains of two different
   length scales create a high fraction of distorted pores. The main
   novelty of this work is adapting the network flow model to work with two
   length scales, and we present both the network creation and flow model
   in the multi-scale case.
   The effects of particle size and initial formation porosity on formation
   damage are studied in detail. Our study confirms that large particles
   tend to occupy the formation face, while small particles invade deep
   into the formation. Moreover, particles which are smaller than pore
   throats (entrances) impair permeability more than those larger than pore
   throats. Our study also indicates that a higher initial formation
   porosity leads to more particle invasion and permeability impairment
   Thus in order to reduce formation damage, mud particle size
   distributions should be carefully selected according to given formation
   properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Oil-recovery predictions for surfactant polymer flooding}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{341-350}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in surfactant-polymer (SP) flooding because
   of the need to increase oil production from depleted and water flooded
   reservoirs. Prediction of oil recovery from SP flooding, however, is
   complex and time consuming. Thus, a quick and easy method is needed to
   screen reservoirs for potential SP floods. This paper presents a scaling
   model that is capable of producing reasonable estimates of oil recovery
   for a SP flood using a simple spreadsheet calculation. The model is also
   useful for initial SP design.
   We present key dimensionless groups that control recovery for a SP
   flood. The proper physics for SP floods including the optimal salinity
   in the three-phase region and the trapping number for residual oil
   saturation determination has been incorporated. Based on these groups, a
   Box-Behnken experimental design is performed to generate response
   surface fits for oil recovery prediction at key dimensionless times. The
   response surfaces derived can be used to estimate the oil recovery
   potential for any given reservoir and are ideal for screening large
   databases of reservoirs to identify the most attractive chemical
   flooding candidates. The response function can also be used for proper
   design of key parameters for SP flooding. Our model will aid engineers
   to understand how key parameters affect oil recovery without performing
   time consuming chemical simulations. This is the first time that
   dimensionless groups for SP flooding have been derived comprehensively
   to obtain a response function of oil recovery as a function of
   dimensionless groups. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Policymakers, planners, engineers, and others seek effective ways to
   anticipate and manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for a sustainable
   future. Here, a microsimulation model was developed to demonstrate how
   one can forecast Austin's demographic and firmographic attributes over
   time, using a variety of national and local, aggregate and disaggregate
   data sets. Year 2030 household energy demands and GHG emissions
   estimates are compared under five different land use and transport
   policy scenarios. Application of an urban growth boundary provided the
   lowest increase in overall vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and GHG
   emissions, while network additions resulted in the highest rates of
   increase. Average energy consumption per household are estimated to fall
   over time (by 11-19\% depending on the scenario), but the region's
   overall energy consumption is estimated to increase dramatically - by
   nearly 88\% in terms of home energy consumption (in the base scenario)
   and 108\% in the transport sector, relative to the 2005 base-year
   scenario. Such increases are considerably higher than proposed GHG
   targets, presenting a serious energy and emissions challenge for Austin

Abstract = {{Compilation of real-world programs often requires hours. The term
   nightly build known to industrial researchers is an artifact of long
   compilation times. Our goal is to reduce the absolute analysis times for
   large C codes (of the order of millions of lines). Pointer analysis is
   one of the key analyses performed during compilation. Its scalability is
   paramount to achieve the efficiency of the overall compilation process
   and its precision directly affects that of the client analyses. In this
   work, we design a time- and space-efficient flow-sensitive pointer
   analysis and parallelize it on graphics processing units. Our analysis
   proposes to use an extended bloom filter, called multibloom, to store
   points-to information in an approximate manner and develops an analysis
   in terms of the operations over the multibloom. Since bloom filter is a
   probabilistic data structure, we develop ways to gain back the analysis
   precision. We achieve effective parallelization by achieving memory
   coalescing, reducing thread divergence, and improving load balance
   across GPU warps. Compared to a state-of-the-art sequential solution,
   our parallel version achieves a 7.8x speedup with less than 5\%
   precision loss on a suite of six large programs. Using two client
   transformations, we show that this loss in precision only minimally
   affects a client's precision.}},

   to the distance between the nodes, i.e., the quality of CSI degrades
   with increasing distance. Accounting for the training and feedback
   overhead, we derive the transmission capacity of this MIMO IA ad hoc
   network and then compare it to open-loop (interference-blind) spatial

Abstract = {{Geological storage of CO2 requires multiphase flow models coupled with
   key hydrogeologic features to accurately predict the long-term
   consequences. The prediction uncertainty during geological CO2 storage
   requires a computationally efficient and practically useful framework.
   This paper presents a comparative study between ensemble-based filtering
   algorithms (En-As) and calibration-constrained null-space Monte Carlo
   (NSMC) methods. For the En-As, we use the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF),
   ensemble smoother (ES), ES with multiple data assimilation (ES-MDA), and
   EnKF and ES with the pilot point method. For the NSMC calibrated models
   with various parameterization, schemes are tested and single and
   multiple NSMC (M-NSMC) methods are used. A synthetic case with two
   layers was developed to mimic an actual CO2 injection pilot test where
   one injection and two observation wells are located within a short
   distance. Observed data include bottom hole pressure at injection well
   and gas saturation (S-g) at two observation wells in the upper layer.
   Model parameters include horizontal permeability and porosity.
   Comparison of results shows that both methodologies yield good history
   match and reasonable prediction results in a computationally efficient
   way. In particular, the ES-MDA and M-NSMC resulted in smaller objective
   function values and lower prediction uncertainties of S-g profiles
   compared to other variants tested in this work. The En-As with the pilot
   point method have higher variability of permeability compared to those
   without one, but the En-As show smoother permeability fields compared to
   the NSMC methods. This is because stochastic randomness at a grid scale
   was included to generate NSMC fields. Both ensemble-based and NSMC
   algorithms are unable to correct the structural orientation of the prior
   ensemble members using only the sparse dynamic data from wells, while
   they obtain reasonable history match, suggesting that structural
   uncertainty should be incorporated into prior information. Overall, the
   ES-MDA has an advantage in terms of computational efficiency, but at the
   expense of additional computation M-NSMC shows applicability for highly
   nonlinear problems such as multiphase flow problems.}},

Abstract = {{Calibration of subsurface flow models is an essential step for managing
   ground water aquifers, designing of contaminant remediation plans, and
   maximizing recovery from hydrocarbon reservoirs. We investigate an
   efficient sampling algorithm known as nested sampling (NS), which can
   simultaneously sample the posterior distribution for uncertainty
   quantification, and estimate the Bayesian evidence for model selection.
   Model selection statistics, such as the Bayesian evidence, are needed to
   choose or assign different weights to different models of different
   levels of complexities. In this work, we report the first successful
   application of nested sampling for calibration of several nonlinear
   subsurface flow problems. The estimated Bayesian evidence by the NS
   algorithm is used to weight different parameterizations of the
   subsurface flow models (prior model selection). The results of the
   numerical evaluation implicitly enforced Occam's razor where simpler
   models with fewer number of parameters are favored over complex models.
   The proper level of model complexity was automatically determined based
   on the information content of the calibration data and the data mismatch
   of the calibrated model.}},

Title = {{Thermodynamic model of a thermal storage air conditioning system with
   dynamic behavior}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},

Volume = {{112}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A thermodynamic model was developed to predict transient behavior of a
   thermal storage system, using phase change materials (PCMs), for a novel
   electric vehicle climate conditioning application. The main objectives
   of the paper are to consider the system's dynamic behavior, such as a
   dynamic air flow rate into the vehicle's cabin, and to characterize the
   transient heat transfer process between the thermal storage unit and the
   vehicle's cabin, while still maintaining accurate solution to the
   complex phase change heat transfer. The system studied consists of a
   heat transfer fluid circulating between either of the on-board hot and
   cold thermal storage units, which we refer to as thermal batteries, and
   a liquid-air heat exchanger that provides heat exchange with the
   incoming air to the vehicle cabin. Each thermal battery is a
   shell-and-tube configuration where a heat transfer fluid flows through
   parallel tubes, which are surrounded by PCM within a larger shell. The
   system model incorporates computationally inexpensive semianalytic
   solution to the conjugated laminar forced convection and phase change
   problem within the battery and accounts for airside heat exchange using
   the Number of Transfer Units (NTUs) method for the liquid-air heat
   exchanger. Using this approach, we are able to obtain an accurate
   solution to the complex heat transfer problem within the battery while
   also incorporating the impact of the airside heat transfer on the
   overall system performance. The implemented model was benchmarked
   against a numerical study for a melting process and against full system
   experimental data for solidification using paraffin wax as the PCM.
   Through modeling, we demonstrate the importance of capturing the airside
   heat exchange impact on system performance, and we investigate system
   response to dynamic operating conditions, e.g., air recirculation. (C)

Abstract = {{We compare isogeometric collocation with isogeometric Galerkin and
   standard C-0 finite element methods with respect to the cost of forming
   the matrix and residual vector, the cost of direct and iterative
   solvers, the accuracy versus degrees of freedom and the accuracy versus
   computing time. On this basis, we show that isogeometric collocation has
   the potential to increase the computational efficiency of isogeometric
   analysis and to outperform both isogeometric Galerkin and standard C-0
   finite element methods, when a specified level of accuracy is to be
   achieved with minimum computational cost. We then explore an adaptive
   isogeometric collocation method that is based on local hierarchical
   refinement of NURBS basis functions and collocation points derived from
   the corresponding multi-level Greville abscissae. We introduce the
   concept of weighted collocation that can be consistently developed from
   the weighted residual form and the two-scale relation of B-splines.
   Using weighted collocation in the transition regions between
   hierarchical levels, we are able to reliably handle coincident
   collocation points that naturally occur for multi-level Greville
   abscissae. The resulting method combines the favorable properties of
   isogeometric collocation and hierarchical refinement in terms of
   computational efficiency, local adaptivity, robustness and
   straightforward implementation, which we illustrate by numerical
   examples in one, two and three dimensions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   theoretically analyze the laser energy dependence of these extra peaks
   considering a set of discrete wavevectors within the interior of the
   Brillouin zone of graphene, which activate special double-resonance
   Raman processes. Our result show a nice qualitative agreement between
   the experimental and simulated spectra, demonstrating that these extra

Abstract = {{The ability to remove long, insulating ligands from nanocrystal (NC)
   surfaces without deteriorating the structural integrity of NC films is
   critical to realizing their electronic and optoelectronic applications.
   Here we report a nondestructive ligand-exchange approach based on in
   situ chemical treatment of NCs floating at the liquid air interface,
   enabling strongly coupled NC superlattice films that can be directly
   transferred to arbitrary substrates for device applications.
   Ligand-exchange-induced structural defects such as cracks and degraded
   NC ordering that are commonly observed using previous methods are
   largely prevented by performing ligand exchange at the liquid air
   interface. The significantly reduced interparticle spacing arising from
   ligand replacement leads to highly conductive NC superlattice films, the
   electrical conductivities and carrier mobilities of which are 1 order of
   magnitude higher than those of the same NC films subject to
   substrate-supported exchange using previously reported procedures. The
   in situ, free-floating exchange approach presented here opens the door
   for electronically coupled NC superlattices that hold great promise for
   high-performance, flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{The understanding of the metal and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)
   interface is critical for future electronic device technologies based on
   this new class of two-dimensional semiconductors. Here, we investigate
   the initial growth of nanometer-thick Pd, Au, and Ag films on monolayer
   MoS2. Distinct growth morphologies are identified by atomic force
   microscopy: Pd forms a uniform contact, Au clusters into nanostructures,
   and Ag forms randomly distributed islands on MoS2. The formation of
   these different interfaces is elucidated by large-scale spin-polarized
   density functional theory calculations. Using Raman spectroscopy, we
   find that the interface homogeneity shows characteristic Raman shifts in
   E-2g(1) and A(1g) modes. Interestingly, we show that insertion of
   graphene between metal and MoS2 can effectively decouple MoS2 from the
   perturbations imparted by metal contacts (e.g., strain), while
   maintaining an effective electronic coupling between metal contact and
   MoS2, suggesting that graphene can act as a conductive buffer layer in
   TMD electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Barium titanate nanoparticles (BT NP) belong to a class of second
   harmonic generating (SHG) nanoprobes that have recently demonstrated
   promise in biological imaging. Unfortunately, BT NPs display low
   cellular uptake efficiencies, which may be a problem if cellular
   internalization is desired or required for a particular application. To
   overcome this issue, while concomitantly developing a particle platform
   that can also deliver nucleic acids into cells, we coated the BT NPs
   with the cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI)-one of the most
   effective nonviral gene delivery agents. Coating of BT with PEI yielded
   complexes with positive zeta potentials and resulted in an 8-fold
   increase in cellular uptake of the BT NPs. Importantly, we were able to
   achieve high levels of gene delivery with the BT-PEI/DNA complexes,
   supporting further efforts to generate BT platforms for coupled imaging
   and gene therapy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports a comprehensive set of experimentally measured
   physico-chemical surface properties of 12 different microalgae including
   fresh and seawater species of green algae, diatoms and cyanobacteria.
   The surface free energy and its components including the acid-base (AB),
   van der Waals (LW), electron donor/acceptor parameters were quantified
   based on contact angle measurements along with the Lifshitz-van der
   Waals acid-base approach using the probe liquid surface tension
   parameters proposed by van Oss et al. as well as by Della Volpe and
   Siboni. Moreover, the zeta and surface potentials of all species were
   determined using electrophoretic mobility measurements along with using
   Smoluchowski's model. Finally, the free energy of cohesion of the
   microalgae was also determined based on the calculated surface energy
   properties. The results showed that the electron donor parameter
   correlated well with the free energy of cohesion in all groups of
   microalgae. Moreover, species known to form colonies and exhibit benthic
   cultures had distinctly hydrophobic surfaces compared to microalgae
   prefering planktonic growth. These results indicate the importance of
   surface hydrophobicity for causing biofouiling or flocculation of
   cultures. Finally, the zeta potentials did not show a distinctive trend
   with the types of microalgae but the surface potentials were markedly
   larger for the salt water species. The reported methods and data are
   expected to provide critical information for researchers and technology
   developers concerned with cell to cell and cell to substrata
   interactions of microalgae in algal biomass cultivation and harvesting,
   biofouling of membranes and surfaces, as well as cell-surface
   interactions in photosynthetic microbial fuel cell technologies. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper reports the cell to substratum and cell to cell interactions
   of a diverse group of microalgae based on the Extended Derjaguin,
   Landau, Verwey, Overbeek (XDLVO) approach using the previously reported
   physico-chemical surface properties. The microalgae included 10
   different species of green algae and diatoms from both freshwater and
   saltwater environments while the substrata included glass, indium-tin
   oxide (ITO), stainless steel, polycarbonate, polyethylene, and
   polystryrene. The results indicated that acid-base interactions were the
   dominating mechanism of interaction for microalgae. For green algae, if
   at least one of the interacting surfaces was hydrophobic, adhesion at
   primary minimum was predicted without,any energy barrier. However, most
   diatom systems featured energy barriers for adhesion due to repulsive
   van der Waals interactions. The results reported in this study are
   expected to provide useful data and insight into the interaction
   mechanisms of microalgae cells with each other and with substrata for a
   number of practical applications including prevention of biofouling of
   photobioreactors and other man-made surfaces, promotion of biofilm
   formation in algal biofilm photobioreactors, and developing
   bioflocculation strategies for energy efficient harvesting of algal
   biomass. Particularly, Botryococcus braunii and Cerithiopsis fusiformis
   were identified as promising species for biofloccuation and biofilm
   formation in freshwater and saltwater aquatic systems, respectively.
   Finally, based on the observed trends in this study, use of hydrophilic
   algae and hydrophilic coatings over surfaces are recommended for
   minimizing biofouling in aquatic systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{A strategic approach to recharging lithium-sulphur batteries for long
   cycle life}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The success of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries has brought
   indisputable convenience to human society for the past two decades.
   However, unlike commercialized intercalation cathodes,
   high-energy-density sulphur cathodes are still in the stage of research
   because of the unsatisfactory capacity retention and long-term
   cyclability. The capacity degradation over extended cycles originates
   from the soluble polysulphides gradually diffusing out of the cathode
   region. Here we report an applicable way to recharge lithium-sulphur
   cells by a simple charge operation control that offers tremendous
   improvement with various lithium-sulphur battery systems. Adjusting the
   charging condition leads to long cycle life (over 500 cycles) with
   excellent capacity retention (>99\%) by inhibiting electrochemical
   reactions along with severe polysulphide dissolution. This charging
   strategy and understanding of the reactions in different discharge steps
   will advance progress in the development of lithium-sulphur batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial systems provide an attractive, renewable route to produce
   desired organic molecules such as fuels and chemicals. While attention
   within the field of metabolic engineering has mostly focused on
   Escherichia coli, yeast is a potent host and growing host for industrial
   products and has many outstanding, biotechnologically desirable native
   traits. Thus, there has been a recent shift in focus toward yeast as
   production hosts to replace E. coli. As such, products have diversified
   in yeast beyond simply ethanol. Additionally, nonconventional yeasts
   have been considered to move beyond Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This
   review highlights recent advances in metabolic engineering of yeasts for
   producing value-added chemical compounds including alcohols, sugar
   derivatives, organic acids, fats, terpenes, aromatics, and polyketides.
   Furthermore, we will also discuss the future direction of metabolic
   engineering of yeasts.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular systems can be engineered into factories that produce
   high-value chemicals from renewable feedstock. Such an approach requires
   an expanded toolbox for metabolic engineering. Recently, protein
   engineering and directed evolution strategies have started to play a
   growing and critical role within metabolic engineering. This review
   focuses on the various ways in which directed evolution can be applied
   in conjunction with metabolic engineering to improve product yields.
   Specifically, we discuss the application of directed evolution on both
   catalytic and non-catalytic traits of enzymes, on regulatory elements,
   and on whole genomes in a metabolic engineering context. We demonstrate
   how the goals of metabolic pathway engineering can be achieved in part
   through evolving cellular parts as opposed to traditional approaches
   that rely on gene overexpression and deletion. Finally, we discuss the
   current limitations in screening technology that hinder the full
   implementation of a metabolic pathway-directed evolution approach.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the slightly compressible two-phase flow problem in a porous
   medium with capillary pressure. The problem is solved using the implicit
   pressure, explicit saturation (IMPES) method, and the convergence is
   accelerated with iterative coupling of the equations. We use
   discontinuous Galerkin to discretize both the pressure and saturation
   equations. We apply two improvements, which are projecting the flux to
   the mass conservative H(div)-space and penalizing the jump in capillary
   pressure in the saturation equation. We also discuss the need and use of
   slope limiters and the choice of primary variables in discretization.
   The methods are verified with two- and three-dimensional numerical
   examples. The results show that the modifications stabilize the method
   and improve the solution.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the feasibility of using the dominant frequency of the
   sample surface response to a mechanical stimulation as an effective
   indicator for sensing the depthwise distribution of elastic properties
   in transparent layered phantom samples simulating the cortex and nucleus
   of the crystalline lens. Focused ultrasound waves are used to
   noninvasively interrogate the sample surface. A phase-sensitive optical
   coherence tomography system is utilized to capture the surface dynamics
   over time with nanometer scale sensitivity. Spectral analysis is
   performed on the sample surface response to ultrasound stimulation and
   the dominant frequency is calculated under particular loading
   parameters. Pilot experiments were conducted on homogeneous and layered
   tissue-mimicking phantoms. Results indicate that the mechanical layers
   located at different depths introduce different frequencies to the
   sample surface response, which are correlated with the depth-dependent
   elasticity of the sample. The duration and the frequency of the
   ultrasound excitation are also investigated for their influences on this
   spectrum-based detection. This noninvasive method may be potentially
   applied for localized and rapid assessment of the depth dependence of
   the mechanical properties of the crystalline lens. (C) 2013 Optical

Title = {{An adaptive-grid model for dynamic simulation of thermocline thermal
   energy storage systems}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{865-873}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The advent of the smart grid requires both reliable, cost-effective
   energy storage solutions and the ability to accurately and efficiently
   simulate these systems. Thermocline thermal energy storage, where heat
   is stored over a temperature gradient, is a promising energy storage
   technology. However, because of the complexities of thermal
   stratification, accurate, yet simple models are difficult to identify
   and generally require complex computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models.
   In this work, a novel, adaptive-grid one-dimensional model for
   representing thermocline thermal energy storage systems is presented and
   validated using experimental data. Compared to standard, fixed-grid
   one-dimensional models, the adaptive-grid model improves accuracy and
   decreases the required number of state variables and equations by using
   a high-resolution grid in the region of thermal stratification and
   larger, variable-volume, isothermal nodes to represent the ends of the
   tank. Experimental data shows that the adaptive-grid model is more
   accurate than other one-dimensional models because it minimizes the
   effect of numerical diffusion and better predicts system behavior when
   temperature inversion is introduced into the system. The model presented
   has applicability in both cold and hot thermal energy storage systems
   and is advantageous over CFD models when many repeated simulations are
   required, such as in optimization, control, or prediction of long-term
   performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to reduce the required amounts of ancillary
   services, by limiting ramp rates of wind power through control of a
   storage system. Storage operation policies to limit the ramp rate of net
   production (wind + storage output) are optimized in a two-stage
   stochastic linear program with fixed recourse. Operation policies decide
   the storage operation based on the probability density function of one
   step ahead wind power, which is forecasted by a Gaussian process. In
   this optimization problem, it is assumed that a financial penalty is
   incurred when violating the ramp rate limit (RRL), and that the penalty
   is linearly proportional to the number of MW per period above or below
   the RRLs. The L-shaped method is used to reduce the number of
   constraints caused by various wind power scenarios. Then, the storage
   specification is determined based on minimizing the sum of the penalty
   costs and the investment costs of the storage system. The ultimate goal
   of this paper is to find the relationship between the financial
   penalties and the RRL.}},

Abstract = {{Deep reactive ion etch (DRIE) processes are performed on both sides of a
   silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer to realize piezoelectric accelerometers
   consisting of 20-mu m-thick epitaxial silicon cantilevers with bulk
   silicon masses at the tip. Sol-gel deposition of lead-zirconate-titanate
   (PZT) is used to realize an 800-nm-thick film on the top surface of the
   beams. Prior to accelerometer characterization, a system identification
   procedure based on laser Doppler vibrometry is performed, providing a
   complete description of the devices and predicted sensitivities.
   Frequency response measurements confirm device sensitivities in the
   3.4-50 pC/g range in the flat-band (depending on device geometry), and
   resonance frequencies in the 60-Hz-1.5-kHz range. The self-noise for the
   longest beam of 8.5mm is measured as 1.7 mu g/root Hz at 30 Hz and is
   limited by dielectric loss of the PZT film which is estimated to have a
   tan delta of 0.02. Scaling relationships for this particular device
   geometry are presented to provide insight into possible future design

Abstract = {{Atomically detailed molecular dynamics trajectories in conjunction with
   Milestoning are used to analyse the different contributions of coarse
   variables to the permeation process of a small peptide
   (N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide, NATA) through a
   1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine membrane. The peptide reverses
   its overall orientation as it permeates through the biological bilayer.
   The large change in orientation is investigated explicitly but is shown
   to impact the free energy landscape and permeation time only moderately.
   Nevertheless, a significant difference in permeation properties of the
   two halves of the membrane suggests the presence of other hidden slow
   variables. We speculate, based on calculation of the potential of mean
   force, that a conformational transition of NATA makes significant
   contribution to these differences. Other candidates for hidden slow
   variables may include water permeation and collective motions of
   phospholipids.}},

Abstract = {{The Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) approach is widely used to implement
   the absorbing boundary conditions for coupled multi-physics wave
   propagation problems. However, it has been recognized that the solution
   in the PML absorbing layer can become unstable in the presence of
   back-propagating modes. This paper analyzes the spectral location of
   those modes excited by monopole acoustic sources in
   logging-while-drilling cylindrical tools. To recover the stability of
   the solution for such a class of problems involving the modeling of
   elastic cylindrical waveguides, we propose the implementation of
   artificial attenuation in the waveguide to dampen undesirable modes,
   thereby making their amplitude negligible in the PML absorbing layer due
   to the limited numerical accuracy and round-off errors. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We present the realization and scaling properties of

   superior performance to the counterparts without the Si1-xGex shell.
   With a channel length (L-ch) of 380 nm and a diameter of 40 nm, we
   demonstrate a subthreshold swing of 180 mV/dec, and an ON-current (I-ON)
   of 60 mu A/mu m, comparable with recent results in Ge n-type FinFETs
   fabricated by top-down techniques. By systematically studying the
   scaling properties, we identify the contribution of the channel and
   contact resistances to device characteristics. We conclude that I-ON is
   not limited by the contact resistance but rather by a relatively large
   channel resistance, presumably associated with a high-interface trap
   density (D-it).}},

Abstract = {{The task of sparse linear regression consists of finding an unknown
   sparse vector from linear measurements. Solving this task even under
   ``high-dimensional{''} settings, where the number of samples is fewer
   than the number of variables, is now known to be possible via methods
   such as the LASSO. We consider the multiple sparse linear regression
   problem, where the task consists of recovering several related sparse
   vectors at once. A simple approach to this task would involve solving
   independent sparse linear regression problems, but a natural question is
   whether one can reduce the overall number of samples required by
   leveraging partial sharing of the support sets, or nonzero patterns, of
   the signal vectors. A line of recent research has studied the use of
   norm block-regularizations with for such problems. However, depending on
   the level of sharing, these could actually perform worse in sample
   complexity when compared to solving each problem independently. We
   present a new ``adaptive{''} method for multiple sparse linear
   regression that can leverage support and parameter overlap when it
   exists, but not pay a penalty when it does not. We show how to achieve
   this using a very simple idea: decompose the parameters into two
   components and regularize these differently. We show, theoretically and
   empirically, that our method strictly and noticeably outperforms both or
   methods, over the entire range of possible overlaps (except at boundary
   cases, where we match the best method), even under high-dimensional
   scaling.}},

Abstract = {{Video on-demand streaming from Internet-based servers is becoming one of
   the most important services offered by wireless networks today. In order
   to improve the area spectral efficiency of video transmission in
   cellular systems, small cells heterogeneous architectures (e. g.,
   femtocells, WiFi off-loading) are being proposed, such that video
   traffic to nomadic users can be handled by short-range links to the
   nearest small cell access points (referred to as ``helpers{''}). As the
   helper deployment density increases, the backhaul capacity becomes the
   system bottleneck. In order to alleviate such bottleneck we propose a
   system where helpers with low-rate backhaul but high storage capacity
   cache popular video files. Files not available from helpers are
   transmitted by the cellular base station. We analyze the optimum way of
   assigning files to the helpers, in order to minimize the expected
   downloading time for files. We distinguish between the uncoded case
   (where only complete files are stored) and the coded case, where
   segments of Fountain-encoded versions of the video files are stored at
   helpers. We show that the uncoded optimum file assignment is NP-hard,
   and develop a greedy strategy that is provably within a factor 2 of the
   optimum. Further, for a special case we provide an efficient algorithm
   achieving a provably better approximation ratio of 1 - (1 - 1/d)(d),
   where d is the maximum number of helpers a user can be connected to. We
   also show that the coded optimum cache assignment problem is convex that
   can be further reduced to a linear program. We present numerical results
   comparing the proposed schemes.}},

Abstract = {{This is a numerical study where we propose and quantify a technique for
   increasing the efficiency of convective systems. The concept is based on
   ``trimming{''} or ``shaving{''} and locally discarding the warmest part
   of a developing thermal boundary layer such that fluid at moderate
   temperatures is always absorbing thermal energy from the heated
   surfaces, which are not allowed to overheat. For the present study, a
   parallel plate channel that is subjected to an internal forced
   convective cooling is the configuration considered. Therefore,
   geometrically speaking, the proposed trimming technique simply consists
   in optimizing a blunt reduction of the spacing between the upper and
   lower plates composing the channel along its axial location, such that
   the new configuration has a step-like geometry, allowing the heated
   coolant to be discarded at the transition between the two sections. The
   numerical results, which are directly compared with the performance of
   an optimally spaced flow between two parallel plates, show that the
   thermal performance can be increased by over 20\% with two levels of
   trimming along the flow axis for forced convection i.e., three sections
   with different plate-to-plate spacings. The numerical predictions are
   also compared with scaling-based results showing a good agreement.
   Additionally, numerical simulations also considered buoyancy driven
   flows (i.e., natural convection); however, no significant performance
   gains were observed when the boundary layer trimming was used in that
   case. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical method is proposed for solving the two layer shallow water
   equations with variable bathymetry in one dimension based on
   high-resolution f-wave-propagation finite volume methods. The method
   splits the jump in the fluxes and source terms into waves propagating
   away from each grid cell interface. It addresses the required
   determination of the system's eigenstructure and a scheme for evaluating
   the flux and source terms. It also handles dry states in the system
   where the bottom layer depth becomes zero, utilizing existing methods
   for the single layer solution and handling single layer dry states that
   can exist independently. Sample results are shown illustrating the
   method and its handling of dry states including an idealized ocean
   setting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{62}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Simulations by many groups have shown that fission waves could form in
   uranium and potentially be used as the basis for a power reactor. The
   vast majority of studies have been done using a neutron diffusion
   approximation. Monte Carlo simulations are typically considered to be
   the benchmark against which other computational approaches are tested.
   However, a direct comparison of Monte Carlo and diffusion results for
   fission waves has not been made. In the present work we show the results
   of 1-D and 3-D simulations of a fission wave system done using MCNPX
   2.7.0. The results are compared with those from a one-dimensional,
   one-group neutron diffusion code. The diffusion simulations produce a
   wave speed of 5.9 cm/year versus 7.9 cm/year for the 3-D Monte Carlo
   simulations and 53 cm/year for the 1-D simulations. The 1-D diffusion
   and Monte Carlo simulations produce flux profiles with a correlation of
   R-2 = 0.93, and their U-238 burnup profiles have R-2 = 0.98. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In many cases, model validation requires that legacy data be partitioned
   into calibration and validation sets, but how to do so is a nontrivial
   and open area of research. We present a systematic procedure to
   partition the data, adapted from cross-validation and in the context of
   predictive modeling. By considering all possible partitions, we proceed
   with post-processing steps to find the optimal partition of the data
   subject to given constraints. We are concerned here with mathematical
   models of physical systems whose predictions of a given unobservable
   quantity of interest are the basis for critical decisions. Thus, the
   proposed approach addresses two critical issues: (1) that the model be
   evaluated with respect to its ability to reproduce the data and (2) that
   the model be highly challenged by the validation set with respect to
   predictions of the quantity of interest. This framework also relies on
   the interaction between the experimentalist and/or modeler, who
   understand the physical system and the limitations of the model; the
   decision-maker, who understands and can quantify the cost of model
   failure; and the computational scientists, who strive to determine if
   the model satisfies both the modeler's and decision-maker's
   requirements. The framework is general and may be applied to a wide
   range of problems. It is illustrated here through an example using
   generated experiments of a nonlinear one degree-of-freedom oscillator.

Abstract = {{We analyze the noise sensitivity of a new singularity index that was
   designed to detect impulse singularities in signals of arbitrary
   dimensionality while rejecting step-like singularities see Muralidhar et
   al., IEEE Signal Process. Lett., vol. 20, no. 1, pp. 7-10, 2013 and
   Muralidhar et al., Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Image Process., 2012. For
   example, the index responds strongly to curvilinear masses (ridges) in
   images, while weakly to jump discontinuities (edges). We analyze the
   detection power of the index in the presence of noise. Our analysis is
   geared towards answering the following questions: a) in the presence of
   noise only, what is the probability of falsely detecting an impulse
   given a threshold; b) given an impulse submerged in noise, what is the
   probability of detecting it given a threshold; and c) since the index is
   designed to be edge suppressing, what is the probability of incorrectly
   detecting an edge submerged in noise given a threshold. We compare the
   detection power of the index with that of a nominal impulse detector,
   the second derivative operator. Simulations and example applications in
   1-D and 2-D reveal the efficacy of the new singularity index for
   correctly detecting impulses submerged in noise, while suppressing
   edges. A software version of the 2-D singularity index can be downloaded

Abstract = {{Delayed neutron activation analysis (DNAA) remains one of the most
   sensitive methods of nondestructively determining fissile materials in a
   variety of sample matrices, provided that the samples contain only a
   single fissile component. This has historically been the limiting factor
   in many applications of DNAA, and often chemically destructive methods
   of analysis have needed to be utilized for many real-world samples. This
   work seeks to develop a method that will allow for DNAA to be utilized
   on samples containing multiple fissile components. Initial efforts,
   presented here, show that using a multivariate linear regression model
   to describe the delayed neutron emission profile of an irradiated sample
   allows for the concurrent determination of fissile nuclides in samples
   containing both U-235 and Pu-239, without chemical separations and using
   only a single counting step.}},

Abstract = {{Readily programmable chemical networks are important tools as the scope
   of chemistry expands from individual molecules to larger molecular
   systems. Although many complex systems are constructed using
   conventional organic and inorganic chemistry, the programmability of
   biological molecules such as nucleic acids allows for precise,
   high-throughput and automated design, as well as simple, rapid and
   robust implementation. Here we show that systematic and quantitative
   control over the diffusivity and reactivity of DNA molecules yields
   highly programmable chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that execute at
   the macroscale. In particular, we designed and implemented non-enzymatic
   DNA circuits capable of performing pattern-transformation algorithms
   such as edge detection. We also showed that it is possible to fine-tune
   and multiplex such circuits. We believe these strategies will provide
   programmable platforms on which to prototype CRNs, discover bottom-up
   construction principles and generate patterns in materials.}},

Title = {{A pilot point guided pattern matching approach to integrate dynamic data

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{125-138}},

Abstract = {{Methods based on multiple-point statistics (MPS) have been routinely
   used to characterize complex geological formations in the last decade.
   These methods use the available static data (for example, measured
   conductivities) for conditioning. Integrating dynamic data (for example,
   measured transient piezometric head data) into the same framework is
   challenging because of the complex non-linear relationship between the
   dynamic response and geology. The Ensemble PATtern (EnPAT) search method
   was recently developed as a promising technique to handle this problem.
   In this approach, a pattern is postulated to be composed of both
   parameter and state variables, and then, parameter values are
   sequentially (point-wise) simulated by directly sampling the matched
   pattern from an ensemble of training images of both geologic parameters
   and state variables. As a consequence, the updated ensemble of
   realizations of the geological parameters preserve curvilinear
   structures (i.e., non-multiGaussanity) as well as the complex
   relationship between static and dynamic data. Moreover, the uncertainty
   of flow and transport predictions can be assessed using the updated
   ensemble of geological models. In this work, we further modify the EnPAT
   method by introducing the pilot-point concept into the algorithm. More
   specifically, the parameter values at a set of randomly selected pilot
   point locations are simulated by the pattern searching procedure, and
   then a faster MPS method is used to complete the simulation by
   conditioning to the previously simulated pilot point values. This pilot
   point guided MPS implementation results in lower computational cost and
   more accurate inference of the parameter field. In addition, in some
   situations where there is sparsity of measured geologic static data, the
   EnPAT algorithm is extended to work only with the dynamic data. We
   employed a synthetic example to demonstrate the effectiveness of pilot
   points in the implementation of EnPAT, and also the capability of
   dynamic data to identify complex geologic structures when measured
   conductivity data are not available. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A computer algorithm is implemented to construct 3D cubic pore networks
   that simultaneously honor nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mercury
   injection capillary pressure (MICP) measurements on core samples. The
   algorithm uses discretized pore-body size distributions from NMR and
   pore-throat size versus incremental pore-volume fraction information
   from MICP as initial inputs. Both pore-throat radius distribution and
   body throat correlation are iteratively refined to match
   percolation-simulated primary drainage capillary pressure with MICP
   data. It outputs a pore-throat radius distribution which is not directly
   measurable with either NMR or MICP. In addition, quasi-static fluid
   distribution and single-phase connectivity are quantified at each
   capillary pressure stage. NMR measurements on desaturating core samples
   are simulated from the quantitative fluid distribution in a
   gas-displacing-water drainage process and are verified with laboratory
   measurements. We invoke effective medium theory to quantify the
   single-phase connectivity in two-phase flow by simulating percolation in
   equivalent sub-pore-networks that consider the remaining fluid phase as
   solid cementation. Primary drainage relative permeability curves
   quantified from fluid distribution and phase connectivity show
   petrophysical consistency after applying a hydrated-water saturation
   correction. Core measurements of tight-gas sandstone samples from the
   Cotton Valley formation, East Texas, are used to verify the new
   algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Carbon dioxide dissolution in structural and stratigraphic traps}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{736}},
Pages = {{287-315}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in structural and
   stratigraphic traps is a viable option to reduce anthropogenic
   emissions. While dissolution of the CO2 stored in these traps reduces
   the long-term leakage risk, the dissolution process remains poorly
   understood in systems that reflect the appropriate subsurface geometry.
   Here, we study dissolution in a porous layer that exhibits a feature
   relevant for CO2 storage in structural and stratigraphic traps: a finite
   CO2 source along the top boundary that extends only part way into the
   layer. This feature represents the finite extent of the interface
   between free-phase CO2 pooled in a trap and the underlying brine. Using
   theory and simulations, we describe the dissolution mechanisms in this
   system for a wide range of times and Rayleigh numbers, and classify the
   behaviour into seven regimes. For each regime, we quantify the
   dissolution flux numerically and model it analytically, with the goal of
   providing simple expressions to estimate the dissolution rate in real
   systems. We find that, at late times, the dissolution flux decreases
   relative to early times as the flow of unsaturated water to the CO2
   source becomes constrained by a lateral exchange flow though the
   reservoir. Application of the models to several representative
   reservoirs indicates that dissolution is strongly affected by the
   reservoir properties; however, we find that reservoirs with high
   permeabilities (k >= 1 Darcy) that are tens of metres thick and several
   kilometres wide could potentially dissolve hundreds of megatons of CO2
   in tens of years.}},

Abstract = {{A general mathematical model of viral infections inside a spherical
   organ is presented. Transported quantities are used to represent
   external cells or viral particles that penetrate the organ surface to
   either promote or combat the infection. A diffusion mechanism is
   considered for the migration of transported quantities to the organ
   inner tissue. Cases that include the effect of penetration, diffusion
   and proliferation of immune system cells, the generation of latently
   infected cells and the delivery of antiviral treatment are analyzed.
   Different antiviral mechanisms are modeled in the context of spatial
   variation. Equilibrium conditions are also calculated to determine the
   radial profile after the infection progresses and antiviral therapy is
   delivered for a long period of time. The dynamic and equilibrium
   solutions obtained in this paper provide insight into the temporal and
   spatial evolution of viral infections.}},

Abstract = {{This work uses an in situ filter test method to measure the
   size-resolved removal efficiency of indoor-generated ultrafine particles
   (approximately 7-100nm) for six new commercially available filters
   installed in a recirculating heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning
   (HVAC) system in an unoccupied test house. The fibrous HVAC filters were
   previously rated by the manufacturers according to ASHRAE Standard 52.2
   and ranged from shallow (2.5cm) fiberglass panel filters (MERV 4) to
   deep-bed (12.7cm) electrostatically charged synthetic media filters
   (MERV 16). Measured removal efficiency ranged from 0 to 10\% for most
   ultrafine particles (UFP) sizes with the lowest rated filters (MERV 4
   and 6) to 60-80\% for most UFP sizes with the highest rated filter (MERV
   16). The deeper bed filters generally achieved higher removal
   efficiencies than the panel filters, while maintaining a low pressure
   drop and higher airflow rate in the operating HVAC system. Assuming
   constant efficiency, a modeling effort using these measured values for
   new filters and other inputs from real buildings shows that MERV 13-16
   filters could reduce the indoor proportion of outdoor UFPs (in the
   absence of indoor sources) by as much as a factor of 2-3 in a typical
   single-family residence relative to the lowest efficiency filters,
   depending in part on particle size.}},

Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{3-4}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of stabilizing a class of nonlinear
   systems with unknown bounded delayed feedback wherein the time-varying
   delay is 1) piecewise constant 2) continuous with a bounded rate. We
   also consider application of these results to the stabilization of
   rigid-body attitude dynamics. In the first case, the time-delay in
   feedback is modeled specifically as a switch among an arbitrarily large
   set of unknown constant values with a known strict upper bound. The
   feedback is a linear function of the delayed states. In the case of
   linear systems with switched delay feedback, a new sufficiency condition
   for average dwell time result is presented using a complete type
   Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional approach. Further, the
   corresponding switched system with nonlinear perturbations is proven to
   be exponentially stable inside a well characterized region of attraction
   for an appropriately chosen average dwell time. In the second case, the
   concept of the complete type L-K functional is extended to a class of
   nonlinear time-delay systems with unknown time varying time-delay. This
   extension ensures stability robustness to time-delay in the control
   design for all values of time-delay less than the known upper bound.
   Model transformation is used in order to partition the nonlinear system
   into a nominal linear part that is exponentially stable with a bounded
   perturbation. We obtain sufficient conditions which ensure exponential
   stability inside a region of attraction estimate. A constructive method
   to evaluate the sufficient conditions is presented together with
   comparison with the corresponding constant and piecewise constant delay.
   Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the theoretical
   results of this paper.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing requirements for model validation when comparing
   computational and experimental results, there is a need to incorporate
   detailed representations of measurement devices within the computational
   simulations. Thermocouples are the most common temperature measurement
   transducers in flames and fire environments. Even for the relatively
   simple thermocouple transducer, the coupling of heat transfer mechanisms
   particularly under unsteady flow conditions leads to interesting
   dynamics. As experimentalists are well aware, the experimentally
   determined thermocouple values are not the same as the local gas
   temperatures and corrections are often required. From the computational
   perspective, it is improper then to assume that the predicted gas
   temperatures should be the same as the temperatures that an
   experimentalist might measure since the thermal characteristics of the
   thermocouple influence the indicated temperature. The thermal
   characteristics of simulated thermocouples in unsteady flame conditions
   are investigated. Validation exercises are presented to test the
   underlying thermocouple model. The thermocouple model problem is
   examined for a quasi-steady problem in which the gas temperature and
   surrounding walls are assumed to be random and described by probability
   density functions (PDFs). Differences are noted between the predicted
   thermocouple response and expected response. These differences are
   interpreted from the perspective of what modeling artifacts might drive
   the differences.}},

   temperature at 10C/10C charge/discharge rate with little capacity fade;
   at 55 degrees C, a capacity fade occurs as a result of reaction with the

Abstract = {{The sodium layered oxides Na2Ni2TeO6, Na2Co2TeO6 and Na1.6Sr0.2Ni2TeO6
   have been synthesized by conventional solid-state method. The samples
   were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), cyclic voltammetry
   (CV), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and charge-discharge
   measurements. The results show that all the samples crystallize in a
   hexagonal unit cell without impurity. The electrochemical Na+ extraction
   (i.e., the charge profile) for Na2Ni2TeO6 exhibits two voltage plateaus
   at 3.6 and 4.4 V, the first corresponds to Na+ ordering at extraction of
   1/3 of the sodium ions per formula unit, the second to the onset of SEI
   formation. Detailed XPS analysis confirms that the Ni(III) does not
   disproportionate into Ni(III) and Ni(IV). The process of Na
   extraction/insertion in the interlayers of Na2Ni2TeO6 is highly
   reversible with a capacity of 100 mAh g(-1), at slow cycling rate (0.03
   C) in the 4.35 to 3 V voltage range versus Na+/Na. The lattice constant
   and the unit-cell volume increase with the substitution of Na+ by Sr2+.
   In the presence of Sr2+, the appearance of a step in the
   charge-discharge profile of Na1.6Sr0.2Ni2TeO6 is suppressed. Na2Co2TeO6
   showed little Na extraction/insertion. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a practical and flexible methodology for
   generating a random collection of discrete joint probability
   distributions, subject to a specified information set, which can be
   expressed as a set of linear constraints (e.g., marginal assessments,
   moments, or pairwise correlations). Our approach begins with the
   construction of a polytope using this set of linear constraints. This
   polytope defines the set of all joint distributions that match the given
   information; we refer to this set as the ``truth set.{''} We then
   implement a Monte Carlo procedure, the Hit-and-Run algorithm, to sample
   points uniformly from the truth set. Each sampled point is a joint
   distribution that matches the specified information. We provide
   guidelines to determine the quality of this sampled collection. The
   sampled points can be used to solve optimization models and to simulate
   systems under different uncertainty scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Nucleic acids are highly charged polyelectrolytes that interact strongly
   with salt ions. Rigid, base-paired regions are successfully described
   with wormlike chain models, but nonbase-paired single stranded regions
   have fundamentally different polymer properties because of their greater
   flexibility. Recently, attention has turned to single stranded nucleic
   acids due to the growing recognition of their biological importance, as
   well as the availability of sophisticated experimental techniques
   sensitive to the conformation of individual molecules. We investigate
   polyelectrolyte properties of poly(dT), an important and widely studied
   model system for flexible single stranded nucleic acids, in
   physiologically important mixed mono- and divalent salt. We report
   measurements of the form factor and interparticle interactions using
   SAXS, end-to-end distances using smFRET, and number of excess ions using
   ASAXS. We present a coarse-grained model that accounts for flexibility,
   excluded volume, and electrostatic interactions in these systems.
   Predictions of the model are validated against experiment. We also
   discuss the state of all-atom, explicit solvent molecular dynamics
   simulations of poly(dT), the next step in understanding the complexities
   of ion interactions with these highly charged and flexible polymers. (c)

Abstract = {{The electronic and chemical properties of reduced graphene oxide (RGO)
   can be modulated by chemical doping foreign atoms and functional
   moieties. Nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-RGO) is a promising
   candidate for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However,
   there are still some challenges in further preparation and modification
   of N-RGO. In this work, a low-cost industrial material, urea, was chosen
   to modify RGO by a facile, catalyst-free thermal annealing approach in
   large scale. The obtained N-RGO, as a metal-free catalyst for oxygen
   reduction was characterized by XRD, XPS, Raman, SEM, TEM, and
   electrochemical measurements. It was found that the optimum synthesis
   conditions were a mass ratio of graphene oxide and urea equal to 1:10
   and an annealing temperature of 800 A degrees C. Detailed X-ray
   photoelectron spectrum analysis of the optimum product shows that the
   atomic percentage of N-RGO samples can be adjusted up to 2.6 \%, and the
   resultant product can act as an efficient metal-free catalyst,
   exhibiting enhanced electrocatalytic properties for ORR in alkaline
   electrolytes. This simple, cost-effective, and scalable approach opens
   up the possibility for the synthesis of other nitrogen doping materials
   in gram-scale. It can be applied to various carbon materials for the
   development of other metal-free efficient ORR catalysts for fuel cell
   applications, and even new catalytic materials for applications beyond
   fuel cells.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a multiperiod system operation problem with two conflicting
   objectives, minimizing cost and risk. Risk stems from uncertain
   disruptions to the system during operation. Whereas a general model
   would hedge against disruptions in each time period, we study special
   cases in which only a modest number of disruptions occur. To optimize
   for risk, we employ a convex approximation based on constraint sampling.
   We develop a stratified sampling scheme based on distributional
   information on the time of disruption. We establish that our scheme
   yields significant savings in sampling costs-up to an order of magnitude
   in the number of time periods-over naive sampling. Moreover, in the
   absence of distributional information, we exhibit a sampling strategy
   that has comparable performance to optimal stratification. We
   numerically demonstrate that stratification improves cost over naive
   sampling, improving the solution's proximity to the efficient frontier
   of the bicriteria problem.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a combined density functional theory and experimental study, we
   present that the electrochemical activity of Pd3Co alloy catalysts
   toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can be enhanced by adding a small
   amount of Ir. While Ir tends to favorably exist in the subsurface
   layers, the underlying Ir atoms are found to cause a substantial
   modification in the surface electronic structure. As a consequence, we
   find that the activation barriers of O/OH hydrogenation reactions are
   noticeably lowered, which would be mainly responsible for the enhanced
   ORR activity. Furthermore, our study suggests that the presence of Ir in
   the near-surface region can suppress Co out-diffusion from the Pd3Co
   substrate, thereby improving the durability of Pd-Ir-Co catalysts. We
   also discuss the relative roles played by Ir and Co in enhancing the ORR
   activity relative to monometallic Pd catalysts. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing
