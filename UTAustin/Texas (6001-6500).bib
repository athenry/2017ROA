Abstract = {{We propose a two-stage depth propagation algorithm for semi-automatic
   2D-to-3D video conversion that forces the solution towards statistical
   ``naturalness{''}. First, both forward and backward motion vectors are
   estimated and compared to decide initial depth values, then a
   compensation process is adopted to further improve the depth
   initialization. Secondly, the luminance and initial depth are decomposed
   into a wavelet pyramid. Each sub-band of depth is inferred using a
   Bayesian formulation under a natural scene statistic prior assumption.
   This is incorporated into a propagation target function as a prior
   regularizing term. The final depth map associated with each frame of the
   input 2D video is optimized by composing all the sub-bands. Experimental
   results obtained on various sequences show that the presented method
   outperforms several state-of-the-art depth propagation methods.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of estimating a dense depth map from a single
   monocular image. Inspired by psychophysical evidence of visual
   processing in human vision systems (HVS) and natural scene statistics
   (NSS) models of image and range, we propose a Bayesian framework to
   recover detailed 3D scene structure by exploiting the statistical
   relationships between local image features and depth variations inherent
   in natural images. By observing that similar depth structures may exist
   in different types of luminance/chrominance textured regions in natural
   scenes, we build a dictionary of canonical range patterns as the prior,
   and fit a multivariate Gaussian mixture (MGM) model to associate local
   image features to different range patterns as the likelihood. Compared
   with the state-of-the-art depth estimation method, we achieve similar
   performance in terms of pixel-wise estimated range error, but superior
   capability of recovering relative distant relationships between
   different parts of the image.}},

Abstract = {{Storm surge due to hurricanes and tropical storms can result in
   significant loss of life, property damage, and long-term damage to
   coastal ecosystems and landscapes. Computer modeling of storm surge is
   useful for two primary purposes: forecasting of storm impacts for
   response planning, particularly the evacuation of vulnerable coastal
   populations; and hindcasting of storms for determining risk, development
   of mitigation strategies, coastal restoration, and sustainability. Model
   results must be communicated quickly and effectively, to provide context
   about the magnitudes and locations of the maximum waves and surges in
   time for meaningful actions to be taken in the impact region before a
   storm strikes.
   In this paper, we present an overview of the SWAN+ADCIRC modeling system
   for coastal waves and circulation. We also describe FigureGen, a
   graphics program adapted to visualize hurricane waves and storm surge as
   computed by these models. The system was applied recently to forecast
   Hurricane Isaac (2012) as it made landfall in southern Louisiana. Model
   results are shown to be an accurate warning of the impacts of waves and
   circulation along the northern Gulf coastline, especially when
   communicated to emergency managers as geo-referenced images.}},

Title = {{Speed Synchronization Process of Merging Vehicles from the Entrance Ramp
   Empirical Analysis}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2391}},
Pages = {{11-21}},
Abstract = {{This paper explores the ``lane-changing preparation process,{''} defined
   as the synchronization process, from a new, integrated perspective. A
   comprehensive study was conducted to analyze the behavioral
   characteristics of the speed synchronization process of merging vehicles
   from entrance ramps by tracking their trajectories in the merge lanes.
   On the basis of gap selection, merging vehicles were classified as
   either original gap type or overtaking type, and the existence of speed
   synchronization was proved by comparing the speed differences of merging
   vehicles in relation to the putative leader (PL) and the putative
   follower (PF) vehicles. Several rules of merging vehicles during speed
   synchronization were established in the behavioral study. The merging
   vehicles tended to maintain a speed 5 to 7 m/s higher than the speed of
   the PL sons to overtake unsatisfied gaps in the adjacent through lane.
   When those vehicles intended to accept a gap, they first adjusted their
   speeds to be within a 2-m/s difference from their PL and PF vehicles and
   then merged into the targeted gap within 2 to 3 s. Factors affecting
   drivers' tolerance of their speed with PL and PF vehicles were modeled
   with the multiregression method. Significant effects in speed
   synchronization include the number of rejected gaps, acceleration or
   deceleration, the speed difference between the PL and the PF, the time
   headway, the remaining distance in the auxiliary lane, and whether the
   PL is a merged vehicle. Results from this study may contribute to the
   understanding of the complex lane-changing behavior in microscopic
   traffic flow modeling.}},

Abstract = {{An extension of the adaptive integral method (AIM) is presented for fast
   analysis of scattering from three-dimensional (3D) structures located in
   multiple layers of a planar layered medium. The proposed scheme
   accelerates the iterative method-of-moments solution by employing 3D
   auxiliary regular grids, each of which encloses the parts of the
   structure in a different layer, and 2D auxiliary regular grids, each of
   which is located at a different interface of the layered medium. The
   auxiliary grids are used to execute the standard four-stage AIM
   procedure (anterpolation, propagation, interpolation, and correction)
   but the propagation stage of the procedure is divided into intra-layer
   and inter-layer components. Only the 3D grids and both 3D and 2D grids
   are used for intra-and inter-layer propagation stages, respectively.

Pages = {{37-46}},
Abstract = {{A comprehensive benefit cost assessment of motorcycle use is offered,
   along with the characteristics, behaviors, and attitudes of motorcycle
   riders. U.S. motorcyclists are at high risk of crashing, with rates 24
   times higher than those of passenger car and light-duty truck drivers
   per mile traveled. However, motorcycles require only one-quarter the
   parking space of a car and can reduce congestion by doubling network
   capacity (in vehicles per hour). Most motorcycles have high fuel
   economy, but low seating capacities render them little or no better than
   most cars and some light-duty trucks (assuming average vehicle
   occupancies) when compared in terms of fuel consumption per rider (or
   vehicle occupant) mile traveled. Motorcycles emit fewer grams of many
   polluting emissions but more volatile organic compounds and carbon
   monoxide than most cars if a catalytic converter is not installed. Noise
   impacts are a serious issue, with an inconsistent patchwork of
   regulations applied across states and localities. Results of a survey of
   current and former U.S. motorcyclists indicate that most respondents
   ride motorcycles for recreational purposes and ride in groups, but about
   one-half also ride for more mandatory (less discretionary) purposes and
   about 40\% also ride solo. Fewer than one-third of respondents have
   formal motorcycle training, and helmet use is lowest among current
   riders who do not own a motorcycle. Engine size appears to be rising,
   and respondents support policies that combat operating a vehicle under
   the influence (e.g., ignition interlock devices for offenders).
   Regression models illuminate key factors and marginal effects on
   motorcycle riding and ownership rates.}},

   localization and enhancement at the nanoantenna gap. We achieve
   high-power THz photomixers based on field-emission nanodiodes integrated
   with nanomanipulated conical antennas or clusters of nanobowtie

   utilizes mixing instead of high frequency sampling, and folds the input
   in frequency around harmonics of the mixing local oscillator. The
   frequency-folded input is separated in the digital domain, which enables
   significant dynamic range benefits. The frequency of the mixing local
   oscillator can be significantly smaller than the signal bandwidth, and
   hence the architecture is suitable for high-speed applications. The
   architecture is verified through system level simulation and the impact
   of non-idealities on performance is considered. The design is observed

   conventional pulse width modulators. A prototype is simulated in a 130
   nm CMOS process, and achieves 35\% peak efficiency for 17 dBm output

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a first-order close-loop VCO based
   Delta Sigma ADC. Unlike other VCO based ADC, it does not contain
   operational amplifier which is power hungry and scaling unfriendly.
   Also, by using two VCOs referring to each other, it has an intrinsic DEM
   capability that improves SNDR degradation caused by mismatches in the
   feedback DAC. The design is low power and area efficient. A prototype is
   designed in the 0.13um CMOS technology with a power supply of 1.5V. The
   input signal bandwidth is 10MHz. In SPICE simulation, 70dB of SNDR is
   achieved while consuming only 5.6mW.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple but high performance architecture for
   multi-channel analog-to-digital conversion. Based on compressive
   sensing, only one SAR ADC is needed to convert multi-channel sparse
   inputs, leading to significant analog power saving and hardware saving.
   Moreover, it helps avoid problems occurring in conventional
   multi-channel ADCs such as timing skew, offset mismatch, and gain
   mismatch. A 12-bit SAR ADC converting 4-channel sparse signals
   simultaneously is designed in 130nm CMOS process. The design reaches a
   SNDR of 66.3dB and consumes an average power of 58 mu W at the sampling
   frequency of 1MHz. The L-1 minimization method is chosen to reconstruct
   the input signals. The single-tone and multi-tone inputs can be
   reconstructed with a minimum precision of 68dB and 55dB THD,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, researchers have intensively investigated various
   topics in test-case prioritization, which aims to re-order test cases to
   increase the rate of fault detection during regression testing. The
   total and additional prioritization strategies, which prioritize based
   on total numbers of elements covered per test, and numbers of additional
   (not-yet-covered) elements covered per test, are two widely-adopted
   generic strategies used for such prioritization. This paper proposes a
   basic model and an extended model that unify the total strategy and the
   additional strategy. Our models yield a spectrum of generic strategies
   ranging between the total and additional strategies, depending on a
   parameter referred to as the p value. We also propose four heuristics to
   obtain differentiated p values for different methods under test. We
   performed an empirical study on 19 versions of four Java programs to
   explore our results. Our results demonstrate that wide ranges of
   strategies in our basic and extended models with uniform p values can
   significantly outperform both the total and additional strategies. In
   addition, our results also demonstrate that using differentiated p
   values for both the basic and extended models with method coverage can
   even outperform the additional strategy using statement coverage.}},

Abstract = {{Software architecture is considered as a set of architectural design
   decisions (ADDs). Capturing and representing ADDs during the
   architecting process is necessary for reducing architectural knowledge
   evaporation. Moreover, managing the evolution of ADDs helps to maintain
   consistency between requirements and the deployed system. In this work,
   we create the Triple View Model (TVM) as a general architecture
   framework for documenting ADDs. The TVM clarifies the notion of ADDs in
   three different views and covers key features of the architecting
   process. Based on the TVM, we propose a scenario-based method
   (SceMethod) to manage the documentation and the evolution of ADDs.
   Furthermore, we also develop a UML metamodel that incorporates
   evolution-centered characteristics to manage evolutionary architectural
   knowledge. We conduct a case study to validate the applicability and the
   effectiveness of our model and method. In our future work, we plan to
   investigate how to support ADD documentation and evolution in
   geographically separated software development (GSD).}},

   they can be expected to be found in the natural waters used as drinking

   flocculation and filtration. Both flocculation and granular media
   filtration experiments with citrate-capped silver nanoparticles were
   performed at different ionic strengths and in the presence and absence
   of natural organic matter. The results were generally consistent with
   theories of particle destabilization that have been developed for larger
   particles (greater than 1 mu m), suggesting that silver nanoparticles
   are likely to be removed in conventional treatment processes.}},

Abstract = {{Shorter technology enable us to create higher speed oscillators which
   can provide better resolution in time domain. Therefore, a simple ADC
   using voltage (or current) controlled oscillator (VCO) and a counter can
   be implemented using this approach. Conceptually, the operation order in
   this ADC is similar to a conventional Sigma Delta modulator. The CCO
   integrates frequency to produce output in the form of phase. And the
   number of stages in the CCO determines the quantization levels (or phase
   resolution). The difference of quantized phase output produces a
   frequency proportional to the input signal. Therefore, unlike, a
   conventional Sigma Delta modulator no feedback is required for a first
   order noise shaping. In order to achieve a low power for moderate
   performance two key techniques have been used: a) a cross-coupled
   voltage to current (V/I) converter to achieve non-linearity cancellation
   (mainly 3rd-order harmonic), and b) a stack structure to share current
   between V/I converter and CCO to reduce power. This ADC has been
   simulated using models of typical 130nm CMOS technology. In SPICE
   simulation, SQDR/SFDR of 67.5 dB/71 dB is achieved over a total signal
   bandwidth of 5 MHz for an input swing of 300mV (V-pp) for typical corner
   at room temperature. The analog blocks consumed a total of 96.5 mu W
   from a regulated 1.2V supply, whereas, the digital blocks consumed an
   estimated power of 1.1 mW. Since, the major circuit blocks are digital
   in nature, the presented circuit is highly amenable with technology
   scaling.}},

Abstract = {{A feedback-based active interference suppression technique employing
   harmonic rejection mixers (HRMs) for enhancing linearity in a broadband
   channelizer is proposed. In the approach, an interferer is
   down-converted to baseband, low-pass filtered and then up-converted,
   where it is subtracted from the input. Using previously reported HRMs
   capable of LO frequency synthesis in both the down-conversion and
   up-conversion paths, wideband interference cancellation is achieved
   without the use of a wide tuning range PLL. Limitation on the maximum
   achievable interference rejection due to unwanted interaction between
   in-band and out-of-band harmonics is identified. An approach based on a
   2-step up-conversion in the feedback path is proposed to remove this
   limitation. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified

   an operational current-to-frequency converter that has a large open-loop
   conversion-gain like in an operational transconductance element in which
   the input and output variables are dissimilar. The difference between a
   current-controlled oscillator and current to frequency converter is that
   the transfer characteristic of the latter passes through the origin.
   Such a building block is meant for use in negative feedback
   circuit-configurations. Here the feedback network dominates the
   closed-loop transfer characteristics. The ability of such a technique to
   trade gain for improving linearity and reducing process, voltage and
   temperature variations, is well known. The idea here is to provide a
   building block to configure ADC's with different resolutions over a wide
   range of sampling rates below 1 GHz. We present the architecture of such
   a device and its achievable performance via simulations using the models
   of a typical 65nm process technology.}},

Abstract = {{A new fused floating-point magnitude unit to compute the square-root of
   the sum of two squares is proposed. Conventionally, the magnitude
   computation is executed by discrete serial or parallel floating-point
   units with conventional floating-point multiplication, squares,
   addition, and square-root units. The proposed fused floating-point
   magnitude design has an enhanced exponent unit because the exponent
   processes of the sum-of-squares and square-root can be merged. Moreover,
   normalization to make the exponent an even number is not necessary for
   the fused magnitude unit. Normalization and rounding processing between
   the squares, addition and square-root computations are eliminated. This
   paper compares the fused magnitude unit with the conventional discrete
   floating-point magnitude units. Compared with the discrete parallel
   magnitude unit with conventional floating-point squarers, an adder, and
   a square-root unit, the fused floating-point magnitude unit has 24\%
   less area, 24\% less latency, and 27\% less power consumption (26\% less

Abstract = {{In this paper, we extend the micro-Raman technique for measurement of
   all three normal stress components around the through-silicon via (TSV)
   structure, as compared with the traditional technique of measuring the
   sum of the normal stresses. In this technique, a high numerical aperture
   (NA) objective is used to observe the two additional lattice vibration
   modes (Mode 1 and 2) together with the conventional longitudinal optical
   mode (Mode 3) so that all three normal stress components can be
   determined separately. {[}1] In our micro-Raman system, all the three
   vibration modes become measurable with numerical aperture (NA) exceeding
   0.40 and with spectral intensities increasing with NA.
   The relatively weak signal strengths of Mode 1 and 2 necessitate careful
   calibrations of the signal-to-noise ratio and the optimization of the
   laser power level. This led to a choice of NA of 0.85 with 100x
   objective in the experiments. This method was applied for a full
   characterization of the stress components in a 2 by 2 array of blind
   copper TSVs with 5 mu m diameter, 55 mu m depth and covered with 2 mu m
   oxide. The accuracy of Raman measurements was calibrated as a function
   of polarization configuration, laser power (2mW to 10mW). The
   experimental results show a good agreement with FEA simulation.}},

Abstract = {{The characteristics of thermal stresses in a five-stacked memory dies
   containing through-silicon vias (TSVs) were measured with synchrotron
   x-ray microdiffraction. The measurements were performed in and around
   the Cu vias for both the top and bottom dies. With scanning white beam
   x-ray microdiffraction, high resolution mappings of stress distribution
   were obtained. The results provided a direct observation of the local
   plasticity in Cu TSV and the stress and deformation in the surrounding
   Si. Thermo-mechanical modeling using finite element analysis (FEA) was
   carried out for the stacked structure. Results from the modeling
   analysis were correlated to the synchrotron observation to examine the
   effect of the die stacking on the stress behavior of the TSV at
   different die levels. Overall, the stress distribution obtained by FEA
   showed good agreement with the synchrotron measurement. The presence of
   plasticity was predicted by FEA and confirmed by the synchrotron
   observation. The implication of the residual stress on reliability of
   the memory structure was discussed. The results from this work
   demonstrate the capability of synchrotron based x-ray technique in
   studying the stress characteristics of multi-stack TSV structures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for use of-mechanistic empirical
   design procedures to determine load equivalencies for various axle
   configurations and loads with a focus on oversize and overweight
   vehicles. The study uses the DARWin-ME system for pavement analysis and
   computation of equivalent damage factors (EDFs). In the context of the
   study, the EDFs for a given axle load and configuration consist of two
   partial factors: the axle load factor and the group equivalency factor.
   The framework adopted in this study defines a given axle load and
   configuration equivalent to a reference axle load based on equivalent
   pavement responses that results in the same distress level. The EDFs for
   single, tandem, tridem, and quad axles were evaluated for a wide
   spectrum of varying loads, and three failure criteria were applied:
   rutting, fatigue cracking, and roughness. Except in the case of rutting,
   there was no evidence that EDFs are affected by the structural capacity
   of the pavement sections. For single axles, it was found that thicker
   pavement structures are less sensitive to traffic loads. For tandem,
   tridem, and quad axles, the relationship was nonmonotonic. For fatigue
   cracking, a linear relationship between the axle load factor and the
   number of axles per axle group was observed. Finally, for roughness, the
   EDFs showed no systematic trend for the different structural numbers.}},

Abstract = {{When APIs evolve, clients make corresponding changes to their
   applications to utilize new or updated APIs. Despite the benefits of new
   or updated APIs, developers are often slow to adopt the new APIs. As a
   first step toward understanding the impact of API evolution on software
   ecosystems, we conduct an in-depth case study of the co-evolution
   behavior of Android API and dependent applications using the version
   history data found in github.
   Our study confirms that Android is evolving fast at a rate of 115 API
   updates per month on average. Client adoption, however, is not catching
   up with the pace of API evolution. About 28\% of API references in
   client applications are outdated with a median lagging time of 16
   months. 22\% of outdated API usages eventually upgrade to use newer API
   versions, but the propagation time is about 14 months, much slower than
   the average API release interval (3 months). Fast evolving APIs are used
   more by clients than slow evolving APIs but the average time taken to
   adopt new versions is longer for fast evolving APIs. Further, API usage
   adaptation code is more defect prone than the one without API usage
   adaptation. This may indicate that developers avoid API instability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a non-parametric data synthesizing algorithm to
   generate privacy-safe ``realistic but not real{''} synthetic health
   data. Our goal is to provide a systematic mechanism that guarantees an
   adequate and controllable level of privacy while substantially improving
   on the utility of public use data, compared to current practices by CMS,
   OSHPD and other agencies. The proposed algorithm synthesizes artificial
   records while preserving the statistical characteristics of the original
   data to the extent possible. The risk from ``database linking attack{''}
   is quantified by either an l-diversified or an epsilon-differentially
   perturbed data generation process. Moreover its algorithmic performance
   is optimized using Locality-Sensitive Hashing and parallel computation
   techniques to yield a linear-time algorithm that is suitable for Big
   Data Health applications. We synthesize a public Medicare claim dataset
   using the proposed algorithm, and demonstrate multiple data mining
   applications and statistical analyses using the data. The synthetic
   dataset delivers results that are substantially identical to those
   obtained from the original dataset, without revealing the actual
   records.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying wind power variability can be essential to both power system
   planners and operators, as well as wind farm owners and investors. In
   this paper the conditional range metric, a novel probabilistic
   variability metric, is used to quantify wind power variability. The
   comparison of the wind power variability from four turbines of the same
   size but different technologies (fixed speed, variable slip, DFIG, full
   converter) yields that the full converter wind turbine has the least
   variable and the fixed speed the most variable output, with the fixed
   speed being 15\% more variable than the full converter turbine output.
   Comparing the output from two variable speed wind turbines of different
   sizes suggests that wind power variability decreases slightly with
   turbine size in p.u. values. However, the results of comparing the wind
   power variability from one turbine at one site to the wind power
   variability from the aggregated output of two identical turbines at
   different sites indicate that wind power aggregation provides a
   significant reduction in wind power variability, since variability
   increases by no more than 75\% regardless of wind turbine size and
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents harmonic analysis of a fixed-speed wind turbine in a
   utility distribution system. It shows a condition of how the wind
   turbine may be involved in harmonic resonance through its power factor
   correction capacitors. In addition the effect of wind speed on the
   resonant frequency is also considered. The test system used in this
   study is a distribution feeder with an equivalent nonlinear load and a
   wind turbine connected at the feeder end. The results show that severe
   harmonic distortion can occur due to the interaction of the power factor
   correction capacitors and the system impedances. Although, wind speed
   does not have a direct effect on the resonant frequency, the number of
   power factor correction capacitors affects the resonance condition. A
   single-tuned notch filter is shown to be efficient in reducing the
   harmonic distortion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates effects of the distribution circuit parameters on
   the primary and secondary circuit voltages due to EV loads. The
   distribution circuit parameters considered here are; location of the
   service transformer with respect to the substation and location of the
   EV loads within the secondary service. The voltage analysis is carried
   out using a 13.8 kV distribution feeder dominated by residential loads.
   The study reveals that EV charging affects the secondary voltage more
   significantly than the primary voltage. The short-circuit capacity even
   at the remote end of the primary distribution line is adequately high;
   hence, preventing EV loads from affecting its primary voltage. When four
   240V/16A EV loads in a secondary service nearby and remote from the
   substation are charging, the additional voltage drops in their
   respective primary voltages are 0.023\% and 0.13\%. However, because the
   short-circuit capacity at the secondary service wire for both locations
   (remote/nearby) is significantly lower, additional voltage drops of
   approximately 4.5\% occur in the secondary service voltages. The study
   also reveals that a single EV load installed on a distant load node from
   a service transformer leads to comparatively higher additional voltage
   drop (1.7\%) than an EV on a nearby load node (0.81\%) in the same
   secondary service.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses characterization of hurricane-caused power system
   outages using simple to calculate localized tropical cyclone intensity
   indices. Studied outage metrics include maximum outage incidence,

   maximum outages. Four hurricane damaging actions are considered: storm
   surge, maximum sustained wind-speeds, the exposure time to at least
   tropical storm winds, and the land area swept by the hurricane. For an
   optimal curve fitting process that derives intensity indices for each of
   the outage metrics, the study follows an empirical approach by using
   outage and four actions data for hurricanes from 2004-08. The maximum
   outage incidence is observed to follow a logistic curve with a
   correlation of 0.8, suggesting a good fit. Restoration times fit a cubic
   polynomial with an R-2 of 0.65 because of the influence of different
   management approaches and logistical processes during restoration.}},

Abstract = {{In utility power system substation design, the breaker-and-a-half
   topology is frequently used, primarily because it is considered very
   reliable. This paper aims to demonstrate that by adding sectionalizing
   circuit breakers into the busbars of the breaker-and-a-half
   configuration, the reliability of this substation design can be
   improved. Using a combinatorics-based approach to combining reliability
   indices of substation component failures, combined with using minimal
   cut sets of reliability graphs to identify failure scenarios, overall
   system failure rates were calculated for various substation topologies.
   The results demonstrate that the sectionalized breaker-and-a-half
   topology reduces the substation's failure rate by 70.8\% and its total
   annual downtime by 28.9\% compared to a typical breaker-and-a-half
   scheme, although at the cost of increasing the mean time to repair of a
   substation failure by 2.49 hours.}},

Abstract = {{Electric power grids throughout the world continue to suffer from
   massive blackouts with multibillion dollar cost to society. Most large
   blackouts involve a sequence of cascading outages. Once a critical
   component of a power system failed, the outages including generator and
   load trips can sequentially spread and frequently lead to large
   blackouts. Some of our previous work has proposed a sequential outage
   checker based cascading outage analysis model. In this paper, an
   improved cascading outage analysis model is proposed. Four outage
   checkers, namely the transient stability checker, the frequency outage
   checker, the line outage checker and the voltage outage checker are
   implemented. The outage checkers are operated according to a newly
   proposed algorithm to determine the status of the resulting operating
   state or equilibrium. Detailed modeling of the protection schemes,
   including rotor angle deviation relays, under frequency load shedding
   schemes, under/over voltage relays and over current relays are
   implemented. A case study of the improved cascading outage model using
   the IEEE 118-bus system and the IEEE 300-bus system is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic precision scaling is a promising technique to reduce power
   consumption in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems. Power savings
   are achieved by dynamically adapting word lengths to a time-varying
   environment. Typical applications are wireless communication systems
   that operate under different wireless channel conditions. One of the
   obstacles of such techniques is that they require an optimization of
   word lengths for all intermediate values at all possible operation
   points. This makes traditional simulation-based fixed-point optimization
   infeasible. In this paper, we study efficient heuristics to find optimal
   sets of word lengths for all variables in a system under a range of
   operating conditions. We exploit statistical analysis of quantization
   noise coupled with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) models of the
   channel environment. Applied to an example of a Fast Fourier Transform
   (FFT) block in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
   system, a more than 5,000x improvement in optimization time compared to
   an efficient simulation-based word length optimization method can be
   achieved.}},

   networks}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Distributed space-time block coding is a diversity technique to mitigate
   the effects of fading in multi-hop wireless networks, where multiple
   relay stages are used by a source to communicate with its destination.
   This article proposes a new distributed space-time block code called the
   cascaded orthogonal space-time block code (COSTBC) for the case where
   the source and destination are equipped with multiple antennas and each
   relay stage has one or more multiple antenna relays. Each relay stage is
   assumed to have receive channel state information (CSI) for all the
   channels from the source and all relays from previous stages to itself,
   while the destination is assumed to have receive CSI for all the
   channels. To construct the COSTBC, multiple orthogonal space-time block
   codes (OSTBCs) are used in cascade by the source and each relay stages.
   In the COSTBC, each relay stage separates the constellation symbols of
   the OSTBC sent by the preceding relay stage using its CSI, and then
   transmits another OSTBC to the next relay stage. COSTBCs are shown to
   achieve the maximum diversity gain in a multi-hop wireless network with
   linear decoding complexity thanks to the connection to OSTBCs. Several
   explicit constructions of COSTBCs are also provided, and their
   performance is simulated in different relay configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Motion can reduce the visibility of flicker distortions. We performed
   human subjective tests to investigate how motion influences the
   visibility of flicker distortions in naturalistic videos. Forty three
   naive subjects participated in two tasks ({''}follow the moving
   object{''} and ``view freely{''}) and reported their percepts on 36 test
   videos. Flicker distortions were simulated by periodic changes of video
   frames at different quality levels and flicker frequencies. An eye
   tracker was used to monitor each subject's gaze. The results indicate
   that the visibility of flicker distortions is strongly reduced when the
   speed of coherent motion is large, and the effect is more pronounced
   when the video quality is poor. We conjecture that sufficiently fast and
   coherent motions near the gaze point mask or `silence' the perception of
   flicker distortions in naturalistic videos in agreement with a recently
   observed `motion silencing' effect on synthetic stimuli.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Number = {{2369}},
Pages = {{59-67}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses a study to evaluate the benefits on a continuously
   reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP) of diamond grinding used
   specifically for improving pavement functionality in surface
   macrotexture, skid resistance, roughness, and noise. The effectiveness
   of diamond grinding in improving those properties is calculated on the
   basis of in-field observations. The effect of three preexisting
   conditions (carpet drag, burlap drag, and transverse tining) on the
   effectiveness of diamond grinding is also evaluated. The results of the
   analysis indicate that diamond grinding improved the surface
   macrotexture by 0.6 nun and skid resistance by about 60\%. The surface
   roughness of the diamond-ground sections was, on average, appreciably
   reduced, from 124 to 80 in./mi. An average overall reduction in noise
   level of 3.2 dB(A) was evident. A maximum reduction in the region of the
   noise frequencies (1,000 to 2,500 Hz) was observed, with a maximum noise
   reduction of 5.6 dB(A) at 1,600 Hz. The grinding operation produced a
   relatively uniform surface in relation to these properties despite the
   varying preexisting conditions across the CRCP.}},

Abstract = {{As has been noted in recent experiences, thunderstorms can cause damage
   to turbine units that are part of a wind farm because of the correlated
   wind inflow fields that these units can be subjected to simultaneously.
   We extend a model for simulating thunderstorm downburst events and their
   effects on a single turbine unit to situations where multiple units in a
   wind farm are subjected to correlated input from moving downbursts. The
   end-to-end simulation we describe involves first the generation of a
   downburst touchdown with associated downburst wind field and subsequent
   movement in the vicinity of a wind farm, comprised of a 6 x 4
   rectilinear arrangement of 5 MW 90-m hub-height turbines. The downburst
   model includes a slowly varying (non-turbulent) component and a
   turbulent component. The wind field model is developed and calibrated
   based on Doppler radar data on recorded downbursts. Results show that
   downbursts with different physical characteristics can lead to highly
   variable loads on units in the wind farm. (C) 2013 American Institute of

Title = {{Bidirectional Control Characteristics of General Motors and Optimal
   Velocity Car-Following Models Implications for Coordinated Driving in a
   Connected Vehicle Environment}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2381}},
Pages = {{110-119}},
Abstract = {{In natural traffic flow, the information from preceding vehicles
   predominantly determines driver behavior. With connected vehicle
   technologies, drivers can receive information from both preceding and
   following vehicles. This information creates new opportunities for
   vehicle coordination and control at the microscopic level on the basis
   of bidirectional information. Although bidirectional car-following
   models have been studied since the 1960s, most existing car-following
   models, especially those used by adaptive cruise control technologies,
   are still forward-only car-following models. This paper serves as a
   first step toward the use of bidirectional car-following models for
   microscopic vehicle coordination and control. The focus is on the study
   of the models' general control characteristics and impact on traffic
   flow stability. A general bidirectional control framework is proposed to
   convert any car-following model into its bidirectional form. Four
   representative General Motors and optimal velocity car-following models
   are reformulated and calibrated against field vehicle trajectory data
   collected in the next-generation simulation program (NGSIM). The
   bidirectional control characteristics of the selected models were
   evaluated by tuning of the percentage of backward information considered
   in the final car-following decision. The evaluation uses forward versus
   backward acceleration diagrams and a ring road stability analysis of
   equilibrium states obtained from NGSIM data. The results indicate that
   the increase in the contribution of backward information may help
   alleviate traffic congestion and stabilize traffic flow. An operating
   range of the backward information contribution of between 5\% and 20\%
   is recommended to ensure that the resulting models are still physical
   and realistic for both free-flow and congestion situations.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{142-150}},
Abstract = {{As the proportion of immigrants in the U.S. population continues to
   rise, it is becoming increasingly important to understand immigrants'
   residential location choices and travel behavior in the travel modeling
   and transportation policy making arena. This paper presents a joint
   model of choice of residential location and auto ownership that
   explicitly accounts for immigration status and length of stay in the
   United States as explanatory variables. Results of model estimation from
   the use of a San Francisco, California, Bay Area subsample of the 2009
   National Household Travel Survey show that immigration and length of
   stay are significant explanatory variables in both choice of residential
   location and auto ownership, with immigrants displaying assimilation
   effects (i.e., they increasingly resemble nonimmigrant households as the
   length of stay increases). Even after immigration effects have been
   controlled and residential location has been included as an explanatory
   variable in the auto ownership model, significant self-selection effects
   are likely to dampen estimates of the impacts of land use changes on
   travel behavior in policy forecasts. The paper demonstrates the need to
   account for immigration variables and self-selection effects in
   transportation forecasting models that inform policy decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Locating bugs is important, difficult, and expensive, particularly for
   large-scale systems. To address this, natural language information
   retrieval techniques are increasingly being used to suggest potential
   faulty source files given bug reports. While these techniques are very
   scalable, in practice their effectiveness remains low in accurately
   localizing bugs to a small number of files. Our key insight is that
   structured information retrieval based on code constructs, such as class
   and method names, enables more accurate bug localization. We present
   BLUiR, which embodies this insight, requires only the source code and
   bug reports, and takes advantage of bug similarity data if available. We
   build BLUiR on a proven, open source IR toolkit that anyone can use. Our
   work provides a thorough grounding of IR-based bug localization research
   in fundamental IR theoretical and empirical knowledge and practice. We
   evaluate BLUiR on four open source projects with approximately 3,400
   bugs. Results show that BLUiR matches or outperforms a current
   state-of-theart tool across applications considered, even when BLUiR
   does not use bug similarity data used by the other tool.}},

Abstract = {{Voltage droops resulting from inductive noise are common in
   state-of-the-art processors. Many of the techniques used to reduce
   energy consumption - clock gating, power gating, process shrinks, and
   voltage reduction - lead to increased voltage droops or increased
   sensitivity to voltage variations. Designers use voltage guardbands to
   minimize errors due to voltage fluctuations and inductive noise;
   however, this leads to lower performance because the voltage and
   frequency points are set to deal with voltage droops from a worst-case
   benchmark or stressmark. Although most applications do not approach the
   voltage droop caused by the stressmark, there is no mechanism to
   guarantee correct operation outside the tested range.
   In this paper, we examine floating-point issue throttling (FP
   throttling), a hardware technique that reduces worst-case voltage droop.
   By lowering the issue rate in the FP scheduler, the processor can
   significantly reduce the maximum voltage droop in the system. We show
   the impact of FP throttling on voltage droop, and translate this
   reduction in voltage droop to an increase in operating frequency (and
   hence increased performance) because an additional guardband is no
   longer required to guard against droops resulting from heavy FP usage.
   We then examine the impact of FP throttling and guardband reduction on
   the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks and show that some benchmarks benefit from
   the frequency improvements with FP throttling while others suffer due to
   reduced FP throughput.
   Finally, we present two techniques to determine dynamically when to
   trade FP throughput for reduced voltage margin and increased frequency,
   and show performance improvements of up to 15\% for CINT2006 benchmarks
   and up to 8\% for CFP2006 benchmarks. Our studies are done on hardware
   in which FP units generate the worst-case voltage droop. The technique
   can be modified for architectures in which other units cause the worst
   droop.}},

Abstract = {{Recent interest in approximate circuit design is driven by its potential
   for large energy savings. In this paper, we address the problem of
   approximate logic synthesis (ALS). ALS is concerned with formally
   synthesizing a minimum-cost approximate Boolean network whose behavior
   deviates in a well-defined manner from a specified exact Boolean
   function, where in this work, we allow the deviation to be constrained
   by both the magnitude and frequency of the error.
   We make two contributions in solving this general ALS problem: The first
   contribution is to establish that the approximate synthesis problem
   un-constrained by the frequency of errors is isomorphic with the Boolean
   relations (BR) minimization problem. That equivalence allows us to
   exploit recently developed fast algorithms for BR problems to solve the
   error magnitude-only constrained ALS problem. The second contribution is
   an efficient heuristic algorithm for iteratively refining the
   magnitude-constrained solution to arrive at a solution also satisfying
   the error frequency constraint.
   Our combined greedy approximate logic synthesis (GALS) approach is able
   to operate on any Boolean network for which the deviation measures can
   be specified and is most immediately applicable to arithmetic blocks.
   Experiments on adder and multiplier blocks demonstrate literal count
   reductions of up to 60\% under tight error frequency and magnitude
   constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Access to electric vehicle (EV) charging stations will affect EV
   adoption rates, use decisions, electrified mile shares, petroleum
   demand, and power consumption across times of day. Parking information
   from more than 30,000 records of personal trips in the Puget Sound,
   Washington, Regional Council's 2006 Household Activity Survey is used to
   determine public (nonresidential) parking locations and durations.
   Regression equations predict parking demand variables (i.e., total
   vehicle hours per zone or neighborhood and parked time per vehicle trip)
   as a function of site accessibility, local job and population density,
   trip attributes, and other variables available in most regions and
   travel surveys. Several of these variables are key inputs to a
   mixed-integer programming problem developed to determine optimal
   location assignments for EV charging stations. The algorithm minimizes
   EV users' costs for station access while penalizing unmet demand. This
   useful specification is used to determine the top locations for
   installing a constrained number of charging stations within 10 mi of the
   downtown area of Seattle, Washington, and shows how the access costs of
   charging location schemes respond to parking demand and station
   location. The models developed here are generalizable to data sets

Abstract = {{The ultimate goal of this work was to accurately predict attenuation
   from large tethered encapsulated bubbles used in an underwater noise
   abatement system. Measurements of underwater sound attenuation were
   obtained during a set of lake experiments, where a low-frequency sound
   source was surrounded by different arrays of encapsulated bubbles with
   various individual bubbles sizes and void fractions, and compared with
   an existing predictive model by Church {[}J. Acoust. Soc. Am. vol. 7,
   1510-1521 (1995)] for the dispersion relation in liquid containing
   encapsulated bubbles. Although Church's model was originally intended to
   describe ultrasound contrast agents, it was evaluated here for large
   bubbles (on the order of 10 cm) and fairly good quantitative agreement
   between the data and the model was observed. A modification of Church's
   model was made by combining it with Kargl's model {[}J. Acoust. Soc. Am.
   vol. 111, 168-173 (2002)], attempting to incorporate multiple scattering
   effects, which may be important at high void fractions. However, a
   comparison with the data indicates that the Church-Kargl hybrid as
   implemented here may overcompensate for these effects. These results
   indicate that Church's model is sufficient for use as a design tool for
   tethered encapsulated bubble screens with void fractions less than 2\%.}},

Abstract = {{Delay line ADCs become more and more attractive with technology scaling
   to smaller dimensions with lower voltages. However, linearity, which has
   always been an issue, becomes a problem with longer delay lines.
   Resolutions of reported delay-line ADCs are hardly more than 4 bits with
   sampling rates of hundreds of MHz. In this paper, we present a technique
   which extends harmonic distortion correction techniques to digital
   calibration of a delay-line ADC. In our simulation results, digital
   calibration improves SNDR and SFDR to 42.5 dB and 45.4 dB, respectively,
   compared with the original SNDR of 25.6 dB and the original SFDR of 25.7
   dB. This strongly supports the scalability of delay line ADCs and their
   improved performance in further scaled fabrication processes.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we explore mobility in a cluttered, uneven and dynamic
   environment where collisions are inevitable. In particular, we study a
   mobile robot's ability to precisely track a planned path on an inclined
   surface, then respond to unknown collisions by using force compliance
   and estimation of the obstacle's surface normal. In addition, once the
   contact disturbance disappears, the robot merges automatically back to
   its original planned path. This study aims at highlighting the need to
   safely deal with unexpected collisions with external objects and use
   them to move alongside their contour, opening opportunities perhaps to
   use contacts as supporting structures. At the same time, it aims to
   endow capabilities for precise maneuvering in the rough terrains. Our
   newly designed compliant omnidirectional robot is able to quickly
   respond to contacts through the use of current control and absolute
   position / orientation sensing. A whole-body controller developed by the
   Human Centered Robotics Lab is used to compensate for gravity and create
   new multicontact constraints in response to the collisions. To pursue
   the study, we built the mobile base and a multicontact experimental
   setup. The results show that our model-based controller successfully
   accomplishes the tasks with good precision while relying on data-driven
   contact estimation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel video stabilization method for cell phone cameras.
   Our video stabilization is based on a pure 3D rotation motion model,
   which can better capture the motion of the camera compared with 2D
   models. 3D camera rotation can be reliably captured by a gyroscope as
   commonly found on a smart phone or tablet. In this paper we directly
   smooth the sequence of camera rotation matrices for the video frames.
   Our contributions are (1) a smoothness metric for a sequence of 3D
   rotation matrices based on geodesic distance on a non-linear manifold,
   and (2) an efficient global motion smoothing algorithm using manifold
   optimization. Our smoothness metric better exploits the manifold
   structure of sequences of rotation matrices. Experimental results show
   that our video stabilization method outperforms state-of-the-art methods

Abstract = {{Newly developed HTTP-based video streaming technology enables flexible
   rate-adaptation in varying channel conditions. The users' Quality of
   Experience (QoE) of rate-adaptive HTTP video streams, however, is not
   well understood. Therefore, designing QoE-optimized rate-adaptive video
   streaming algorithms remains a challenging task. An important aspect of
   understanding and modeling QoE is to be able to predict the
   up-to-the-moment subjective quality of video as it is played. We propose
   a dynamic system model to predict the time-varying subjective quality
   (TVSQ) of rate-adaptive videos that is transported over HTTP. For this
   purpose, we built a video database and measured TVSQ via a subjective
   study. A dynamic system model is developed using the database and the
   measured human data. We show that the proposed model can effectively
   predict the TVSQ of rate-adaptive videos in an online manner, which is
   necessary to be able to conduct QoE-optimized online rate-adaptation for

Abstract = {{Smooth muscle cells (SMC) are critical in stabilizing developing
   vascular networks, and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1)
   has been shown to promote SMC differentiation from stem cells.
   Previously, our lab has developed a chemically modified fibrin-based
   hydrogel that induces endothelial cell (EC) phenotype and network
   formation from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) without exogenous
   cytokines. Additionally, we have shown that this hydrogel system is
   capable of releasing growth factors in a controlled manner. In the
   present work, the effects of TGF-beta 1 on hMSCs in both monolayer and
   fibrin-based gel culture systems were demonstrated. The objective was to
   enhance SMC properties through TGF-beta 1 signaling for vessel stability
   while maintaining EC gene expression and morphology. Proliferation was
   decreased with higher TGF-beta 1 concentration in both monolayer and 3D
   gel cultures. EC genes were predominantly downregulated in the presence
   of TGF-beta 1 in monolayer cultures, while SMC genes were generally
   upregulated. In fibrin-based gels, several SMC genes were significantly
   upregulated at high concentrations of TGF-beta 1. Even at elevated
   TGF-beta 1 concentrations, no significant differences were seen in EC
   genes for hMSCs in gels compared to controls. Network formation and
   growth occurred in PEGylated fibrin gels loaded with TGF-beta 1 and were
   not significantly different from gels without loaded growth factor.
   Additionally, production of smooth muscle a-actin (SMA) was
   significantly increased in gels loaded with TGF-beta 1. These results
   demonstrate a simultaneous response of hMSCs to both the 3D biomatrix
   and cytokine signaling cues.}},

Title = {{A COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL BAYESIAN INVERSE
   PROBLEMS PART I: THE LINEARIZED CASE, WITH APPLICATION TO GLOBAL SEISMIC
   INVERSION}},

Abstract = {{We present a computational framework for estimating the uncertainty in
   the numerical solution of linearized infinite-dimensional statistical
   inverse problems. We adopt the Bayesian inference formulation: given
   observational data and their uncertainty, the governing forward problem
   and its uncertainty, and a prior probability distribution describing
   uncertainty in the parameter field, find the posterior probability
   distribution over the parameter field. The prior must be chosen
   appropriately in order to guarantee well-posedness of the
   infinite-dimensional inverse problem and facilitate computation of the
   posterior. Furthermore, straightforward discretizations may not lead to
   convergent approximations of the infinite-dimensional problem. And
   finally, solution of the discretized inverse problem via explicit
   construction of the covariance matrix is prohibitive due to the need to
   solve the forward problem as many times as there are parameters. Our
   computational framework builds on the infinite-dimensional formulation
   proposed by Stuart {[}Acta Numer., 19 (2010), pp. 451-559] and
   incorporates a number of components aimed at ensuring a convergent
   discretization of the underlying infinite-dimensional inverse problem.
   The framework additionally incorporates algorithms for manipulating the
   prior, constructing a low rank approximation of the data-informed
   component of the posterior covariance operator, and exploring the
   posterior that together ensure scalability of the entire framework to
   very high parameter dimensions. We demonstrate this computational
   framework on the Bayesian solution of an inverse problem in
   three-dimensional global seismic wave propagation with hundreds of
   thousands of parameters.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{B1235-B1266}},
Abstract = {{We study the reactive flow in a thin strip where the geometry changes
   take place due to reactions. Specifically, we consider
   precipitation-dissolution processes taking place at the lateral
   boundaries of the strip. The geometry changes depend on the
   concentration of the solute in the bulk (trace of the concentration),
   which makes the problem a free-moving boundary problem. The numerical
   computations are challenging in view of the nonlinearities in the
   description of the reaction rates. In addition to this, the movement of
   the boundary depends on the unknown concentration (and hence part of the
   solution), and the computation of the coupled model remains a delicate
   issue. Our aim is to develop appropriate numerical techniques for the
   computation of the solutions of the coupled convection-diffusion problem
   and the equation describing the geometry changes. The performance is
   demonstrated with the help of several numerical tests.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed study on the reliability of suction caissons for moorings of

   considering mooring line tensions and suction caisson capacity at the

   simulations using a plastic limit model calibrated to numerical
   computations using finite element modeling. Loading for catenary and
   taut-leg mooring systems were considered for the reliability analyses;
   loads were expressed as functions of uncertain metocean variables by
   means of response surfaces. Reliability analyses were carried using
   FORM. Linear relationships were established between the logarithm of
   failure probability and caisson length for both cases of mooring
   systems. Partial safety factors for capacity, and mean and dynamic line
   tensions were calibrated separately for caissons in connection to
   catenary and taut-leg moorings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   sum-of-squares unit has less latency, area, and power consumption than
   the floating-point dot-product units and the discrete parallel

   architecture is used, its significand squarer is faster and smaller than
   normal significand multipliers, and the sub-modules related to
   subtraction can be removed. Furthermore, compound addition can be
   applied to the fused sum-of-squares unit to enhance the performance in
   the single-path addition. Compared with the fused floating-point

Abstract = {{This paper considers the modifications required to transform a
   highly-efficient, specialized linear algebra core into an efficient
   engine for computing Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). We review the
   minimal changes required to support Radix-4 FFT computations and propose
   extensions to the micro-architecture of the baseline linear algebra
   core. Along the way, we study the critical differences between the two
   classes of algorithms. Special attention is paid to the configuration of
   the on-chip memory system to support high utilization. We examine design
   trade-offs between efficiency, specialization and flexibility, and their
   effects both on the core and memory hierarchy for a unified design as
   compared to dedicated accelerators for each application. The final
   design is a flexible architecture that can perform both classes of
   applications. Results show that the proposed hybrid FFT/Linear Algebra
   core can achieve 26.6 GFLOPS/S with a power efficiency of 40 GFLOPS/W,
   which is up to 100X and 40X more energy efficient than cutting-edge CPUs
   and GPUs, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells are a promising
   alternative energy technology, but a thorough understanding of charge
   transport behavior in BHJ materials is necessary in order to design
   devices with high power conversion efficiencies. Parameters such as
   carrier mobilities, carrier concentrations, and the recombination
   coefficient have traditionally been successfully measured using vertical
   structures similar to organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. We have
   developed a lateral BHJ device which complements these vertical
   techniques by allowing spatially resolved measurement along the
   transport direction of charge carriers. This is essential for evaluating
   the effect of nanoscale structure and morphology on these important
   charge transport parameters. Nanomorphology in organic BHJ films has
   been controlled using a variety of methods, but the effect of these
   procedures has been infrequently correlated with the charge transport
   parameter of the BHJ material. Electron beam lithography has been used
   to create lateral device structures with many voltage probes at a
   sub-micron resolution throughout the device channel. By performing
   in-situ potentiometry, we can calculate both carrier mobilities and
   determine the effect of solvent choice and annealing procedure on the
   charge transport in BHJ system. Spin coated P3HT: PCBM films prepared
   from solutions in chloroform and o-xylene are characterized using this
   technique.

Abstract = {{Graphene presents interesting opportunities but also faces unique
   challenges for applications in nanoelectronics. As a gapless
   semiconductor, with an inert surface that is difficult to grow high
   quality gate dielectrics on, or chemically dope, it can be challenging
   to make graphene field effect transistors (GFETs) with low leakage
   currents, low interface state densities, and low source/drain series
   resistance. However, the Dirac cone bandstructure with high a Fermi
   velocity enables high frequency GFETs with ambipolar characteristics
   which can be used, for instance, in simple frequency doublers.

Abstract = {{Many strong silicon physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are known to be
   vulnerable to machine-learning attacks due to linear separability of the
   output function. This significantly limits their potential as reliable
   security primitives. We introduce a novel strong silicon PUF based on
   the exponential current-voltage behavior in subthreshold region of FET
   operation which injects strong nonlinearity into the response of the
   PUF. The PUF, which we term subthreshold current array (SCA) PUF, is
   implemented as a pair of two-dimensional n X k transistor arrays with
   all devices subject to stochastic variability operating in subthreshold
   region. Our PUF is fundamentally different from earlier attempts to
   inject nonlinearity via digital control techniques, which could also be
   used with SCA-PUF. Voltages produced by nominally identical arrays are
   compared to produce a random binary response.
   SCA-PUF shows excellent security properties. The average inter-class
   Hamming distance, a measure of uniqueness, is 50.2\%. The average
   intra-class Hamming distance, a measure of response stability, is
   4.17\%. Crucially, we demonstrate that the introduced PUF is much less
   vulnerable to modeling attacks. Using machine-learning techniques of
   support-vector machine with radial basis function kernel and logistic
   regression for best nonlinear learnability, we observe that
   ``information leakage{''} (rate of error reduction with learning) is
   much lower than for delay-based PUF. Over a wide range of the number of
   observed challenge-response pairs, the error rate is 3-35X higher than
   for the delay-based PUF. We also demonstrate an enhanced SCA-PUF design
   utilizing XOR scrambling and show that it has an up to 30X higher error
   rate compared to the XOR delay-based PUF.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new optimization model for addressing the problem
   of planning pavement maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction
   (MRR) for a large-scale road network. In the past, this problem has
   usually been formulated as a linear programming or integer programming
   model. The solutions obtained from those models determine the timing,
   location, and type of treatment needed to perform the MRR operation for
   a given planning horizon. A shortcoming of such models is that the
   sections selected for MRR are usually distributed spatially across the
   network, and this distribution makes it difficult to plan and implement
   MRR activities in a coordinated manner. To take advantage of economies
   of scale, adjacent road sections with similar MRR needs should be
   maintained within a single project. However, the idea of automatically
   combining adjacent sections into one large project has not been given
   serious attention in existing optimization models for pavement MRR
   planning. This paper proposes a new approach to pavement MRR planning
   that utilizes the spatial structure of the road network. The road
   network is first partitioned into groups of adjacent sections, or MRR
   projects, with similar MRR needs. Then a knapsack problem is solved to
   optimally allocate resources to selected MRR projects with the objective
   of maximizing system performance.}},

Abstract = {{TSV-induced stress is an important issue in 3D IC design since it leads
   to serious reliability problems and influences device performance.
   Existing finite element method can provide accurate analysis for the
   stress of simple TSV placement, but is not scalable to larger designs
   due to its expensive memory consumption and high run time. On the
   contrary, linear superposition method is efficient to analyze stress in
   full-chip scale, but sometimes it fails to provide an accurate
   estimation since it neglects the stress induced by interactions between
   TSVs. In this paper we propose an accurate two-stage semi-analytical
   framework for full-chip TSV-induced stress modeling. In addition to the
   linear superposition, we characterize the stress induced by interactions
   between TSVs to provide more accurate full-chip modeling. Experimental
   results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly
   improve the accuracy of linear superposition method with reasonable
   overhead in run time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an efficient algorithm to synthesize prefix graph
   structures that yield adders with the best performance-area trade-off.
   For designing a parallel prefix adder of a given bit-width, our approach
   generates prefix graph structures to optimize an objective function such
   as size of prefix graph subject to constraints like bit-wise output
   logic level. Besides having the best performance-area trade-off our
   approach, unlike existing techniques, can (i) handle more complex
   constraints such as maximum node fanout or wire-length that impact the
   performance/area of a design and (ii) generate several feasible
   solutions that minimize the objective function. Generating several
   optimal solutions provides the option to choose adder designs that
   mitigate constraints such as wire congestion or power consumption that
   are difficult to model as constraints during logic synthesis.
   Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves performance
   by 3\% and area by 9\% over even a 64-bit full custom designed adder
   implemented in an industrial high-performance design.}},

Abstract = {{Model-based predictive control for buildings is an active area of
   research. Significant effort has been placed on developing accurate and
   computationally efficient reduced-order models that can be implemented
   in predictive controllers. During a building's design and construction
   process, detailed building models are often created by experienced
   building modelers. These models are often too complex to be directly
   implemented in control applications. Reducing these models to low-order
   models can be time-consuming and require additional skills beyond those
   possessed by building modelers. In this paper we demonstrate simple
   reduction of building models using the OpenStudio analysis framework in
   a script-based environment. OpenStudio is a cross-platform tool for
   modeling and analysis of building energy systems. A reduced-order model
   is created for a simple building and an economic-based model predictive
   controller is used to minimize summertime cooling costs in an
   electricity market with real-time pricing.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a singular perturbations framework for the
   dynamic analysis and model reduction of building models. Working with a
   prototype building, we present a theoretical justification of the
   empirically acknowledged multiple time scale dynamic response of
   buildings, and develop a mathematically rigorous methodology for
   deriving reduced-order models for the dynamics in each time scale. Our
   analysis accounts for the potential use of Heat Recovery Ventilators
   (HRVs), and we show that their presence leads to the emergence of a
   dynamic behavior with three time scales, including an overall,
   system-wide component which involves both the building and the HVAC
   system. The second part of the paper presents a simulation case study,
   where we demonstrate the use of the derived reduced-order models in the
   synthesis of a nonlinear predictive model-based optimal energy
   management strategy for a single-zone test building situated on the
   University of Texas campus. The proposed controller exhibits excellent
   performance, can easily be executed in real-time and its application
   results in significant energy savings compared to setpoint tracking
   strategies.}},

   control. This scheme is compared to a classical PID/logic based control
   scheme and is found to provide superior output responses with smaller
   settling times and less oscillatory behavior in response to disturbances
   in electric loads. The NMPC solution is obtained by applying orthogonal
   collocation on finite elements to convert the dynamic problem to a set
   of algebraic equations, which can be solved as a nonlinear programming
   (NLP) problem. This NLP problem is then solved using analytical
   derivatives and an interior-point algorithm to ensure fast solution
   times. The computation time at each control step was sufficiently faster

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of characterizing an optimal Voronoi-like
   partition aimed at providing a baseline solution to a special class of
   target assignment problems involving teams of spatially distributed
   vehicles. It is assumed that the motion of each vehicle is described by
   a second order mechanical system with time-varying linear or affine
   dynamics. The Voronoi-like partition encodes information regarding the
   proximity relations between the vehicles and arbitrary target points in
   the plane, which are induced, in turn, by a non-symmetric (generalized)
   distance function that incorporates the vehicle dynamics. In particular,
   the generalized distance is taken to be the minimum square integral
   control associated with the transition of a vehicle to an arbitrary
   target point with (approximately) zero terminal velocity at a fixed
   final time. The space we wish to partition corresponds to the union of
   all the terminal positions that can be attained by each vehicle with
   approximately zero terminal velocity using finite control effort.
   Consequently, the partition is computed over a space with a lower
   dimension than the state space of each vehicle. We present an efficient
   computational scheme for the characterization of the Voronoi-like
   partition, which utilizes the one-to-one correspondence between the
   level sets of the cost-to-go and the Euclidean distance functions.
   Simulation results that illustrate the theoretical developments are

Abstract = {{This paper presents lossless convexification for a class of finite
   horizon optimal control problems with non-convex control constraints and
   quadratic state constraints. Some special cases where the state at most
   touches the state constraint have been addressed previously in the
   literature. In this paper, the convexification results are generalized
   to allow optimal trajectories with boundary arcs. There are a number of
   practical examples that belong to the class of problems studied here.
   The optimal control problems considered have convex cost, specialized
   linear dynamics, quadratic state constraints, and non-convex control
   constraints. Hence, the control constraints are the single source of
   non-convexity. The control set is relaxed to a convex set by introducing
   a scalar slack variable. It is shown that optimal solutions of the
   relaxed problem are also optimal solutions of the original problem,
   hence the term lossless convexification. The main contribution of this
   paper is to extend the lossless convexification to the problem with
   quadratic state constraints. The proof uses a maximum principle with
   state variable inequality constraints and requires an assumption on the
   bounds of an external disturbance. A numerical example is presented to
   illustrate the approach. Because the numerical problem is a second order
   cone problem, convergence to the global minimum is guaranteed in a
   deterministic, finite number of steps.}},

Abstract = {{Microchannel catalytic plate reactors are a promising route for
   converting methane from geographically distributed sources (e. g., shale
   gas deposits) to hydrogen or liquid transportation fuels. Their capacity
   is easily scalable by increasing the number of units and thus well
   suited to distributed production needs. However, miniaturization
   inevitably reduces the number of available actuators and sensors, and
   the control of these inherently distributed systems presents challenges.
   In the present paper, we concentrate on autothermal microchannel
   reactors producing hydrogen via methane-steam reforming, and introduce a
   novel temperature control strategy based on the use of a layer of
   phase-change material (PCM) confined between the reactor plates. The PCM
   layer, which mitigates temperature excursions through
   melting-solidification occurring due to fluctuations in hydrogen
   production rate, acts as the distributed tier of a hierarchical control
   structure. The supervisory layer consists of a model-based feedforward
   controller. We also introduce a novel stochastic optimization method for
   selecting the PCM layer thickness (i.e., for distributed controller
   ``tuning{''}). The proposed approach is tested in simulations carried
   out on a detailed 2D reactor model, showing excellent disturbance
   rejection performance.}},

Abstract = {{During regular use, mobile devices generate significant amounts of heat.
   In this paper, we discuss the use of phase-change materials (PCM) as an
   energy storage medium to lower the energy consumption of temperature
   control devices in mobile systems. We adopt a systems perspective and
   show that the fundamental effect of latent-heat storage is to increase
   the time constant of the response of the system to changes in heat input
   without affecting the gain. We also demonstrate that PCM-based cooling
   reduces energy consumption when used in conjunction with active cooling
   in a hierarchical control structure, and establish a connection between
   the dynamics of the integrated system, energy savings and the quantity
   and geometric properties of the PCM elements. Composite heat sinks
   consisting of PCM elements confined in a matrix material with high
   thermal conductivity represent a promising practical implementation of
   PCM-based cooling. Using a first-principles model and a novel algorithm,
   we present a method for optimizing the size and number of the PCM
   elements in the matrix, which effectively amounts to ``tuning{''} the
   PCM-based controller. We study the PCM-enhanced thermal management of a
   computer microchip to illustrate the theoretical concepts.}},

Abstract = {{We review a wide range of absorbers based on patterned resistive sheets
   for use in mid-wave and long-wave infrared microbolometers. These
   structures range from wavelength selective dielectric coated Salisbury
   screens to patterned resistive sheets to stacked multi-spectral devices.
   For basic three color devices in the LWIR band we have designed and
   fabricated wavelength selective dielectric coated Salisbury screen (DSS)
   absorbers suitable for use in microbolometers. In order to produce
   wavelength selective narrowband absorption, the general design rules for
   DSS microbolometers show that the thickness of the air gap should be a
   half wavelength and the optical thickness of the dielectric support
   layer should be a quarter wavelength. This structure is also air gap
   tunable; i.e., by varying only air gap thickness, the center wavelength
   of the absorption curve is shifted. FTIR microscope measurements have
   been made on a number of the different devices demonstrating three color
   capability in the LWIR while maintain very high efficiency absorption.
   We have also shown that the use of a patterned resistive sheet
   consisting of a properly sized array of cross-shaped holes acts as a
   polarization independent frequency-selective absorber allowing a
   three-color system spanning the 7-14 micron band. For realistic metal
   layers the skin effect produces complex surface impedance that can be
   quite large in the LWIR band. We have shown that metal layers of
   thickness between one and three skin depths can act as the absorber
   layer, and have shown that thick metal layers can still produce
   excellent absorption in the LWIR. Holes in the dielectric support layer
   also reduce the thermal mass in the system without compromising spectral
   selectivity. Broadband designs using rectangular holes that produce
   substantially reduced thermal mass (over 50\%) while maintaining
   efficient spectral absorption have also been found Finally, we have
   considered multispectral stacked structures, including Jaumann absorbers
   and stacked dipole/slot patterned resistive sheets. These structures
   promise either two band (MWIR/LWIR) or two to three color LWIR in a
   multi-layer stacked pixel.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a three dimensional model that simulates the
   operation of two particular configurations of a lithium iron phosphate
   (LiFePO4) battery - spirally wound and prismatically wound.
   Understanding how these batteries operate is important for the design,
   optimization, and control of their performance, safety and durability.
   While 1D approximations may be sufficient for small scale or single cell
   batteries, these approximations are limited when scaled up to larger
   batteries, where significant three dimensional gradients might develop
   including lithium ion concentration, temperature, current density and
   voltage gradients. The model presented here accounts for all of these
   gradients in three dimensions by coupling an electrochemical model with
   a thermal model. This coupling demonstrates how electrochemical
   performance affects temperature distribution and to a lesser extent how
   temperature affects electrochemical performance. Results generated
   include temperature influences on current distribution and vice versa,
   an exploration of various cooling environments' effects on performance,
   design optimization of current collector thickness and current collector
   tab placement, an analysis of lithium plating risk, and a comparison of
   energy density between the two configurations. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{Silicon microelectronics on unconventional substrates has led to
   numerous unprecedented applications. Inspired by the great success, it
   is a natural desire to integrate silicon photonic circuitry on
   unconventional substrates in the hope of extending the applicability
   range of silicon photonics to a multitude of novel hybrid silicon
   photonic devices. However, photonic devices usually have larger
   dimensions and more complicated morphologies. The transfer method used
   in electronics cannot be applied directly to transfer photonic devices.
   Here, we propose a low temperature transfer technique based on adhesive
   bonding and deep reactive ion etching. A defect-free transfer of 2 cm x
   2 cm, 250 nm thick silicon nanomembrane onto a glass slide has been

Abstract = {{We study routing and scheduling algorithms for relay-assisted,
   multi-channel downlink wireless networks (e. g., OFDM-based cellular
   systems with relays). Over such networks, while it is well understood
   that the BackPressure algorithm is stabilizing (i.e., queue lengths do
   not become arbitrarily large), its performance (e. g., delay, buffer
   usage) can be poor.
   In this paper, we study an alternative - the MaxWeight algorithm -
   variants of which are known to have good performance in a single-hop
   setting. In a general relay setting however, MaxWeight is not even
   stabilizing (and thus can have very poor performance). In this paper, we
   study an iterative MaxWeight algorithm for routing and scheduling in
   downlink multi-channel relay networks. We show that, surprisingly, the
   iterative MaxWeight algorithm can stabilize the system in several
   large-scale instantiations of this setting (e. g., general arrivals with
   full-duplex relays, bounded arrivals with half-duplex relays). Further,
   using both many-channel large-deviations analysis and simulations, we
   show that iterative MaxWeight outperforms the BackPressure algorithm
   from a queue-length/delay perspective.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the design of cross-layer opportunistic transport
   for stored video over wireless networks with a slow varying (average)
   capacity. We focus on two key ideas: (1) scheduling data transmissions
   when capacity is high; and (2), exploiting knowledge of future capacity
   variations. The latter is possible when users' mobility is known or
   predictable, e. g., users riding on public transportation or using
   navigation systems. We consider the design of cross-layer transmission
   schedules which minimize system utilization (and thus possibly
   transmit/receive energy) while avoiding, if at all possible,
   rebuffering/delays, in several scenarios. For the single-user
   anticipative case where all future capacity variations are known
   beforehand; we establish the optimal transmission schedule is a
   Generalized Piecewise Constant Thresholding (GPCT) scheme. For the
   single-user partially anticipative case where only a finite window of
   future capacity variations is known, we propose an online Greedy Fixed
   Horizon Control (GFHC). An upper bound on the competitive ratio of GFHC
   and GPCT is established showing how performance loss depends on the
   window size, receiver playback buffer, and capacity variability. Finally
   we consider the multiuser case where we can exploit both future temporal
   and multiuser diversity. Our simulations and evaluation based on a
   measured wireless capacity trace exhibit robust potential gains for our
   proposed transmission schemes.}},

Abstract = {{While many studies have examined the effects mechanical forces on vSMCs,
   there is a limited understanding of how the different arterial strain
   waveforms that occur in disease and different vascular beds alter vSMC
   mechanotransduction and phenotype. Here, we present a novel system for
   applying complex, time-varying strain waveforms to cultured cells and
   use this system to understand how these waveforms can alter vSMC
   phenotype and signaling. We have developed a highly adaptable cell
   culture system that allows the application of mechanical strain to cells
   in culture and can reproduce the complex dynamic mechanical environment
   experienced by arterial cells in the body. Using this system, we
   examined whether the type of applied strain waveform altered phenotypic
   modulation of vSMCs by mechanical forces. Cells exposed to the brachial
   waveform had increased phosphorylation of AKT, EGR-1, c-Fos expression
   and cytoskeletal remodeling in comparison to cells treated with the
   aortic waveform. In addition, vSMCs exposed to physiological waveforms
   had adopted a more differentiated phenotype in comparison to those
   treated with static or sinusoidal cyclic strain, with increased
   expression of vSMC markers desmin, calponin and SM-22 as well as
   increased expression of regulatory miRNAs including miR-143, -145 and
   -221. Taken together, our studies demonstrate the development of a novel
   system for applying complex, time-varying mechanical forces to cells in
   culture. In addition, we have shown that physiological strain waveforms
   have powerful effects on vSMC phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Transient errors during execution of a process running on a processor
   can lead to serious system failures or security lapses. It is necessary
   to detect, and if possible, correct these errors before any damage is
   caused to the system. Of the many approaches, monitoring the control
   flow of an application during runtime is one of the techniques used for
   transient error detection during an application execution. Although
   promising, the cost of implementing the control flow checks in software
   has been prohibitively high and hence is not widely used in practice. In
   this paper we describe a hardware based control flow monitoring
   technique which has the capability to detect errors in control flow and
   the instruction stream being executed on a processor. Our technique
   achieves a high coverage of control flow error detection (99.98\%) and
   has the capability to quickly recover from the error, making it
   resilient to transient control flow errors. It poses an extremely low
   performance overhead (similar to 1\%) and reasonable area cost (< 6\%)
   to the host processor. The framework for runtime monitoring of control
   flow described in this paper can be extended to efficiently monitor and
   detect any transient errors in the execution of instructions on a
   processor.}},

Abstract = {{As the complexity of integrated circuit design increases and production
   schedules become shorter, the dependency on post-silicon validation for
   capturing design errors that escape from pre-silicon verification also
   increases. A major challenge in post-silicon validation is the limited
   observability of internal states caused by the limited storage capacity
   available for post-silicon validation. Recent research has shown that
   observability can be enhanced if trace and scan signals are combined
   together, compared with the debugging scenario where only trace signals
   are monitored. This paper proposes an enhanced and systematic algorithm
   for the efficient combination of trace and scan signals to maximize the
   observability of internal circuit states. Experimental results on
   benchmark circuits show that the proposed technique provides a higher
   number of restored states compared to the existing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{A highly efficient SOC test compression scheme which uses sequential
   linear decompressors local to each core is proposed. Test data is stored
   on the tester in compressed form and brought over the TAM to the core
   before being decompressed. Very high encoding efficiency is achieved by
   providing the ability to share free variables across test cubes being
   compressed at the same time as well as in subsequent time steps. The
   idea of retaining unused non-pivot free variables when decompressing one
   test cube to help for encoding subsequent test cubes that was introduced
   in {[}Muthyala 12] is applied here in the context of SOC testing. It is
   shown that in this application, a first-in first-out (FIFO) buffer is
   not required. The ability to retain excess free variables rather than
   wasting them when the decompressor is reset avoids the need for high
   precision in matching the number of free variables used for encoding
   with the number of care bits. This allows greater flexibility in test
   scheduling to reduce test time, tester storage, and control complexity
   as indicated by the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the competition among the primary users (PUs) in
   a Dynamic Spectrum Leasing (DSL) system where multiple PUs lease
   spectrum to the secondary users (SUs) for monetary rewards. Considering
   the uncertainties of the PUs' channel gains and of the SUs' demands for
   spectrum, the competition among the PUs is formulated as a stochastic
   Nash game. Due to the uncertainties, the PUs aim to maximize their long
   term utilities which are related to the income from leasing spectrum and
   to their quality of service (QoS) conditions. Resorting to the
   stochastic variational inequality (SVI) theory, we investigate the
   existence and uniqueness of the stochastic Nash equilibrium (SNE). Based
   on the stochastic approximation theory, we propose a distributed
   learning algorithm for computing the SNE of the game. Rigorous
   convergence proof of the algorithm is provided. Besides, the features of

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an architecture for powering green mobile networks
   with a majority of renewable sources. The architecture makes use of wind
   turbines and photovoltaic panels as sources of electric power for

   the cellular network in a microgrid configuration. The microgrid
   configuration allows for a more efficient management of electric
   resources and a more resilient cellular system architecture. In
   addition, the microgid configuration allows for a management of the
   cellular network resources more tightly coupled with the electric power
   grid status and viceversa. The presented results will show that it is
   possible to power a cellular network from renewable source for us much
   as 90 \% of the time. This work also discussed traffic shaping and
   management techniques so as to power off one cell to increase the use of
   renewable energy sources even when the traffic is not at a low level.
   The technique is effective in maintaining within reasonable values the
   reduction of voice traffic quality and the increasing in data queuing

Abstract = {{Motivated by promising demonstrations of carbon nanotube (CNT)
   electrodes in supercapacitors, we evaluate the capacitive performance of
   a (6,6) CNT in {[}BMIM]{[}PF6] ionic liquid (IL), with particular
   attention to the relative contributions of the electric double layer
   (EDL) capacitance (C-D) at the CNT/IL interface and the quantum
   capacitance (C-Q) of the CNT. Our classical molecular dynamics
   simulations reveal that the use of the CNT improves C-D when compared to
   planar graphene, which we discuss in terms of how the electrode
   curvature affects both the electric field strength and IL packing
   density. In addition, according to density functional theory
   calculations, the C-Q of the CNT is constant and significantly larger
   than that of graphene near the Fermi level, which is a consequence of
   the larger number of available electron states in the CNT. Our study
   also shows that the relative performance of the CNT- and graphene-based
   electrodes can be a strong function of applied voltage, which we
   attribute to the shifting contributions of C-Q and C-D.}},

   nanocrystals with varied Se to (S + Se) ratio, the role of Se in
   Cu2ZnSn(S1-xSex)(4) nanocrystals during the sulfurization step is
   systematically investigated. The loss of Sn is suppressed and the grain
   size is enlarged when the Se in Cu2ZnSn(S1-xSex)(4) nanocrystals is
   replaced by S during the sulfurization. As a proof-of-concept, our

Abstract = {{This paper presents improved architectures for a floating-point fused
   two-term dot product unit. The floating-point fused dot product unit is
   useful for a wide variety of digital signal processing (DSP)
   applications including complex multiplication and fast Fourier transform
   (FFT) and discrete cosine transform (DCT) butterfly operations. In order
   to improve the performance, a new alignment scheme, early normalization,
   a four-input leading zero anticipation (LZA), a dual-path algorithm, and
   pipelining are applied. The proposed designs are implemented for single
   precision and synthesized with a 45nm standard cell library. The
   proposed dual-path design reduces the latency by 25\% compared to the
   traditional floating-point fused dot product unit. Based on a data flow
   analysis, the proposed design can be split into three pipeline stages.
   Since the latencies of the three stages are fairly well balanced, the
   throughput is increased by a factor of 2.8 compared to the non-pipelined
   dual-path design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the mapping of algorithms encountered when solving
   dense linear systems and linear leastsquares problems to a custom Linear
   Algebra Processor. Specifically, the focus is on Cholesky, LU (with
   partial pivoting), and QR factorizations. As part of the study, we
   expose the benefits of redesigning floating point units and their
   surrounding data-paths to support these complicated operations. We show
   how adding moderate complexity to the architecture greatly alleviates
   complexities in the algorithm. We study design trade-offs and the
   effectiveness of architectural modifications to demonstrate that we can
   improve power and performance efficiency to a level that can otherwise
   only be expected of full-custom ASIC designs.
   A feasibility study shows that our extensions to the MAC units can
   double the speed of required vector-norm operations while reducing
   energy by 60\%. Similarly, up to 20\% speedup with 15\% savings in
   energy can be achieved for LU factorization. We show how such efficiency
   is maintained even in the complex inner kernels of these operations.}},

   Many such designs are based off of a linear approximation algorithm

Abstract = {{Atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) is a key source of ambient
   ultrafine particles that may contribute substantially to the global
   production of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). While NPF is driven by
   atmospheric nucleation, its impact on CCN concentration depends strongly
   on atmospheric growth mechanisms since the growth rate must exceed the
   loss rate due to scavenging in order for the particles to reach the CCN
   size range. In this work, chemical composition measurements of 20 nm
   diameter particles during NPF in Hyytiala, Finland, in March-April 2011
   permit identification and quantitative assessment of important growth
   channels. In this work we show the following: (A) sulfuric acid, a key
   species associated with atmospheric nucleation, accounts for less than
   half of particle mass growth during this time period; (B) the sulfate
   content of a growing particle during NPF is quantitatively explained by
   condensation of gas-phase sulfuric acid molecules (i.e., sulfuric acid
   uptake is collision-limited); (C) sulfuric acid condensation
   substantially impacts the chemical composition of preexisting
   nanoparticles before new particles have grown to a size sufficient to be
   measured; (D) ammonium and sulfate concentrations are highly correlated,
   indicating that ammonia uptake is driven by sulfuric acid uptake; (E)
   sulfate neutralization by ammonium does not reach the predicted
   thermodynamic end point, suggesting that a barrier exists for ammonia
   uptake; (F) carbonaceous matter accounts for more than half of the
   particle mass growth, and its oxygen-to-carbon ratio (similar to 0.5) is
   characteristic of freshly formed secondary organic aerosol; and (G)
   differences in the overall growth rate from one formation event to
   another are caused by variations in the growth rates of all major
   chemical species, not just one individual species.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of treating the lithium-rich layered Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 with
   (NH4)(2)HPO4 solution followed by annealing at 400 - 700 degrees C on
   the structure and electrochemical properties has been investigated. It
   is found that the treatment with (NH4)(2)HPO4 solution (pH = 8.0) leach
   out lithium ions from layered Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 through Li+/H+
   ion-exchange process, which becomes enhanced at elevated temperatures
   (60 degrees C). Annealing the 60 degrees C (NH4)(2)HPO4 treated sample
   causes a lithium-deficiency-driven transformation to a 4.7 V
   LixNi0.5Mn1.5O4 spinel phase, while the sample treated with (NH4)(2)HPO4
   at room temperature remains unaltered after such high-temperature
   annealing. Cathodes containing these annealed samples were prepared and
   evaluated in half cells by galvanostatic cycling. It is found out that
   the formed spinel-like phase become stable as the annealing temperature
   increases, whereas the layered phase in the annealed samples undergoes
   an irreversible transformation to a new 3 V spinel-like phase. Due to
   the excellent stability of both the 4.7 V LixNi0.5Mn1.5O4 spinel phase
   and the newly evolved 3 V spinal-like phase, the 600 and 700 degrees C
   annealed samples exhibit enhanced energy density, reaching more than 800
   mWh g(-1) with good cycle life between 2.0 and 5.0 V. (C) 2013 The

Pages = {{11179-11186}},
Abstract = {{Previously, pulsed magneto-motive ultrasound (pMMUS) imaging has been
   introduced as a contrast-agent-assisted ultrasound-based imaging
   modality capable of visualizing biological events at the cellular and
   molecular level. In pMMUS imaging, a high intensity pulsed magnetic
   field is used to excite cells or tissue labeled with magnetic
   nanoparticles. Then, ultrasound (US) imaging is used to monitor the
   mechanical response of the tissue to an externally applied magnetic
   field (i.e., tissue displacement). Signal to noise ratio (SNR) in pMMUS
   imaging can be improved by using superparamagnetic nanoparticles with
   larger saturation magnetization. Metal-doped magnetic nanoparticles with
   enhanced tunable nanomagnetism are suitable candidates to improve the
   SNR and, therefore, sensitivity of pMMUS imaging, which is essential for
   in vivo pMMUS imaging. In this study, we demonstrate the capability of
   pMMUS imaging to identify the presence and distribution of zinc-doped
   iron oxide nanoparticles in live nude mice bearing A431 (human
   epithelial carcinoma) xenograft tumors.}},

Title = {{Americans' Crash Histories and Opinions on Safety Policy}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2364}},
Pages = {{12-22}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the influence of driving experience and habits,
   citation histories, vehicle ownership, and demographics on the crash
   risk and safety policy opinions of more than 1,000 Americans. Model
   results suggest that increased driver crash probability and decreased
   support for crash countermeasures correlate with criminal history and
   high tolerance for risk, both of which are more prevalent among men than
   women. Noninjury crash involvement-controlled for years of driving, a
   measure of exposure-appears to be more common for those with busy
   lifestyles, who have higher education and more household vehicles.
   Support for crash safety policies appears to be largely independent of
   the crash history of a survey respondent and his or her family but to be
   linked to gender, marital status, and level of education. Women and
   lower-income households are more likely to support safety policies,
   although those with higher educational attainment are generally less
   likely to support such policies. Finally, results suggest that
   unfamiliarity may be a key (but surmountable) barrier to the
   introduction of technology-based safety policies, such as speed
   limiters.}},

   Partnerships Toll-Pricing Strategies}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2345}},
Pages = {{92-99}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, transportation planning has been challenged by an
   increasing need for infrastructure development, a shortfall of revenue
   from the public sector, and political trending toward deregulation of
   transportation infrastructure development. These factors have led to
   increased interest in privatization of transportation infrastructure and
   the development of public-private partnerships, such as
   design-build-finance-operate. Although the overall goal of a
   transportation infrastructure project is to provide safe, reliable
   transportation systems for the public, parties involved in
   public-private partnerships take different roles and responsibilities.
   The public sector leads in laying out the terms and standards to
   regulate the obligations between the state departments of transportation
   and private entities. The private sector makes capital investment to
   provide agreed-upon services as well as to assume various investment
   risks, including project operational and financial risks. Toll-pricing
   strategies are a key component for the public sector in regulating the
   operation of a public-private partnership facility and for the private
   sector in controlling investment risks. This study investigated the
   applicability of deterministic dynamic optimization models for
   determining toll-pricing strategies that can help improve mobility,
   secure the public interest, and attract investment from the private
   sector. A case study of a design-build-finance-operate project was
   completed. Results showed that the proposed model provides a useful tool
   to assist both the public and private sectors in making more informed
   decisions, including study of optimal strategies to seek investment
   return and determination of the predefined contract regulations.}},

   10,000 devices, wafer-scalable mitigation strategies to restore
   graphene's device characteristics via fluoropolymer interaction, and
   demonstrations of graphene integrated with commercial Si-CMOS chips for
   hybrid nanoelectronics and sensors. Metrology at the wafer-scale has led
   to the development of custom Raman processing software (GRISP) now
   available on the nanohub portal. The metrology reveals that graphene
   grown on 4-in substrates have monolayer quality comparable to exfoliated
   flakes. At room temperature, the high-performance passivated graphene
   devices on SiO2/Si can afford average mobilities 3000cm(2)/V-s and gate
   modulation that exceeds an order of magnitude. The latest growth
   research has yielded graphene with high mobilities greater than
   10,000cm(2)/V-s on oxidized silicon. Further progress requires
   track-compatible graphene-Si integration via wafer bonding in order to
   translate graphene research from basic to applied research in commercial
   R\&D laboratories to ultimately yield a viable nanotechnology.}},

Abstract = {{Structural properties of the cornea determine the shape and optical
   quality of the eye. Keratoconus, a structural degeneration of the
   cornea, is often treated with UV-induced collagen cross-linking to
   increase tissue resistance to further deformation and degeneration.
   Optimal treatments would be customized to the individual and consider
   pre-existing structural properties as well as the effects induced by
   treatment and this requires the capability to noninvasively measure
   tissue properties. The purpose of this study is to use novel methods of
   optical elastography to study the effects of UV-induced corneal collagen
   cross-linking in the rabbit eye. Low-amplitude (<1 mu m) elastic
   flexural waves were generated using focused air-pulse stimulation.
   Elastic wave propagation was measured over a 10x10mm area using Phase
   Stabilized Swept Source Optical Coherence Elastography (PhS-SSOCE) with
   a sensitivity of similar to 10 nm. Wave amplitude and velocity were
   computed and compared in tissues before and after UV cross-linking. Wave
   amplitude was decreased by the cross-linking treatment, while wave
   velocity was greater in cross-linked tissue than it was in the untreated
   cornea. Decreased wave amplitude and increased wave velocity after
   cross-linking is consistent with increased tissue stiffness. This was
   confirmed by conventional mechanical tension testing. These results
   demonstrate that the combination of the PhS-SSOCE and focused air pulse
   stimulation is capable of measuring low amplitude tissue motion and
   quantifying corneal stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{Effect of catheter eccentricity on the appearance of stent struts in

   of light-stent interaction. A phantom blood vessel was constructed from
   a mix of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and titanium dioxide to simulate
   the elastic and optical scattering properties of the arterial wall. A
   Cordis CYPHER (R) sirolimus-eluting stent was deployed within the
   phantom vessel and high resolution Micro-CT images of the stent strut
   were recorded to create a three-dimensional representation. Simulation
   of IV-OCT catheter and reflection of light from the stent strut and
   neointima was implemented for different catheter eccentricities. An
   optical model of the IV-OCT catheter was constructed and IV-OCT images
   corresponding to rotation of the light beam over the stent strut were
   simulated. The measured parameters included intensity and optical path
   length of light reflecting from the stent strut and coupled into
   catheter. The results indicate that in presence of thick neointimas
   sunflower effect is not observed and neointimal thickness measurement
   using IV-OCT is consistent with true values irrespective of catheter

   spectra on nanoscale using compact mW-level sources, such as quantum

   absorption is detected via deflection of an AFM cantilever due to local
   sample thermal expansion. To enable detection of minute sample
   expansion, the repetition frequency of the laser pulses is moved in
   resonance with the cantilever mechanical frequency. Plasmonic
   enhancement under the apex of a sharp metalized AFM tip is also utilized
   to further improve the detection sensitivity. As a result, we are able
   to obtain high-quality absorption spectra from samples thinner than 10
   nm. The spatial resolution is principally determined by the diameter of
   the high-intensity spot in the vicinity the AFM tip, and is below 50nm.

Abstract = {{Internet web browsing has reached a critical tipping point. Increasingly
   users rely more on mobile web browsers to access the Internet than
   desktop browsers. Meanwhile, webpages over the past decade have grown in
   complexity by more than tenfold. The fast penetration of mobile browsing
   and ever-richer webpages implies a growing need for high-performance
   mobile devices in the Mare to ensure continued end-user browsing
   experience. Failing to deliver webpages meeting hard cut-off constraints
   could directly translate to webpage abandonment or fir e-commerce
   websites, great revenue loss. However mobile devices' limited battery
   capacity limits the degree of performance that mobile web browsing can
   achieve. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of heterogeneous
   systems with big/little cores each with different frequencies to achieve
   the ideal trade-off between high performance and energy efficiency
   Through detailed characterizations of different webpage primitives based
   on the hottest 5,000 webpages, we build statistical inference models
   that estimate webpage load time and energy consumption. We show that
   leveraging such predictive models lets us identify and schedule webpages
   us he ideal core and frequency configuration that minimizes energy
   consumption while still meeting stringent cut-off constraints. Real
   hardware and software evaluations show that our scheduling scheme
   achieves 83.0\% energy savings, while only violating the cut-off latency
   for 4.1\% more webpages as compared with a performance-oriented hardware
   strategy Against a more intelligent, OS-driven, dynamic voltage and
   frequency scaling scheme, it achieves 8.6\% energy savings and 4.0\%
   performance improvement simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{Data-dependent branches constitute single biggest source of remaining
   branch mispredictions. Typically, data-dependent branches are associated
   with program data structures, and follow store-load-branch execution
   sequence. A set of memory locations is written at an earlier point in a
   program. Later, these locations are read, and used for evaluating branch
   condition. Branch outcome depends on data values stored in data
   structure, which, typically do not have repeatable pattern. Therefore,
   in addition to history-based dynamic predictor, we need a different kind
   of predictor for handling such branches.
   This paper presents Store-Load-Branch (SLB) predictor; a
   compiler-assisted dynamic branch prediction scheme for data-dependent
   direct and indirect branches. For every data-dependent branch, compiler
   identifies store instructions that modify the data structure associated
   with the branch. Marked store instructions are dynamically tracked, and
   stored values are used for computing branch flags ahead of time. Branch
   flags are buffered, and later used for making predictions. On average,

Abstract = {{Current graphics processing units (GPUs) utilize the single instruction
   multiple thread (SIMT) execution model. With SIMT, a group of logical
   threads executes such that all threads in the group execute a single
   common instruction on a particular cycle. To enable control flow to
   diverge within the group of threads, GPUs partially serialize execution
   and follow a single control flow path at a time. The execution of the
   threads in the group that are not on the current path is masked. Most
   current GPUs rely on a hardware reconvergence stack to track the
   multiple concurrent paths and to choose a single path for execution.
   Control flow paths are pushed onto the stack when they diverge and are
   popped off of the stack to enable threads to reconverge and keep lane
   utilization high. The stack algorithm guarantees optimal reconvergence
   for applications with structured control flow as it traverses the
   structured control-flow tree depth first. The downside of using the
   reconvergence stack is that only a single path is followed, which does
   not maximize available parallelism, degrading performance in some cases.
   We propose a change to the stack hardware in which the execution of two
   different paths can be interleaved. While this is a fundamental change
   to the stack concept, we show how dual-path execution can be implemented
   with only modest changes to current hardware and that parallelism is
   increased without sacrificing optimal (structured) control-flow
   reconvergence. We perform a detailed evaluation of a set of benchmarks
   with divergent control flow and demonstrate that the dual-path stack
   architecture is much more robust compared to previous approaches for
   increasing path parallelism. Dual-path execution either matches the
   performance of the baseline single-path stack architecture or
   outperforms single-path execution by 14.9\% on average and by over 30\%
   in some cases.}},

   Failure modes and mass transport mechanism responsible for EM
   degradation of CuMn interconnects were examined. Although immortality
   was not observed, EM lifetime of short lines was significantly improved
   together with a reduction in lifetime deviation. This is attributed to
   the effectiveness of Mn in repairing process defects, particularly for

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the composition and structure of five multiple-input
   converter (MIC) families, and then identifies possible bi-directional
   applications for these MIC families. Among these five MIC families, the
   bi-directional power flow capability of pulsating voltage source cell
   MICs, push-pull connected MICs, and time-sharing (TS) MICs were not
   identified in past works. In particular, TS-MICs are originally
   considered unidirectional. With a new driving strategy and components
   arrangement, TS-MICs can also perform bi-directional operations. The
   operation states of a bi-directional TS-MIC are analyzed and the voltage
   transfer ratios (VTRs) are derived. A prototype of TS dual-input SEPIC
   is built to verify the bi-directional operation analysis. The measured
   VTRs match with the prediction in the analysis, and both input cells
   simultaneously change their input current direction when the operation
   status changes between discharge-mode and charge-mode.}},

Abstract = {{A dual-band microbolometer with separate absorption of each wavelength
   band would be desirable for multispectral applications. In addition, a
   three dimensional (3D) stacked structure would be advantageous for size
   and integration in focal plane arrays. We present designs for a 3D
   stacked dual-band microbolometer based on the in-band and out-of-band
   reflection and transmission characteristics of resistive dipoles and
   slots. The mechanism of individual absorption in each layer of a
   dual-band microbolometer is analyzed and simulated to allow the
   resistive slot layer to efficiently absorb the LWIR band while a
   superposed resistive dipole layer absorbs the MWIR band. The top dipole
   layer is designed to have peak absorption at 5 mu m, with a second
   underlying slot layer and mirror layer designed to have peak absorption
   at 10 mu m. The stacked combination of two different types of layers
   provides highly efficient wavelength selective absorption, yielding
   calculated power absorption efficiency of nearly 100 \% for both LWIR
   and MWIR bands.}},

Abstract = {{Inverted organic solar cells, which utilize a transparent cathode and a
   high work function metal anode, have been the subject of extensive
   research. Their advantages over conventional organic solar cells include
   increased resistance to environmental degradation and compatibility with
   large area fabrication techniques. Carrier transport layers are
   essential for achieving high power conversion efficiencies in inverted
   organic solar cells and therefore need to be compatible with these large
   area fabrication techniques. Inkjet printing is one such technique that
   can be integrated into the low cost mass production of these cells via
   roll to roll fabrication. N-type metal oxides such as ZnO or zinc tin
   oxide (ZTO) have been previously used as electron transport layers for
   inverted cells, but only as spin coated films. We have developed inkjet
   printable ZTO solutions for use as electron transport layers in inverted
   organic solar cells, and achieve power conversion efficiencies of over
   3\% in inverted P3HT:PC71BM solar cells. We also discuss the effect of
   printing parameters on the electrical performance of these layers in
   inverted organic solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a device which can do multiplexed detection of two
   different chemicals on one chip by using infrared absorption
   spectroscopy. The signature of Trichloroethylene(TCE) and xylene in
   water enable multiplexed detection on one chip. We use the slow light
   effect in the photonic crystal design which enhances the absorption of
   the analytes by a factor of 30 as demonstrated by our previous works. In
   order to match the absorption peaks of these two analytes, photonic
   crystal slow light regions are designed at 1644nm and 1674nm with a SU8
   cladding on top. Multiplexed detection is enabled by using a multimode
   interference (MMI) optical power splitter at the input, which divides
   optical power into two arms, and Y combiner at the output. Consequently,
   the absorption of these two chemicals can be enhanced by the slow light
   effect. The MMI structure and Y combiner also enable the multiplexed
   detection of two analytes on one chip.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the photoelectrochemical activity of WO3, Bi2S3/WO3
   heterojunction films were designed by coupling WO3 films with varying
   amounts of urchin-like Bi2S3 nanospheres. The WO3 films were composed of
   WO3 nanoprism arrays, which were synthesized using a solvothermal
   method. After coating a single layer of Bi2S3 on top of the WO3 film,
   the resulting Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film showed enhanced
   photoelectrochemical activity. At 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the initial
   photocurrent density of the Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film with one layer
   of Bi2S3 was 1.33 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 1.19 mA cm(-2) in a 0.2
   M NaCl mixed water-ethanol solution, which was 40\% and 32\% higher than
   the bare WO3 film under the same conditions, respectively. The optimal
   number of Bi2S3 layers for coupling with the WO3 film was found to be 3
   layers, which had the highest photocurrent density and IPCE values. The
   photoelectrochemical activity of Bi2S3/WO3 heterojunction film was not
   stable for water oxidation due to photocorrosion in aqueous electrolyte,
   but it was stable in the NaCl mixed water-ethanol solution and a
   non-aqueous solution containing iodide/triiodide as a redox couple. The
   origin of enhanced photoelectrochemical activity of the Bi2S3/WO3
   heterojunction film was primarily ascribed to the band potential
   matching between WO3 and Bi2S3, which is advantageous for charge
   separation.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a unified discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) framework with
   optimal test functions for Friedrichs-like systems, which embrace a
   large class of elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic partial differential
   equations (PDEs). The well-posedness, i.e., existence, uniqueness, and
   stability, of the DPG solution is established on a single abstract DPG
   formulation, and two abstract DPG methods corresponding to two
   different, but equivalent, norms are devised. We then apply the single
   DPG framework to several linear(ized) PDEs including, but not limited
   to, scalar transport, Laplace, diffusion, convection-diffusion,
   convection-diffusion-reaction, linear(ized) continuum mechanics (e. g.,
   linear(ized) elasticity, a version of linearized Navier-Stokes
   equations, etc.), time-domain acoustics, and a version of the Maxwell's
   equations. The results show that we not only recover several existing
   DPG methods, but also discover new DPG methods for both PDEs currently
   considered in the DPG community and new ones. As a direct consequence of
   the single abstract DPG framework, all of the resulting DPG methods are
   shown to be trivially well-posed. We show that the inf-sup constant of
   the abstract DPG equation is independent of the mesh and is the same
   order as that of the PDE counterpart.}},

   system is designed to provide 14 mu m lateral resolution for the PhS-OCT
   probe beam (1060 nm) and 13 mu m lateral resolution for photothermal
   excitation beams. DWP-OCT system's sensitivity is 102 dB, axial
   resolution is 13 mu m in tissue and uses a real-time digital dispersion
   compensation algorithm. Noise floor for optical pathlength measurements
   is 300 pm in the signal frequency range (380-400 Hz) of photothermal
   modulation frequencies. Blood SO2 level is calculated from measured
   optical pathlength (op) signal in a 300 mu m diameter microvessel
   phantom introduced by the two photothermal excitation beams. En-face and
   B-scan images of a phantom microvessel are recorded, and six blood
   samples' SO2 levels are measured using DWP-OCT and compared with values
   provided by a commercial blood oximeter. A mathematical model indicates
   thermal diffusion introduces a systematic artifact that over-estimates
   SO2 values and is consistent with measured data}},

Abstract = {{We present a framework aimed at estimating the potential damage to an
   offshore wind farm from hurricanes. Our approach is related to assessing
   risks that are assumed to be fundamentally related to the estimation of
   wind speed exceedance probabilities at selected hub heights of wind
   turbines in the farm and of associated wind turbine loads. As part of
   this preliminary framework for risk assessment, synthetic storm tracks
   are first simulated over the ocean using available historical tropical
   storm data; then, a hurricane intensity evolution model based on
   thermodynamic and atmospheric environmental variables is developed for
   each of the tracks as they get to regions within the proximity of the
   chosen wind farm site. Based on this intensity model, a turbulent wind
   field can be simulated at locations of interest along the hurricane
   track. The simulated turbulent wind field may then be used to estimate
   wind speed exceedance probability distributions and, when combined with
   correlated waves, it can also be used in analysis of the response of
   individual turbines in a wind farm. The framework for the overall risk
   assessment is presented; the individual components that comprise such an
   assessment are described briefly in illustrative applications.}},

Abstract = {{Wind energy is the most abundant resource in the renewable energy
   portfolio. Increasing the wind capture capability improves the economic
   viability of this technology, making it more competitive with
   traditional fossil-fuel based approaches. Therefore, it is beneficial to
   explore optimal control strategies that maximize aerodynamic efficiency,
   thus, the wind energy capture. Accordingly, this paper presents a
   dynamic programming approach to find the control inputs for the blade
   pitch angle and speed ratio, that maximizes the power coefficient. The
   process uses historical wind data to evaluate the performance of various
   inputs over a simulated time horizon. A dynamic wind turbine model
   facilitates this process by characterizing the performance of the
   various possible input scenarios. Each scenario is scored through the
   programming technique, and the optimal control inputs are identified
   following simulation. The results are presented to compare the wind
   energy capture under the proposed algorithm with the traditional
   feedback control design.}},

   cope with wind speed variations. Based on our preliminary study, the
   gear ratios of the variable ratio gearbox were carefully selected to
   increase the wind energy capture. We then propose a new control approach
   to extend the gear service life. It finds the gear shifting sequence

   Desynchronization-Tau Differing from 24.0 Hours-Documented by

Abstract = {{We investigated the circadian synchronization/desynchronization (by
   field-study assessment of differences in period, tau, of 16 coexisting
   and well-documented rhythms) of 30 healthy firemen (FM) exposed to
   irregular, difficult, and stressful nocturnal work hours who
   demonstrated excellent clinical tolerance (allochronism). Three groups
   of FM were studied (A = 12 FM on 24-h duty at the fire station; B = 9 FM
   on 24-h duty at the emergency call center; C = 9 day-shift
   administrative FM) of mostly comparable average age, body mass index,
   career duration, chronotype-morningness/eveningness, and trait of field
   dependence/independence. The self-assessed 16 circadian rhythms were (i)
   physiological ones of sleep-wake (sleep log), activity-rest
   (actography), body temperature (internal transmitter pill probe), right-
   and left-hand grip strength (hand dynamometer), systolic and diastolic
   blood pressure (BP) plus heart rate (ambulatory BP monitoring device);
   (ii) psychological ones (visual analog self-rating scales) of
   sleepiness, fatigue, fitness for work, and capacity to cope with
   aggressive social behavior; and (iii) cognitive ones of eye-hand skill
   and letter cancellation, entailing performance speed (tasks
   completed/unit time) and accuracy (errors). Data (4-6 time points/24 h;
   2 591 480 values in total) were gathered continuously throughout two 8-d
   spans, one in winter 2010-2011 and one in summer 2011. Each of the
   resulting 938 unequal-interval time series was analyzed by a special
   power spectrum analysis to objectively determine the prominent tau. The
   desynchronization ratio (DR: number of study variables with tau = 24.0
   h/number of study variables x 100) served to ascertain the
   strength/weakness of each rhythm per individual, group, and season. The
   field study confirmed, independent of group and season, coexistence of
   rather strong and weak circadian oscillators. Interindividual
   differences in DR were detected between groups and seasons (chi(2),
   correlation tests, analysis of variance {[}ANOVA]). Moreover, in each
   group, both in winter and summer, a normal distribution was observed in
   the number of FM with rhythms with tau = 24.0 h, e.g., ranging from 5/16
   (large desynchronization) to 16/16 (no desynchronization). Such a normal
   distribution with intraindividual stability over time (i.e., seasons) is
   consistent with the hypothesis of an inherited origin of a differential
   propensity to circadian desynchronization and which is supported by the
   distribution of tau s in winter and summer following the Dian-Circadian
   Genetic Model, i.e., with tau = 24.0 h, tau = 24.0 h + n(0.8 h), and tau
   = 24.0 h - n(0.8 h).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Pages = {{11163-11169}},
Abstract = {{Mo3Sb7 thin films prepared by magnetron sputtering are evaluated as an
   anode material for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. The as deposited films
   are amorphous and composed of small agglomerated domains with an overall
   Sb/Mo ratio of 2.34 that is almost identical to the ratio measured for
   the starting powder and the expected nominal ratio of 2.33. When cycled
   with Li and Na, the films show large storage capacities of around 430
   and 330 mA h g(-1), respectively, with good capacity retention. In
   addition, micron thick films retain large capacities of about 310 and
   280 mA h g(-1) at very high rates of 100 and 30 C-rate currents for Li
   and Na, respectively. The XRD study of the changes in the structure of
   the electrode material reveals that Li3Sb forms at full discharge
   whereas the electrode at full charge is amorphous. For the reaction with
   Na, the electrode material remains amorphous. Analysis of the surface
   chemistry characterized by XPS suggests the formation of an inorganic
   layer (LiF, LixPOyFz) covered by organic products (carbonates, esters,
   ethers) in the case of Li and the formation of an organic layer only
   (carbonates) in the case of Na. The electrode surface is visible at full
   charge for Na, thereby indicating that the Solid Electrolyte Interphase
   (SEI) layer is thinner when cycling with Na compared to that with Li.
   Overall, the results highlight the very good potential of Mo3Sb7 as an
   anode for Li- and Na-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{The vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) is an attractive grid scale
   energy storage option, but high operating cost impedes widespread
   commercialization. One way of mitigating cost is to optimize system
   performance, which requires an accurate model capable of predicting cell
   voltage under different operating conditions such as current,
   temperature, flow rate, and state of charge. This paper presents an
   isothermal VRFB model based on principles of mass transfer and
   electrochemical kinetics that can predict transient performance with
   respect to the aforementioned operating conditions. The model captures
   two important physical phenomena that occur at significantly different
   time scales as a result of vanadium crossover: (1) rapid self discharge
   reactions and (2) capacity loss after long term cycling. A gap metric
   analysis showed that a linear controller for the flow rate may be
   suitable near the 50\% SOC range.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(dopamine) has emerged in recent years as a readily accessible
   synthetic analogue of the naturally occurring melanins. However, the
   polymer's structure has proved difficult to unambiguously elucidate and
   a variety of models have been proposed. Despite these challenges,
   poly(dopamine) has found extraordinary utility in a range of
   applications including surface coatings, biotechnology and biomedicine,
   and water purification membranes. Most of these applications take
   advantage of the robust polymer films that deposit onto a wide range of
   surfaces, as well as its inertness to harsh chemical environments. In
   view of the expansion of interest in poly(dopamine), we provide
   perspective on this material, focusing on its history, chemical
   relationship to melanins, recent applications, and potential areas for

Abstract = {{The use of near-infrared wavelengths for photoacoustic (PA) imaging
   takes advantage of the relatively low inherent absorption of tissues and
   has encouraged the development of agents which show high contrast in
   this range. Here, we describe the modification of a commercially
   available PA imaging system (Vevo LAZR, VisualSonics, Toronto) to take
   advantage of the 532nm and 1064nm wavelengths inherent in the generation
   of the currently tuneable range of 680 to 970nm and in the use of these
   two wavelengths to assess contrast agents.
   The photoacoustic imaging system generated light from a Nd/YAG laser
   modified to extract the 532 and 1064nm wavelengths in addition to its
   OPO-derived tuneable range (680 - 970 nm) and deliver this light through
   a fiber integrated into a linear array transducer (LZ400, VisualSonics).
   Gold nanorods (UT Austin), carbon nanotubes (Stanford U), DyLight 550
   (Thermo Fisher) and blood were imaged in a phantom (PE20 tubing) and in
   a hindlimb subcutaneous tumor in vivo to determine their photoacoustic
   signal intensity at all wavelengths.
   In the phantom and in vivo, all agents caused an enhancement of the
   photoacoustic signal at their respective peak absorbance wavelengths.
   These results show that the 532nm and 1064nm wavelengths could prove
   useful in biomedical imaging due to the contrast agents customized for
   them. The 1064nm wavelength in particular has the advantage of having
   very low generation of endogenous signal in vivo, making agents tuned to
   this wavelength ideal for targeted contrast imaging.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{The task of evaluating correlations is central to computational
   structural biology. The rigid-body correlation problem seeks the
   rigid-body transformation (R, t), R is an element of SO(3), t is an
   element of R-3, that maximizes the correlation between a pair of input
   scalar-valued functions representing molecular structures. Exhaustive
   solutions to the rigid-body correlation problem take advantage of the
   fast Fourier transform to achieve a speedup with respect to either the
   sought translation or rotation. We present PFcorr, a new exhaustive
   solution, based on the nonequispaced SO(3) Fourier transform, to the
   rigid-body correlation problem; unlike previous solutions, ours achieves
   a combination of translational and rotational speedups without requiring
   equispaced grids. PFcorr can be straightforwardly applied to a variety
   of problems in protein structure prediction and refinement that involve
   correlations under rigid-body motions of the protein. Additionally, we
   show how it applies, along with an appropriate flexibility model, to
   analogues of the above problems in which the flexibility of the protein
   is relevant.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetic properties of the doped high-voltage spinels
   LiMn1.5Ni0.42M0.08O4 (M = Cr, Fe, Co, Cu, Al, and Ga) as well as the
   Mn-rich spinels LiMn1.5+xNi0.5-xO4 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1) synthesized by a
   tank-reactor coprecipitation method have been investigated. It is found
   that the Curie temperatures correlate well with the degree of cation
   ordering determined by measuring the capacity value at similar to 2.7 V,
   which corresponds to the insertion of additional lithium into the empty
   16c octahedral sites of the spinel lattice. Additionally, it is found
   that the saturation magnetization near 0 K provides a reliable means of
   calculating the Mn3+ content in each sample based on the predicted
   magnetic exchange interactions of the spinel structure. The magnetic
   results match well with the capacity values obtained in the 4 V region
   of the samples when assembled as cathodes in lithium-ion cells. The
   Mn-rich spinels offer insight into the relationship between Mn3+ content
   and degree of cation ordering and how they affect the magnitude of the
   capacity in the similar to 2.7 V region. The effects of Mn3+ content and
   cation ordering were isolated by examining the relationship among
   lattice parameter, Mn3+ content, capacity contribution at similar to 2.7
   V, and Curie temperature. Thus, it is posited that the Curie temperature
   is a reliable qualitative means of measuring the degree of cation order
   in a variety of doped or Mn-rich spinel oxides.}},

Title = {{Superior power density solid oxide fuel cells by enlarging the
   three-phase boundary region of a NiO-Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 composite anode

Abstract = {{In an effort to boost the power densities of solid oxide fuel cells
   (SOFCs) operating at intermediate temperatures (600-750 degrees C),
   novel powder synthesis methods have been studied with the goal of
   increasing the three-phase boundary region of the anode. Porous anodes
   composed of Ni and Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC) cermet are commonly studied in
   SOFCs, but the cell performance is limited by their dependency on the
   three-phase boundaries at which the electrochemical oxidation reaction
   takes place. This paper presents a remarkable improvement in the
   electrochemical performance through a significant enlargement of the
   three-phase boundary region by an optimization of the surface structure.
   The strategy starts with the premise that the oxide powder particles in
   aqueous solution carry a positive or negative electrical charge
   depending upon the pH of the solution, and the charge can be exploited
   to attach chelated metal ions to their surface, extending the
   three-phase boundary region. This modified NiO-GDC composite powder
   resulted in not only an extension of both electronic and O2- ionic
   conduction pathways, but also a suppression of grain growth in the anode
   during the process of cell fabrication. As the final outcome, the
   modified Ni-GDC anode-supported cells show far superior power densities
   (1.85 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C and 0.83 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C) in
   H-2 compared to the conventional Ni-GDC anode-supported cells (0.61 W
   cm(-2) at 750 degrees C and 0.26 W cm(-2) at 600 degrees C).}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, polymer photonic devices are fabricated using clean-room
   processes such as photolithography, electron beam lithography, reactive
   ion etching (RIE) and lift-off methods etc, which leads to long
   fabrication time, low throughput and high cost. We describe in this
   paper a novel process for fabricating polymer photonic devices using a
   combination of imprinting and ink jet printing methods, which provides
   high throughput on a variety of rigid and flexible substrates with low
   cost. Particularly, we demonstrate a thermo-optic switch and an
   electro-optic modulator. In the rib waveguide patterning, the imprint
   lithography transfers the waveguide pattern from a soft mold to UV-15LV
   bottom cladding layer. The soft mold is replicated from a silicon master
   mold and rendered hydrophobic to ensure successful de-molding. Ink jet
   printing method is used to deposit the core layer in thermo-optic switch
   and electrode layers in electro-optic modulator. Compared to
   spin-coating method, the use of print-on-demand method greatly reduces
   material consumption and process complexity. Every step involved has the
   potential to be fully compatible with roll-to-roll (R2R) volume
   production. For example, the soft mold can be wrapped around a cylinder
   to realized roll-to-roll imprinting. By combining R2R imprint
   lithography with ink jet printing, fabrication of large volume and large
   area multi-layer polymer photonic devices can be realized.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, there has been considerable interest in
   miniaturizing aircraft to create a class of extremely small, robotic
   vehicles with a gross mass on the order of tens of grams and a dimension
   on the order of tens of centimeters. These are collectively refered to
   as micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) or microflyers. Because the size of
   microflyers is on the same order as that of small birds and large
   insects, engineers are turning to nature for inspiration. Bioinspired
   concepts make use of structural or aerodynamic mechanisms that are
   observed in insects and birds, such as elastic energy storage and
   unsteady aerodynamics. Biomimetic concepts attempt to replicate the form
   and function of natural flyers, such as flapping-wing propulsion and
   external appearance. This paper reviews recent developments in the area
   of man-made microflyers. The design space for microflyers will be
   described, along with fundamental physical limits to miniaturization.
   Key aerodynamic phenomena at the scale of microflyers will be
   highlighted. Because the focus is on bioinspiration and biomimetics,
   scaled-down versions of conventional aircraft, such as fixed wing micro
   air vehicles and microhelicopters will not be addressed. A few
   representative bioinspired and biomimetic microflyer concepts developed
   by researchers will be described in detail. Finally, some of the sensing
   mechanisms used by natural flyers that are being implemented in man-made
   microflyers will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Heteroatom-doped graphene serves as a metal-free cathode catalyst in
   fuel cells, and has attracted great attention because of its low-cost,
   abundance, high activity, and robust stability. However, the heteroatom
   configuration in the graphene sheet is difficult to control, which
   prevents an understanding of the catalytic mechanisms and synthesis
   strategies. Herein, we introduce an organic condensation method to
   selectively functionalize graphene edges and defects with heterocycles
   under mild conditions. This method is an efficient way to dope graphene
   with structure-defined heteroatom clusters. By this method, the
   as-prepared heteroatom-doped graphene shows promising performance for
   oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline conditions with a preferred
   four-electron transfer process, demonstrating that graphene containing
   heteroatom clusters have high catalytic activity as metal-free cathodes.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1}},

Pages = {{10209-10217}},
Abstract = {{The reversible capacity values of lithium-rich layered oxide cathodes
   depend on the length (capacity) of the plateau region during the first
   charge. With an aim to understand the factors that control the length of
   the plateau region and thereby enhance the reversible capacity, the
   effects of various cationic substitutions in Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 have been
   investigated systematically. Specifically, substitutions of (i) M3+ =
   Al3+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Co3+, and Ga3+ for equal amounts of Mn4+ and Ni2+ in
   Li1.2Mn0.60-0.5xNi0.2-0.5xMxO2 with x = 0.06, 0.13, and 0.2, (ii) Ti4+
   for Mn4+ in Li1.2Mn0.6-xTixNi0.2O2 with x = 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1, and
   (iii) Mg2+ for Ni2+ in Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2-xMgxO2 with x - 0.025, 0.05, and
   0.1 have been investigated. The cationic substitutions affect the first
   charge capacity values both in the sloping region corresponding to the
   oxidation of the transition-metal ions to the 4+ state and in the
   plateau region corresponding to the oxidation of O2- ions to O-2 and/or
   transition-metal ions beyond 4+, which control the reversible capacity
   values in subsequent cycles. While the changes in the sloping-region
   capacity could be readily understood by considering the redox activities
   of the transition-metal ions, the plateau-region capacity is found to
   depend sensitively on the metal-oxygen covalence, which is dictated by
   the relative positions of the metal:3d band with respect to the top of
   the O2-:2p band, and electron delocalization. For instance, an overlap
   of the Co3+/4+:t(2g) band with the top of the O-2 : 2p band along with a
   partially filled t(2g) band across the shared octahedral edges makes the
   oxygen loss from the lattice and/or oxidation beyond 4+ much more
   facile.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{35}},
Pages = {{10362-10367}},
Abstract = {{Conventional lithium-sulfur batteries suffer from rapid capacity fade
   which limits their commercialization applications. Li/dissolved
   polysulfide cells with binder-free, interwoven, self-standing carbon
   electrodes show outstanding performance in terms of capacity utilization
   and reversibility. To further understand this system, we present here a
   binder-free carbon nanofiber (CNF) paper electrode with large
   interspaces between fibers, low manufacturing cost, and high polysulfide
   loadings. The 3D interwoven structure of the CNF paper electrode allows
   transitions between high-order polysulfides (charged products) and
   lithium sulfide (discharged product) to occur within a confined
   environment. Crystalline Li2S is found within the large interspaces of
   the 3D electrode framework after the 1st discharge, avoiding the
   formation of dense passivation layers on the cathode. The robust porous
   CNF paper electrode leads to superior electrochemical performance with a
   reversible capacity of 1094 mA h g(-1) after 80 cycles at a C/5 rate and
   Coulombic efficiencies above 98\% with a sulfur loading of 1.7 mg
   cm(-2). A stable reversible capacity of similar to 900 mA h g(-1) is
   obtained with a much higher sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm(-2), making this
   battery configuration promising for practical applications.}},

   explored as high performance nanocatalyst supports, as well as doped

   graphene supported Pt was demonstrated to have excellent selectivity in
   the electrochemical oxidation of HCY i.e., the detection of HCY is
   successful in the presence of a 20-fold excess of ascorbic acid (AA).
   The practical application of N-doped graphene supported PtNP materials
   is effectively shown for the determination of HCY in both human blood

Abstract = {{We have studied the effect of chlorination on the dielectric performance
   of a barium titanate (BTO)-polymer film. Functionalization of BTO powder
   particles with chlorine (Cl) atoms and/or Cl-containing functional
   groups was achieved by a simple treatment using chlorinated solvents.
   The chlorinated BTO (Cl-BTO) particles were incorporated into a
   cyanoethyl-based polymer and the mixture was spin-coated to produce a
   composite film. The dielectric constant of the composite film with
   Cl-BTO was as high as 208 at a frequency of 10 Hz, showing a 2.5-fold
   increase in dielectric constant compared to composites composed of the
   neat BTO and the cyanoethyl-based polymer at a frequency of 10 Hz. The
   observed dramatic increase in dielectric constant would be caused by the
   interfacial polarization due to the p-type doping effect resulting from
   the presence of strong electronegative Cl atoms. Given a relatively high
   dielectric constant, composite films with Cl-BTO were further exploited
   as a dielectric layer in an inorganic electroluminescence (EL) device.
   The luminance of the EL device with Cl-BTO was 4090 cd m(-2) at a
   frequency of 1 kHz, showing a 2.03-fold increase in luminance compared
   to that with the untreated BTO. The improved performance of the EL
   device is attributed to a high dielectric constant of the composite
   films that allow for efficient charge carrier tunneling into the
   phosphor and therefore enhanced luminance and efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate board-to-board optical communication utilizing 45 degree
   mirrors and print-on-demand micro-lenses as surface-normal coupler. The
   presented system which includes polymer waveguides, embedded 45 degree
   mirrors and micro-lenses, realizes back-to-back optical interconnects
   between two boards. The waveguide and mirrors are fabricated using
   molding method using a low-cost electroplated nickel mold. Micro-lenses
   (80 mu m in diameter) are fabricated using a material inkjet-printer, on
   top of the 45 degree mirrors. Experimental results show that each 45
   degree mirror contributes about 1.88 dB loss (65\% coupling efficiency)
   to the total optical loss. When propagating in free space without a
   lens, a 2 mm separation between boards results in a 9.9 dB loss, which
   is reduced to 7.5 dB when a micro-lens is inserted in the path. High
   speed data transmission test is performed at various separations. At a
   separation of 1mm, the system can provide 10Gbps error free
   transmission. At 2mm separation, the maximum error free data rate was
   measured to be 3.5Gbps and 7.5Gbps, with and without the micro-lens,
   respectively. Printing the micro-lenses on both the input 45 degree
   mirror and the photodiode or the receiving 45 degree mirror in a
   confocal setup will significantly reduce the free-space propagation
   loss. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of
   free-space coupling between waveguides on separate boards.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we demonstrate a three-dimensional (3D) photonic
   integration scheme based on crystalline silicon. We develop a process
   using SU-8 based adhesive bonding to fabricate vertically stacked,
   double-layer silicon nanomembranes. A single-layer silicon photonic
   integrated circuit fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) chip and a
   bare SOI chip are bonded together, followed by removal of the bare SOI
   chip's silicon substrate and buried oxide layer, to form a silicon
   nanomembrane as a platform for additional photonic layer. We designed
   and fabricated subwavelength nanostructure based fiber-to-chip grating
   coupler on the bonded silicon nanomembrane, and also inter-layer grating
   coupler for coupling between two silicon nanomembranes. The
   fiber-to-chip grating coupler has a peak efficiency of -3.9 dB at 1545
   nm operating wavelength with transverse-electric (TE) polarization. The
   inter-layer grating coupler has a peak efficiency of -6.8 dB at 1533 nm
   operating wavelength with TE polarization. The demonstrated approach
   serves as a potential solution for 3D photonic integration and novel 3D
   photonic devices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the cell-substratum interactions of planktonic
   (Chlorella vulgaris) and benthic (Botryococcus sudeticus) freshwater
   green algae with hydrophilic (glass) and hydrophobic (indium tin oxide)
   substrata to determine the critical parameters controlling the adhesion
   of algal cells to surfaces. The surface properties of the algae and
   substrata were quantified by measuring contact angle, electrophoretic
   mobility, and streaming potential. Using these data, the cell-substratum
   interactions were modeled using thermodynamic, DLVO, and XDLVO
   approaches. Finally, the rate of attachment and the strength of adhesion
   of the algal cells were quantified using a parallel-plate flow chamber.
   The results indicated that (1) acid-base interactions played a critical
   role in the adhesion of algae, (2) the hydrophobic alga attached at a
   higher density and with a higher strength of adhesion on both substrata,
   and (3) the XDLVO model was the most accurate in predicting the density
   of cells and their strength of adhesion. These results can be used to
   select substrata to promote/inhibit the adhesion of algal cells to
   surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{A synthetic route to crystalline silicon (Si) nanowires with an
   amorphous Si shell is reported. Trisilane (Si3H8) and Sn(HMDS)(2) are
   decomposed in supercritical toluene at 450 degrees C. Sn(HMDS)(2)
   creates Sn nanoparticles that seed Si nanowire growth by the
   supercritical fluid-liquid-solid (SFLS) mechanism. The Si : Sn ratio in
   the reaction determines the growth of amorphous Si shell. No amorphous
   shell forms at relatively low Si : Sn ratios of 20 : 1, whereas higher
   Si : Sn ratio of 40 : 1 leads to significant amorphous shell. We propose
   that hydrogen evolved from trisilane decomposition etches away the Sn
   seed particles as nanowires grow, which promotes the amorphous Si shell
   deposition when the higher Si : Sn ratios are used.}},

   Finite element modeling has proven useful in treatment planning and

Abstract = {{Apoptosis is an especially important process affecting disease states
   from HIV-AIDS to auto-immune disease to cancer. A cascade of initiator
   and executioner capsase functional proteins is the hallmark of
   apoptosis. When activated the various caspases activate other caspases
   or cleave structural proteins of the cytoskeleton, resulting in
   ``blebbing{''} of the plasma membrane forming apoptotic bodies that
   completely enclose the disassembled cellular components. Containment of
   the cytosolic components within the apoptotic bodies differentiates
   apoptosis from necroptosis and necrosis, both of which release
   fragmented cytosol and other cellular constituents into the
   intracellular space.
   Biochemical models of caspase activation reveal the extensive feedback
   loops characteristic of apoptosis. They clearly explain the failure of
   Arrhenius models to give accurate predictions of cell survival curves in
   hyperthermic heating protocols. Nevertheless, each of the individual
   reaction velocities can reasonably be assumed to follow Arrhenius
   kinetics. If so, the thermal sensitivity of the reaction velocity to
   temperature elevation is: partial derivative k/partial derivative T =
   E-a {[}k/RT2]. Particular reaction steps described by higher activation
   energies, E-a, are likely more thermally-sensitive than lower energy
   reactions and may initiate apoptosis in the absence of other stress
   signals. Additionally, while the classical irreversible Arrhenius
   formulation fails to accurately represent many cell survival and/or dye
   uptake curves - those that display an early stage shoulder region - an
   expanded reversible model of the law of mass action equation seems to
   prove effective and is directly based on a firm theoretical
   thermodynamic foundation.}},

Abstract = {{Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been researched for reservoir
   characterization in petroleum engineering. However, the repeated
   assimilation causes lots of simulation cost. Ensemble smoother (ES)
   assimilates all available data once. It has advantages over EnKF:
   efficiency and simplicity. The two ensemble methods are based on the
   same assumptions: Gaussian distribution and trust in the mean of all
   ensembles. Many researchers have pointed out that EnKF gives
   overshooting and filter divergence problems when the two key assumptions
   are not satisfied. This paper presents characterization of channel
   fields using ES with the concept of clustered covariance, especially
   improper ensemble design. The standard EnKF, ES, and the proposed method
   are applied to a 2D synthetic channel field with 200 ensembles. From
   distance-based clustering method, we separate initial ensembles into 10
   groups based its on similarity. The proposed method uses 10 Kalman
   gains, since each cluster has own Kalman gain. They can represent
   ensembles properly by using similar ensembles instead of 200 different
   ensembles. For the channel fields, the standard EnKF and ES show
   overshooting and filter divergence problems. Updated permeability fields
   have extreme values and lose the continuity of channel stream. However,
   the proposed method manages those two problems and provides reasonable
   results. We can get future prediction with reliable uncertainty. The
   proposed method only requires about 5\% of simulation time compared to
   EnKF, since it is based on ES. It can be applied to the characterization
   of channel fields, even though we have improper ensembles due to limited
   information.}},

Abstract = {{High temperature operation of terahertz (THz) sources based on quantum
   cascade lasers (QCLs) is discussed. THz QCLs are compact, powerful
   sources but can only operate at cryogenic temperatures. State-of-the art
   THz QCLs are made with GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures and use a single
   composition of AlGaAs for the barrier material. It was recently shown
   that multi-composition barriers in the band structure can result in gain
   > loss at temperature as high as similar to 240K. We demonstrate early
   experimental results that yield QCLs that operate up to 184K - similar
   to QCLs based on single composition barrier designs. An alternative
   method of producing room-temperature THz is based on intra-cavity
   difference-frequency generation (DFG) in mid-infrared (mid-IR) QCLs.
   Here we report devices with record conversion efficiency. THz DFG QCLs
   reported previously are highly inefficient since THz radiation produced
   more than similar to 100 mu m away from the exit facet is fully absorbed
   due to high THz losses in the QCL waveguide. Our lasers use a
   non-collinear Cherenkov DFG scheme to extract THz radiation from the
   active region. Dual-color mid-IR quantum cascade lasers with integrated
   giant optical nonlinearity are grown on semi-insulating (S.I.) InP
   substrates. THz radiation is emitted at an angle into the substrate with
   respect to the mid-infrared pumps. Since S.I. InP is virtually lossless
   to THz radiation, this scheme allows for efficient extraction of THz
   radiation along the whole waveguide length. As a result, our sources
   demonstrate large mid-infrared-to-THz conversion efficiency. Devices
   tested at room-temperature produced 18 mu W peak-power and 75 mu W/W-2
   conversion efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{A vehicle's door is frequently used by a driver or passengers. When a
   vehicle is parked at incline, it is not easy to open or close doors
   because of gravity force and external disturbances. Moreover, there
   might cause a safety problems for a weak or a disabled person.
   Therefore, there is increasing demand for automation of vehicle's door.
   In this study, an automatic swing door mechanism for a passenger car is
   proposed by using a parallel force/velocity actuator (PFVA) based on a
   Dual-Input-Single-Output (DISO) framework. PFVA has two distinct
   actuators. One is force actuator(FA) with a low reduction gear train,
   the other is velocity actuator(VA) with a high reduction gear train. It
   can be effectively used in combining velocity control with force
   compensation application. First, we formulated a kinematics and a
   dynamics of automatic swing door system with PFVA as input, and then a

Abstract = {{Optical spectroscopy has shown potential as a tool for precancer
   detection by discriminating alterations in the optical properties within
   epithelial tissues. Identifying depth-dependent alterations associated
   with the progression of epithelial cancerous lesions can be especially
   challenging in the oral cavity due to the variable thickness of the
   epithelium and the presence of keratinization. Optical spectroscopy of
   epithelial tissue with improved depth resolution would greatly assist in
   the isolation of optical properties associated with cancer progression.
   Here, we report a fiber optic probe for oblique polarized reflectance
   spectroscopy (OPRS) that is capable of depth sensitive detection by
   combining the following three approaches: multiple beveled fibers,
   oblique collection geometry, and polarization gating. We analyze how
   probe design parameters are related to improvements in collection
   efficiency of scattered photons from superficial tissue layers and to
   increased depth discrimination within epithelium. We have demonstrated
   that obliquely-oriented collection fibers increase both depth
   selectivity and collection efficiency of scattering signal. Currently,
   we evaluate this technology in a clinical trial of patients presenting
   lesions suspicious for dysplasia or carcinoma in the oral cavity. We use
   depth sensitive spectroscopic data to develop automated algorithms for
   analysis of morphological and architectural changes in the context of
   the multilayer oral epithelial tissue. Our initial results show that
   OPRS has the potential to improve the detection and monitoring of
   epithelial precancers in the oral cavity.}},

   describe a low-degree-of-freedom model designed for proof-of-concept, in
   preparation for the development of the full DDDAS. The physical system
   involves fiber-reinforced composite plates subjected to quasi-static
   loading and enriched with distributed carbon nanotubes that act as
   sensors, signaling damage through changes on the voltage profile. We
   give an overview of the experimental data we collected, of the damage
   models we explored, and of the Bayesian methodology we applied in order
   to use uncertain experimental data for driving the stochastic system.}},

Abstract = {{Vocal fold scarring is one of the major causes of voice disorders and
   may arise from overuse or post-surgical wound healing. One promising
   treatment utilizes the injection of soft biomaterials aimed at restoring
   viscoelasticity of the outermost vibratory layer of the vocal fold,
   superficial lamina propria (SLP). However, the density of the tissue and
   the required injection pressure impair proper localization of the
   injected biomaterial in SLP. To enhance treatment effectiveness, we are
   investigating a technique to image and ablate sub-epithelial planar
   voids in vocal folds using ultrafast laser pulses to better localize the
   injected biomaterial. It is challenging to optimize the excitation
   wavelength to perform imaging and ablation at depths suitable for
   clinical use. Here, we compare maximum imaging depth using two photon
   autofluorescence and second harmonic generation with third-harmonic
   generation imaging modalities for healthy porcine vocal folds. We used a
   home-built inverted nonlinear scanning microscope together with a high
   repetition rate (2 MHz) ultrafast fiber laser (Raydiance Inc.). We
   acquired both two-photon autofluorescence and second harmonic generation
   signals using 776 nm wavelength and third harmonic generation signals
   using 1552 nm excitation wavelength. We observed that maximum imaging
   depth with 776 nm wavelength is significantly improved from 114 mu m to
   205 mu m when third harmonic generation is employed using 1552 nm
   wavelength, without any observable damage in the tissue.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Based on density functional theory calculations, we present mechanisms
   underlying the improvement in the catalytic performance of Pd-based
   alloys for oxygen hydrogenation to water. As a model case, we consider
   the Pd/Pd3Co system where one or two Pd overlayers are located on top of
   the bimetallic substrate. Our calculations clearly demonstrate that the
   subsurface Co atoms assist in facilitating the oxygen reduction reaction
   by lowering the activation barriers for O/OH hydrogenation with a slight
   increase in the O-2 scission barrier; however, we also find that the Co
   atoms lying below the subsurface have no significant contribution in
   altering the surface reactivity towards oxygen hydrogenation. The
   analysis of intra- and interlayer orbital interactions in the
   near-surface region elucidates the synergetic interplay between the
   surface electronic structure modification due to the underlying Co atoms
   (interlayer ligand effect) and the compressive strain caused by the
   Pd3Co substrate. This result also brings to light the significant
   contribution of the out of plane (d(xz) and d(yz)) states in altering
   the surface reactivity towards O hydrogenation.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{29}},
Pages = {{6955-6969}},
Abstract = {{We develop and implement a new hybrid methodology combining
   self-consistent field theory (SCFT) and Monte Carlo simulations to study
   the complexation between negatively charged semiflexible linear
   polyelectrolyte (LPE) molecules and a positively charged dendrimer
   containing grafts of neutral polymers. We examine the influence of LPE
   stiffness, length of the dendrimer grafts, and solution pOH upon the
   characteristics of the resulting complexes. Our results indicate that
   increasing LPE stiffness reduces the dendrimer-LPE binding affinity and
   results in an overall higher net charge carried within the dendrimer
   molecule. When we varied the size of the grafts, the dendrimer-LPE
   binding strength was seen to decrease with increasing grafting chain
   length for the flexible LPE chains. In contrast, for stiff LPE chains,
   the binding strength was not seen to vary significantly with the
   grafting lengths. Overall, longer grafting lengths were seen to reduce
   the fraction of exposed LPE molecules, suggesting that grafted
   dendrimers may better shield nucleic acid material from serum nucleases.
   Lastly, we found that increasing the solution pOH was seen to enhance
   both the binding between the dendrimer and LPE molecules and the total
   positive charge carried by the complex.}},

Title = {{Single-user MIMO versus multi-user MIMO in distributed antenna systems
   with limited feedback}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{This article investigates the performance of cellular networks employing
   distributed antennas in addition to the central antennas of the base
   station. Distributed antennas are likely to be implemented using remote
   radio units, which is enabled by a low latency and high bandwidth
   dedicated link to the base station. This facilitates coherent
   transmission from potentially all available antennas at the same time.
   Such distributed antenna system (DAS) is an effective way to deal with
   path loss and large-scale fading in cellular systems. DAS can apply
   precoding across multiple transmission points to implement single-user
   MIMO (SU-MIMO) and multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) transmission. The
   throughput performance of various SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO transmission
   strategies is investigated in this article, employing a Long-Term
   evolution (LTE) standard compliant simulation framework. The previously
   theoretically established cell-capacity improvement of MU-MIMO in
   comparison to SU-MIMO in DASs is confirmed under the practical
   constraints imposed by the LTE standard, even under the assumption of
   imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the base station. Because
   practical systems will use quantized feedback, the performance of
   different CSI feedback algorithms for DASs is investigated. It is shown
   that significant gains in the CSI quantization accuracy and in the
   throughput of especially MU-MIMO systems can be achieved with relatively
   simple quantization codebook constructions that exploit the available
   temporal correlation and channel gain differences.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated a rational mechanism for one-step waferscale synthesis

   two-dimensional (2-D) network catalysts (porous gold) in one-step.
   Tuning the material chemistry along the lengths of the nanowire
   catalysts yielded 3-D ZnO nanosuperstructures with distinct morphology
   on each segment. The growth mechanism and roles of chemistry of
   catalysts in growth of ZnO nanosuperstructures were studied. Compared
   with nanowire arrays synthesized from commonly used zero-dimensional
   (0-D) dot catalysts, 3-D nanosuperstructures significantly enhanced
   water oxidation efficiency by 150\%. This work may inspire a new general

Title = {{A distributed algorithm using interference pricing for relay
   interference channels}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Relays in cellular systems are sensitive to interference. A good relay
   design will transmit in a way that avoids excess out-of-cell
   interference. This article proposes a two-step algorithm for relay
   design for the relay interference channel, which models a relay-based
   cellular system. The transmitters and relays are equipped with multiple
   antennas while the receivers are equipped with a single antenna. In the
   first step, we propose to apply existing single-hop strategies to design
   the transmission parameters of the transmitters. In the second step, we
   propose to modify the interference pricing approach to design the
   relays. Interference pricing is used to provide the relays with
   information on how interference impacts the end-to-end achievable rates.
   A new method is proposed to compute interference prices via an
   approximation of the end-to-end achievable rate to integrate information
   about the relationship of the parameters in the two hops to alleviate
   mismatch between the rates on two hops experienced by the direct
   application of prior algorithms, which are designed specifically for the
   single-hop interference channel. Simulations show that the proposed
   algorithm outperforms the other designs, including the naive approach of
   applying the single-hop interference pricing strategies on two hops.}},

   disorder in Au dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2912-2921}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we present a new methodology for the analysis of 1-2 nm
   nanoparticles using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
   spectroscopy. Different numbers of thiols were introduced onto the
   surfaces of dendrimer-encapsulated Au nanoparticles, consisting of an
   average of 147 atoms, to systematically tune the nanoparticle disorder.
   An analogous system was investigated using density functional theory
   molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations to produce theoretical EXAFS
   signals that could be directly compared to the experimental results.
   Validation of the theoretical results by comparing to experiment allows
   us to infer previously unknown details of structure and dynamics of the
   nanoparticles. Additionally, the structural information that is learned
   from theoretical studies can be compared with traditional EXAFS fitting
   results to identify and rationalize any errors in the experimental fit.
   This study demonstrates that DFT-MD simulations accurately depict
   complex experimental systems in which we have control over nanoparticle
   disorder, and shows the advantages of using a combined
   experimental/theoretical approach over standard EXAFS fitting
   methodologies for determining the structural parameters of metallic
   nanoparticles.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{262-280}},
Abstract = {{The standard method for assessing hyperthermia treatment has been
   calculation of cumulative equivalent minutes at 43 degrees C, CEM43 and
   its variations. This parameter normalises treatment thermal histories
   rather than predicts treatment results. Arrhenius models have been
   widely used in analysing higher temperature thermal treatments and
   successfully employed to predict irreversible thermal alterations in
   structural proteins. Unfortunately, in many, but not all cases they fail
   to represent thermally induced damage or cell death at hyperthermic
   temperatures, 43-50 degrees C, exhibiting significant over-prediction of
   the initial `shoulder' region. The failure arises from the simplifying
   assumptions used to derive the irreversible reaction format that has
   been used in thermal damage studies. Several successful multi-parameter
   fit methods have been employed to model cell survival data. The
   two-state statistical thermodynamic model was derived from basic
   thermodynamic principles. The three-state model results from relaxing
   the assumptions under the Arrhenius formulation that result in an
   irreversible reaction. In other cell processes studied in vitro the
   irreversible Arrhenius model holds, and is sufficient to provide an
   accurate and useful estimate of thermal damage and cell death. It is
   essential in numerical model work to include multiple thermal damage
   processes operating in parallel to obtain a clear image of the likely
   outcome in tissues. Arrhenius and other C(t) models have that
   capability, while a single value for CEM43, does not.}},

Abstract = {{With an aim to develop a better understanding of the factors influencing
   the electrochemical performance of doped spinel cathodes, a series of
   Li1.1Mn1.8M0.1O4-delta F delta and Li(1+x)Mr(2-2x)M(x)O(4-delta)F(delta)
   (M = Al, Ti, Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni) samples have been investigated
   systematically. The samples have been made by solid-state reaction
   followed by a low-temperature fluorination reaction and characterized by
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), redox titration, scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), electrochemical cycling, and differential capacity measurements.
   Generally, LiF impurity phase begins to form at or above a fluorine
   content of similar to 0.2. The capacity fade decreases with decreasing
   oxidation state of the dopant MnII+, increasing electronegativity of the
   dopant M, decreasing bond dissociation energy of M-O, and decreasing Mn
   dissolution; the capacity fade increases drastically below a Mn valence
   of similar to 3.6+. Additionally, the charge-discharge kinetics worsen
   with increasing fluorine content. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract = {{New particle formation (NPF) in the atmosphere substantially impacts
   ultrafine particle number concentrations and cloud condensation nuclei
   (CCN) levels. The impact of NPF on CCN levels depends on the ability of
   the particles to grow rapidly into the CCN size range thus avoiding loss
   due to scavenging. This work presents quantitative chemical composition
   measurements of individual 20 nm diameter particles during NPF using the
   Nano Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (NAMS). Sulfuric acid is shown to
   contribute quantitatively to changes in the sulfate mass fraction.
   However, growth due to sulfuric acid generally accounts for <50\% of the
   total particle growth. Ammonium and sulfate are highly correlated, but
   sulfuric acid is not neutralized to its thermodynamic endpoint.
   Carbonaceous matter accounts for >50\% of mass growth and is
   characteristic of fresh secondary organic aerosol. Differences in the
   overall growth rate from one event to another are caused by variations
   among all major chemical species and not just one individual species.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, several studies have been investigating the impact of
   thermal lensing in ocular media on the visual function. These studies
   have shown that when near-infrared (NIR) laser energy (1319 nm) is
   introduced to a human eye, the heating of the eye can be sufficient to
   alter the index of refraction of the media leading to transient changes
   in the visible wavefront through an effect known as thermal lensing,
   while remaining at a safe level. One of the main limitations of
   experimentation with human subjects, however, is the reliance on a
   subject's description of the effect, which can vary greatly between
   individuals. Therefore, a computational model was needed that could
   accurately represent the changes of an image as a function of changes in
   the index of refraction. First, to model changes in the index of
   refraction throughout the eye, a computational thermal propagation model
   was used. These data were used to generate a comprehensive ray tracing
   model of the human eye using Zemax (Radiant Zemax Inc, Redmond WA) via a
   gradient lens surface. Using this model, several different targets have
   been analyzed which made it possible to calculate real-world visual
   acuity so that the effect of changes in the index of refraction could be
   related back to changes in the image of a visual scene.}},

Abstract = {{Although electric vehicles are attracting increasing interest from
   consumers and automakers, the disadvantages associated with limited
   range and the current scarcity of public recharge stations have played a
   key role in limiting their large scale adoption. In this paper, we
   explore how information technologies might be used to mitigate `range
   anxiety' and further strengthen the potential of electric vehicle
   integration with the renewable energy generation and storage. We
   motivate several mobile applications/services which would improve the
   ownership experience of electric vehicles and flexibility for energy
   providers. Our work leverages a previously proposed sensor platform for
   collecting travel-time and energy-usage data for a road network by a
   community of electric car drivers. Travel-time and energy-usage on a
   given road segment may exhibit substantial variability due to
   environmental and temporal factors, e. g., congestion, road's grade, AC
   on/off, etc. Such variability in turn, makes it difficult to accurately
   predict travel-times as well as the feasible range of a car given its
   current energy reserves. However, by collecting statistical data using
   cars/mobiles as probes one can quantify such uncertainty and develop
   complementary algorithms to counter the anxiety and time waste
   associated with such uncertainty. This paper develops the necessary
   (routing) algorithms to support these new classes of
   applications/services for electric vehicles.}},

   intriguing catalytic activity for hydrogenation reactions, particularly

   can provide insight into the reaction mechanisms responsible for this

   highlight several recent model experiments and theoretical calculations
   on a well-structured gold surface that provide some insights. In
   addition to the behavior of hydrogen on a model gold surface, we review
   the reactivity of hydrogen on a model gold surface in regards to NO2
   reduction, chemoselective C=O bond hydrogenation, ether formation, and
   O-H bond dissociation in water and alcohols. Those studies indicate that
   atomic hydrogen has a weak interaction with gold surfaces which likely
   plays a key role in the unique hydrogenative chemistry of classical gold
   catalysts.}},

   coefficient is highly heterogeneous. Generally, a numerical method
   either uses a very fine computational mesh to resolve the
   heterogeneities and therefore becomes computationally inefficient, or it
   performs efficiently on a coarse mesh but gives inaccurate results.
   Standard nonoverlapping domain decomposition using mortar spaces to
   couple together the subdomains efficiently handles these equations in
   parallel, but the issue of heterogeneity is not directly addressed. We
   define new mortar spaces that incorporate fine scale information
   obtained from local cell problems, using the theory of homogenization as
   a heuristic guide to limit the number of degrees of freedom in the
   mortar space. This gives computational efficiency in parallel, even when
   the subdomain problems are fully resolved on a fine mesh. In the case of
   an elliptic coefficient satisfying the two-scale separation assumption,
   the method is provably accurate with respect to the heterogeneity.
   Formally first and second order mortar space approximations are
   constructed explicitly in two dimensions. Numerical tests are presented
   for one medium with the two-scale separation assumption and two without
   it. The results show that these new homogenization based mortar spaces
   work much better than simple polynomial based mortar spaces, and that
   generally the second order spaces work better than the first order ones.}},

Abstract = {{Information dependency may be the most important key for managing
   information exchange to reduce project risks. Studies to date have not
   successfully discovered objective and quantitative surrogate to measure
   information dependency. This paper suggests an approach to measure
   information dependency with the productivity relationships among various
   disciplines for heavy industrial engineering projects. As part of a
   Construction Industry Institute (CII) study, the authors identified the
   information exchange pattern of engineering disciplines. Based on the
   patterns, the authors discovered the information dependency that various
   engineering disciplines had with their productivity relationships and
   conducted a survey afterwards for validation. Both results show
   significant and consistent evidence suggesting that: 1) information of
   equipment and piping disciplines is statistically dependent rather than
   the other paired disciplines; and 2) productivity relationship can be a
   legitimate surrogate to measure information dependency between equipment
   and piping disciplines. As such, this study enlightens a research
   trajectory for improvement of engineering productivity.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of gold nanotracers to track adipose-derived stem cells in a
   PEGylated fibrin gel for dermal tissue engineering applications}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{325-336}},
Abstract = {{Evaluating the regenerative capacity of a tissue-engineered device in a
   noninvasive and synchronous manner is critical to determining the
   mechanisms for success in clinical applications. In particular, directly
   tracking implanted cells in a three-dimensional (3D) scaffold is
   desirable in that it enables the monitoring of cellular activity in a
   specific and localized manner. The authors' group has previously
   demonstrated that the PEGylation of fibrin results in a 3D scaffold that
   supports morphologic and phenotypic changes in mesenchymal stem cells
   that may be advantageous in wound healing applications. Recently, the
   authors have evaluated adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) as a
   mesenchymal cell source to regenerate skin and blood vessels due to
   their potential for proliferation, differentiation, and production of
   growth factors. However, tracking and monitoring ASCs in a 3D scaffold,
   such as a PEGylated fibrin gel, have not yet been fully investigated. In
   the current paper, nanoscale gold spheres (20 nm) as cell tracers for
   ASCs cultured in a PEGylated fibrin gel were evaluated. An advanced
   dual-imaging modality combining ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging was
   utilized to monitor rat ASCs over time. The ASCs took up gold
   nanotracers and could be detected up to day 16 with high sensitivity
   using photoacoustic imaging. There were no detrimental effects on ASC
   morphology, network formation, proliferation, and protein
   expression/secretion (ie, smooth muscle alpha-actin, vascular
   endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase-2, and matrix
   metalloproteinase-9) associated with gold nanotracers. Therefore,
   utilization of gold nanotracers can be an effective strategy to monitor
   the regenerative process of a stem cell source in a 3D gel for vascular
   and dermal tissue engineering applications.}},

Title = {{Synthesis and characterization of thermally rearranged (TR) polymers:
   effect of glass transition temperature of aromatic poly(hydroxyimide)
   precursors on TR process and gas permeation properties}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1}},

Pages = {{6063-6072}},
Abstract = {{Soluble aromatic polyimides containing ortho-positioned hydroxy groups
   were synthesized as precursors for thermal rearrangement (TR) to
   polybenzoxazoles (PBOs). Fully imidized polyimides with
   high-molecular-weights were afforded via a `one-pot' solution
   imidization technique (i.e., ester-acid method). The poly(hydroxyimide)s
   were designed to vary in their glass transition temperatures (T-g) by
   carefully selecting dianhydride-bisaminophenol combinations to introduce
   various levels of chain rigidity. TR conversion (imide-to-benzoxazole
   conversion) occurred in solid-state films only under inert atmosphere
   and over a temperature range of 300-450 degrees C, depending on the
   chemical structure (chain rigidity) of precursors. The effect of the
   precursor T-g on TR conversion was studied using TGA, DSC, FTIR and gel
   fraction measurements. The TR conversion temperature of
   imide-to-benzoxazole rearrangement strongly depended on the precursor
   T-g. Thus, for example, the feasible TR temperature was successfully
   reduced by similar to 100 degrees C by lowering the precursor T-g by
   using a bisphenol A type dianhydride in the polymer synthesis. Gas
   permeation properties of representative TR systems are also reported.
   The TR process significantly increased gas permeabilities while
   maintaining good selectivities. By correlating the TR conversion degree
   with gas transport properties, there appears to be an optimal TR
   conversion degree that can maximize both gas permeability and
   selectivity. Systematic studies on TR polymers derived from low T-g
   precursors were suggested to further explore this correlation.}},

Title = {{2013 Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Recommendations for the
   Diagnosis of Adult Hypertension, Assessment of Cardiovascular and other
   Hypertension-associated Risk, and Attainment of Therapeutic Goals}},
Journal = {{CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL}},

Pages = {{355-410}},
Abstract = {{Correlation between systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure
   (BP) level and target organ damage, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk,
   and long-term prognosis is much greater for ambulatory BP monitoring
   (ABPM) than daytime office measurements. The 2013 ABPM guidelines
   specified herein are based on ABPM patient outcomes studies and
   constitute a substantial revision of current knowledge. The asleep SBP
   mean and sleep-time relative SBP decline are the most significant
   predictors of CVD events, both individually as well as jointly when
   combined with other ABPM-derived prognostic markers. Thus, they should
   be preferably used to diagnose hypertension and assess CVD and other
   associated risks. Progressive decrease by therapeutic intervention of
   the asleep BP mean is the most significant predictor of CVD event-free
   interval. The 24-h BP mean is not recommended to diagnose hypertension
   because it disregards the more valuable clinical information pertaining
   to the features of the 24-h BP pattern. Persons with the same 24-h BP
   mean may display radically different 24-h BP patterns, ranging from
   extreme-dipper to riser types, representative of markedly different risk
   states. Classification of individuals by comparing office with either
   the 24-h or awake BP mean as ``masked normotensives{''} (elevated clinic
   BP but normal ABPM), which should replace the terms of ``isolated
   office{''} or ``white-coat hypertension{''}, and ``masked
   hypertensives{''} (normal clinic BP but elevated ABPM) is misleading and
   should be avoided because it disregards the clinical significance of the
   asleep BP mean. Outcome-based ABPM reference thresholds for men, which
   in the absence of compelling clinical conditions are 135/85 mmHg for the
   awake and 120/70 mmHg for the asleep SBP/DBP means, are lower by 10/5
   mmHg for SBP/DBP in uncomplicated, low-CVD risk, women and lower by
   15/10 mmHg for SBP/DBP in male and female high-risk patients, e. g.,
   with diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and/or past CVD events. In
   the adult population, the combined prevalence of masked normotension and
   masked hypertension is > 35\%. Moreover, > 20\% of ``normotensive{''}
   adults have a non-dipper BP profile and, thus, are at relatively high
   CVD risk. Clinic BP measurements, even if supplemented with home
   self-measurements, are unable to quantify 24- h BP patterning and asleep
   BP level, resulting in potential misclassification of up to 50\% of all
   evaluated adults. ABPM should be viewed as the new gold standard to
   diagnose true hypertension, accurately assess consequent tissue/organ,
   maternal/fetal, and CVD risk, and individualize hypertension
   chronotherapy. ABPM should be a priority for persons likely to have a
   blunted nighttime BP decline and elevated CVD risk, i.e., those who are
   elderly and obese, those with secondary or resistant hypertension, and
   those diagnosed with diabetes, CKD, metabolic syndrome, and sleep
   disorders. (Author Correspondence: rhermida@uvigo.es or prf@unife.it).}},

Abstract = {{Realizing the environmental benefits of solar photovoltaics (PV) will
   require reducing costs associated with perception, informational gaps
   and technological uncertainties. To identify opportunities to decrease
   costs associated with residential PV adoption, in this letter we use
   multivariate regression models to analyze a unique, household-level
   dataset of PV adopters in Texas (USA) to systematically quantify the
   effect of different information channels on aspiring PV adopters'
   decision-making. We find that the length of the decision period depends
   on the business model, such as whether the system was bought or leased,
   and on special opportunities to learn, such as the influence of other PV
   owners in the neighborhood. This influence accrues passively through
   merely witnessing PV systems in the neighborhood, increasing confidence
   and motivation, as well as actively through peer-to-peer communications.
   Using these insights we propose a new framework to provide public
   information on PV that could drastically reduce barriers to PV adoption,
   thereby accelerating its market penetration and environmental benefits.
   This framework could also serve as a model for other distributed
   generation technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion of microgeneration technologies, particularly rooftop
   photovoltaic (PV), represents a key option in reducing emissions in the
   residential sector. We use a uniquely rich dataset from the burgeoning
   residential PV market in Texas to study the nature of the consumer's
   decision-making process in the adoption of these technologies. In
   particular, focusing on the financial metrics and the information
   decision-makers use to base their decisions upon, we study how the
   leasing and buying models affect individual choices and, thereby, the
   adoption of capital-intensive energy technologies. Overall, our findings
   suggest that the leasing model more effectively addresses consumers'
   informational requirements and that, contrary to some other studies,
   buyers and lessees of PV do not necessarily differ significantly along
   socio-demographic variables. Instead, we find that the leasing model has
   opened up the residential PV market to a new, and potentially very
   large, consumer segment-those with a tight cash-flow situation.}},

Title = {{Potential for rooftop photovoltaics in Tokyo to replace nuclear capacity}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{In 2010, nuclear power accounted for 27\% of electricity production in
   Japan. The March 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi power station
   resulted in the closure of all of Japan's nuclear power plants and it
   remains an open question as to how many will reopen. Even before the
   loss of nuclear capacity, there were efforts in Japan to foster the use
   of renewable energy, including large scale solar power. Nuclear power
   plants in Japan provided more than just base-load by storing energy in
   large scale pumped hydroelectric storage systems, which was then
   released to provide some peaking capacity. If this storage were instead
   coupled to current generation rooftop solar systems in Tokyo, the
   combined system could help to meet peak requirements while at the same
   time providing similar to 26.5\% of the electricity Tokyo used to get
   from nuclear output, and do so 91\% of the time. Data from a study of
   rooftop space and a 34 yr data set of average daily irradiance in the
   Tokyo metropolitan area were used. Using pumped hydroelectric storage
   with 5.6 times this rooftop area could completely provide for TEPCO's
   nuclear capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition of peptide presented by the major histocompatibility complex
   (pMHC) molecule by the T-cell receptor (TCR) determines T-cell
   selection, development, differentiation, fate, and function. Despite
   intensive studies on the structures, thermodynamic properties, kinetic
   rates, and affinities of TCR-pMHC interactions in the past two decades,
   questions regarding the functional outcome of these interactions, i.e.
   how binding of the ab TCR heterodimer with distinct pMHCs triggers
   different intracellular signals via the adjacent CD3 components to
   produce different T-cell responses, remain unclear. Most kinetic
   measurements have used surface plasmon resonance, a three-dimensional
   (3D) technique in which fluid-phase receptors and ligands are removed
   from their cellular environment. Recently, several two-dimensional (2D)
   techniques have been developed to analyze molecular interactions on live
   T cells with pMHCs presented by surrogate antigen-presenting cells or
   supported planar lipid bilayers. The insights from these in situ
   analyses have provided a sharp contrast of the 2D network biology
   approach to the 3D reductionist approach and prompted rethinking of our
   current views of T-cell triggering. Based on these insights, we propose
   a mechanochemical coupled triggering hypothesis to explain why the in
   situ kinetic parameters differ so much from their 3D counterparts, yet
   correlate so much better with T-cell functional responses.}},

   high-order, and self-adaptive hp finite-element refinement strategy. The
   resulting numerical scheme provides accurate and reliable simulations of
   triaxial induction measurements while reducing the computational
   complexity of conventional 3D problems. We employed this method to
   quantify effects of borehole-eccentered triaxial tools fabricated with
   conductive and resistive mandrels. Numerical experiments indicate that a
   conductive mandrel can mitigate borehole-eccentered effects on
   horizontal magnetic field measurements to a level below 25\%, which
   contrast those observed in the presence of resistive mandrels, in which
   measurements can differ by more than 100\% depending solely upon the
   borehole-eccentered distance. When the mandrel and borehole were
   conductive, H-xy measurements experienced significant (up to 100\%)
   tool-eccentered effects across layers whose electrical conductivity was
   different from that of the borehole.}},

Abstract = {{Resolving thin layers and clearly delineating layer boundaries in
   inverted seismic sections are very important goals for exploration and
   production. Many seismic inversion methods based on a least-squares
   optimization approach with Tikhonov-type regularization can lead to
   unfocused transitions between adjacent layers. A basis pursuit inversion
   (BPI) algorithm based on the L-1 norm optimization method can, however,
   resolve sharp boundaries between layers. We have formulated a BPI
   algorithm for amplitude-versus-angle inversion and investigated its
   potential to improve contrasts between layers. Like the BPI for
   poststack case, the sparse layer constraint, rather than the sparse
   spike constraint, is used to construct the model space as a wedge
   dictionary. All the elements of the dictionary are bed reflectivities,
   which include solutions consisting of thin beds as well. With this
   dictionary, we use an L-1 norm optimization framework to derive three
   reflectivities, namely, R-p, R-s, and R-rho. Although BPI does not
   require a starting model, high-resolution absolute velocities (V-P, V-S)
   and density (rho) can be obtained by incorporating initial models in the
   BPI derived reflectivities. Tests on synthetic and field data show that
   the BPI algorithm can indeed detect and enhance layer boundaries by
   effectively removing the wavelet interference.}},

Abstract = {{The monostatic radar cross section (RCS) of a microstrip leaky-wave
   antenna (MLWA) is investigated. Both full-wave simulation and laboratory
   measurement are carried out to characterize its RCS as a function of
   frequency and aspect angle. Three distinct scattering features in the
   range-aspect plane are observed. By modeling the scattering mechanisms
   individually, the observed features can be clearly identified as the
   primary antenna mode scattering, higher-order bounce antenna mode
   scattering and structural mode scattering. The unique range-extended
   return due the antenna mode scattering is further interpreted using a
   time-of-arrival ray picture. It is shown that the extended range delay
   is directly attributable to the continuous aperture of the MLWA and the
   frequency-dependent group velocity of the leaky wave.}},

Title = {{On relative permeability data uncertainty and CO2 injectivity estimation
   for brine aquifers}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{200-212}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Performance assessment of possible CO2 storage schemes is often
   investigated through numerical simulation of the CO2 injection process.
   An important criterion of interest is the maximum sustainable injection
   rate. Relevant numerical models generally employ a multi-phase extension
   to Darcy's law, requiring data concerning the evolution of relative
   permeability for CO2 and brine mixtures with increasing CO2 saturation.
   Relative permeability data is acutely scarce for many geographical
   regions of concern and often cited as a major source of uncertainty.
   However, such data is expensive and time consuming to acquire. With a
   view to improving our understanding concerning the significance of
   relative permeability uncertainty on injectivity, this article presents
   a sensitivity analysis of sustainable CO2 injection rate with respect to
   permeability, porosity and relative permeability. Based on available
   relative permeability data obtained from 25 sandstone and carbonate
   cores discussed in the literature, injectivity uncertainty associated
   with relative permeability is found to be as high as +/- 57\% for open
   aquifers and low permeability closed aquifers (<50 mD). However, for
   high permeability closed aquifers (>100 mD), aquifer compressibility
   plays a more important role and the uncertainty due to relative
   permeability is found to reduce to +/- 6\%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Two campaigns were run with concentrated PZ at the University of Texas
   at Austin pilot plant for CO2 capture. One campaign used a simple
   stripper, and the next used an innovative 2-stage flash skid. Both
   campaigns were analyzed for their approach to equilibrium in the
   respective heater process units. The total pressure measurements from
   nearly all runs from both campaigns matched the total pressure
   prediction by the equilibrium model within 5\%. The energy efficiency
   with the 2-stage flash was low due to heat loss and a high approach
   temperature in the heat exchanger. The lowest heat duties for the simple
   stripper and 2-stage flash were 128 and 170 kJ/mol CO2, respectively.
   The 2-stage flash campaign demonstrated significantly higher hot side
   temperature approaches on the main heat exchanger, which increased the
   sensible heat requirement. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the heat
   duty of a representative case from the campaign could be reduced to 143
   kJ/mol CO2 with a hot side approach of 10 degrees C. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Oxidative degradation of monoethanolamine (MEA) in CO2 capture systems
   was studied using two different apparatuses and a variety of

   ten. The activation energy of the oxidation rate was 68-70 kJ/mol.
   Addition of 2\% CO2 to the gas increased oxidation by a factor of five.
   The oxidation rate was found to be approximately first-order in oxygen
   partial pressure. Addition of 50 ppm NO2 center dot or SO2 to the
   reactor gas had a minimal effect on the degradation rate. The mass
   balance was closed within 5\% at high gas flow and within 20\% at low

   density. Overall, the conversion efficiency at 2 mA cm(-2) is improved
   from 61\% to 74\% at 40 degrees C with the nanocrystalline IrO2. The

Title = {{Effects of bifunctional metal sulfide interlayers on photovoltaic
   properties of organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{5412-5421}},
Abstract = {{Bilayer organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells have been fabricated with
   chemical-bath deposited In2S3, SnS, and Sb2S3 interlayers between the
   organic P3HT hole-conducting and inorganic TiO2 electron-conducting
   layers. Sb has the highest electronegativity among the elements
   investigated, and the ionicity of the metal-sulfur bond decreases in the
   order In2S3 (15\%) > SnS (9\%) > Sb2S3 (7\%). Thus, with a larger
   covalent character of the Sb-S bond, Sb may bond to S atoms on P3HT
   relatively easily compared to In or Sn. Such chemical bonding between
   Sb2S3 and P3HT may then reduce the overall incompatibility between the
   TiO2 and P3HT layers, making Sb2S3-based devices more efficient compared
   to In2S3- and SnS-based devices. Along with strong photon absorption,
   the presence of the metal-sulfur bond promotes improved wetting between
   the TiO2 sand P3HT layers, resulting in dual functionality for the metal
   sulfide interlayers. However, along with differences in metal-sulfur
   bond ionicity, the efficiency improvements seen with Sb2S3 can further
   be attributed to factors like differences in crystal structure,
   morphology, photon absorption, charge carrier recombination rates, and
   the manner in which the sulfide layer interacts with TiO2. While further
   studies are required to elucidate the exact reason behind the behavior
   of Sb2S3, the findings discussed herein can provide guidelines for
   identifying novel absorber layers for developing efficient and
   cost-effective organic-inorganic hybrid photovoltaics.}},

Abstract = {{Expert Rev. Med. Devices 10(1), 125-134 (2013) The metastasis of cancer
   is a multistage process involving complex biological interactions and

   imaging methods capable of identifying the early stages of invasion and
   metastasis are lacking. Photoacoustic imaging is capable of providing
   noninvasive, real-time imaging of significant anatomical and
   physiological changes. indicating the progression of cancer invasion and
   metastasis. Preclinically, photoacoustic methods have been used to image
   lymphatic anatomy, including the sentinel lymph nodes, to identify
   circulating tumor cells within vasculature and to detect
   micrometastases. Progress has begun toward the development of clinically

Abstract = {{An in-flight dynamical method is introduced for use by sample-collection
   missions to identify the presence and quantity of collected sample
   material. The method, denoted as G-Sample, implements a
   maximum-likelihood estimator to identify the collected sample mass,
   based on onboard force-sensor measurements, thruster firings, and a
   dynamics model of the spacecraft. In terms of hardware, G-Sample
   requires only a force sensor. Hardware complexities are avoided by
   treating sample mass determination largely as a computational problem in
   modern estimation, rather than requiring the need for additional
   specialized equipment or sophisticated sensing architectures. Simulation
   examples are provided for a spacecraft configuration with a
   sample-collection device mounted on the end of an extended boom. In one
   representative example, a 1000 g sample mass is estimated to within 110
   g (95\% confidence) under realistic assumptions of thruster profile
   error, spacecraft parameter uncertainty, and sensor noise. For
   convenience to future mission design, an overall sample-mass estimation
   error budget is developed to approximate the effect of model
   uncertainty, sensor noise, data rate, and thrust profile error on the
   expected estimate of collected sample mass.}},

Abstract = {{Application of graphene as transparent electrodes is an active research

   optical characteristics. We report optical characteristics of hybrid
   materials of graphene and VO2. We observed a 12\% improvement in
   infrared transmittance with VO2 films deposited on graphene sapphire
   substrates compared to that of bare sapphire substrates. We also found
   that the phase transition temperature decreases as the number of
   graphene layers on the substrates increases. In the case of VO2 films on
   the substrate that was coated with four layers of graphene, the mean
   phase transition temperature was lowered to similar to 56 degrees C.}},

Title = {{Effectiveness of virtual models in design for additive manufacturing: a
   laser sintering case study}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{11-19}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies have conventionally
   focused on producing prototypes. However, recent trends show that AM is
   being increasingly used for production parts. With this shift from
   prototypes to production parts, there is a need to determine whether
   established engineering design techniques can be applied to AM
   processes, particularly techniques characteristic of the final
   implementation phase such as virtual (mathematical) modeling, or whether
   AM process-specific adjustments must be made.
   Design/methodology/approach - The effectiveness of applying virtual
   models to design problems utilizing AM processes was addressed using two
   approaches in this research. Literature was first reviewed to determine
   the current focus of the AM industry on virtual modeling, both
   analytical and numerical, and its implementation. Second, experiments
   were conducted to validate virtual models applied to fastener mechanism
   designs manufactured using laser sintering (LS).
   Findings - Limited research has been published that demonstrates the
   effectiveness of applying established design techniques, particularly
   virtual modeling techniques, to parts manufactured with AM processes.
   The experimental case study has demonstrated that, for the limited cases
   considered, design techniques capable of accommodating the complex
   material properties of LS materials, such as finite element analysis,
   are effective methods for predicting part performance in accordance with
   desired outcomes.
   Practical implications - The research indicates that designers can focus
   on designing quality LS parts with existing technology and methods
   rather than revamping their design methods due to the introduction of a
   new manufacturing technology.
   Originality/value - This research provides support for the application
   of established design methods to IS AM processes; validating what has
   previously been an assumed part of AM.}},

Abstract = {{Complex sheet metal components can be formed from lightweight aluminum
   and magnesium sheet alloys using superplastic forming technologies.
   Superplastic forming typically takes advantage of the high strain-rate
   sensitivity characteristic of grain-boundary-sliding (GBS) creep to
   obtain significant ductility at high temperatures. However, GBS creep
   requires fme-grained materials, which can be expensive and difficult to
   manufacture. An alternative is provided by materials that exhibit
   solute-drag (SD) creep, a mechanism that also produces elevated values
   of strain-rate sensitivity. SD creep typically operates at lower
   temperatures and faster strain rates than does GBS creep. Unlike GBS
   creep, solute-drag creep does not require a fine, stable grain size.
   Previous work by Boissiere et al. {[}1] suggested that the Mg-Y-Nd
   alloy, essentially WE43, deforms by SD creep at temperatures near 400
   degrees C. The present investigation examines both tensile and biaxial
   deformation behavior of Elektron (TM) 43 sheet, which has a composition
   similar to WE43, at temperatures ranging from 400 to 500 degrees C. Data
   are presented that provide additional evidence for SD creep in Elektron
   43 and demonstrate the remarkable degree of biaxial strain possible
   under this regime (>1000\%). These results indicate an excellent
   potential for producing complex 3-D parts, via superplastic forming,
   using this particular heat-treatable Mg alloy.}},

Abstract = {{A time-dependent material constitutive model is developed for the
   deformation of wrought Mg AZ31 sheet material at 450 degrees C. This
   material model is used to simulate gas-pressure bulge forming of AZ31
   sheet into hemispherical domes. Finite-element-method (REM) simulations
   using this material model are compared against experimental data
   obtained for dome height as a function of forming time under forming
   conditions identical to those assumed in the simulations. The
   time-dependent material model predicts experimental dome heights during
   forming with a quite useful accuracy. The most significant advantage of
   the time-dependent material model is that it can address the effect of
   preheating time on forming. Preheating times shorter than similar to 120
   s produce an increase in forming rate. This material model provides a
   quantitative means of accounting for that effect.}},

Title = {{Novel methodology for evaluating economic feasibility of low-water
   cooling technology retrofits at power plants}},
Journal = {{WATER POLICY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{292-308}},
Abstract = {{Increasing demand on water supplies - already strained by population and
   economic growth and instream flow requirements - means many areas are
   considering conservation and reallocation to meet their needs. One
   method of increasing water availability is through low-water cooling
   technologies at thermoelectric power plants. Cooling towers, hybrid
   wet-dry and dry cooling systems reduce water requirements and the
   environmental impact at power plants but require additional capital and
   operating expenditure. These expenses can be offset with revenue from
   leasing water rights made available by new cooling technologies and the
   added benefit of drought resiliency. Thus, cooling technology retrofits
   are hypothesized as cost-effective opportunities for increasing drought
   resiliency and supporting instream flows. To test this hypothesis, we
   developed a novel methodology for evaluating drought resiliency as a
   function of economic and technical performance parameters. Using a river
   basin-based water resources model of 39 Texas power plants, we
   illustrate this methodology to determine the feasibility of retrofitting
   alternative cooling technologies. At current capital costs and water
   prices, switching to alternative cooling technologies is economically
   justifiable today at three facilities. Higher water prices, coupled with
   higher volatility in water availability, will be likely to make
   low-water cooling technologies economically viable at more power plants
   in the future.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{17-29}},
Abstract = {{Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has the limitation of applications for
   multi-point geostatistics because it assumes Gaussian random field. It
   also uses all ensembles to get covariance matrix, even though they have
   different permeability field each other, resulting in filter divergence.
   The proposed method suggests the concept of clustered covariance by
   grouping initial ensembles using a distance-based method. Hausdorff
   distance is used for calculating similarity between permeability fields
   and they are separated by k-means clustering. When EnKF is applied to a
   2D channel field, it shows overshooting problem and mismatches the true
   production data. The proposed method gives better history matching and
   future performance prediction without overshooting problems.
   Furthermore, it shows stable results for sensitivity analyses over the
   number of total ensembles. The more accurate covariance is calculated by
   clustering, the better results are obtained.}},

   controlling oxidation and hydrolysis of TiCl3 at low pH (0.71-0.85) and
   low TiCl3 concentration (8-40 mM). As a photoanode for water oxidation

   KOH electrolyte under AM 1.5 G illumination of similar to 0.4 mA cm(-2)
   reached at an exceptionally low bias of -0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.4 V vs.

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of distributed convergence to efficient outcomes
   in coordination games through dynamics based on aspiration learning. Our
   first contribution is the characterization of the asymptotic behavior of
   the induced Markov chain of the iterated process in terms of an
   equivalent finite-state Markov chain. We then characterize explicitly
   the behavior of the proposed aspiration learning in a generalized
   version of coordination games, examples of which include network
   formation and common-pool games. In particular, we show that in generic
   coordination games the frequency at which an efficient action profile is
   played can be made arbitrarily large. Although convergence to efficient
   outcomes is desirable, in several coordination games, such as
   common-pool games, attainability of fair outcomes, i.e., sequences of
   plays at which players experience highly rewarding returns with the same
   frequency, might also be of special interest. To this end, we
   demonstrate through analysis and simulations that aspiration learning
   also establishes fair outcomes in all symmetric coordination games,
   including common-pool games.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a second order elliptic problem with a heterogeneous
   coefficient written in mixed form. The nonoverlapping mortar domain
   decomposition method is efficient in parallel if the mortar interface
   coupling space has a restricted number of degrees of freedom. In the
   heterogeneous case, we define a new multiscale mortar space that
   incorporates purely local information from homogenization theory to
   better approximate the solution along the interfaces with just a few
   degrees of freedom. In the case of a locally periodic heterogeneous
   coefficient of period epsilon, we prove that the new method achieves
   both optimal order error estimates in the discretization parameters and
   good approximation when e is small. Moreover, we present three numerical
   examples to assess its performance when the coefficient is not obviously
   locally periodic. We show that the new mortar method works well, and
   better than polynomial mortar spaces.}},

Abstract = {{We consider discretizations of a model elliptic problem by means of
   different numerical methods applied separately in different subdomains,
   termed multinumerics, coupled using the mortar technique. The grids need
   not match along the interfaces. We are also interested in the multiscale
   setting, where the subdomains are partitioned by a mesh of size h,
   whereas the interfaces are partitioned by a mesh of much coarser size H,
   and where lower-order polynomials are used in the subdomains and
   higher-order polynomials are used on the mortar interface mesh. We
   derive several fully computable a posteriori error estimates which
   deliver a guaranteed upper bound on the error measured in the energy
   norm. Our estimates are also locally efficient and one of them is robust
   with respect to the ratio H/h under an assumption of sufficient
   regularity of the weak solution. The present approach allows bounding
   separately and comparing mutually the subdomain and interface errors. A
   subdomain/interface adaptive refinement strategy is proposed and
   numerically tested.}},

Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{The number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) found in blood is known to
   be a prognostic marker for recurrence of primary tumors, however, most
   current methods for isolating CTCs rely on cell surface markers that are
   not universally expressed by CTCs. Dielectrophoresis (DEP) can
   discriminate and manipulate cancer cells in microfluidic systems and has
   been proposed as a molecular marker-independent approach for isolating
   CTCs from blood. To investigate the potential applicability of DEP to
   different cancer types, the dielectric and density properties of the
   NCI-60 panel of tumor cell types have been measured by dielectrophoretic
   field-flow fractionation (DEP-FFF) and compared with like properties of
   the subpopulations of normal peripheral blood cells. We show that all of
   the NCI-60 cell types, regardless of tissue of origin, exhibit
   dielectric properties that facilitate their isolation from blood by DEP.
   Cell types derived from solid tumors that grew in adherent cultures
   exhibited dielectric properties that were strikingly different from
   those of peripheral blood cell subpopulations while leukemia-derived
   lines that grew in non-adherent cultures exhibited dielectric properties
   that were closer to those of peripheral blood cell types. Our results
   suggest that DEP methods have wide applicability for the surface-marker
   independent isolation of viable CTCs from blood as well as for the
   concentration of leukemia cells from blood. (C) 2013 American Institute

Abstract = {{Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are prognostic markers for the recurrence
   of cancer and may carry molecular information relevant to cancer
   diagnosis. Dielectrophoresis (DEP) has been proposed as a molecular
   marker-independent approach for isolating CTCs from blood and has been
   shown to be broadly applicable to different types of cancers. However,
   existing batch-mode microfluidic DEP methods have been unable to process
   10 ml clinical blood specimens rapidly enough. To achieve the required
   processing rates of 106 nucleated cells/min, we describe a continuous
   flow microfluidic processing chamber into which the peripheral blood
   mononuclear cell fraction of a clinical specimen is slowly injected,
   deionized by diffusion, and then subjected to a balance of DEP,
   sedimentation and hydrodynamic lift forces. These forces cause tumor
   cells to be transported close to the floor of the chamber, while blood
   cells are carried about three cell diameters above them. The tumor cells
   are isolated by skimming them from the bottom of the chamber while the
   blood cells flow to waste. The principles, design, and modeling of the
   continuous-flow system are presented. To illustrate operation of the
   technology, we demonstrate the isolation of circulating colon tumor
   cells from clinical specimens and verify the tumor origin of these cells
   by molecular analysis. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

   information-theoretic sensitivity analysis is applied to the ignition
   delay problem using real experimental. The optimal design is obtained by
   maximizing the statistical dependence between the model parameters and
   observables, which is quantified in this study using mutual information.
   This is naturally posed in the Bayesian framework. The study shows that
   by monitoring the information gain after each measurement update, one
   can design a stopping criteria for the experimental process which gives
   a minimal set of experiments to efficiently learn the Arrhenius

Title = {{Electromagnetic Simulation of the Near-Field Distribution around a Wind
   Farm}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{An efficient approach to compute the near-field distribution around and
   within a wind farm under plane wave excitation is proposed. To make the
   problem computationally tractable, several simplifying assumptions are
   made based on the geometry problem. By comparing the approximations
   against full-wave simulations at 500 MHz, it is shown that the
   assumptions do not introduce significant errors into the resulting
   near-field distribution. The near fields around a 3 x 3 wind farm are
   computed using the developed methodology at 150 MHz, 500 MHz, and 3 GHz.
   Both the multipath interference patterns and the forward shadows are
   predicted by the proposed method.}},

Title = {{Synthesis of macroporous poly(acrylic acid)-carbon nanotube composites

Abstract = {{Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) formed between Acrylic Acid (AA) and
   Choline Chloride (CCl) exhibit certain properties of ionic liquids (e.
   g. high viscosity) that make them suitable for frontal polymerization
   (FP). The use of DESs not only as a monomer but also as the solvent
   prevents the use of additional solvents (i.e. typically of organic
   nature) and offers a green tool for the synthesis of functional
   composites. We have recently explored this approach for the preparation
   of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(methacrylic acid). In this work, we
   have taken advantage of the outstanding capability of DESs to solubilize
   and/or disperse a number of substances to incorporate - in a homogeneous
   fashion - carbon nanotubes (in this particular case, N-doped MWCNT -
   CNxMWCNTs) in the polymerizable DES. Interestingly, CNxMWCNTs also
   played the role of an inert filler in FP. The resulting PAA-CNxMWCNT
   composites exhibited some distinct features as compared to previous PAA
   also obtained via DES-assisted FP. For instance, PAA-CNxMWCNT composites
   can undergo swelling depending on the pH, as bare PAA. However, the
   presence of CNxMWCNTs allows the formation of a macroporous structure
   after submission to a freeze-drying process, the achievement of which
   was not possible in bare PAA. The combination of structural (e. g.
   macroporosity) and functional (e. g. stimuli responsive) properties
   exhibited by these materials besides an eventually high biocompatibility
   - coming from the green character of the DES-assisted synthesis - should
   make the resulting macroporous PAA-CNxMWCNT composites excellent
   candidates for their future application as biomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroendocrine mechanisms are major determinants of the normal 24-h
   blood pressure (BP) pattern. At the central level, integration of the
   major driving factors of this temporal variability is mediated by
   circadian rhythms of monoaminergic systems in conjunction with those of
   the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid,
   opioid, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, plus endothelial systems and
   specific vasoactive peptides. Humoral secretions are typically episodic,
   coupled either to sleep and/or the circadian endogenous (suprachiasmatic
   nucleus) central pacemaker clock, but exhibiting also weekly, monthly,
   seasonal, and annual periodicities. Sleep induction and arousal are
   influenced also by many hormones and chemical substances that exhibit
   24-h variation, e. g., arginine vasopressin, vasoactive intestinal
   peptide, melatonin, somatotropin, insulin, steroids, serotonin,
   corticotropin-releasing factor, adrenocorticotropic hormone,
   thyrotropin-releasing hormone, endogenous opioids, and prostaglandin E2,
   all with established effects on the cardiovascular system. As a
   consequence, physical, mental, and pathologic stimuli that activate or
   inhibit neuroendocrine effectors of biological rhythmicity may also
   interfere with, or modify, the temporal BP structure. Moreover,
   immediate adjustment to exogenous components/environment demands by BP
   rhythms is modulated by the circadian-time-dependent responsiveness of
   biological oscillators and their neuroendocrine effectors. This
   knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the pathophysiology
   of abnormalities of the 24-h BP pattern and level and their correction
   through circadian rhythm-based chronotherapeutic strategies. (Author

Title = {{Administration-Time Differences in Effects of Hypertension Medications
   on Ambulatory Blood Pressure Regulation}},
Journal = {{CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{280-314}},
Abstract = {{Specific features of the 24-h blood pressure (BP) pattern are linked to
   progressive injury of target tissues and risk of cardiovascular disease
   (CVD) events. Several studies have consistently shown an association
   between blunted asleep BP decline and risk of fatal and nonfatal CVD
   events. Thus, there is growing focus on ways to properly control BP
   during nighttime sleep as well as during daytime activity. One strategy,
   termed chronotherapy, entails the timing of hypertension medications to
   endogenous circadian rhythm determinants of the 24-h BP pattern.
   Significant and clinically meaningful treatment-time differences in the
   beneficial and/or adverse effects of at least six different classes of
   hypertension medications, and their combinations, are now known.
   Generally, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are more effective with
   bedtime than morning dosing, and for dihydropyridine derivatives bedtime
   dosing significantly reduces risk of peripheral edema. The
   renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is highly circadian rhythmic and
   activates during nighttime sleep. Accordingly, evening/bedtime ingestion
   of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) benazepril,
   captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril,
   spirapril, trandolapril, and zofenopril exerts more marked effect on the
   asleep than awake systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP means. Likewise,
   the bedtime, in comparison with morning, ingestion schedule of the
   angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs irbesartan, olmesartan,
   telmisartan, and valsartan exerts greater therapeutic effect on asleep
   BP, plus significant increase in the sleep-time relative BP decline,
   with the additional benefit, independent of drug terminal half-life, of
   converting the 24-h BP profile into a more normal dipping pattern. This
   is the case also for the bedtime versus upon-awakening regimen of
   combination ARB-CCB, ACEI-CCB, and ARB-diuretic medications. The
   chronotherapy of conventional hypertension medications constitutes a new
   and cost-effective strategy for enhancing the control of daytime and
   nighttime SBP and DBP levels, normalizing the dipping status of their
   24-h patterning, and potentially reducing the risk of CVD events and
   end-organ injury, for example, of the blood vessels and tissues of the
   heart, brain, kidney, and retina. (Author correspondence:

Abstract = {{In this paper, the long-term monitoring results for hydrophobic organic
   compounds, specifically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), from a
   field demonstration of capping contaminated sediments at the Anacostia
   River in Washington DC are presented and analyzed. In situ pore water
   concentrations in field-contaminated sediments in the demonstration caps
   were quantified using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based passive
   sampling device. High resolution vertical pore water concentration
   profiles were measured using the device and were used to infer fate and
   transport of polycyclic aromatics hydrocarbons (PAHs) at the site. The
   derived pore water concentrations were compared with observed
   bioaccumulation and solid-phase concentration profiles to infer
   contaminant migration rates and mechanisms. Observed pore water
   concentrations were found to be a better predictor of bioaccumulation
   than solid-phase concentrations. Solid-phase concentrations were low in
   cores which implied containment of contamination; however pore water
   profiles showed that contaminant migration had occurred in the first few
   years after cap placement. The discrepancy is the result of the low
   sorption capacity of the sand. Because of surface re-contamination, low
   sorption capacity in the demonstration caps and strong tidal pumping
   effects, steady state contaminant profiles were reached in the caps
   several years after placement. Despite re-contamination at the surface,
   steady state concentrations in the capped areas showed decreased
   contamination levels relative to the control area.}},

Title = {{Macro Analysis of the Electro-Adsorption Process in Low Concentration
   NaCl Solutions for Water Desalination Applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY}},

Abstract = {{Capacitive deionization (CDI) has become a very attractive desalination
   technology due to its capability of returning a fraction of the input
   energy during the regeneration of its adsorbent electrodes. As in any
   separation technique, analysis of the mass transfer phenomena occurring
   in this water treatment method is vital to evaluate and extend the
   performance of a desalination system. This publication proposes a novel
   method to estimate the net electro-adsorption rate of a CDI cell from a
   series of low concentration desalination experiments coupled with a
   one-dimensional electro-adsorption model. In the proposed methodology, a
   one-dimensional model is presented and two regimes are identified based
   on the presence or absence of a convection-diffusion layer within the
   bulk solution, as dictated by the electro-diffusion based Peclet number.
   For each of these regimes, the net adsorption flux is calculated based
   on the velocity at which ions are transported toward the electrodes. The
   proposed model is then solved, first under the assumption of an infinite
   electrode adsorption capacitance before relaxing this condition, and
   correlated against the experimental data to assess the global
   electro-adsorption rate. The analysis in this paper also provides unique
   physical insight into the macro-scale mass transfer processes that
   control desalination in CDI. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract = {{The development and widespread application of vaccines has been one of
   the most significant achievements of modern medicine. Vaccines have not
   only been instrumental in controlling and even eliminating
   life-threatening diseases like polio, measles, diphtheria, etc., but
   have also been immensely powerful in enhancing the worldwide outlook of
   public health over the past century. Despite these successes, there are
   still many complex disorders (e. g., cancer, HIV, and other emerging
   infectious diseases) for which effective preventative or therapeutic
   vaccines have been difficult to develop. This failure can be attributed
   primarily to our inability to precisely control and modulate the highly
   complex immune memory response, specifically the cellular response.
   Dominated by B and T cell maturation and function, the cellular response
   is primarily initiated by potent immunostimulators and antigens.
   Efficient and targeted delivery of these immunomodulatory and
   immunostimulatory molecules to appropriate cells is key to successful
   development of next generation vaccine formulations. Over the past
   decade, particulate carriers have emerged as an attractive means for
   enhancing the delivery efficacy and potency of vaccines and associated
   immunomodulatory molecules. Specifically, polymer-based micro and
   nanoparticles are being extensively studied for a wide variety of
   applications. In this review, we discuss the immunological fundamentals
   for developing effective vaccines and how materials and material
   properties can be exploited to improve these therapies. Particular
   emphasis is given to polymer-based particles and how the route of
   administration of particulate systems affects the phenotype and
   robustness of an immune response. Comparison of various strategies and
   recent advancements in the field are discussed along with insights into
   current limitations and future directions.}},

Title = {{Disturbance Effect on Time-Dependent Yield Stress Measurement of
   Bentonite Suspensions}},
Journal = {{GEOTECHNICAL TESTING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{78-87}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Disturbance effect on time-dependent yield stress measurement of
   bentonite suspension was investigated using vane and cone and plate
   geometry. With cone and plate geometry, the disturbance occurs as a
   result of the large strains the suspensions are subjected to when placed
   on the lower plate and when the cone is lowered to the testing position
   before the actual shear stress is applied. As an alternative, vane
   geometry has been used to measure yield stress in bentonite suspension
   to (1) minimize the placing disturbance, and (2) eliminate the loading
   disturbance. Even though a minimal amount of disturbance was still
   induced by vane geometry, it was assumed that the amount of disturbance
   was small enough to be ignored compared to that with cone and plate
   geometry. Yield stresses of bentonite suspensions at different weight
   fractions and various resting times were determined from stress ramp
   tests. Linear relationships were developed between yield stresses
   measured with the different geometries. Disturbance rapidly increased up
   to approximately 50 \% with resting times, then converged at long
   resting times (60 \% at 10 days). This indicates that cone and plate
   geometry significantly underestimated the actual yield stress of the
   tested material because of disturbance. Based on the quantified
   disturbance, a method to predict the undisturbed yield stress from
   disturbed one was proposed. The observations were interpreted with
   structural kinetics.}},

Title = {{Spectrum-Sharing Transmission Capacity with Interference Cancellation}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{76-86}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper analyzes large-scale networks that share the spectrum with
   interference cancellation (IC). The efficiency of spectrum sharing is
   determined primarily by interference, which in turn depends on the
   spatial densities, the interference cancellation method, and the
   spectrum sharing method, i.e., underlay or overlay. By assuming the
   Poisson distribution for transmitters, equal transmission power in the
   same system, and an interference-limited environment, this paper finds
   the performance gain from IC in terms of spectrum-sharing transmission
   capacity (S-TC), defined as the number of successful transmissions per
   unit area while guaranteeing the target outage probabilities of all
   coexisting systems. The effectiveness of IC is characterized by the
   coefficient of cancellation (CoC), and specific CoC values are derived
   for two simple IC scenarios, the strong interferer and the close
   interferer cancellation, with the assumption of having perfect
   information for channel states of interfering links and interferer
   locations. The sum S-TC optimal spatial densities of the two systems are
   given. Finally, CoC conditions to determine the superiority of an
   underlay or overlay method are presented. We verify that the underlay
   method could be preferred depending on the CoCs of coexisting systems;
   that is starkly different from the case without IC, in which the overlay
   method is always better.}},

Abstract = {{High-voltage spinel cathodes LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 are promising candidates for
   large-scale energy-storage applications such as electric vehicles.
   However, the widespread adoption of this high-voltage spinel cathode is
   hampered by severe capacity fade, particularly at elevated temperatures,
   resulting from aggressive formation of a thick solid-electrolyte
   interphase (SEI) layer through side reactions with the electrolyte at
   the high operating voltage, cationic ordering between Mn4+ and Ni2+ ions
   in the crystal lattice, and formation of a rock salt LixNi1-xO impurity
   phase. While these issues have been explored, the wide variation in
   physical and electrochemical properties with different synthesis methods
   is not fully understood. In this investigation, we present how the
   synthesis conditions of the co-precipitation method influence the
   microstructure and morphology through nucleation and growth of crystals
   in solution. The samples were prepared by two similar wet-chemical
   routes and were characterized by microscopy and electrochemical methods
   to determine the role of microstructure and morphology in the
   electrochemical performance. Various factors such as the degree of
   cation ordering between Mn4+ and Ni-2+, Mn3+ content, Ni-Mn ratio in the
   sample, change in lattice parameter with the state of charge, and
   surface crystal planes were examined to develop a better understanding
   of the factors influencing the electrochemical performance. It is found
   that the surface crystal planes, the arrangement of lithium ions near
   the surface, and the lithium diffusion mechanism have a dominant effect
   on the capacity retention and rate performance.}},

Abstract = {{The move to low-k1 lithography makes it increasingly difficult to print
   feature sizes that are a small fraction of the wavelength of light. With
   further delay in the delivery of extreme ultraviolet lithography, these
   difficulties will motivate the research community to explore
   increasingly broad solutions. We propose that there is significant
   research potential in studying the essential premise of the
   design/manufacturing handoff paradigm. Today this premise revolves
   around design rules that define what implementations are legal, and raw
   shapes, which define design intent, and are treated as a fixed
   requirement for lithography. In reality, layout features may vary within
   certain tolerances without violating any design constraints. The
   knowledge of such tolerances can help improve the manufacturability of
   layout features while still meeting design requirements. We propose a
   methodology to convert electrical slack in a design to shape slack or
   tolerances on individual layout shapes. We show how this can be done for
   two important implementation fabrics: (a) cell-library-based digital
   logic and (b) static random access memory. We further develop a
   tolerance-driven optical proximity correction algorithm that utilizes
   this shape slack information during mask preparation to ensure that all
   features prints within their shape slacks in presence of lithographic
   process variations. Experiments on 45 nm silicon on insulator cells
   using accurate process models show that this approach reduces
   postlithography delay errors by 50\%, and layout hotspots by 47\%
   compared to conventional methods. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3-D) integration with through-silicon-vias (TSVs) has
   emerged as an effective approach to overcome the wiring limit beyond the
   32 nm technology node. Due to the mismatch of thermal expansion between
   the via material and Si, thermal stresses ubiquitously exist in the
   integrated 3-D structures. The thermal stresses can be significant to
   raise serious reliability issues, such as TSV extrusion and mobility
   degradation of logic devices. To understand the characteristics of the
   thermal stresses in TSVs, experimental measurements and numerical
   analysis are presented in this work. A precision wafer curvature
   technique was used together with micro-Raman spectroscopy to form a
   complementary approach to characterize the deformation and stresses in
   the TSV structures. The microstructures of the Cu vias were analyzed to
   provide insights to the deformation mechanisms. Guided by the
   experimental observations, finite element analysis was performed to
   analyze the thermal stresses taking into account the elastic anisotropy
   of Si and the plasticity of Cu. It was found that plastic deformation is
   localized within the Cu vias near the via/Si interface and may play an
   important role in TSV extrusion. Finally, the effect of thermal stresses
   on carrier mobility was investigated to evaluate the keep-out zone (KOZ)
   for logic devices near the TSVs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Chemically modified graphene (CMG) nanoplatelets have shown great
   promise in various applications due to their electrical properties and
   high surface area. Chemical doping is one of the most effective methods
   to tune the electronic properties of graphene materials. In this work,
   novel B-doped nanoplatelets (borane-reduced graphene oxide, B-rG-0) were
   produced on a large scale via the reduction of graphene oxide by a
   borane-tetrahydrofuran adduct under reflux, and their use for
   supercapacitor electrodes was studied. This is the first report on the
   production of B-doped graphene nanoplatelets from a solution process and
   on the use of B-doped graphene materials in supercapacitors. The B-rG-0
   had a high specific surface area of 466 m(2)/g and showed excellent
   supercapacitor performance including a high specific capacitance of 200
   F/g In aqueous electrolyte as well as superior surface area-normalized
   capacitance to typical carbon-based supercapacitor materials and good
   stability after 4500 cycles. Two- and three-electrode cell measurements
   showed that energy storage In the B-rG-0 supercapacitors was contributed
   by Ion adsorption on the surface of the nanoplatelets In addition to
   electrochemical redox reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Although sub-100 nm nanoclusters of metal nanoparticles are of interest
   in many fields including biomedical imaging, sensors, and catalysis, it
   has been challenging to control their morphologies and chemical
   properties. Herein, a new concept is presented to assemble equilibrium
   Au nanoclusters of controlled size by tuning the colloidal interactions
   with a polymeric stabilizer, PLA(1k)-b-PEG(10k)-b-PLA(1k). The
   nanoclusters form upon mixing a dispersion of similar to 5 nm Au
   nanospheres with a polymer solution followed by partial solvent
   evaporation. A weakly adsorbed polymer quenches the equilibrium
   nanocluster size and provides steric stabilization. Nanocluster size is
   tuned from similar to 20 to similar to 40 nm by experimentally varying
   the final Au nanoparticle concentration and the polymer/Au ratio, along
   with the charge on the initial Au nanoparticle surface. Upon
   biodegradation of the quencher, the nanoclusters reversibly and fully
   dissociate to individual similar to 5 nm primary particles. Equilibrium
   cluster size is predicted semiquantitatively with a free energy model
   that balances short-ranged depletion and van der Waals attractions with
   longer-ranged electrostatic repulsion, as a function of the Au and
   polymer concentrations. The close spacings of the Au nanoparticles In
   the clusters produce strong NIR extinction over a broad range of
   wavelengths from 650 to 900 nm, which is of practical interest in
   biomedical imaging.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{690-700}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{To provide for more detailed and accurate load calculations and energy
   simulation of buildings, the effect of blinds on convection heat
   transfer at interior window surfaces was analyzed. Based on full-scale
   experiments in an office-size chamber for various diffuser locations,
   window geometry, and blind angles, the study provides convective heat
   transfer models for natural convection, forced convection due to a
   ceiling slot diffuser, and forced convection due to a floor register.
   Results are given in the form of correlations which relate either supply
   volumetric flow rate or room-surface temperature difference to
   convection heat transfer at both window and exterior wall surfaces.
   Results show that heat transfer is dependent on supply flow rate, blind
   angle, diffuser location and window configuration. Results are compared
   against previously reported data and show that convection in cases with
   blinds follows the same form as often arises in turbulent forced
   convection situations, but differs appreciably in magnitude from
   previously given models for bare windows. These results should allow for
   more accurate simulation of energy use in buildings and contribute to
   the construction of more energy efficient buildings. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Relative permeabilities for three-phase flow are commonly predicted from
   two-phase-flow measurements using empirical models. These empirical
   models are usually tested against available steady-state data. However,
   the oil flow is transient during various production stages {[}e.g., gas
   injection after waterflood and steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)].
   Hence, there is a need to test the empirical models against
   unsteady-state or transient data.
   We compare two sets of three-phase oil-permeability data measured during
   tertiary gasflood. The first data set, which was recently published
   (Dehghanpour et al. 2011a), is measured during transient
   gravity-drainage experiments, and will be detailed further here. The
   second set was measured by Oak et al. (1990) during steady-state
   corefloods. We compare the two data sets with the corresponding
   two-phase permeability curves, and observe different qualitative
   behaviours. The comparison indicates that during steady-state tertiary
   gasflood, the presence and flow of water restrict the oil flow, while
   during transient tertiary gasflood, water-saturation drop enhances the
   oil flow. We test the performance of well-known empirical models further
   in predicting the two data sets, and explain how Stone I and
   saturation-weighted interpolation (SWI) should be used to usefully
   predict oil permeability during a three-phase tertiary displacement.}},

   interplays with imide-to-benzoxazole conversion. The acidic degradation
   product, as detected by H-1 NMR, is suspected to have some catalytic
   effect on the TR process, which along with the protecting function of
   the acetate groups, resulted in a lower onset TR conversion temperature,
   the ability to conduct the TR process in air, and a higher TR conversion
   level. Gas permeation properties greatly depend on the
   ortho-functionality of polyimide precursors as well. The precursor films
   containing larger functional groups are much more permeable with
   comparable gas selectivities. Similarly, the resulting TR polymers
   formed from polyimides with larger leaving groups also showed much
   higher gas permeabilities despite similar degrees of TR conversion. The
   incorporation of bulkier functional groups in the TR precursors provides
   an effective way to significantly improve the gas transport performance,
   particularly the gas permeabilities of both the polyimide precursors and
   the resulting TR polymers.}},

Abstract = {{The charge-discharge behaviors of doped high-voltage spinel oxides
   LiMn1.5Ni0.5-xMxO4 (M = Cr, Fe, Co, and Ga) have been investigated
   between 5.0 and 2.0 V before and after post-annealing at 700 degrees C.
   It is found that the discharge profiles of LiMn1.5Ni0.5-xMxO4 below 3 V
   are influenced by the dopant ions due to the variations in lattice
   strain during lithium ion insertion into 16c octahedral sites caused by
   the differences in the degree of cation ordering in the 16d sites of the
   spinel lattice. The differences in the degree of cation ordering can be
   attributed to the size differences between the Mn4+ and M3+ (M = Cr, Fe,
   Co, and Ga) ions. Furthermore, after post-annealing at 700 degrees C,
   the degree of cation ordering in the 16d sites of the undoped and
   Fe-doped samples increases, as supported by the discharge profile below
   3 V, decrease in lattice parameter, and a reduction in microstrain. In
   contrast, the highest degree of cation disorder in the 16d sites is
   found with Co doping due to the uniform distribution of the Co dopant
   ions in the bulk and the lower concentration of Ni2+ ions in the bulk
   compared to the other doped samples that encounter a segregation of the
   dopant ions to the surface. The study demonstrates that the
   charge-discharge behavior below 3 V is an effective way to assess
   precisely the degree of cation ordering in the 5 V spinels.}},

Title = {{Surface modification of polypyrrole via affinity peptide: quantification
   and mechanism}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1060-1066}},
Abstract = {{The conducting polymer, polypyrrole (PPy), is an exciting substrate for
   basic research to study cell behavior in the presence of exogenous
   electric fields and has potential for clinical application as a coating
   for neural electrodes. However, typical surface modification approaches
   (e. g., copolymerization of pyrrole and pyrrole derivatives,
   post-polymerization modification, doping with functional biomolecules)
   reduce the electrical conductivity and hence the utility of the
   material. In previous work, a 12 amino acid peptide, T59, was evolved to
   bind to PPy and provide a novel means of surface modification that does
   not reduce the bulk conductivity. In the current study, we have used
   equilibrium binding assays and force spectroscopy to determine that the
   affinity of T59 to PPy is 92.6 +/- 21.4 nM, with a maximum surface
   density of 5.1 +/- 1.7 femtomoles per cm(2) by equilibrium binding
   assay, and that the off- rate of this binding pair is 2.5 s(-1), with a
   calculated on-rate of 2.6 +/- 10(7) M-1 s(-1). This suggests that T59
   possesses a high affinity for PPy with binding that occurs in a rapid
   equilibrium. We also present evidence in support of a proposed mechanism
   of binding for T59 to PPy; an association of an aspartic acid (D8) and
   the delocalized positive charge on the backbone of oxidized PPy is
   indicated as the key interaction. Understanding the binding parameters
   and mechanism of this novel bio/synthetic interface is important as we
   try to understand how best to employ PPy-based materials.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) has
   substantial effects on behavior and performance of concrete structures.
   In this study, a time-dependent variation of CTE in hardening concrete
   was examined based on a series of field experiments using a device
   called impervious non-stress cylinder (INC). The results showed
   consistent trends: (1) the CTE at the time of setting is about twice as
   high as the CTE in the stabilized stage and (2) after the CTE's initial
   sudden drop, it starts to slightly increase for a certain period of time
   and then stabilizes. The present study also quantitatively investigated
   the effect of time-dependent CTE variation on thermal stress
   developments. The results revealed that the effect of CTE's
   time-dependent variation is non-negligible; rather, it may be of great
   importance for accurate assessments of early-age cracking potential and
   the later-age behavior and response of concrete structures. Published by

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{316-326}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Despite their three-layer-composite cross section, the stability of
   glass fiber reinforced plastics (GRPs) pipes has been evaluated only
   through the allowable deflection and nominal stiffness (SN) in the
   design stage without considering the fracture characteristics of
   materials. This study suggests a safety evaluation method based on the
   strength and fracture characteristics of pipe wall materials. Also, the
   present study proposes a formula to calculate an optimum pipe wall
   thickness and a method to determine the total bending moment (the sum of
   moments due to vertical earth pressure, horizontal earth pressure, and
   live load). To this end, the present study conducted a quantitative
   evaluation on structural behavior of GRP pipes using the assumptions of
   earth pressure distribution proposed by Spangler and Howard as well as
   the theories of mechanics of materials and structural analysis. Also,
   the equations to calculate the total moment coefficient, minimum pipe
   wall thickness, and optimum GRP layer thickness were derived by
   analyzing the characteristics of bending moment distribution in GRP
   pipes. By proposing a reasonable total bending moment calculating
   equation and optimum design method, this study intends to provide useful
   basic data for economical manufacturing and valid structural safety
   evaluation of GRP pipes. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Both supervised and semisupervised algorithms for hyperspectral data
   analysis typically assume that all unlabeled data belong to the same set
   of land-cover classes that is represented by labeled data. This is not
   true in general, however, since there may be new classes in the
   unexplored regions within an image or in areas that are geographically
   near but topographically distinct. This problem is more likely to occur
   when one attempts to build classifiers that cover wider areas; such
   classifiers also need to address spatial variations in acquired spectral
   signatures if they are to be accurate and robust. This paper presents a
   semisupervised spatially adaptive mixture model (SESSAMM) to identify
   land covers from hyperspectral images in the presence of previously
   unknown land-cover classes and spatial variation of spectral responses.
   SESSAMM uses a nonparametric Bayesian framework to apply spatially
   adaptive mechanisms to the mixture model with (potentially) infinitely
   many components. In this method, each component in the mixture has
   spatially adapted parameters estimated by Gaussian process regression,
   and spatial correlations between indicator variables are also
   considered. The proposed SESSAMM algorithm is applied to hyperspectral
   data from Botswana and from the DC Mall, where some classes are present
   only in the unlabeled data. SESSAMM successfully differentiates
   unlabeled instances of previously known classes from unknown classes and
   provides better results than the standard Dirichlet process mixture
   model and other alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel geodesic-active-contour-based (GAC-based) variational
   model that uses two level-set functions to segment the right and left
   ventricles and the epicardium in short-axis magnetic resonance (MR)
   images. For the right ventricle, the myocardial wall is typically very
   thin and hard to identify using the resolution of existing MR scanners.
   We propose to use two level sets to identify both the endocardial wall
   by pushing away one level-set function from another, in the setting of
   the edge-driven GAC model with a new edge detection function. Existing
   edge detection functions have strict restrictions on the location of
   initial contours. We develop a new edge detection function that relaxes
   this restriction and propose an iterative method that uses a sequence of
   edge detection functions to minimize the energy of our model
   successively. Experimental results are presented to validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a submerged evacuated circular cylindrical shell subjected
   to an external impulse loading and focus on the numerical simulation of
   the radiation by such a shell into the surrounding fluid. The structure
   of the radiated field in question is complex, and the only fully
   successful attempts at its numerical simulation were those where the
   shell was treated as an elastic body, i.e. where all the assumptions
   accommodating the distinctive geometry of a shell were abandoned. Our
   objective is to attempt introducing a mathematical model of the system
   that would be based on a shell theory more advanced than the ones used
   so far in the present context but that, at the same time, would produce
   the results of the same level of accuracy as the more complex,
   non-shell-theory-based models. We demonstrate that this is indeed
   possible, and that employing the Reissner-Mindlin shell theory within
   the framework of the semi-analytical methodology developed in our
   earlier work allows for an accurate reproduction of the structure of the
   radiated field without resorting to treating the shell as an elastic
   body. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Epitaxial strontium titanate (STO) films have been grown by atomic layer
   deposition (ALD) on Si(001) substrates with a thin STO buffer layer
   grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Four unit cells of STO grown by
   MBE serve as the surface template for ALD growth. The STO films grown by
   ALD are crystalline as-deposited with minimal, if any, amorphous SiOx
   layer at the STO-Si interface. The growth of STO was achieved using
   bis(triisopropylcyclopentadienyl)-strontium, titanium tetraisopropoxide,
   and water as the coreactants at a substrate temperature of 250 degrees
   C. In situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed that
   the ALD process did not induce additional Si-O bonding at the STO-Si
   interface. Postdeposition XPS analysis also revealed sporadic carbon
   incorporation in the as-deposited films. However, annealing at a
   temperature of 250 degrees C for 30 mm in moderate to high vacuum
   (10(-6)-10(-9) Torr) removed the carbon species. Higher annealing
   temperatures (>275 degrees C) gave rise to a small increase in Si-O
   bonding, as indicated by XPS, but no reduced Ti species were observed.
   X-ray diffraction revealed that the as-deposited STO films were c-axis
   oriented and fully crystalline. A rocking curve around the STO(002)
   reflection gave a full width at half maximum of 0.30 degrees +/- 0.06
   degrees for film thicknesses ranging from 5 to 25 nm. Cross-sectional
   transmission electron microscopy revealed that the STO films were
   continuous with conformal growth to the substrate and smooth interfaces
   between the ALD- and MBE-grown STO. Overall, the results indicate that
   thick, crystalline STO can be grown on Si(001) substrates by ALD with
   minimal formation of an amorphous SiOx layer using a four-unit-cell STO
   buffer layer grown by MBE to serve as the surface template. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This article aims to achieve computational reliability and energy
   efficiency through codevelopment of algorithms, device, and circuit
   designs for application-specific, reconfigurable architectures. The new
   methodology characterizes aging-switching activity and aging-supply
   voltage relationships that are applicable for minimizing power
   consumption and task execution efficiency in order to achieve low bit
   energy ratio (BER). In addition, a new dynamic management algorithm
   (DMA) is proposed to alleviate device degradation and to extend system
   lifespan. In contrast to traditional workload balancing schemes in which
   cores are regarded as homogeneous, the new algorithm ranks cores as
   ``highly competitive,{''} ``less competitive,{''} and ``not
   competitive{''} according to their various competitiveness. Core
   competitiveness is evaluated based upon their reliability, temperature,
   and timing requirements. Consequently, ``competitive{''} cores will take
   charge of the majority of the tasks at relatively high voltage/frequency
   without violating power and timing budgets, while `` not competitive{''}
   cores will have light workloads to ensure their reliability. The new
   approach combines intrinsic device characteristics (aging-switching
   activity and aging-supply voltage curves) into an integrated framework
   to achieve high reliability and low energy level with graceful
   degradation of system performance. Experimental results show that the
   proposed method has achieved up to 20\% power reduction, with about 4\%
   performance degradation (in terms of accomplished workload and system
   throughput), compared with traditional workload balancing methods. The
   new method also improves system mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) by up to
   25\%.}},

Abstract = {{Wind is considered to be one of the most promising resources in the
   renewable energy portfolio. Still, to make wind energy conversion more
   economically viable, it is necessary to extract greater power from the
   wind while minimizing the cost associated with the technology. This is
   particularly important for small wind turbines, which have the highest
   cost per kilowatt of energy produced. One solution would be a variable
   ratio gearbox (VRG) that can be integrated into the simple and low-cost
   fixed-speed induction generator. Through discrete variable rotor speed
   operation, the VRG-enabled system affects the wind speed ratio, the
   power coefficient, and ultimately the power produced. To maximize
   electrical production, mechanical braking is applied during the normal
   operation of the wind turbine. A strategy is used to select gear ratios
   (GRs) that produce torque slightly above the maximum amount the
   generator can accept while simultaneously applying the mechanical brake,
   so that full load production may be realized over greater ranges of the
   wind speed. To characterize the performance of the system, a 100 kW,
   fixed speed, stall-regulated wind turbine, has been developed for this
   study. The VRG-enabled wind turbine control system is presented in two
   papers. Part 1 focuses on the turbine simulation model, which includes
   the rotor, VRG-enabled drivetrain, disk brake, and electric generator. A
   technique for estimating the performance of a disk brake, in the wind
   turbine context, is also presented. Part 2 of the research will present
   a dynamic optimization algorithm that is used to establish the control
   protocol for competing performance objectives. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{The cost of electrical power produced by small wind turbines impedes the
   use of this technology, which can otherwise provide power to millions of
   homes in rural regions worldwide. To encourage their use, small wind
   turbines must capture wind energy more effectively while avoiding
   increased equipment costs. A variable ratio gearbox (VRG) can provide
   this capability to the simple fixed-speed wind turbine through discrete
   operating speeds. This is the second of a two-part publication that
   focuses on the control of a VRG-enabled wind turbine. The first part
   presented a 100 kW fixed speed, wind turbine model, and a method for
   manipulating the VRG and mechanical brake to achieve full load
   operation. In this study, an optimal control algorithm is developed to
   maximize the power production in light of the limited brake pad life.
   Recorded wind data are used to develop a customized control design that
   is specific to a given site. Three decision-making modules interact with
   the wind turbine model developed in Part 1 to create possible VRG gear
   ratio (GR) combinations. Dynamic programming is applied to select the
   optimal combination and establish the operating protocol. The technique
   is performed on 20 different wind profiles. The results suggest an
   increase in wind energy production of nearly 10\%. {[}DOI:

   225-237, 2013. First published October 10, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/jn.00951.2011.-If humans exploit task redundancies as a
   general strategy, they should do so even if the redundancy is decoupled
   from the physical implementation of the task itself. Here, we derived a
   family of goal functions that explicitly defined infinite possible
   redundancies between distance (D) and time (T) for unidirectional
   reaching. All {[}T, D] combinations satisfying any specific goal
   function defined a goal-equivalent manifold (GEM). We tested how humans
   learned two such functions, D/T = c (constant speed) and D.T = c, that
   were very different but could both be achieved by neurophysiologically
   and biomechanically similar reaching movements. Subjects were never
   explicitly shown either relationship, but only instructed to minimize
   their errors. Subjects exhibited significant learning and consolidation
   of learning for both tasks. Initial error magnitudes were higher, but
   learning rates were faster, for the D.T task than for the D/T task.
   Learning the D/T task first facilitated subsequent learning of the D.T
   task. Conversely, learning the D.T task first interfered with subsequent
   learning of the D/T task. Analyses of trial-to-trial dynamics
   demonstrated that subjects actively corrected deviations perpendicular
   to each GEM faster than deviations along each GEM to the same degree for
   both tasks, despite exhibiting significantly greater variance ratios for
   the D/T task. Variance measures alone failed to capture critical
   features of trial-to-trial control. Humans actively exploited these
   abstract task redundancies, even though they did not have to. They did
   not use readily available alternative strategies that could have
   achieved the same performance.}},

Title = {{Ultraviolet curable branched siloxanes as low-k dielectrics for imprint

Abstract = {{A methacrylate-based, UV curable branched siloxane (MA-Si-12) was
   designed for use as a low-k dielectric that can be directly patterned by
   step and flash imprint lithography. MA-Si-12 has the properties of low
   viscosity (20 cP) and low vapor pressure (1.3 Torr), which make the
   material suitable for imprint processes based on an inkjet dispensing
   system. However, the mechanical strength of UV cured MA-Si-12 is too low
   (0.4 GPa Young's modulus by nanoindentation) for use with chemical
   mechanical polishing. Therefore, a methacrylate-based, UV curable cyclic
   siloxane (8-ring) was synthesized to be blended with the siloxane and
   improve the modulus. A formulation consisting of a mixture of MA-Si-12
   and 8-ring (50 wt. \% respectively) provides patterned structures with a
   modulus of 2.0 GPa. This formulation still has a viscosity (19 cP) and
   vapor pressure (1.3 Torr) low enough for inkjet dispensing. The UV cured
   resin has a dielectric constant of 2.8 at 1MHz, low water absorption
   (0.7 wt. \% after 24 h), and low UV cure shrinkage (5.6\%). It provides
   high resolution, high fidelity imprint patterns. Mixing or blending of
   branched and cyclic siloxanes is a valuable approach to the design of
   imprint resist formulations with low dielectric constants. (C) 2013

Title = {{Metabolic engineering of muconic acid production in Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae}},
Journal = {{METABOLIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{55-66}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The dicarboxylic acid muconic acid has garnered significant interest due
   to its potential use as a platform chemical for the production of
   several valuable consumer bio-plastics including nylon-6,6 and
   polyurethane (via an adipic acid intermediate) and polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET) (via a terephthalic acid intermediate). Many process
   advantages (including lower pH levels) support the production of this
   molecule in yeast. Here, we present the first heterologous production of
   muconic acid in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A three-step
   synthetic, composite pathway comprised of the enzymes dehydroshikimate
   dehydratase from Podospora anserina, protocatechuic acid decarboxylase
   from Enterobacter cloacae, and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Candida
   albicans was imported into yeast. Further genetic modifications guided
   by metabolic modeling and feedback inhibition mitigation were introduced
   to increase precursor availability. Specifically, the knockout of AR03
   and overexpression of a feedback-resistant mutant of aro4 reduced
   feedback inhibition in the shikimate pathway, and the zwf1 deletion and
   over-expression of TKL1 increased flux of necessary precursors into the
   pathway. Further balancing of the heterologous enzyme levels led to a
   final titer of nearly 141 mg/L muconic acid in a shake-flask culture, a
   value nearly 24-fold higher than the initial strain. Moreover, this
   strain has the highest titer and second highest yield of any reported
   shikimate and aromatic amino acid-based molecule in yeast in a simple
   batch condition. This work collectively demonstrates that yeast has the
   potential to be a platform for the bioproduction of muconic acid and
   suggests an area that is ripe for future metabolic engineering efforts.

Abstract = {{Although microfluidic devices offer many benefits, high fluid shear
   stresses in such devices are an undesirable consequence of
   miniaturization. In the present study, we present an adaptive

   microfluidic-based devices by autonomously optimizing its internal flow
   structure. This concept was demonstrated by testing a prototype
   microscale thermal-fluid device that responded to changes in the local
   thermal environment. The autonomous, self-optimizing functionality was
   achieved using poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel actuated
   microvalves, which independently controlled the flow to four distinct
   regions within the device. The experimental results showed that the
   device optimized its internal topological flow arrangement such that
   fluid was delivered only to regions where cooling was required. As a
   result, a series of spatially distributed thermal loads were dissipated
   with minimal pumping power consumption.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2291-2297}},
Abstract = {{A simple, low-cost modification of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cells by
   placing a treated carbon paper between the sulfur electrode and the
   separator has been investigated to significantly improve the performance
   of Li-S cells. The treated carbon paper was prepared by an
   alcohol-alkaline/thermal treatment of a commercial Toray carbon paper,
   introducing hydroxyl functional groups and micro-cracks on the carbon
   fibers in the carbon paper, which enhances the hydrophilicity and
   increases surface areas of the carbon paper matrix. The modified Li-S
   cells deliver a higher initial capacity of 1651 mAh g(-1) at 1.5-2.8 V
   at a rate of C/5 compared to the cells without any interlayer or with an
   untreated carbon paper interlayer. The cells with the treated carbon
   paper offer additional improvement in performance when the discharge
   cut-off voltage is raised to 1.8 V: 1057, 1002, and 929 mAh g(-1) after
   100 cycles, respectively, at C/5, C/2, and 1 C rates. The improved cell
   performance is attributed to the 3D architecture of the carbon paper
   interlayer, serving as a conductive skeleton for trapping and depositing
   dissolved sulfur-containing active materials, as confirmed by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   (EDS). The novel configuration presented here offers a low-cost approach
   to overcome the persistent problems of Li-S cells.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{We present a set of reactive transport experiments in cement fractures.
   The experiments simulate coupling between flow and reaction when acidic,
   CO2-rich fluids flow along a leaky wellbore. An analog dilute acid with
   a pH between 2.0 and 3.15 was injected at constant rate between 0.3 and
   9.4 cm/s into a fractured cement core. Pressure differential across the
   core and effluent pH were measured to track flow path evolution, which
   was analyzed with electron microscopy after injection. In many
   experiments reaction was restricted within relatively narrow, tortuous
   channels along the fracture surface. The observations are consistent
   with coupling between flow and dissolution/precipitation. Injected acid
   reacts along the fracture surface to leach calcium from cement phases.
   Ahead of the reaction front, high pH pore fluid mixes with calcium-rich
   water and induces mineral precipitation. Increases in the pressure
   differential for most experiments indicate that precipitation can be
   sufficient to restrict flow. Experimental data from this study combined
   with published field evidence for mineral precipitation along cemented
   annuli suggests that leakage of CO2-rich fluids along a wellbore may
   seal the leakage pathway if the initial aperture is small and residence
   time allows mobilization and precipitation of minerals along the
   fracture.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{107-116}},

Abstract = {{Many metabolic engineering and genetic engineering applications in yeast
   rely on the use of plasmids. Despite their pervasive use and the diverse
   collections available, there is a fundamental lack of understanding of
   how commonly used DNA plasmids affect the cell's ability to grow and how
   the choice of plasmid components can influence plasmid load and burden.
   In this study, we characterized the major attributes of the 2 micron and
   centromeric plasmids typically used in yeast by examining the impact of
   choice of selection marker, promoter, origin of replication, and strain
   ploidy on conferred growth rates and plasmid copy number. We conclude
   that the plasmid burden, as demonstrated by a reduced growth rate, is
   primarily due to the choice of selection marker, especially when
   auxotrophic markers are utilized. The plasmid burden traditionally
   attributed to replication and maintenance of plasmid DNA plays only a
   minor role in haploid yeast yet is much more significant in diploid
   strains. The selection marker can also significantly change plasmid copy
   number. In fact, plasmid copy number can be influenced to some extent by
   all of the parameters tested. The information presented in this study
   will allow for more rational design and selection of plasmids for
   engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber reinforcement represents a promising alternative in projects
   involving localized repair of slopes and reinforcement of thin soil
   veneers, where planar reinforcement (e. g., with geotextiles and
   geogrids) is difficult to implement. Current design methodologies allow
   quantification of the shear strength of fiber-soil composites in terms
   of the parameters that independently characterize the soil matrix and
   fibers. The shear strength of fiber-reinforced soil is considered to
   have two components, including the shear strength of the soil matrix and
   the tension mobilized within the fibers. Triaxial compression tests and
   fiber pullout tests were conducted to evaluate how the fiber tension is
   mobilized for varying shear strain levels. The results of this
   evaluation provide insights into whether the shear strength of
   fiber-reinforced soil is governed by the peak or residual shear strength
   of unreinforced soil. A revision to existing design methodology is
   proposed in which the individual contribution of fibers and soil matrix
   is quantified based on the strain level. The appropriateness of using
   the peak or residual shear strength of the unreinforced soil for
   predicting the equivalent shear strength of fiber-soil composites is
   discussed based on strain compatibility considerations. DOI:

Title = {{A Computational Study of the Interfacial Structure and Capacitance of

Abstract = {{A combination of graphene-like electrodes and ionic liquid (IL)
   electrolytes has emerged as a viable and attractive choice for
   electrochemical double layer (EDL) capacitors. Based on combined
   classical molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations,
   we present the interfacial capacitance between planar graphene and
   {[}BMIM]{[}PF6] IL, with particular attention to the relative
   contributions of the electric double layer capacitance at the
   graphene/IL interface and the quantum capacitance of graphene. The
   microstructure of {[}BMIM]{[}PF6] near the graphene electrode with
   varying charge densities are investigated to provide a molecular
   description of EDLs, including BMIM/PF6 packing and orientation,
   cation-anion segregation, and electrode charge screening. Although the
   IL interfacial structures exhibit an alternative cation/anion layering
   extending a few nanometers, the calculated potential profiles provide
   evidence of one-ion thick compact EDL formation. The
   capacitance-potential curve of the EDL is convex-or bell-shaped, whereas
   the quantum capacitance of graphene is found to have concave-or U-shaped
   characteristics with a minimum of nearly zero. Consequently, we find
   that the total interfacial capacitance exhibits a U-shaped trend,
   consistent with existing experimental observations at a typical
   carbon/IL interface. Our work highlights the importance of the quantum
   capacitance in the overall performance of graphene-based EDL capacitors.

Title = {{Seagrass meadows provide an acoustic refuge for estuarine fish}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{472}},
Pages = {{117-127}},
Abstract = {{It has been widely accepted that fish reside within seagrass meadows
   because of the visual protection and structure provided by the standing
   biomass. However, for many larger species of estuarine fish, marine
   mammals that use echolocation to forage represent a significant threat.
   We hypothesized that seagrasses may serve as an acoustic refuge to fish
   from dolphin predators by sufficiently attenuating the high-frequency
   sounds used in echolocation. To test this hypothesis, we measured the
   attenuation of a 100 kHz acoustic signal with increasing distance into a
   seagrass meadow. The transmission loss of low-frequency sound energy
   relevant to fish calls (300 to 500 Hz) was also investigated to address
   the hypothesis that marine mammals may use passive acoustic detection to
   locate fish in vegetated substrates. Our results show that seagrasses
   attenuate high-frequency sounds during summer months and reduce prey
   detection thresholds by 58 to 88\% relative to bare substrates. Also,
   based on the low-frequency hearing threshold of bottlenose dolphins, we
   calculated that dolphins are capable of detecting low-frequency fish
   calls within vegetation at a distance of roughly 2.3 to 4.2 m, which is
   within the detection threshold of 2.8 to 9.8 m for dolphins using
   echolocation. This study demonstrates that acoustically complex
   features, such as seagrass meadows, can significantly alter bioacoustic
   signal transmission, possibly providing an important seasonal refuge to
   fish from marine mammal predators.}},

   nanopatterned films}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{624-633}},
Abstract = {{A new method for the fabrication of well-defined nanostructured deposits
   by evaporation-driven directed self-assembly of nanoparticles is
   proposed and studied theoretically. The technique comprises a film of
   suspended nanoparticles drying with its surface in contact with a
   topographically patterned membrane which promotes spatially varying
   evaporation, resulting in a patterned deposit. Membrane thickness and
   topography (in conjunction with the initial film height and
   concentration) allow the feature and residual layer dimensions to be
   controlled independently. Numerical solutions of equations governing the
   dynamics of the process show how the concentration profile evolves as a
   result of flow driven by heterogeneous evaporation. Analysis yields
   bounds on the dimensions of the dried deposit, and provides processing
   parameters to achieve specific patterns. It is estimated that films with
   10 nm to 100 mu m features can be fabricated with a drying time of
   0.1-10 seconds per 10 mu m of feature height above the residual layer
   (depending on membrane thickness), making this a promising method for
   high throughput pattern deposition.}},

   adsorption parameters, adsorption characterization, and marine studies.
   Continuous progress has been made over several decades, with adsorbent
   loadings approaching 3.2 mg U/g adsorbent in equilibrium with seawater.
   Further research is needed to improve first, the viability including
   improved capacity, selectivity, and kinetics, and second, the sorbent
   regeneration for multicycle use. An overview of the status of the

Abstract = {{Solutions of therapeutic proteins often gel and become too viscous to
   deliver via subcutaneous injection at high protein concentrations (>200
   mg ml(-1)). Herein, we demonstrate that protein molecules can be crowded
   into colloidally stable dispersions of distinct nanoclusters that
   exhibit equilibrium hydrodynamic diameters without gelation at very high
   concentrations (up to 320 mg ml(-1)). The nanoclusters form
   spontaneously upon concentration of protein solutions in the presence of
   a crowding agent, for example trehalose. Remarkably nanoclusters of the
   same size are produced by dilution of protein powder in buffer.
   Nanocluster size is stable for extended time periods, and upon frozen
   storage and thawing. Thus, the nanocluster diameter appears to be
   governed by equilibrium behavior arising from a balance of short and
   long-ranged monomer-monomer, monomer-cluster and cluster-cluster
   interactions, as calculated by a free energy model.}},

Abstract = {{While the role of collagen and elastin fibrous components in heart valve
   valvular biomechanics has been extensively investigated, the
   biomechanical role of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) gelatinous-like
   material phase remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated
   the biomechanical role of GAGs in porcine aortic valve (AV) leaflets
   under tension utilizing enzymatic removal. Tissue specimens were removed
   from the belly region of porcine AVs and subsequently treated with
   either an enzyme solution for GAG removal or a control (buffer with no
   enzyme) solution. A dual stress level test methodology was used to
   determine the effects at low and high (physiological) stress levels. In
   addition, planar biaxial tests were conducted both on-axis (i.e. aligned
   to the circumferential and radial axes) and at 45 degrees off-axis to
   induce maximum shear, to explore the effects of augmented fiber
   rotations on the fiber-fiber interactions. Changes in hysteresis were
   used as the primary metric of GAG functional assessment. A simulation of
   the low-force experimental setup was also conducted to clarify the
   internal stress system and provide viscoelastic model parameters for
   this loading range. Results indicated that under planar tension the
   removal of GAGs had no measureable affect extensional mechanical
   properties (either on- or 45 degrees off-axis), including peak stretch,
   hysteresis and creep. Interestingly, in the low-force range, hysteresis
   was markedly reduced, from 35.96 +/- 2.65\% in control group to 25.00
   +/- 1.64\% (p < 0.001) as a result of GAG removal. Collectively, these
   results suggest that GAGs do not play a direct role in modulating the
   time-dependent tensile properties of valvular tissues. Rather, they
   appear to be strongly connected with fiber-fiber and fiber-matrix
   interactions at low force levels. Thus, we speculate that GAGs may be
   important in providing a damping mechanism to reduce leaflet flutter
   when the leaflet is not under high tensile stress. (C) 2012 Acta

Abstract = {{Synthetic control of gene expression is critical for metabolic
   engineering efforts. Specifically, precise control of key pathway
   enzymes (heterologous or native) can help maximize product formation.
   The fundamental level of transcriptional control takes place at promoter
   elements that drive gene expression. Endogenous promoters are limited in
   that they do not fully sample the complete continuum of transcriptional
   control, and do not maximize the transcription levels achievable within
   an organism. To address this issue, several attempts at promoter
   engineering have shown great promise both in expanding the cell-wide
   transcriptional capacity of an organism and in enabling tunable levels
   of gene expression. Thus, this review highlights the recent advances and
   approaches for altering gene expression control at the promoter level.
   Furthermore, we propose that recent advances in the understanding of
   transcription factors and their DNA-binding sites will enable rational
   and predictive control of gene expression.}},

Title = {{A generalized scattering data decomposition framework for determining

Abstract = {{In this work, we present an optimization-based methodology to identify
   network process-structure-property relationships in multiphase polymeric
   materials. A quantitative description of the material structure can be
   provided by x-ray and neutron scattering signatures, which are modeled
   as the weighted sum of linearly independent components. The profile of a
   component depends on the shape, aggregation, and extent of fundamental
   structural units present in the material, and the inherent modeling
   complexity can be reduced by extraction of these components from
   process-dependent scattering datasets using minimal a priori
   information. The decomposition methodology we develop is based on
   network component analysis (NCA), a nonlinear program used to generate a
   unique, globally optimal matrix decomposition. Using NCA, we conduct a
   case study of amphiphilic triblock copolymers in solution using
   simulated small-angle neutron scattering data. Component signatures are
   successfully recovered based solely on knowledge of a network topology
   specified by sample scattering length density contrast-matching
   conditions. Then, the approach is reformulated as a mixed-integer
   nonlinear program in order to study systems with unknown topology, and
   applied in the study of ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymer crystallization
   from the melt using wide- and small-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS/SAXS)
   data. For this system, the topology is specified by the number density
   of structural units, and the optimal components can be correlated to
   crystalline and amorphous regions for WAXS datasets, while the optimal
   SAXS components can be correlated to ordered and disordered crystalline
   lamellae.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the findings from a study conducted to develop a
   simple quantitative test method to characterize the stability of asphalt
   emulsions. The proposed method uses electrokinetic techniques to
   determine the rate at which an asphalt emulsion breaks when subjected to
   an electric field. The test method was used with different types of
   emulsion as well as emulsions that were modified by further dilution or
   mechanical agitation. Results demonstrate that the parameters obtained
   from these tests were repeatable and different for different types of
   asphalt emulsions. Results also demonstrate that for a given type of
   emulsion the test method is sensitive to factors such as water content
   and partial breaking due to mechanical agitation. The proposed
   electrokinetics-based method and concomitant parameters provide a
   repeatable, rapid, and quantitative method by which to characterize

Abstract = {{Nanoantennas are key optical components that bridge nanometer-scale
   optical signals to far-field, free-space radiation. In analogy to radio
   frequency antennas where tuning and impedance-matching are accomplished
   with lumped circuit elements, one could envision nanoantenna properties
   controlled by nanoscale, optical frequency circuit elements in which
   circuit operations are based on photons rather than electrons. A recent
   investigation of the infrared nanocircuits has demonstrated the
   filtering functionality using dielectric gratings. However, these
   two-dimensional prototypes have limited applicability in real-life
   devices. Here we experimentally demonstrate the first optical nanoscale
   circuits with fully three-dimensional lumped elements, which we use to
   tune and impedance-match a single optical dimer nanoantenna. We control
   the antenna resonance and impedance bandwidth using suitably designed
   loads with combinations of basic circuit elements: nanoscale capacitors,
   inductors, and resistors. Our results pave the way toward extending
   conventional circuit concepts into the visible domain for applications
   in data storage, wireless optical links, and related venues.}},

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{A probability density function (PDF) approach to account for
   turbulence-chemistry interaction in the context of large eddy simulation
   (LES) based simulation of scramjets is developed. To solve the
   high-dimensional joint-composition PDF transport equation robustly, the
   semi-discrete quadrature method of moments (SeQMOM) is employed. The
   SeQMOM approach addresses key numerical issues in LES related to the
   inaccuracies in computing filter-scale gradients, enabling an efficient
   and numerically consistent solution of the PDF transport equation. The
   computational tool is used to simulate a cavity-stabilized Mach 2.2
   supersonic combustor. The LES-SeQMOM approach captures the pressure
   profiles qualitatively, in spite of the large uncertainties in the
   boundary conditions. Further, this flow configuration is found to
   exhibit low-frequency dynamics that lead to oscillatory motions of the
   shock-system inside the combustor. Detailed analyses of the LES data are
   used to describe the physical mechanism leading to these oscillations.

Abstract = {{Firebrand lofting models rely on prescribed size distributions for

   that the balance between aerodynamic forces and weight defines the

   using simple mechanical breakage models that are coupled to a simple
   thermal decomposition model. The breakage model is parameterized by fuel
   density and strength data that are experimentally generated.
   Dimensionless parameters are identified to characterize the degradation
   and breakage processes. The breakage model is then coupled to a plume
   model to form a description of the breakage, transport, and mass loss of
   branching vegetative fuel packets in wildland fire scenarios. A Monte
   Carlo simulation is then performed for branching fuels in a wildland
   fire case study, and the presence of an optimal branch diameter for mass
   transport by brand lofting is identified. (C) 2012 The Combustion

Abstract = {{Combustion-based personal power systems have great potential for

   developed for reforming in the counter-flow reactor, was adapted and
   applied to study lean operation. Results qualitatively describe the
   operating principle of the reactor and its behavior in response to
   changes in inlet conditions. Experiments determined the stable operating
   range of the reactor. Peak reactor wall temperature measurements
   indicate superadiabatic operation. Exhaust emissions of CO and NOx range
   from 35 to 143 ppm and 5 to 25 ppm, respectively, and emission indices
   as a function of firing rate are presented. Unburned hydrocarbons were

   paper proposes a novel mathematical framework for packet classification
   problem. Then the priority area-based quad-tree (PAQT) packet
   classification algorithm combining priority search and recursive space
   decomposition is formally described using the framework. The validity of
   the PAQT algorithm is mathematically proved for theoretical
   justification. The proposed mathematical framework can be applied to
   other packet classification algorithms for formal description and
   theoretical justification. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that
   the PAQT algorithm has very good performance compared to other packet
   classification algorithms in terms of search speed, memory size, and
   scalability.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a consistent spatial formulation for
   discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods applied to solid mechanics problems
   with finite deformation. This spatial formulation provides a general,
   accurate, and efficient DG finite element computational framework for
   modeling nonlinear solid mechanics problems. To obtain a consistent
   formulation, we employ the Incomplete Interior Penalty Galerkin (IIPG)
   method. Another requirement for achieving a fast convergence rate for
   Newton's iterations is the consistent formulation of material
   integrators. We show that material integrators that are well developed
   and tested in continuous Galerkin (CG) methods can be fully exploited
   for DG methods by additionally performing stress returning on element
   interfaces. Finally, for problems with pressure or follower loading,
   stiffness contributed from loaded surfaces must also be consistently
   incorporated. In this work, we propose the Truesdell objective stress
   rate for both hypoelastoplastic and hyperelastoplastic problems. Two
   formulations based on the co-rotational and multiplicative
   decomposition-based frameworks are implemented for hypoelastoplasticity
   and hyperelastoplasticity, respectively. Two new terminologies, the
   so-called standard surface geometry stiffness and the penalty surface
   geometry stiffness, are introduced and derived through consistently
   linearizing the virtual work contributed from interior surface
   integrals. The performance of our DG formulation has been demonstrated
   through solving a cantilever beam problem undergoing large rotations, as
   well as a bipolar void coalescence problem where the voids grow up to
   several hundred times of their original volumes. Fast convergence rates
   for Newton's iterations have been achieved in our IIPG implementation.

Abstract = {{Principal component analysis plays a central role in statistics,

   unequipped-indeed, unable-to deal with outliers in the high-dimensional
   setting where the number of observations is of the same magnitude as the
   number of variables of each observation, and the dataset contains some
   (arbitrarily) corrupted observations. We propose a high-dimensional
   robust principal component analysis algorithm that is efficient, robust
   to contaminated points, and easily kernelizable. In particular, our
   algorithm achieves maximal robustness-it has a breakdown point of 50\%
   (the best possible), while all existing algorithms have a breakdown
   point of zero. Moreover, our algorithm recovers the optimal solution
   exactly in the case where the number of corrupted points grows

Abstract = {{Constrained clustering has been an active research topic since the last
   decade. Most studies focus on batch-mode algorithms. This brief
   introduces two algorithms for on-line constrained learning, named
   on-line linear constrained vector quantization error (O-LCVQE) and
   constrained rival penalized competitive learning (C-RPCL). The former is
   a variant of the LCVQE algorithm for on-line settings, whereas the
   latter is an adaptation of the (on-line) RPCL algorithm to deal with
   constrained clustering. The accuracy results-in terms of the normalized
   mutual information (NMI)-from experiments with nine datasets show that
   the partitions induced by O-LCVQE are competitive with those found by
   the (batch-mode) LCVQE. Compared with this formidable baseline
   algorithm, it is surprising that C-RPCL can provide better partitions
   (in terms of the NMI) for most of the datasets. Also, experiments on a
   large dataset show that on-line algorithms for constrained clustering
   can significantly reduce the computational time.}},

Abstract = {{Programmers often need to reason about how a program evolved between two
   or more program versions. Reasoning about program changes is challenging
   as there is a significant gap between how programmers think about
   changes and how existing program differencing tools represent such
   changes. For example, even though modification of a locking protocol is
   conceptually simple and systematic at a code level, diff extracts
   scattered text additions and deletions per file. To enable programmers
   to reason about program differences at a high level, this paper proposes
   a rule-based program differencing approach that automatically discovers
   and represents systematic changes as logic rules. To demonstrate the
   viability of this approach, we instantiated this approach at two
   different abstraction levels in Java: first at the level of application
   programming interface (API) names and signatures, and second at the
   level of code elements (e.g., types, methods, and fields) and structural
   dependences (e.g., method-calls, field-accesses, and subtyping
   relationships). The benefit of this approach is demonstrated through its
   application to several open source projects as well as a focus group
   study with professional software engineers from a large e-commerce
   company.}},

Title = {{Large-scale parameter extraction in electrocardiology models through

Journal = {{INVERSE PROBLEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{One of the main objectives in electrocardiology is to extract physical
   properties of cardiac tissues from measured information on electrical
   activity of the heart. Mathematically, this is an inverse problem for
   reconstructing coefficients in electrocardiology models from partial
   knowledge of the solutions of the models. In this work, we consider such
   parameter extraction problems for two well-studied electrocardiology
   models: the bidomain model and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. We propose a
   systematic reconstruction method based on the Born approximation of the
   original nonlinear inverse problem. We describe a two-step procedure
   that allows us to reconstruct not only perturbations of the unknowns,
   but also the backgrounds around which the linearization is performed. We
   show some numerical simulations under various conditions to demonstrate
   the performance of our method. We also introduce a parameterization
   strategy using eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator to reduce the
   number of unknowns in the parameter extraction problem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes and estimates a spatial panel ordered-response
   probit model with temporal autoregressive error terms to analyze changes
   in urban land development intensity levels over time. Such a model
   structure maintains a close linkage between the land owner's decision
   (unobserved to the analyst) and the land development intensity level
   (observed by the analyst) and accommodates spatial interactions between
   land owners that lead to spatial spillover effects. In addition, the
   model structure incorporates spatial heterogeneity as well as spatial
   heteroscedasticity. The resulting model is estimated using a composite
   marginal likelihood (CML) approach that does not require any simulation
   machinery and that can be applied to data sets of any size. A simulation
   exercise indicates that the CML approach recovers the model parameters
   very well, even in the presence of high spatial and temporal dependence.
   In addition, the simulation results demonstrate that ignoring spatial
   dependency and spatial heterogeneity when both are actually present will
   lead to bias in parameter estimation. A demonstration exercise applies
   the proposed model to examine urban land development intensity levels
   using parcel-level data from Austin, Texas.}},

Title = {{A Fast Hybrid Fourier-Boltzmann Transport Equation Solver for Nongray
   Phonon Transport}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Nongray phonon transport solvers based on the Boltzmann transport
   equation (BTE) are being increasingly employed to simulate submicron
   thermal transport in semiconductors and dielectrics. Typical sequential
   solution schemes encounter numerical difficulties because of the large
   spread in scattering rates. For frequency bands with very low Knudsen
   numbers, strong coupling between other BTE bands result in slow
   convergence of sequential solution procedures. This is due to the
   explicit treatment of the scattering kernel. In this paper, we present a
   hybrid BTE-Fourier model which addresses this issue. By establishing a
   phonon group cutoff Kn(c), phonon bands with low Knudsen numbers are
   solved using a modified Fourier equation which includes a scattering
   term as well as corrections to account for boundary temperature slip.
   Phonon bands with high Knudsen numbers are solved using the BTE. A
   low-memory iterative solution procedure employing a block-coupled
   solution of the modified Fourier equations and a sequential solution of
   BTEs is developed. The hybrid solver is shown to produce solutions well
   within 1\% of an all-BTE solver (using Kn(c) = 0.1), but with far less
   computational effort. Speedup factors between 2 and 200 are obtained for
   a range of steady-state heat transfer problems. The hybrid solver
   enables efficient and accurate simulation of thermal transport in
   semiconductors and dielectrics across the range of length scales from
   submicron to the macroscale. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007654]}},

Abstract = {{Effective and targeted in vivo delivery of polynucleotide therapeutics
   is the key for the treatment of many diseases. Asymmetric
   immunoliposomes can be used as vehicles to deliver polynucleotides
   effectively because the two leaflets of the bilayer can have different
   compositions, which enhance the delivery capacity. The formation and in
   vitro cellular uptake of asymmetric immunoliposomes containing
   polynucleotide cargoes were studied here. Maleimide-functionalised
   DSPE-PEG (2000) were incorporated into the outer leaflet to produce
   asymmetric liposomes capable of covalently attaching antibodies.
   Thiolated antibodies from both human and rabbit origin were conjugated
   to produce asymmetric pendant-type immunoliposomes that retain their
   specificity towards detection antibodies through the formation process.
   Human IgG-conjugated asymmetric immunoliposomes were readily
   internalised (>20 per cell) by macrophage, HEPG2, and CV-1 monkey kidney
   cells. The cells internalised the liposomal nanoparticles by the
   endocytic pathway. The immunoliposome-encapsulated endosomes were intact

Abstract = {{A large eddy simulation (LES)/probability density function (PDF)
   approach is used to describe the small-scale soot-turbulence-chemistry

   the gas-phase scalars and a set of moments of the soot number density
   function. This LES/PDF approach is then used to simulate a turbulent
   natural gas jet diffusion flame. Since the PDF equation is high
   dimensional, a Lagrangian method formulated in cylindrical coordinates
   is coupled to the Eulerian solution technique for the LES flow
   equations. The LES/PDF simulations show that soot formation is highly
   intermittent and is always restricted to the fuel-rich region of the
   flow. The PDF of soot moments has a wide spread leading to a large
   subfilter variance. Further, the conditional statistics of soot moments
   conditioned on mixture fraction and reaction progress variable show
   strong correlation between the gas phase composition and soot moments.

Title = {{Large eddy simulation of a lifted ethylene flame using a dynamic
   nonequilibrium model for subfilter scalar variance and dissipation rate}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1289-1297}},
Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of nonpremixed turbulent combustion using large eddy
   simulation (LES) requires detailed modeling of the mixing between fuel
   and oxidizer at scales finer than the LES filter resolution. In
   conserved scalar combustion models, the small scale mixing process is
   quantified by two parameters, the subfilter scalar variance and the
   subfilter scalar dissipation rate. The most commonly used models for
   these quantities assume a local equilibrium exists between production
   and dissipation of variance. Such an assumption has limited validity in
   realistic, technically relevant flow configurations. However,
   nonequilibrium models for variance and dissipation rate typically
   contain a model coefficient whose optimal value is unknown a priori for
   a given simulation. Furthermore, conventional dynamic procedures are not
   useful for estimating the value of this coefficient. In this work, an
   alternative dynamic procedure based on the transport equation for
   subfilter scalar variance is presented. This dynamic nonequilibrium
   modeling approach is used for simulation of a turbulent lifted ethylene
   flame, previously studied using DNS by Yoo et al. (2011). The
   predictions of the new model are compared to those of a static
   nonequilibrium modeling approach using an assumed model coefficient, as
   well as those of the equilibrium modeling approach. The equilibrium
   models are found to systematically underpredict both subfilter scalar
   variance and dissipation rate. Use of the dynamic procedure is shown to
   increase the accuracy of the nonequilibrium modeling approach. However,
   numerical errors that arise as a consequence of grid-based implicit
   filtering appear to degrade the accuracy of all three modeling options.
   Thus, while these results confirm the usefulness of the new dynamic
   model, they also show that the quality of subfilter model predictions
   depends on several factors extrinsic to the formulation of the subfilter
   model itself. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was performed to investigate the soot-turbulence
   interaction in the soot-formation region of turbulent non-premixed
   co-flowing ethylene/N-2 jet flames. Simultaneous velocity and soot
   volume-fraction (f(v)) fields were obtained using two-component particle
   image velocimetry and laser-induced incandescence, respectively.
   Measurements were made for jet exit Reynolds numbers between 8500 and
   12,300, and the measurement location was 10 jet diameters downstream,
   near the beginning of the yellow luminous region where soot is first
   formed. In agreement with previous studies, the peak mean f(v) in the
   production region is inversely related to the bulk strain rate. The
   simultaneous data show that soot is formed to the inside of the
   stoichiometric surface (inferred from stoichiometric velocity), but the
   formation region moves outside to regions of lower velocity and strain
   rate as the bulk strain rate is increased. Soot structures form in low
   strain rate regions, but their upstream edge is seen to become stretched
   out and aligned at a preferred angle (near 45 degrees) owing to
   alignment with the instantaneous principal extensive strain rate.
   Statistical analysis shows that the soot exists, on average, in fluid
   with axial velocity of about 3 m/s and strain rate of 700 s(-1),
   regardless of the jet exit velocity. The radial profiles of the
   covariance between f(v) and radial velocity are consistent with a model
   where the soot is formed at a preferred radial location (near the
   reaction zone) and then is transported by turbulent fluctuations to
   regions of lower f(v). (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Abstract = {{A consistent probability density function (PDF) based combustion
   modeling approach for large eddy simulation of turbulent spray
   combustion is formulated. A Lagrangian Monte-Carlo approach for solving
   the PDF transport equation in the context of low-Mach number LES

   experimental pilot-stabilized ethanol spray flame. In this particular
   flame, droplet evaporation occurs away from the flame front, leading to
   separation of the two processes. A high-temperature pre-flame zone with
   a stratified mixture is found to exist throughout the length of the
   flame. The high flow rate of the droplet-laden air prevents the flame
   front from propagating through this evaporated, but well-mixed fuel/air
   mixture. Comparison with experiments displayed large discrepancies
   concerning the droplet inflow conditions. In particular, the inflow
   turbulence is significantly modified by droplet-turbulence interactions

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new perspective/direction on assessing and
   encouraging creativity in concept design for application in engineering
   design education and industry. This research presents several methods
   used to assess the creativity of similar student designs using metrics
   and judges to determine which product is considered the most creative.
   Two methods are proposed for creativity concept evaluation during early
   design, namely the Comparative Creativity Assessment (CCA) and the
   Multi-Point Creativity Assessment (MPCA) methods. A critical survey is
   provided along with a comparison of prominent creativity assessment
   methods for personalities, products, and the design process. These
   comparisons culminate in the motivation for new methodologies in
   creative product evaluation to address certain shortcomings in current
   methods. The paper details the creation of the two creativity assessment
   methods followed by an application of the CCA and MPCA to two case
   studies drawn from engineering design classes.}},

Title = {{How to ablate long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation?}},
Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN CARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{26-35}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Long-standing persistent (LSP) atrial fibrillation is the most
   challenging arrhythmia to treat. Catheter ablation of atrial
   fibrillation has reached satisfactory results for the long-term
   treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but not for the treatment
   of LSP atrial fibrillation. Several approaches with various outcomes
   have been described in the literature. The purpose of this review is to
   summarize the ablation approach that we developed at our institution.
   Recent findings
   During ablation of LSP atrial fibrillation, in addition to pulmonary
   vein antrum and posterior wall isolation, ablation of nonpulmonary vein
   triggers disclosed by high dosage of isoproterenol seems to be of utmost
   importance to achieve long-term success after a single procedure. The
   location of the nonpulmonary vein triggers includes the coronary sinus,
   the anterior part of the septum, the left atrial appendage and the
   superior vena cava. Termination of atrial fibrillation during ablation
   does not seem to influence the outcome. Increasing radiofrequency power
   from 30 up to 45 W seems an important factor to favour durable lesions.
   Summary
   The approach described in this review will guide the reader to what we
   believe is the best approach for the ablation of patients with LSP
   atrial fibrillation.}},

Title = {{Sodium chloride diffusion in sulfonated polymers for membrane
   applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{427}},
Pages = {{186-196}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Sodium chloride permeability and sorption measurements were used to
   calculate average salt diffusion coefficients for charged, sulfonated
   polymers of interest for membrane applications. A sulfonated polysulfone
   random copolymer and two phase-separated, sulfonated styrenic pentablock
   copolymers were considered, and data for these materials were compared
   with those for an uncharged cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol
   diacrylate) hydrogel. The average salt diffusion coefficients reported
   for the block copolymers are apparent salt diffusion coefficients
   because the values have not been adjusted for the polymer's phase
   separated morphology. The sodium chloride permeability of the uncharged
   hydrogel decreases by about 16\% as upstream salt concentration
   increases from 0.01 to 1 mol L-1. This salt permeability change results
   from a decrease in the salt diffusion coefficient with increasing salt
   concentration because the polymer's water content decreases as salt
   concentration increases (i.e., osmotic de-swelling). This decrease in
   salt diffusion coefficient is consistent with free volume theory,
   wherein a decrease in water content leads to a decrease in free volume,
   thereby decreasing the salt diffusion coefficient and, in turn, salt
   permeability. In contrast, the sodium chloride permeability of the
   charged polymers increases by more than an order of magnitude as
   upstream salt concentration increases from 0.01 to 1 mol L-1. This salt
   permeability increase is due to increases in both mobile salt sorption
   and diffusion coefficients with increasing salt concentration, despite
   the fact that water content (and, therefore, free volume) in the polymer
   decreases as salt concentration increases. Thus, the increase in salt
   diffusion coefficient with increasing salt concentration in the charged
   polymers results from factors (which are currently poorly understood)
   other than simply water uptake or free volume. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In this study, we numerically cemented a segmented X-ray microtomography
   image of a sandstone to understand changes to pore space connectivity,
   capillary control on gas, and water distributions, and ultimately
   production behavior in tight gas sandstone reservoirs. Level set
   method-based progressive quasi-static algorithm (a state-of-the-art
   direct simulation of capillarity-dominated fluid displacement) was used
   to find the gas/water configurations during drainage and imbibition
   cycles. Further, we account for gas-water interfacial tension changes
   using 1D burial history model based on available geologic data. We have
   found the displacement simulation method robust, and that diagenetic
   changes impart a significantly larger effect on gas trapping compared
   with interfacial tension changes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a facial expression classification method
   using metric learning-based k-nearest neighbor voting. To achieve
   accurate classification of a facial expression from frontal face image,
   we first learn a distance metric structure from training data that
   characterizes the feature space pattern, then use this metric to
   retrieve nearest neighbors from training dataset, and finally output the
   classification decision accordingly. An expression is represented as a
   fusion of face shape and texture. This representation is based on
   registering a face image with landmarking shape model and extracting
   Gabor features from local patches around landmarks. This type of
   representation achieves robustness and effectiveness by using an
   ensemble of local patch feature detector at a global shape level. A
   naive implementation of metric learning-based k-nearest neighbor would
   incur a time complexity proportional to the size of the training
   dataset, which precludes this method being used with enormous dataset.
   To scale to potential larger databases, an approximate yet efficient
   variant scheme of MLbased kNN voting is further devised based on
   Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). A query example is directly hashed to
   the bucket of a pre-computed hash table where candidate nearest
   neighbors can be found and there is no need to search the entire
   database for nearest neighbors. Experimental results on CohnKanade
   database and Moving Faces and People database show that both ML-based
   kNN voting and its LSH approximation outperform the state-of-the-art,
   demonstrating the superiority and scalability of our method.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous vehicles present new opportunities for addressing traffic
   congestion through flexible traffic control schemes. This paper explores
   the possibility that auctions could be run at each intersection to
   determine the order in which drivers perform conflicting movements.
   While such a scheme would be infeasible for human drivers, autonomous
   vehicles are capable of quickly and seamlessly bidding on behalf of
   human passengers. Specifically, this paper investigates applying
   autonomous vehicle auctions at traditional intersections using stop
   signs and traffic signals, as well as to autonomous reservation
   protocols. This paper also addresses the issue of fairness by having a
   benevolent system agent bid to maintain a reasonable travel time for
   drivers with low budgets. An implementation of the mechanism in a
   microscopic simulator is presented, and experiments on city-scale maps
   are performed.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the proliferation of high-level synthesis tools, hardware
   description of microprocessors remains complex. We argue that much of
   the incidental complexity can be relieved by untangling the description
   into separate functional and microarchitectural components. Such an
   untangling can be achieved using a high-level microcode compiler that
   can generate not only microcode, but also the micro-instruction format
   and the interpretations of each control bit. Simplifying hardware
   description will help the designer make better design-space trade-offs,
   and close the design and verification loop faster. This paper takes the
   reader through an implementation of a simple Y86 processor to
   qualitatively illustrate the complexity reduction from the untangling.}},

Abstract = {{Unsupervised models can provide supplementary soft constraints to help
   classify new data since similar instances are more likely to share the
   same class label. In this context, we investigate how to make an
   existing algorithm, named (CE)-E-3 (from Combining Classifier and
   Cluster Ensembles), more user-friendly by automatically tunning its main
   parameters with the use of metaheuristics. In particular, the (CE)-E-3
   algorithm is based on a general optimization framework that takes as
   input class membership estimates from existing classifiers, as well as a
   similarity matrix from a cluster ensemble operating solely on the new
   (target) data to be classified, and yields a consensus labeling of the
   new data. To do so, two parameters have to be defined a priori, namely:
   the relative importance of classifier and cluster ensembles and the
   number of iterations of the algorithm. In some practical applications,
   these parameters can be optimized via (time consuming) grid search
   approaches based on cross-validation procedures. This paper shows that
   metaheuristics can be more computationally efficient alternatives for
   optimizing such parameters. More precisely, analyses of statistical
   significance made from experiments performed on fourteen datasets show
   that five metaheuristics can yield classifiers as accurate as those
   obtained from grid search, but taking half the running time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a natural and widely prevalent setting where a
   collection of one dimensional time series evolve in a causal manner, and
   one is interested in inferring the graph governing the causality between
   these processes in a high dimensional setting. We consider this problem
   in the special case where variables are discrete and updates are Markov.
   We develop a new algorithm to learn causal graph structure based on the
   notion of directed information, and analytically and empirically
   demonstrate its performance. Our algorithm is an adaptation of a greedy
   heuristic for learning undirected graphical models, with modifications
   to leverage causality. Analytically, the challenge lies in determining
   sample complexity, given the dependencies between samples.}},

Abstract = {{To tackle the expected enormous increase in mobile video traffic in
   cellular networks, an architecture involving base station along with
   caching femto stations (referred to as helpers), storing popular files
   near users, has been proposed {[}1]. The primary benefit of caching is
   the enormous increase in downloading rate when a popular file is
   available at helpers near a user requesting that file. In this work, we
   explore a secondary benefit of caching in this architecture through the
   lens of index coding. We assume a system with n users and k caching
   helpers. Only helpers store files i.e., have side information.
   We investigate the following scenario: Each user requests for a distinct
   file that is not found in its set of neighboring helpers. Users are
   served coded packets (through an index code) by an omniscient base
   station. Every user decodes the desired packet from the coded packets
   and the side information from helpers nearby. We assume that users can
   obtain any file stored in their neighboring helpers without incurring
   transmission costs. With respect to the index code employed, we
   investigate an achievable scheme based on graph coloring (referred to as
   XOR coloring). We show that the general problem reduces to a canonical
   problem where every user is connected to exactly one helper. For the
   canonical problem, with constant number of helpers (k), we show that the
   complexity of computing the best XOR coloring scheme is polynomial in
   the number of users n. The result exploits a special complete bi-partite
   structure that the side information graphs exhibit for any finite k.}},

   frequency of the TM mode in a uniform parallel-plate waveguide, inducing
   an effective negative permeability. The CSRR inclusions provide a strong
   resonance within the frequency band, inducing an effective negative
   permittivity. We present an optimized unit cell design, offering
   moderately broad bandwidth of operation. We also discuss the anisotropic

   moderately large electrical sizes. We have also derived passivity
   conditions for all the components of the polarizability tensor and
   arbitrary incidence angle, which are satisfied by our expressions.
   Finally, we numerically study the effect of size and material variation
   on the relevant polarizability components, and we apply our formulation
   to analyze the effective parameters of uniaxial metamaterials composed
   of arrays of cylindrical rods. We expect that this result may be applied

Abstract = {{The landscape of contemporary engineering education is ever changing,
   adapting and evolving. As an example, finite element theory and
   application has often been included in graduate-level courses in
   engineering programs; however, current industry needs bachelor's-level
   engineering graduates with skills in applying this essential analysis
   and design technique. Engineering education is also changing to include
   more active learning. In response to the need to introduce undergrads to
   the finite element method as well as the need for engineering curricula
   to include more active learning, we have developed, implemented and
   assessed a suite of Active Learning Module (ALMs). The ALMs are designed
   to improve student learning of difficult engineering concepts while
   students gain essential knowledge of finite element analysis. We have
   used the Kolb Learning Cycle as a conceptual framework to guide our
   design of the ALMs.
   Originally developed using MSC Nastran, followed by development efforts
   in SolidWorks Simulation, ANSOFT, ANSYS, and other commercial FEA
   software packages, a team of researchers, with National Science
   Foundation support, have created over twenty-eight active learning
   modules. We will discuss the implementation of these learning modules
   which have been incorporated into undergraduate courses that cover
   topics such as machine design, mechanical vibrations, heat transfer,
   bioelectrical engineering, electromagnetic field analysis, structural
   fatigue analysis, computational fluid dynamics, rocket design, chip
   formation during manufacturing, and large scale deformation in
   machining.
   This update on research findings includes statistical results for each
   module which compare performance on pre-and post-learning module quizzes
   to gauge change in student knowledge related to the difficult
   engineering concepts that each module addresses. Statistically
   significant student performance gains provide evidence of module
   effectiveness. In addition, we present statistical comparisons between
   different personality types (based on Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, MBTI,
   subgroups) and different learning styles (based on Felder-Solomon ILS
   subgroups) in regards to the average gains each group of students have
   made on quiz performance. Although exploratory, and generally based on
   small sample sizes at this point in our multi-year effort, the modules
   for which subgroup differences are found are being carefully reviewed in
   an attempt to determine whether modifications should be made to better
   ensure equitable impact of the modules across students from specific
   personality and /or learning styles subgroups (e.g., MBTI Intuitive
   versus Sensing; ILS Sequential versus Global).}},

Abstract = {{Our program offers an integrated approach to engaging middle school
   students in activities that improve awareness and understanding of a
   range of STEM college and career pathways. The program is framed within
   the Grand Challenges of the 21st Century identified by the National
   Academy of Engineering (NAE). The focus of this paper is the curriculum
   used for our afterschool Innovation Clubs. The Innovation Clubs use the
   LEGO r MINDSTORMS r NXT robotics kits, augmented with other technical
   resources, to investigate solar and wind energy. We integrate additional
   hardware, such as solar panels, third-party sensors, and common
   construction materials, and teach ways to apply new software techniques
   as students evolve their programming skills. Overall, students are
   identifying and designing innovative engineering solutions to some of
   our world's most pressing problems. The curriculum includes the details
   of structured LEGO r builds and specialized programming, curriculum

Abstract = {{Systematic design processes that utilize concept generation tools, such
   as 6-3-5/C-Sketch and Brainstorming with Mind-Mapping, are widely
   applied in product development processes in developed countries. The use
   of these tools contributes to improvements of many common devices.
   Designers from developed countries also apply these concept generation
   tools to solve design problems in developing countries. In order to
   successfully design products for developing countries, leaders in
   low-cost product design advocate the inclusion of the end-user as a
   means to more accurately identify and satisfy the needs of people in
   these countries. However, efforts by engineers to include the end-user,
   and ultimately train them to lead future design efforts, often adds an
   additional layer of complexity due to differences in culture and in
   language among participants.
   To transfer these techniques to designers in developing communities, it
   is important to first determine the extent to which these tools are
   culture-specific, what modifications must be made in order for them to
   be effective in other cultures, and how these might affect the teaching
   of the techniques. This paper presents a pilot study in which designers
   in a developing country were taught to use concept generation
   techniques. It is hypothesized that methods to make these concept
   generation techniques effective in other cultures will become apparent
   from participant feedback and results.
   Since the ability of participants to learn and communicate ideas is
   critical for the success of concept generation, two concept generation
   techniques were selected for their ability to accommodate multiple
   learning styles-visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. The selected
   techniques, Brainstorming with Mind Mapping and 6-3-5/C-Sketch, are
   kinesthetic in nature and rely on active participation, writing, and/or
   sketching by all group members. They are differentiated by the secondary
   learning style they encourage the participant to utilize.
   Study participants were recruited from a prosthetic clinic in Bolivia.
   They were taught how to apply these concept generation methods to a
   shared problem-to create a prosthetic socket design that accommodates
   changes in residual limb volume. This problem was chosen because lack of
   proper fit and comfort in their sockets continues to be an issue of
   great concern to amputees, despite improved technology and advancements
   in understanding lower limb prosthetic socket fit. Existing prosthetic
   socket technology often cannot compensate for changes in the shape of
   the residual limb and the resulting discomfort for the user. Therefore,
   a new socket design is sought using these techniques.
   Based on the results of the study, the more visual techniques, such as
   the 6-3-5/C-Sketch method, were more widely accepted while the verbal
   techniques were not. This outcome suggests that removing the language
   barrier may encourage effective concept generation when crossing
   cultural boundaries.}},

Title = {{Girls Go Beyond Blackboards towards Positive Attitudes about Engineering}},

Abstract = {{Beyond Blackboards is a design-based learning experience in afterschool
   clubs and summer camps that challenges middle school students to solve
   real world problems. The program is implemented in a primarily Hispanic,
   low-income community adjacent to Austin, Texas a city with a strong,
   technology-based economy, and earned district-wide attention with early
   success in team-based competitions. Beyond Blackboards aims to enhance
   interest and understanding of engineering, as well as positively
   influence education and career goals for participants, and ultimately,
   the entire district. This study examines the effects of Beyond
   Blackboards on girls' (a traditionally underrepresented group in
   engineering) attitudes surrounding engineering. Specifically, this study
   investigates (1) primary influences for involvement with engineering,
   (2) interest and engagement in engineering and design-based learning,
   and (3) the lasting impact of Beyond Blackboards on girls' personal,
   educational, and engineering progress. Several instruments were used to
   assess attitudinal changes, including student surveys, teacher
   interviews, and comparison to national data (Trends in International
   Mathematics and Science Study). Findings indicate a positive shift in
   students' interest in engineering as a career, as well as the extent of
   students' educational expectations. Additionally, female role models,
   social perceptions, and self-concepts are predominant in shaping girls'
   experiences with engineering. By working to change engineering attitudes
   early, Beyond Blackboards addresses the current national challenge to
   improve K-12 education to increase career and college readiness, and to
   enhance the STEM labor force by eliminating stereotypes and diversifying
   the field's demographics.}},

Abstract = {{Human-worn rehabilitation exoskeletons have the potential to make
   therapeutic exercises increasingly accessible to disabled individuals

   this work, we propose a novel human-model- in-the-loop framework for
   virtual prototyping (design, control and experimentation) of
   rehabilitation exoskeletons by merging computational musculoskeletal
   analysis with simulation-based design techniques. The framework allows
   to iteratively optimize design and control algorithm of an exoskeleton
   using simulation. We introduce biomechanical, morphological, and
   controller measures to quantify the performance of the device for
   optimization study. Furthermore, the framework allows one to carry out
   virtual experiments for testing specific ``what-if{''} scenarios to
   quantify device performance and recovery progress. To illustrate the
   application of the framework, we present a case study wherein the design
   and analysis of an index-finger exoskeleton is carried out using the
   proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of characterizing an evading strategy for an
   agent traversing a convex polygon populated by a group of pursuers. We
   address the problem by associating it with a generalized Voronoi
   partitioning problem, which encodes information about the proximity
   relations between the evader and the pursuers based on the value
   function of a pursuit-evasion game involving the evader and each pursuer
   from the group individually. The generalized Voronoi partition furnishes
   a collection of continuous paths which have the following property: When
   the evader travels along any of these paths, none of the pursuers will
   have a unilateral incentive to initiate the pursuit against it. With the
   proposed approach, the problem of evasion from the group of pursuers
   admits an elegant geometric solution, which can be computed by means of
   known computational techniques. Numerical simulations that illustrate
   the theoretical developments are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents lossless convexification for a class of finite
   horizon optimal control problems with convex cost, linear dynamics,
   linear state constraints, and non-convex control constraints. There are
   a number of examples that belong to this class of problems since many
   practical problems are constrained to evolve in a bounded state space.
   The control set is relaxed to a convex set by introducing a scalar slack
   variable, and it is proved that optimal solutions of the relaxed problem
   are optimal solutions of the original problem, hence the term loss less
   convexification. Extending the proof to problems with state boundary
   arcs is the main theoretical contribution of this paper. The practical
   implication is that the non-convex optimization problem can be solved as
   a convex problem with guaranteed convergence properties. A numerical
   example is presented to illustrate the approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a scaling-friendly continuous-time closed-loop
   VCO-based Delta Sigma ADC. It uses the VCO as both quantizer and
   integrator, and thus, obviates the need for power-hungry
   scaling-unfriendly OTAs and precision comparators. It arranges two VCOs
   in a pseudo-differential manner, which cancels out even-order
   distortions. More importantly, it brings an intrinsic clocked averaging
   (CLA) capability that automatically addresses DAC mismatches. The
   prototype ADC in 130nm CMOS occupies a small area of 0.03mm(2) and
   achieves 66.5dB SNDR over 2MHz BW while sampling at 300MHz and consuming
   1.8mW under a 1.2V power supply. It can also operate with a low analog
   supply of 0.7V and achieves 65.8dB SNDR while consuming 1.1mW. The
   corresponding figure-of-merits (FOMs) for the two cases are 0.25pJ/step

Abstract = {{The explosive growth in data traffic is resulting in a spectrum crunch
   forcing many wireless network operators to look towards refarming their
   2G spectrum and deploy more spectrally efficient Long Term Evolution
   (LTE) technology. However, mobile network operators face a challenge
   when it comes to spectrum refarming because 2G technologies such as
   Global System for Mobile (GSM) is still widely used for low bandwidth
   machine-to-machine (M2M) devices. In this paper we propose a novel
   solution to provide GSM connectivity within an LTE carrier through an
   efficient overlay by reserving a few physical resource blocks for GSM.
   With this approach, operators can refarm their 2G spectrum to LTE
   efficiently while still providing some GSM connectivity to their low
   data rate M2M customers. Furthermore, spectrum can be dynamically shared
   between LTE and GSM. An approach similar to that proposed in this paper
   can also be applied for other narrow band technology overlays over LTE.}},

   the effect of user adaptation in the loop. To tackle these problems, a
   Hammerstein-Wiener based decoder is proposed to model the nonlinearities

   decoding data from trials conducted as many as 14 days following initial

Abstract = {{Millimeter wave (mmWave) is promising for the fifth generation cellular
   systems. The sensitivity of mmWave signals to blockages, such as
   buildings in cities, however, makes the network performance hard to
   predict. Using concepts from stochastic geometry and random shape
   theory, this paper proposes an analytical framework to incorporate the
   blockage effects and evaluate the performance of mmWave cellular
   networks, in terms of coverage probability and achievable rate.
   Leveraging prior work on a blockage model, a stochastic characterization
   of the regions covered by line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS links is
   obtained, which allows different path loss laws to be applied to the LOS
   and non-LOS links, respectively. Based on the proposed framework,
   analytical expressions for the mmWave downlink coverage probability are
   derived, and then the network performance is examined. Numerical results
   show that millimeter wave (mmWave) networks can provide comparable
   coverage probability and much higher data rates than microwave networks.}},

Abstract = {{Gyroscope is playing a key role in helping estimate camera rotation
   during mobile video capture. The fusion of gyroscope and visual
   measurements needs the knowledge of camera projection parameters, the
   gyroscope bias and the relative orientation between gyroscope and

   usually not well synchronized. In this paper, we propose an online
   method that estimates all the necessary parameters while capturing
   videos. Our contributions are (1) simultaneous online camera
   self-calibration and camera-gyroscope calibration based on an implicit
   extended Kalman filter, and (2) generalization of coplanarity constraint
   of camera rotation in a rolling shutter camera model for cellphones. The
   proposed method is able to accurately estimate the needed parameters
   online with all kinds of camera motion, and can be embedded in
   gyro-aided applications such as video stabilization and feature
   tracking.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a novel solution called dynamic spectrum
   refarming (DSR) for deploying LTE small cells using the same spectrum as
   existing GSM networks. The basic idea of DSR is that LTE small cells are
   deployed in the GSM spectrum but suppress transmission of all signals
   including the reference signals in some specific physical resource
   blocks corresponding to a portion of the GSM carriers to ensure full GSM
   coverage. Our study shows that the proposed solution can provide LTE
   mobile terminals with high speed data services when they are in the
   coverage of the LTE small cells while minimally affecting the service
   provided to GSM terminals located within the LTE small cell coverage
   area. Thus, the proposal allows the normal operation of the existing GSM
   networks even with LTE small cells deployed in that spectrum. Though the
   focus of this paper is about GSM spectrum refarming, an analogous
   approach can be applied to reuse code division multiple access (CDMA)
   spectrum for LTE small cells.}},

Abstract = {{This paper exploits the potential of large antenna arrays at
   millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) frequencies to develop a low-complexity
   directional modulation technique, Antenna Subset Modulation (ASM), for
   point-to-point secure wireless communication. The main idea in ASM is to
   modulate the radiation pattern at the symbol rate by driving only a
   subset of antennas in the array. This results in a directional radiation
   pattern that projects a sharply defined constellation in the desired
   direction and randomizes the constellation in other directions. To
   implement ASM, a simple antenna selection technique that selects an
   antenna subset randomly for every symbol is proposed. While randomly
   switching antenna subsets does not affect the symbol modulation for a
   desired receiver along the main direction, it effectively randomizes the
   amplitude and phase of the received symbol for an eavesdropper along a
   sidelobe. Statistical analysis and numerical examples are presented to
   highlight the superior performance and secrecy capacity achieved by ASM.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) and carrier aggregation (CA) are two
   distinct features of next-generation cellular networks. Small cells in
   HetNets are vital for data off-loading and can significantly improve
   area and cell edge spectral efficiency compared to using just
   macrocells. CA further increases the transmission bandwidth and thus
   network capacity by aggregating multiple component carriers on the
   physical layer. In this paper, we propose a tractable multi-band
   multi-tier model to study multi-flow CA in HetNets, where base station
   positions in each tier follow an independent Poisson point process. Our
   model incorporates an appropriate notion of load which allows the study
   of the impact of biasing on HetNet performance. For a typical HetNet
   consisting of two tiers, macro cells and small cells, and two bands,
   800MHz band and 2.4GHz band, we observe that the gain (in terms of UE
   ergodic rate) is about 35\% to 40\% if the small cells adopt optimal
   biasing factor compared to the case without biasing. Our model also
   incorporates the impact of band deployment. For the typical HetNet
   described, our study suggests that deploying the 800MHz band and 2.4GHz
   band in both the macro and small cells helps the HetNet best exploit the
   CA feature.}},

   The goal is to allocate a given storage budget in a distributed storage

   the maximum number of edges in a hypergraph subject to a constraint on
   its maximum matching number. The conjecture was recently verified in
   some regimes. In this paper we assume that the conjecture is true and
   establish new results for the optimal allocation for a variety of

Abstract = {{Regenerating codes enable trading off repair bandwidth for storage in
   distributed storage systems (DSS). Due to their distributed nature,
   these systems are intrinsically susceptible to attacks, and they may be
   susceptible to multiple node failures. This paper analyzes storage
   systems that employ cooperative regenerating codes that are robust to
   passive eavesdroppers, and proposes codes achieving the secrecy capacity
   for the minimum bandwidth cooperative regenerating point. The
   achievability results correspond to exact repair, and secure file size
   upper bounds are obtained using mincut analyses over a suitable secrecy
   graph representation of DSS. The main achievability argument is based on
   appropriate precoding of the data using MRD (Gabidulin) codes to
   eliminate any information leakage to the eavesdropper.}},

Abstract = {{we report a multilayered Quantum Dot (QD) based Light Emitting Diode
   structure with a solution processed zinc oxide nanoparticle based
   electron transporting layer, with subsequent patterning of the anode and
   cathode on the same substrate. The solution processed electron
   transporting layer improves the robustness of the device as compared to
   the use of sputtered thin films, resulting in LEDs with longer
   lifetimes. The use of spin coated zinc oxide layer and an insulating
   aluminum oxide layer allows for fabrication of LEDs using spin coating
   of quantum dots while patterning the anode and cathode. Zinc oxide shows
   low CB and VB edge energy levels, efficiently suppressing the hole
   leakage current. We have shown successful electroluminescence at 580nm
   and 600nm wavelengths, with a typical turn on voltage of about 12V. An
   array of individually addressable LEDs was fabricated on a single
   substrate, with the average size of each element of 800um X 200um. A
   potential application of such compact multicolor light source for cell
   characterizations is demonstrated by imaging of HEMA 3 stained MDA-MB

Abstract = {{We present results of performance optimization for direct numerical
   simulation (DNS) of wall bounded turbulent flow (channel flow). DNS is a
   technique in which the fluid flow equations are solved without subgrid
   modeling. Of particular interest are high Reynolds number (Re) turbulent
   flows over walls, because of their importance in technological
   applications. Simulating high Re turbulence is a challenging
   computational problem, due to the high spatial and temporal resolution
   requirements.
   An optimized code was developed using spectral methods, the method of
   choice for turbulent flows. Optimization was performed to address three
   major issues: efficiency of banded matrix linear algebra, cache reuse
   and memory access, and communication for the global data transposes.
   Results show that performance is highly dependent on characteristics of
   the communication network, rather than single-core performance. In our
   tests, it exhibits approximately 80\% strong scaling parallel efficiency
   at 786K cores relative to performance on 65K cores.}},

Abstract = {{Integration of electric vehicles (EVs) in distribution circuits
   introduces challenges such as increase in load demand and voltage drops
   during peak load hours. These concerns call for a study to evaluate
   impacts of EV charging on primary and secondary voltages. Hence the
   objective of the paper is to present practical approaches in carrying
   out such a study. The paper begins by laying out criteria of circuit
   simulators for evaluating voltage quality concern. The paper then
   describes the modeling of three-phase and single-phase distribution
   circuits, conventional and electric vehicle loads, and their
   corresponding load profiles. Once simulation models are established,
   evaluation procedures are described. Circuit parameters for the study
   include the location of secondary service, the EV load location within a
   secondary circuit, and the size of the EV load and charger. The paper
   also describes how results should be interpreted. The simulation tools
   developed and the analytical approach discussed in the paper will help
   utilities in evaluating voltage quality impacts of EV loads on their
   distribution circuits and possibly designing efficient mitigation
   schemes, addressing the effects of EV charging.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of connected vehicle (CV) technologies, cyber
   security issues in the vehicular network has emerged as serious concerns
   for successful deployment of CV systems. In the existing literature, the
   analysis of the cyber security impacts has been primarily focused from
   the computer science perspectives investigating potential attacking
   scenarios and counter-measures through network security strategies. In
   this paper, we investigate traffic impacts of cyber attacks considering
   real-world driver behavior, especially the ``built-in{''} safety
   redundancy of the visual verification by drivers or autonomous driving
   system. More specifically, we study the impact of ``false-accident{''}
   attacks on the stability of traffic flow. In the false-accident attack,
   a vehicle sends out a false accident alert to its surrounding vehicle
   through CV-enabled network and has considered an attacking scenario that
   has catastrophic effects. Traffic flow stability is based on widely-used
   numerical linear stability analysis methods, the ring road test. In such
   a test, vehicles are restricted within a ring road so that traffic
   congestion and perturbations appear in cyclic patterns indicating the
   stability of traffic flow. The study indicates that false-accident
   attacks do not necessarily yield significant impact on the stability of
   traffic flow. Sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying the attacking
   duration, the attacking vehicle position in a platoon, and the CV safety
   application reaction range.}},

Abstract = {{The inherent structure of the power grid deeply influences its secure
   functioning and stability. As power grids move towards becoming
   `smarter' with increased demand response and decentralized control, the
   topological aspects of the grid have become even more important.
   Understanding the topology can thus lead to better strategies to control
   the smart grid as well as enable rapid identification and prevention of
   risks such as blackouts. This paper focuses on modeling and analyzing
   basic similarities in network structure of large power grids across
   America and Europe. A simple but accurate model of the power grid can
   help generate real-sized test cases to evaluate new grid technologies as
   well as aid in tractable theoretical analysis of the grid structure.}},

Abstract = {{Managing architectural design decisions (ADDs) in software development
   process is an essential task for architectural knowledge management. As
   software ecosystems become a new software development paradigm in
   software engineering processes, it is important and necessary to capture
   and represent ADDs in open software development, and to evolve
   architectural knowledge with minimum knowledge evaporation in the open
   ecosystem community. So far, little work has been done on managing
   architectural decisions in software ecosystems in current software
   architecture research and practice. In this research position paper, we
   discuss the typical characteristics of software ecosystems which may
   influence architecture decision-making processes in software
   development, and identify the essential aspects that should be
   considered for managing ADDs in the context of software ecosystem. In
   addition, we discuss major challenges of managing ADDs for software
   ecosystems, and we also propose possible directions in research to solve
   the problems.}},

Abstract = {{The finite cell method (FCM) belongs to the class of immersed boundary
   methods, and combines the fictitious domain approach with high-order
   approximation, adaptive integration and weak imposition of unfitted
   Dirichlet boundary conditions. For the analysis of complex geometries,
   it circumvents expensive and potentially error-pronemeshing procedures,
   while maintaining high rates of convergence. The present contribution
   provides an overview of recent accomplishments in the FCM with
   applications in structural mechanics. First, we review the basic
   components of the technology using the p- and B-spline versions of the
   FCM. Second, we illustrate the typical solution behavior for linear
   elasticity in 1D. Third, we show that it is straightforward to extend
   the FCM to nonlinear elasticity. We also outline that the FCM can be
   extended to applications beyond structural mechanics, such as transport
   processes in porous media. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of the
   FCM with two application examples, i.e. the vibration analysis of a ship
   propeller described by T-spline CAD surfaces and the nonlinear
   compression test of a CT-based metal foam.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced filters like the sigma point and particle filters are more
   accurate than the extended Kalman filter for nonlinear and non-Gaussian
   applications, but experience drawbacks such as being computationally
   expensive with a serial implementation. However, since the majority of
   the computation can be carried out simultaneously, these filters are
   inherently well suited for parallel computing. This research leverages
   inexpensive and personal-level parallel computing architectures, such as
   the NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and multi-core CPUs to
   exploit such parallelism. In particular, parallelization of the
   Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the bootstrap Particle Filter (PF)
   applied to an orbit determination problem and a loosely coupled GPS/INS
   integration problem is the main objective of this work. This work
   demonstrates that the UKF and the PF can be applied to the two
   navigation problems with great benefits in the presence of
   nonlinearities and non-Gaussian noises. An 8-time speedup is achieved
   for both filters with an 8-thread CPU, and up to two orders of magnitude
   speedups are achieved using a M2090 GPU. The results show that the two
   UKF implementations can be executed in real time without
   parallelization, but the two PF implementations can be executed in real
   time only when parallelized on a GPU.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper, a sustainable system emulator (SSE) for living
   environments powered by renewable energy sources is addressed. The main
   purpose of the SSE is to emulate the various factors that influence
   sustainability using a simple engineering approach. The main goal is to
   realize a useful mixed-reality platform for designing living
   environments with overall energy self-sufficiency as well as adequate
   habitability. The SSE design concept is based on the combination of an
   outer-system emulator (OSE) and an inner-system emulator (ISE). The OSE
   uses artificial lights and air blowers to emulate the sunshine and wind
   conditions in the Fukushima area of Japan. The ISE emulates the interior
   of a residential environment, based on renewable energy sources and
   power storage facilities, and consists of reduced-scale models powered
   by solar cells and a wind turbine. The ISE also includes DC appliances,
   which emulate domestic power usage, and electrochemical batteries for
   power storage. Control algorithms for energy management can also be
   implemented in the SSE. An experimental study was carried out using the
   SSE to emulate both the natural environment and living environments, and
   the relationship among the different emulation parameters was
   investigated. Furthermore, the experimental results indicated that
   accelerated testing using SSE may be effective for improving the design
   efficiency of renewable-energy powered systems.}},

Abstract = {{A number of analytical models exist to predict the thermal conductivity
   of foams; however, they do not consider the effect of pore size on the
   effective thermal conductivity. It is speculated that foams with smaller
   pore sizes would have much lower thermal conductivity owing to the
   Knudsen effect. This study aims at fabricating polymer nanofoams with
   pore sizes on the level of nanometers and to characterize their thermal
   conductivity Polyetherimide (PEI) foams were fabricated using solid
   state foaming. Process parameters such as saturation pressure and
   duration, desorption time and foaming temperature were varied to obtain
   foams with pore sizes ranging from a few hundred nanometers to two
   microns. The microstructures of the samples were characterized using
   scanning electron microscopy.' Throughout the cross section of the
   foams, there exist regions with varying pore size and porosity. The
   effective porosity and thermal conductivity of the individual regions
   were determined based on a series model for effective thermal
   conductivity. It is confirmed that as the pore size is reduced while
   maintaining a fixed porosity, the thermal conductivity also decreases.}},

Abstract = {{A systems level analysis is presented for a solar organic Rankine cycle
   (S-ORC) for assessing the feasibility of the cycle to be used in small

   generated for a system composed of the collector, the heat transfer
   fluid, the pump, the expander, and the heat exchangers, using five
   different working fluids. Based on the collector efficiency and incident
   radiation, the thermodynamic efficiency of the system was evaluated. For
   flat panel solar collectors, the highest system efficiency was found to
   be 6.2\% when using R-134a as a working fluid. R-134a also required the
   least boiler heat transfer area, although its operation required
   relatively higher pressures. The performance of the solar-ORC system is
   compared with that of photovoltaic systems and the practicality of these
   solar thermal systems are discussed in terms of system size and end use.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture with amine scrubbing at coal-fired power
   plants can remove 90\% of the CO2 from flue gas, but operational energy
   requirements reduce net electrical output by 20-30\%. Temporarily
   reducing the load on energy intensive components of the amine scrubbing
   process could temporarily increase power output and allow additional
   electricity sales when prices are high. Doing so could entail additional
   CO2 emissions, or amine solvent storage can be utilized to allow
   increased power output without additional CO2 emissions. Priceresponsive
   flexible capture is studied for \$0-200/tCO(2) and \$2. 11/MMBTU natural
   gas using a nominal 500 MW coal-fired facility in the 2010 Electric
   Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid. CO2 capture systems use a 7
   molal monoethanolamine (MEA) solvent. Venting additional CO2 while
   increasing electrical output provides significant benefit only at
   \$30-60/tCO(2) and when natural gas prices exceed \$4/MMBTU. Solvent
   storage can improve profitability with CO2 capture at higher CO2

Abstract = {{Since many thermoelectric power plants use water for cooling, the power
   sector is vulnerable to droughts, heat waves, and other water
   constraints. At the same time, large water demands for power generation
   can strain water availability for other users in a river basin.
   Opportunities exist for power plants to decrease freshwater demands,
   increasing both drought resiliency of power plants and water
   availability for other users in the basin. One particular method of
   decreasing freshwater demands for power. plants is by incorporating
   reservoir storage into cooling operations. Using reservoir storage
   allows water to be recirculated and reused for power plant cooling,
   thereby decreasing water withdrawal requirements. Water storage also has
   the added benefit of making water available during times of shortage.
   While storage is known to be beneficial, no tools exist to explicitly
   quantify the basin-wide water availability impacts and increased power
   generation resiliency possible via constructing water storage at
   thermoelectric power plants without existing reservoirs. Here we present
   the results of modeling efforts regarding the value (both in terms of
   resiliency and water availability) of reservoir storage for power plant
   cooling and basin-wide water availability in the Brazos and Colorado
   River basins, using a customized river basin based-model along with
   existing Texas Water Availability Models. Results vary between river
   basins and different water availability models, with construction of new
   reservoirs generally increasing basin-wide water availability in the
   Brazos River basin and generally decreasing basin-wide water
   availability in the Colorado River basin. We conclude that the value of
   reservoir storage for power plant resiliency and basin- wide water
   availability is highly site-specific.}},

Abstract = {{According to the waste management hierarchy published by the U.S. EPA,
   waste reduction and reuse are the most preferred modes of waste
   management, followed by recycling, energy recovery and lastly disposal.
   As many communities in the U.S. work towards sustainable waste
   management practices, recycling tends to be a cost-effective and common
   solution for handling municipal solid waste. With the introduction of
   single-stream recycling and automated materials recovery facilities
   (MRFs), where commingled recyclables are sorted into various commodity
   streams for sale to recycling facilities, recycling rates have steadily
   climbed in recent years. Despite increasing total recycling rates,
   contamination and diminishing returns for higher recovery ratios causes
   MRFs to landfill 5-25\% of the incoming recycling stream as fesidue.
   This residue stream is composed primarily of plastics and fiber(1), both
   of which have high energy content that could be recovered instead of
   buried in a landfill. Plastics in particular are reported to have heat
   contents similar to fossil fuels, making energy recovery a viable
   end-of-life pathway. Sorting, shredding and densifying the residue
   stream to form solid recovered fuel (SRF) pellets for use as an
   alternative fuel yields energy recovery, displaced fossil fuels and
   landfill avoidance, moving more disposed refuse up the waste management
   hierarchy. Previous studies have shown that plastic, paper, and
   plastic-paper mixes are well suited for conversion to SRF and combustion
   for energy production. However, these studies focused on relatively
   homogenous and predictable material streams. MRF residue is not
   homogenous and has only a moderate degree of predictability, and thus
   poses several technical challenges for conversion to SRF and for
   straightforward energy and emissions analysis.
   This research seeks to understand the energetic and environmental
   tradeoffs associated with converting MRF residue into SRF for co-firing
   in pulverized coal power plants. A technical analysis is presented that
   compares a residue-to-SRF scenario to a residue-to-landfill scenario to
   estimate non-obvious energy and emissions tradeoffs associated with this
   alternative end-of-life scenario for MRF residue. Sensitivity to key
   assumptions was analyzed by considering facility proximity, landfill gas
   capture efficiency, conversion ratio of residue to SRF and the mass of
   residue used.
   The results of this study indicate that the use of MRF residue derived
   SRF in coal fired steam-electricity power plants realizes meaningful
   reductions of emissions, primary energy consumption, coal use and
   landfill deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Detemiinistic solution techniques for non-equilibrium rarefied flows in
   RF MEMS switches are frequently based on the ellipsoidal statistical
   Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (ESBGK) form of the Boltzmann kinetic equation.
   These numerical schemes involve the sequential solution of the
   distribution function in velocity space. However, these schemes have
   poor convergence rates, especially at low Knudsen numbers, because of
   the explicit coupling of the distribution functions in velocity space.
   Furthermore, parallel implementation of these schemes is inefficient,
   making simulation of real-life devices practically impossible. In this
   paper we describe the parallel performance of a recently-developed
   numerical procedure called the coupled ordinates method (COMET) to solve
   ESBGK equations. In this method, the distribution functions for all
   velocity ordinates are strongly coupled at each physical point,
   resulting in an implicit solution procedure in velocity space. The
   coupled procedure is used as a relaxation sweep in a geometric multigrid
   scheme to promote spatial coupling. Results show that COMET gives
   excellent CPU scaling on multiple processors even for very small
   workload per processor. The solver is also shown to have very good
   strong and weak scaling characteristics. The parallel COMET solver also
   gives significantly faster solutions than the parallel implementation of
   the conventional sequential solution procedure. It is believed that the
   parallel COMET solver can become an efficient tool to model real-life RF
   MEMS switches.}},

Abstract = {{Light trapping is an important technique in increasing the efficiency of
   solar cells. Inverse optimization is a systematic numerical approach
   that allows us to find the limits of light trapping more efficiently. It
   is an alternative to exhaustive search simulations or experimental
   measurements. In this work, we use inverse optimization to study light
   trapping in thin film amorphous silicon cells textured by periodic
   patterns of metallic surface grating. We use a finite set of Haar
   wavelets to describe a general form of grating structure composed of
   multiple rectangular nano-strips. We use global simulated annealing
   optimization to find the coefficients of the wavelets basis for optimal
   absorption enhancement in thin film silicon. The motivation for choosing
   wavelet basis (vis-a-vis other orthonormal bases such as Fourier) is the
   feasibility of fabricating the resulting nano-structures. The resulting
   improvement in the number of absorbed photons is around 130\% for
   wavelength range of 300-700nm, which is significantly better than the
   previous results using simple front surface nano-strips. In addition, we
   use statistical analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of the
   characteristics of the resulting structure to numerical uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional microchannel heat sinks provide good heat dissipation
   capability but are associated with high pressure drop and corresponding
   pumping power. The use of a manifold system that distributes the flow
   into the microchannels through multiple, alternating inlet and outlet
   pairs is investigated here. This manifold arrangement greatly reduces
   the pressure drop incurred due to the smaller flow paths, while
   simultaneously increasing the heat transfer coefficient by tripping the
   thermal boundary layers. A three-dimensional numerical model is
   developed and validated, to study the effect of various geometric
   parameters on the performance of the manifold microchannel heat sink.
   Apart from a deterministic analysis, a probabilistic optimization study
   is also performed. In the presence of uncertainties in the geometric and
   operating parameters of the system, this probabilistic optimization
   approach yields an optimal design that is also robust and reliable.
   Uncertainty-based optimization also yields auxiliary information
   regarding local and global sensitivities and helps identify the input
   parameters to which outputs are most sensitive. This information can be
   used to design improved experiments targeted at the most sensitive
   inputs. Optimization under uncertainty also provides a quantitative
   estimate of the allowable uncertainty in input parameters for an
   acceptable uncertainty in the relevant output parameters. The optimal
   geometric design parameters with uncertainties that maximize heat
   transfer coefficient while minimizing pressure drop for fixed input
   conditions are identified for a manifold microchannel heat sink. A
   comparison between the deterministic and probabilistic optimization
   results is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of stabilizing a class of nonlinear
   systems with unknown bounded delayed feedback wherein the time-varying
   delay is piecewise constant. We also consider application of these
   results to the stabilization of rigid-body attitude dynamics. The
   time-delay in feedback is modeled specifically as a switch among an
   arbitrarily large set of unknown constant values with a known strict
   upper bound. The feedback is a linear function of the delayed states. In
   the special case of linear systems with switched delay feedback, a new
   sufficiency condition for average dwell time result is presented using a
   complete type Lyapunov-Krasovslcii (L-K) functional approach. Further,
   the corresponding switched system with nonlinear perturbations is proven
   to be exponentially stable inside a well characterized region of
   attraction for an appropriately chosen average dwell time. A
   constructive method to evaluate these new results is presented alongside
   comparisons with other sufficient stability conditions for delayed
   feedback from existing literature. Numerical simulations are performed
   to illustrate the theoretical results of this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Limitations on position-time precision are analyzed in
   energy-constrained GNSS receivers. The goal of this work is to determine
   the combination of sampling rate, number of quantization bits, number of
   satellites tracked, and coherent integration time that maximizes the
   position-time precision under a fixed low-energy constraint. In this
   paper, only the measurement errors due to spectrally flat Gaussian
   thermal noise are considered. Analytical expressions relating the
   foregoing parameters to precision and energy consumption are developed.
   Based on these expressions, a constrained optimization problem is
   formulated. Optimal solutions indicate that under a tight energy
   constraint energy should be allocated toward increasing the sampling
   rate at the expense of the other parameters. Moreover, the quantization
   resolution should be set above 1-bit only under an energy surplus.
   Interestingly, optimum settings under tight energy constraints
   approximately match those chosen by the designers of energy efficient
   commercial GNSS receivers.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines extreme response statistics for a monopile-supported
   5-MW offshore wind turbine in 20 meters of water that is subjected to
   coupled wind and wave input fields during a hurricane. Over
   approximately 120 hours, these hurricane-induced input fields yield
   changing characteristics of the excitation and the response of a parked
   turbine. As the storm evolves, the directionality of the wind and waves
   changes; short-crested waves are simulated and associated wind velocity
   fields are generated. Aerodynamic loads on the rotor and hydrodynamic
   loads on the support structure are simulated in coupled response
   analyses. Because yaw control backup power is not assured during the
   hurricane, different assumptions on yaw misalignment are assumed in the
   turbine response simulations. Time series of various turbine response
   measures are evaluated. Response extremes are of particular interest; we
   discuss the relative importance of wind and waves on the overall turbine
   performance during the storm. We also assess the role of yaw control
   systems and the effect of loss of power to such systems during tropical
   storms by examining the turbine response for alternative situations of
   turbine misalignment. Ultimately, this study seeks to provide the
   framework for assessing turbine designs for tropical cyclone conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of predicted loads on offshore wind turbines depends on the
   mathematical models employed to describe the combined action of the wind
   and waves. Using a global simulation framework that employs a
   domain-decomposition strategy for computational efficiency, this study
   investigates the effects of nonlinear waves on computed loads on the
   support structure (monopile) and the rotor-nacelle assembly of a
   bottom-supported offshore wind turbine. The fully nonlinear (FNL)
   numerical wave solver is invoked only on sub-domains where
   nonlinearities are detected; thus, only locally in space and time, a
   linear solution (and associated Morison hydrodynamics) is replaced by
   the FNL one. An efficient carefully tuned linear-nonlinear transition
   scheme makes it possible to run long simulations such that effects from
   weakly nonlinear up to fully nonlinear events, such as imminent breaking
   waves, can be accounted for. The unsteady nonlinear free-surface problem
   governing the propagation of gravity waves is formulated using potential
   theory and a higher-order boundary element method (HOBEM) is used to
   discretize Laplace's equation. The FNL solver is employed and associated
   hydrodynamic loads are simulated in conjunction with aerodynamic loads
   on the rotor of a 5-MW wind turbine using the NREL open-source software,
   FAST. We assess load statistics associated with a single severe sea
   state. Such load statistics are needed in evaluating relevant load cases
   specified in offshore wind turbine design guidelines; in this context,
   the influence of nonlinear wave modeling and its selection over
   alternative linear or linearized wave modeling is compared. Ultimately,
   a study such as this one will seek to evaluate long-term loads using the
   FNL solver in computations directed towards reliability-based design of
   offshore wind turbines where a range of sea states will need to be
   evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the computation of radiative heat transfer in a slab
   filled with a participating medium composed of CO2, H2O, and soot. The
   HITEMP 2010 spectral database is employed to obtain the necessary
   parameters for the prediction of radiative transfer in the
   non-isothermal, homogeneous medium. The spectral integration is
   performed with the spectral line weighted-sum-of-gray-gases (SLW) and
   the cumulative wavenumber (CW) models and compared with the line-by-line
   (LBL) benchmark solution. Since radiation heat transfer can sometimes be
   the dominant heat transfer mechanism in combustion processes, it is
   important to understand how the predicted thermochemical state depends
   on the radiation model for the composition, taking into account the
   complex dependence of the properties with the spectrum. The contribution
   of this work is to compare two detailed spectral model that are

Abstract = {{Fire models are routinely used in life safety design projects and are
   being used more often in fire and arson investigations as well as
   reconstructions of firefighter line-of-duty deaths (LODDs) and injuries.
   In all of these applications, the fire heat release rate (HRR), location
   of a fire in a compartment, gas-phase soot concentration, and
   solid-phase soot accumulation are important parameters that govern the
   evolution of thermal conditions within the fire compartment. These input
   parameters can be a large source of uncertainty in fire models,
   especially in scenarios in which experimental data or detailed
   information on fire behavior are not available, such as fire
   investigations and LODD reconstructions. Various methods have been
   reported in literature to determine the size and location of a fire in a
   compartment using ceiling-mounted detectors {[}1-4]. A previous study by
   the authors developed an inverse fire modeling technique to determine
   the time-varying HRR of fire in a compartment using measured
   thermocouple data {[}5]. The work presented in this paper extends the
   inverse HRR methodology by developing a technique to determine the
   location of a fire using wall-mounted heat flux sensors or a surrogate
   such as degradation characteristics of enclosure boundaries that can be
   collected during post-fire assessments. Additionally, the presence of
   soot modifies the radiative transfer field in the hot gas layer (gas
   phase) as well as radiative heat transfer to surfaces (condensed phase).
   As a detailed history of compartment conditions becomes less available,
   there is a need for an inversion methodology to accurately recover
   governing input parameters such as fire size, fire location, and fire
   burning properties while maintaining an adequate level of accuracy. As
   an intermediate step using measured fire test data, we can begin to
   construct an approach to use rich data to invert for fire intensity,
   fire location, and fire properties such as the amount of soot produced
   by the fire.}},

Abstract = {{G-FOLD, Guidance for Fuel Optimal Large Divert, is an algorithm that is
   developed to compute, onboard in real-time, fuel optimal trajectories
   for large divert maneuvers necessary for planetary pinpoint or precision
   landing. The algorithm incorporates all relevant mission constraints and
   computes the global optimal trajectory. It is based on a mathematical
   result known as ``lossless convexification{''} of the associated optimal
   control problem, which allowed us to formulate the problem as a convex
   optimization problem and to guarantee obtaining the global optimal
   solution when a feasible solution exists. Hence the algorithm ensures
   that all physically achievable diverts are also computable in real-time.
   This paper reports the first three flight test results of G-FOLD
   generated trajectories. The goal of these tests were to test pre-flight
   computed G-FOLD trajectories to demonstrate that they are computed with
   relevant mission constraints and appropriate vehicle dynamics accounted
   for. The results showed good agreement with the desired ideal
   trajectories with mismatches below expected bounds, which validated that
   the desired outcome that the trajectories were computed by using the
   right problem description and the resulting trajectories are flyable.}},

Abstract = {{With a goal of efficiently trading higher memory footprints for faster
   runtimes, a high fidelity interpolation method is presented for
   approximating a scalar quantity and associated gradients in the global
   3D domain external to a sphere. The new ``Fetch{''} interpolation model
   utilizes the weighting function method originally proposed by Junkins
   et. al to achieve continuity and smoothness. An overlapping grid
   strategy ensures a singularity-free domain, while minimizing associated
   memory costs. Local interpolating functions are judiciously chosen with
   a new adaptive, order-based selection of local polynomials which
   minimizes coefficient storage subject to a radially mapped residual
   tolerance. Analytic inversions of the normal equations associated with
   each candidate polynomial allow for rapid solutions to the least squares
   process without resorting to the conventional numerical linear system
   solvers. The gradient and higher order partial derivatives are computed
   directly with no memory cost, and are smooth and continuous to a
   user-specified order. The method is specifically applied to interpolate
   the Grace Gravity Model GGM03C geopotential up to degree and order 360.
   Highly tuned interpolation models of various resolutions are presented
   and discussed in detail. Released Fetch interpolation models of the
   geopotential include resolutions of 33 x 33, 70 x70, 156 x 156 and 360 x
   360. The memory requirements span from 120 MB to 2360 MB, and the
   expected speedups over spherical harmonics evaluations span from similar
   to 10 to similar to 3000 fold. The break even resolution for runtime
   speeds is approximately degree and order 8. The models are globally
   continuous to order 3 and thus may be of interest to a variety of
   science and engineering applications. The runtime evaluation codes along
   with model coefficients are available on the internet.}},

   is that the solution to the unperturbed equations of motion is that of a
   linear harmonic oscillator, so the analytical solution is explicitly
   characterized during any coast phase. The control scheme progresses
   through thrust-coast regimes covering two main phases: first, a matching
   of the target's semi-major axis, and second, a matching of position and
   velocity of the target, to achieve rendezvous. No restrictions are posed
   upon the initial position and velocity separations between the chaser

Abstract = {{A classification is presented that categorizes free-return trajectories
   in the Earth Sun rotating frame that begin and end near the Earth with
   no intermediate velocity adjustments. Candidate trajectories and
   trajectory families are searched to determine possible orbits to
   rendezvous with near-Earth asteroids. Determination of trajectory
   families is accomplished via a numerical search technique, which uses a
   constrained zero-cost optimization algorithm combined with a particle
   swarm algorithm. Hundreds of candidate trajectories are found,
   satisfying constraints at Earth and escape energy conditions. The
   trajectories are classified in five different categories based on common
   characteristics in orbital plane, direction, and time of flight.
   Additionally, an example rendezvous orbit is shown involving near-Earth
   asteroid 2000 SG344 in the years 2027-2028.}},

Title = {{Keynote - Total Design Data Needs for the New Generation Large-Scale
   Activity Microsimulation Models}},
Booktitle = {{TRANSPORT SURVEY METHODS: BEST PRACTICE FOR DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Pages = {{21-45}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - In this paper we describe a total design data collection
   method (expanding the definition of the usual ``total design''
   terminology used in typical household travel surveys) to emphasize the
   need to describe individual and group behaviors embedded within their
   spatial, temporal, and social contexts.
   Methodology/approach - We first offer an overview of recently developed
   modeling and simulation applications predominantly in North America
   followed by a summary of the data needs in typical modeling and
   simulation modules for statewide and regional travel demand forecasting.
   We then proceed to describe an ideal data collection scheme with core
   and satellite survey components that can inform current and future model
   building. Mention is also made to the currently implemented California
   Household Travel Survey that brings together multiple agencies, modeling
   goals, and data collection component surveys.
   Findings - The preparation of this paper involved reviewing emerging
   transportation modeling approaches and paradigms, policy questions, and
   behavioral issues and considerations that are important in the
   multimodal transportation planning context. It was found that many of
   the questions being asked of policy makers in the transportation domain
   require a deep understanding of the interactions and constraints under
   which individuals make activity-travel choices, the learning processes
   at play, and the attitudes and perceptions that shape ways in which
   people adjust their travel behavior in response to policy interventions.
   Based on the work, it was found that many of the traditional travel
   survey designs are not able to provide the comprehensive data needed to
   estimate activity-based model systems that truly capture the full range
   of behavioral considerations and phenomena of importance.
   Originality/value of paper - This paper offers a review of the emerging
   transportation modeling approaches and behavioral paradigms of
   importance in activity-based travel demand forecasting. The paper
   discusses how traditional travel survey designs are inadequate to meet
   the data needs of emerging modeling approaches. Based on a review of all
   of the data needs and new data collection methods that are making it
   possible to observe a full range of human behaviors, the paper offers a
   total survey data collection design that brings together many different
   surveys and data collection protocols. The core household travel survey
   is augmented by a full slate of special purpose surveys that together
   yield a rich behavioral database for activity-based microsimulation
   modeling. The paper is a valuable reference for transportation planners
   and modelers interested in developing data collection enterprises that
   will feed the next generation of transportation models.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{34-49}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we present a novel methodology to derive blending schemes
   to concurrently couple local and nonlocal models obtained from a single
   reference framework based upon the peridynamic theory of solid
   mechanics. A consistent force-based blended model that couples
   peridynamics and classical elasticity is presented using nonlocal
   weights composed of integrals of blending functions. The proposed
   blended model possesses desired properties of multiscale material models
   such as satisfying Newton's third law and passing the patch test. This
   approach finds useful applications in material failure for which the
   peridynamics theory can be used to describe regions where fracture is
   expected, whereas classical elasticity could be efficiently used
   elsewhere. Numerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy and
   efficiency of the blended model are presented as well as qualitative
   studies of the error sensitivity on different model and problem
   parameters. We also generalize this approach to the coupling of
   peridynamics and higher-order gradient models of any order. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{An approach for the generation of particles at a hybrid
   Navier-Stokes/DSMC interface is presented for simple gases and gas
   mixtures with internal degrees of freedom. DSMC particles generated at a
   hybrid boundary are assigned thermal velocities using a non-equilibrium
   surface reservoir approach, in which the fluxes of mass, momentum and
   energy determined from the Navier-Stokes solution are used to prescribe
   the appropriate velocity distribution function used in the DSMC particle
   generation. The non-equilibrium surface reservoir approach is first
   outlined for a simple (single-species, monatomic) gas, and is then
   extended to gas mixtures with internal degrees of freedom, in which
   additional diffusion and internal heat flux terms are included in the
   Generalized Chapman-Enskog formulation of the perturbation. The
   significance of the diffusion, shear stress and heat flux breakdown
   parameters used to compute the perturbation are examined at a hybrid
   interface within non-equilibrium boundary layer flow, as well as within
   the breakdown region near a normal shock, in a five-species air gas
   mixture. The validity of the Chapman-Enskog perturbation at each of
   these hybrid interfaces is assessed by comparison with the Generalized
   Chapman-Enskog perturbations. Although a hybrid flowfield solution is
   not presented, this work provides a rigorous approach for
   non-equilibrium particle generation involving general hybrid
   particle/continuum studies of hypersonic flows. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{A commercial polyamide reverse osmosis (RO) membrane was
   surface-modified with polydopamine deposited from buffered, aqueous

   modification conditions (i.e., dopamine solution concentration,
   polydopamine deposition time, and initial pH of Tris-HCl buffer) on pure
   water flux, flux during filtration of an oil/water emulsion, and NaCl
   rejection was investigated. Dead-end filtration results showed decreased
   pure water flux with increasing dopamine solution concentration and
   polydopamine deposition time. Membranes modified at a pH of 5 exhibited
   no change in pure water flux or flux during fouling experiments compared
   to the native membranes, suggesting that polydopamine was not deposited
   under such acidic coating conditions. All polydopamine-modified
   membranes, except those coated at a pH of 5, had higher fluxes when
   filtering an oil/water emulsion than that of unmodified membranes. NaCl
   rejection values in all membranes were within the manufacturer's
   specification. The increased flux when filtering an oil/water emulsion
   was not sensitive to dopamine concentration, coating time greater than
   60 min, or alkaline buffer pH value. Short deposition times slightly
   reduced the fouling resistance of coated membranes, and membranes
   modified at acidic pH values showed no improvement in fouling. (C) 2012

   velocities in Poiseuille and electrokinetically driven flows over the
   first similar to 0.4 mu m next to the wall from the motion of an
   ensemble of O(10(5)) fluorescent particles illuminated by evanescent
   waves. Because the evanescent-wave intensity decays exponentially with
   wall-normal distance, the particle-wall separation can be determined
   from the brightness of each particle image, and used to estimate the
   steady-state distribution of the tracers near the wall. More recently,
   evanescent-wave illumination has been combined with fluorescence
   thermometry, to estimate water temperature fields from changes in the
   fluorescence intensity of aqueous fluorophore solutions. Poiseuille flow
   of a fluorescein solution at Reynolds numbers of 3.3 and 8.3 through a
   heated minichannel was illuminated with evanescent waves to measure
   solution temperatures at an average distance of 74 nm from the wall. The

Abstract = {{Achieving the increasingly fast mixing requirements posed by the
   chemical, biological, and life science community for confined
   microchannel droplet flows remains an engineering challenge. The viscous
   and surface tension forces that often dominate microflows undermine
   fast, efficient mixing. A novel mixing arrangement based on droplet
   collisions has been developed that significantly improves mixing rates
   by utilizing inertia to rapidly rearrange fluid contents. This article
   experimentally investigates inertial droplet mixing in micro-flows
   following high-speed droplet pair collisions. The technique utilizes a
   gaseous flow for liquid droplet generation and transport with collisions
   occurring in Y-junction microchannel geometries. Mixing rates are
   quantified using differential fluorescent optical diagnostics, custom
   image processing algorithms, and statistical analysis. Measured droplet
   mixing times are compared to the characteristic time scales for mass and
   viscous diffusion and bulk convective transport. Results show that
   mixing times are decreased as the droplet pair collision inertia is
   increased, indicating the potential benefit for inertial collision
   mixing.}},

Journal = {{WAVE MOTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{57-79}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The numerical simulation of wave motion in arbitrarily heterogeneous
   semi-infinite media requires the truncation of the semi-infinite extent
   of the domain to yield a finite computational domain. In the presence of
   heterogeneity, the domain truncation is best accomplished via the
   introduction of perfectly-matched-layers (PMLs) at the truncation
   surface.
   By and large, most PML formulations treat in an identical manner both
   the interior domain and the PML buffer zone. By construction, the
   complex-coordinate-stretched equations used to introduce the PML, also
   serve to describe the interior domain, where they reduce to the
   original, unstretched, system of governing equations. Such a unified
   treatment, however, results in increased computational cost.
   In this development, we discuss a hybrid formulation that leads to a
   mixed form within the PML, coupled with a standard displacement-only
   form for the interior domain, both of which are second-order in time. We
   discuss the formulation and the numerical implementation using finite
   elements in the context of a standard Galerkin scheme that yields fully
   symmetric discrete forms, and results in optimal computational cost. We
   show that existing displacement-based codes for interior domains can be
   easily modified to accommodate PMLs as a means of domain truncation.
   We report on numerical results demonstrating the stability, efficacy,
   and cost-effectiveness of the hybrid formulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The photothermal stability of plasmonic nanoparticles is critically
   important to perform reliable photoacoustic imaging and photothermal
   therapy. Recently, biodegradable nanoclusters composed of sub-5 nm
   primary gold particles and a biodegradable polymer have been reported as
   clinically-translatable contrast agents for photoacoustic imaging. After
   cellular internalization, the nanoclusters degrade into 5 nm primary
   particles for efficient excretion from the body. In this paper, three
   different sizes of biodegradable nanoclusters were synthesized and the
   optical properties and photothermal stability of the nanoclusters were
   investigated and compared to that of gold nanorods. The results of our
   study indicate that 40 nm and 80 nm biodegradable nanoclusters
   demonstrate higher photothermal stability compared to gold nanorods.
   Furthermore, 40 nm nanoclusters produce higher photoacoustic signal than
   gold nanorods at a given concentration of gold. Therefore, the
   biodegradable plasmonic nanoclusters can be effectively used for
   photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy. (C) 2012 Optical Society

Abstract = {{In vitro bioreactor-based cultures are being extensively investigated
   for large-scale production of differentiated cells from embryonic stem
   cells (ESCs). However, it is unclear whether in vitro ESC-derived
   progenitors have similar gene expression profiles and functionalities as
   their in vivo counterparts. This is crucial in establishing the validity
   of ESC-derived cells as replacements for adult-isolated cells for
   clinical therapies. In this study, we compared the gene expression
   profiles of Lin-ckit+Sca-1+ (LKS) cells generated in vitro from mouse
   ESCs using either static or bioreactor-based cultures, with that of
   native LKS cells isolated from mouse fetal liver (FL) or bone marrow
   (BM). We found that in vitro-generated LKS cells were more similar to
   FL-than to BM LKS cells in gene expression. Further, when compared to
   cells derived from bioreactor cultures, static culture-derived LKS cells
   showed fewer differentially expressed genes relative to both in vivo LKS
   populations. Overall, the expression of hematopoietic genes was lower in
   ESC-derived LKS cells compared to cells from BM and FL, while the levels
   of non-hematopoietic genes were up-regulated. In order to determine if
   these molecular profiles correlated with functionality, we evaluated
   ESC-derived LKS cells for in vitro hematopoietic-differentiation and
   colony formation (CFU assay). Although static culture-generated cells
   failed to form any colonies, they did differentiate into CD11c+ and
   B220+ cells indicating some hematopoietic potential. In contrast,
   bioreactor-derived LKS cells, when differentiated under the same
   conditions failed to produce any B220+ or CD11c+ cells and did not form
   colonies, indicating that these cells are not hematopoietic progenitors.
   We conclude that in vitro culture conditions significantly affect the
   transcriptome and functionality of ESC-derived LKS cells and although in
   vitro differentiated LKS cells were lineage negative and expressed both
   ckit and Sca-1, these cells, especially those obtained from dynamic
   cultures, are significantly different from native cells of the same
   phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation is a useful method
   for describing electronic properties associated with charged
   excitations. A hierarchy of GW methods exists, starting from
   non-self-consistent G(0)W(0), through partial self-consistency in the
   eigenvalues and in the Green's function (scGW(0)), to fully
   self-consistent GW (scGW). Here, we assess the performance of these
   methods for benzene, pyridine, and the diazines. The quasiparticle
   spectra are compared to photoemission spectroscopy (PES) experiments
   with respect to all measured particle removal energies and the ordering
   of the frontier orbitals. We find that the accuracy of the calculated
   spectra does not match the expectations based on their level of
   self-consistency. In particular, for certain starting points G(0)W(0)
   and scGW(0) provide spectra in better agreement with the PES than scGW.

Abstract = {{Economic, energy, and sustainability metrics are key performance
   indicators for process operations. The relative importance of these

   can be aligned by focusing on energy efficiency. Power-steam systems are
   the major energy drivers for most plants, and we discuss possible
   operational changes that might improve energy efficiency, as well as the
   role of process control. Managing the interplay of real-time
   optimization and regulatory control is a challenge for the future, as
   well as interfacing with the implementation of smart power grids by the
   utility industry. Combined heat and power along with energy storage

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Thin films find a variety of technological applications. Assembling thin
   films from atoms in the liquid phase is intrinsically a non-equilibrium
   phenomenon, controlled by the competition between thermodynamics and
   kinetics. We demonstrate here that microwave energy can assist in
   assembling atoms into thin films directly on a substrate at
   significantly lower temperatures than conventional processes,
   potentially enabling plastic-based electronics. Both experimental and
   electromagnetic simulation results show microwave fields can selectively
   interact with a conducting layer on the substrate despite the
   discrepancy between the substrate size and the microwave wavelength. The
   microwave interaction leads to localized energy absorption, heating, and
   subsequent nucleation and growth of the desired films. Electromagnetic
   simulations show remarkable agreement with experiments and are employed
   to understand the physics of the microwave interaction and identify
   conditions to improve uniformity of the films. The films can be
   patterned and grown on various substrates, enabling their use in
   widespread applications.}},

Title = {{A study of capping layers for sulfur monolayer doping on III-V junctions}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Recently, high dosage doping on Si multi-gate field effect transistors
   and III-V planar structures using a self-limiting monolayer doping
   technique was reported to overcome challenges in scaling nano-sized
   transistors. The stoichiometry or composition of the capping layer was
   found to affect the diffusion efficiency of this process. In this work,
   we study the effect of a capping layer in sulfur monolayer doping on
   III-V junctions. Various capping temperatures and growth methods were
   compared. Based on the theoretical and experimental results, we suggest
   an optimized scheme consisting of a bi-layer capping structure. From
   Hall measurements and secondary ion mass spectrometry, a SiNx/BeO
   bi-layer capping, compared to single layer cap, exhibited the best
   results with a surface sheet resistance of 232 Omega/sq, junction depth
   of 11 nm, dopant profile abruptness of 3.5 nm/dec, electrically active S
   concentration of 4.9 x 10(19) /cm(3) (=1.34 x 10(13) /cm(2)), and 3

Abstract = {{Diffusion plays a critical role in determining the rate at which gases
   migrate through porous systems. Accurate estimates of diffusion
   coefficients are essential if gas transport is to be accurately modeled
   and better techniques are needed that can be used to measure these
   coefficients non-invasively. Here we present a novel method for using
   prompt gamma activation analysis to determine the binary diffusion
   coefficients of a gas in a porous system. Argon diffusion experiments
   were conducted in a 1 m long, 10 cm diameter, horizontal column packed
   with a SiO2 sand. The temporal variation of argon concentration within
   the system was measured using prompt gamma activation analysis. The
   binary diffusion coefficient was obtained by comparing the experimental
   data with the predictions from a numerical model in which the diffusion
   coefficient was varied until the sum of square errors between experiment
   and model data was minimized. Predictions of argon concentration using
   the optimal diffusivity fit experimental measurements with an R-2 of
   0.983. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The resistive switching characteristics and mechanism in active
   SiOx-based resistive switching memory have been investigated by using a
   simple TaN/SiO2/n(++) Si-substrate test structure. Controlling the
   oxygen content in SiOx layer not only improved device yield but also
   stabilized electrical switching characteristics. The current transport
   behavior in high- and low-resistance states, thickness effect in SiOx
   layer, device area effect, and multilevel effect by controlling
   compliance current limitation and stopped voltage values have been
   studied. The results indicate that resistive switching occurs in a
   localized region along a filament, rather than uniformly throughout the
   bulk. A general current flow model for nonpolar SiOx-based resistive
   switching memory has been proposed, which provides a simple physical
   concept to describe the resistive switching behavior and provides
   additional insights into optimization of resistive switching memory
   devices. (c) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Ion sorption measurements were conducted to characterize sodium and
   chloride sorption in sulfonated polymers of interest for membrane
   applications. An uncharged polymer, based on cross-linked poly(ethylene
   glycol diacrylate), was included for comparison. The charged polymers
   included a sulfonated polysulfone random copolymer and two phase
   separated sulfonated styrenic pentablock copolymers. The sodium and
   chloride ion concentrations sorbed in these polymers were measured after
   polymer films had been equilibrated with 0.01-1.0 mol L-1 aqueous NaCl
   solutions at neutral pH. For the sulfonated polymers, cation sorption
   was measured using a polymer ashing technique and flame atomic
   absorption spectrophotometry. Anion sorption was measured using a
   desorption technique and ion chromatography. Polymer charge, i.e.,
   sulfonation, influenced ion sorption. In general, salt sorption
   increased as water sorption increased in all polymers considered. In the
   uncharged polymer, the molar concentrations of sorbed sodium and
   chloride were equal to one another, as expected. However, the sulfonated
   polymers sorbed much more sodium than chloride ions due to ion exchange.
   The experimental mobile salt (i.e., anion) sorption data were fit to a
   model containing contributions from both Donnan exclusion and simple
   salt partitioning to the overall salt uptake by the polymer. In general,
   the influence of Donnan exclusion on anion (i.e., mobile salt) sorption
   in these cation exchange materials is reduced as water uptake increases,
   presumably due, in part, to dilution of the hydrated polymer's sulfonate
   groups. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},
