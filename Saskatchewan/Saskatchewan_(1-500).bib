Abstract = {{This work aims to develop novel techniques, including low energy
   end-hall ion (EDH) source, nitrogen and silicon doping, to enhance the
   adhesion strength of Diamond-like carbon (DLC) on Polyethylene
   Terephthalate (PET) to address their major application issues. For this
   purpose, Nitrogen doped DLC (N-DLC) and Silicon doped DLC (Si-DLC) thin
   films with different compositions were prepared on PET substrates using
   EDHI beam deposition. The composition and bonding states of the films
   were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and near
   edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS). The results show that
   sp(3) carbon bonding concentration in Si-DLC is higher than in N-DLC and
   the doped Si forms sp(3) Si-C bonds and N forms sp(3) C-N and sp(2) C=N
   bonds in films. Nano indentation tests were used to measure the hardness
   and Young's modulus while pin-on-disk sliding tests and scratching tests
   were used to evaluate the tribological and adhesion behavior of the
   samples, respectively. The results illustrate hardness reduction and
   adhesion enhancement in N-DLC and hardness enhancement of Si-DLC. In
   addition, the coefficient of friction (COF) of N-DLC is lower than pure
   DLC and Si-DLC, while it has been observed that formation of silicon
   oxide can reduce COF of Si-DLC. The coating roughness measured by an
   optical profiler decreases by increasing nitrogen concentration in
   N-DLC. This is probably because N doping reduces residual stress and
   thus makes film dense and smooth. By optimizing deposition condition,
   highly adherent DLC based thin films on PET have been achieved. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Excessive internal stresses in Diamond-like Carbon (DLC) films induced
   by the energetic ion bombardment during the deposition cause poor
   adhesion even delamination of the thin films from the substrate

   is essential for their applications. In this study, DLC thin films were
   prepared on thin silicon wafers with different shapes and sizes by end
   hall ion beam deposition. Optical profiler was used to measure the
   curvature of the samples before and after DLC deposition and then the
   Stoney equation was used to calculate the residual stress of DLC thin
   films in order to evaluate the feasibility of this method for
   measurement of DLC stress. For this purpose, the curvature radius in
   different directions of all the samples was measured before and after
   DLC deposition by the optical profiler. The calculated stress values
   using Stoney equation for all the samples are the same within reasonable
   errors. These results show that this simple method is appropriate and
   reliable for stress measurement of DLC films. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Diamond coating with sufficient adhesion on WC-Co cutting tools is
   expected to significantly increase their cutting performance. In order
   to enhance the coating-substrate interfacial adhesion, Al2O3 and Ta
   mono-interlayer, Al-Al2O3, Al-AlN and Al-Ta duplex interlayer systems
   have been developed in this study. These interlayer materials were
   prepared using a magnetron sputtering method, and diamond coating were
   deposited on them using microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor
   deposition. Grazing incident X-ray diffraction was carried out to
   determine the phase components in the Al-Al2O3 and Al-AlN interlayers.
   Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to
   evaluate the quality, morphology and microstructure of the deposited
   diamond coatings. Rockwell C indentation testing was performed to
   evaluate the adhesion of the coatings. To elucidate the coating failure
   mechanism, the compositions around the delaminated spots of diamond
   coatings after indentation were identified by Energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy. The results show that continuous diamond coatings were
   achieved on Al2O3, Al-Al2O3, Al-AlN and Al-Ta interlayered substrates,
   whereas a graphite layer was still formed with the Ta monolayer
   accompanied by an easy spallation of diamond coatings. The Al interlayer
   has played an important role in obtaining high purity diamond by in-situ
   forming an alumina barrier layer. Especially, the diamond coating
   deposited with an Al-AlN interlayer demonstrates superior interfacial
   adhesion in comparison with all the other interlayers. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Single phase of Tb-doped YPO4 phosphors with xenotime structure were
   successfully synthesized via a polyacrylamide gel at different annealing
   temperatures (650-1050 degrees C). The crystal structure, thermal
   behavior and optical properties of the as-synthesized samples were
   investigated by XRD, TG-DTA, FT-IR, PL, and XPS. The effects of heat
   treatment on the structure and luminescence properties of samples were
   discussed. The PL spectra results reveal that the annealing temperature
   plays a key role in the luminescence properties of products. The samples
   obtained under 650-850 degrees C exhibit a strong green emission at 546
   nm, attributing to the D-5(4)-F-7(5) transition of Tb3+, while the
   samples produced above 850 degrees C emit dominating blue lines at 381
   and 415 nm, corresponding to the D-5(3)-F-7(6) and D-5(3)-F-7(5)
   transitions, respectively. The XPS results imply that a part of doping
   Tb3+ ions may be oxidized to Tb4+ on the high-temperature thermal
   treatment process, which could be the reason for the bluish color of
   Tb-doped YPO4 phosphors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Analytic sources of inequivalence of the velocity gauge and length gauge}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{It has been known for many years now that the descriptions of
   electromagnetic couplings in velocity gauge and length gauge can yield
   different results for atoms and molecules in strong fields. We point out
   that it is mathematically consistent to mix velocity gauge for some
   components of a material with length gauge for other components,
   although this should not be possible for a bona fide gauge
   transformation. Formany-particle systems in a Hartree approximation, it
   is even possible to mix velocity gauge and length gauge for different
   particles of the same kind. Four main sources of analytic differences
   between velocity gauge and length gauge are then identified, and it is
   pointed out that these sources imply differences between velocity gauge
   and length gauge in particular for subfemtosecond spectroscopy, for
   experiments involving strong fields, and for chiral materials. Finally,
   it is emphasized that the transformation from velocity gauge to length
   gauge is just a particular example of a picture-changing unitary
   transformation. However, all these transformations lead to nonunitary
   shifts of the Hamiltonian, irrespective of whether the transformation
   can be described as a gauge transformation. Therefore, all these
   descriptions of quantum optics in dipole approximation are formally
   equivalent if agreement is achieved which particular formulation of the
   time-dependent interaction terms perturbs the ``true{''} energy
   eigenstates of a system. However, this is where the actual discrepancies
   between velocity gauge, length gauge, and also other formulations such
   as acceleration gauge originate. This implies a generalization of the
   results of Galstyan et al. {[}Phys. Rev. A 93, 023422 (2016)] from two
   different classes of theoretical formulations to many different classes
   of theoretical formulations.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical response of AISI 321 austenitic stainless steel under
   both dynamic and quasi-static compression was studied and compared.
   Compression in both loading conditions led to strain-induced phase
   transformation which follows the FCC gamma-austenite -> BCC
   alpha-martensite sequence. During deformation in both loading
   conditions, precipitation of nano-sized carbide and evolution of
   strain-induced martensite contributed to strengthening while plastic
   deformation mechanisms occurred in the specimens by slip and mechanical
   twinning mechanisms. Specimens subjected to quasi-static compression
   exhibited lower yield strength and higher strain hardening capacity than
   the dynamically impacted specimen. While deformed shear band (DSB)
   characterized by elongated grains developed in the quasi-statically
   compressed specimen, transformed shear band (TSB) characterized by
   nano-grains (average size of 0.28 mu m) were formed in the dynamically
   impacted specimen. The texture of the FCC austenite in all regions of
   the specimen under both loading conditions is predominantly < 110 >
   parallel to CD (compression direction) with minor < 111 > parallel to CD
   component. Large strain localization in the TSB of an impacted specimen
   led to off-< 110 > parallel to CD texture in the FCC austenite. In BCC
   martensite, < 111 > parallel to CD and < 100 > parallel to CD fibres are
   the predominant texture components in specimens subjected to dynamic
   impact and quasi-static loading, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Two different rank coals with high organic sulfur content were selected
   and pretreated with tetrachloroethylene (PCE) under ultrasonic field.
   The effects of pretreating process on sulfur forms in two coals have
   been investigated by chemical analysis and sulfur K-edge X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy (S-XAS). The transformation behaviors of sulfur
   forms during pyrolysis of raw and PCE-treated coals in the fixed bed
   reactor with temperature-programmed apparatus were studied by gas
   chromatography (GC) and S-XAS. Results show that sulfur removal degree
   of Coal A and Coal D are 29.7\% and 24.1\%, respectively; and the
   removal of organic sulfur are dominant, accounting for 87.1\% and 66.1\%
   of total removal of sulfur from Coal A and Coal D. The sulfur
   compositions in coals obviously change before and after PCE extraction,
   and these changes appear to be unevenly distributed on the surface and
   in the bulk of coal. The effects of PCE extraction on the release of
   sulfur-containing gases are different for two coals, which are dependent
   on the sulfur forms in the coals, as well as the chemical structure in
   coals. The sulfur forms retained in the chars are significantly
   different for low rank Coal A before and after PCE extraction, but there
   is little change for high rank Coal D. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Fe-Al alloys with different Al contents have been exposed to a microwave
   plasma activated CH4-H-2 gas mixture at 670 degrees C. An intermediate
   graphite layer formed on Fe-10Al substrate retarded diamond nucleation
   and deteriorated the interfacial adhesion, and severe metal dusting and
   carburization occurred. Diamond nucleation on Fe-20Al was enhanced by
   inhibited graphitization and cementite formation. Only Fe3AlCx-type
   precipitates were observed. On Fe-27Al and Fe-40Al alloys,
   graphitization and substrate carburization were completely prevented,
   producing enhanced nucleation and interfacial adhesion of diamond. The
   improved carburization resistance and diamond deposition with increasing
   Al contents is closely related to the formation of an alumina-rich layer
   on the alloy surface. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{239}},
Pages = {{68-75}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Fermentation redox potential was monitored during cell-recycling
   continuous ethanol operation. The cell-recycling system (CRS) was
   operated using two hollow fibre (HF) membranes (pore sizes 0.20 and 0.65
   mu m) at three dilution rates (0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 h(-1)). Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae NP 01 were recycled in the fermenter at a recycle ratio of
   0.625. Aeration was provided at 2.5 vvm for the first 4 h and then
   further supplied continuously at 0.25 vvm. As steady state was
   established, results showed that the fermentation redox potential was
   lower for processes employing CRS than those without. At the same
   dilution, rates, the sugar utilization and ethanol production with CRS
   were higher than those without CRS. The highest fermentation efficiency
   (87.94 g/l of ethanol, similar to 90\% of theoretical yield) was
   achieved using a 0.2-mu m HF membrane CRS at a dilution rate of 0.02
   h(-1). It was found that 7.53-10.07\% of the carbon derived from glucose
   was incorporated into the yeast. Further, at the same dilution rates,
   yeast in the processes with CRS incorporated less carbon into ethanol
   than in those grown without CRS. This result suggests that processes
   involving CRS utilize more carbon for metabolite synthesis than biomass
   formation. This indicated that the processes with CRS could utilize more
   carbon for metabolite synthesis than biomass formation. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A multiple energy imaging system that can extract multiple endogenous or
   induced contrast materials as well as water and bone images would be
   ideal for imaging of biological subjects. The continuous spectrum
   available from synchrotron light facilities provides a nearly perfect
   source for multiple energy x-ray imaging. A novel multiple energy x-ray
   imaging system, which prepares a horizontally focused polychromatic
   x-ray beam, has been developed at the BioMedical Imaging and Therapy
   bend magnet beamline at the Canadian Light Source. The imaging system is
   made up of a cylindrically bent Laue single silicon (5,1,1) crystal
   monochromator, scanning and positioning stages for the subjects, flat
   panel (area) detector, and a data acquisition and control system.
   Depending on the crystal's bent radius, reflection type, and the
   horizontal beam width of the filtered synchrotron radiation (20-50 keV)
   used, the size and spectral energy range of the focused beam prepared
   varied. For example, with a bent radius of 95 cm, a (1,1,1) type
   reflection and a 50 mm wide beam, a 0.5 mm wide focused beam of spectral
   energy range 27 keV-43 keV was obtained. This spectral energy range
   covers the K-edges of iodine (33.17 keV), xenon (34.56 keV), cesium
   (35.99 keV), and barium (37.44 keV); some of these elements are used as
   biomedical and clinical contrast agents. Using the developed imaging
   system, a test subject composed of iodine, xenon, cesium, and barium
   along with water and bone were imaged and their projected concentrations
   successfully extracted. The estimated dose rate to test subjects imaged
   at a ring current of 200 mA is 8.7 mGy s(-1), corresponding to a
   cumulative dose of 1.3 Gy and a dose of 26.1 mGy per image. Potential
   biomedical applications of the imaging system will include projection
   imaging that requires any of the extracted elements as a contrast agent
   and multi-contrast K-edge imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Essential proteins are those necessary for the survival or reproduction
   of species and discovering such essential proteins is fundamental for
   understanding the minimal requirements for cellular life, which is also
   meaningful to the disease study and drug design. With the development of
   high-throughput techniques, a large number of Protein-Protein
   Interactions (PPIs) can be used to identify essential proteins at the
   network level. Up to now, though a series of network-based computational
   methods have been proposed, it is still a challenge to improve the
   prediction precision as the high false positives in PPI networks. In
   this paper, we propose a new method GOS to identify essential proteins
   by integrating the Gene expressions, Orthology, and Subcellular
   localization information. The gene expressions and subcellular
   localization information are used to determine whether a neighbor in the
   PPI network is reliable. Only reliable neighbors are considered when we
   analyze the topological characteristics of a protein in a PPI network.
   We also analyze the orthologous attributes of each protein to reflect
   its conservative features, and use a random walk model to integrate a
   protein's topological characteristics and its orthology. The
   experimental results on the yeast PPI network show that the proposed
   method GOS outperforms the ten existing methods DC, BC, CC, SC, EC, IC,
   NC, PeC, ION, and CSC.}},

Title = {{A sparsity-based iterative algorithm for reconstruction of micro-CT

Abstract = {{Synchrotron X-ray Micro Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) is an imaging
   technique which is increasingly used for non-invasive in vivo
   preclinical imaging. However, it often requires a large number of
   projections from many different angles to reconstruct high-quality
   images leading to significantly high radiation doses and long scan
   times. To utilize this imaging technique further for in vivo imaging, we
   need to design reconstruction algorithms that reduce the radiation dose
   and scan time without reduction of reconstructed image quality. This
   research is focused on using a combination of gradient-based
   Douglas-Rachford splitting and discrete wavelet packet shrinkage image
   denoising methods to design an algorithm for reconstruction of
   large-scale reduced-view synchrotron Micro-CT images with acceptable
   quality metrics. These quality metrics are computed by comparing the
   reconstructed images with a high-dose reference image reconstructed from
   1800 equally spaced projections spanning 180 degrees. Visual and
   quantitative-based performance assessment of a synthetic head phantom
   and a femoral cortical bone sample imaged in the biomedical imaging and
   therapy bending magnet beamline at the Canadian Light Source
   demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is superior to the existing
   reconstruction algorithms. Using the proposed reconstruction algorithm
   to reduce the number of projections in synchrotron Micro-CT is an
   effective way to reduce the overall radiation dose and scan time which
   improves in vivo imaging protocols. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present D flip-flop, Quatro, and stacked Quarto
   flip-flop designs fabricated in a commercial 28-nm CMOS FDSOI
   technology. Stacked-transistor structures are introduced in the stacked
   Quatro design to protect the sensitive devices of the original
   structure. Striking either of the stacked devices will not upset the
   latch because the conduction path to the supply rail is still cut off by
   the other off-state device. The irradiation experimental results
   substantiate that the stacked Quatro design has significantly better SEU
   tolerance (e.g., higher heavy ion upset Linear Energy Transfer threshold
   and smaller cross-section data) than the reference designs. It
   introduces power and area penalties because the proposed design
   duplicates and stacks two sensitive PMOS devices. Additionally, the
   impact of technology scaling on Quatro in various technology nodes
   (130-nm, 65-nm, and 40-nm) has been studied suggesting decreasing upset
   threshold and decreasing cross-section data.}},

Abstract = {{Gradient-drift (collisionless Simon-Hoh) instability is a robust
   instability often considered to be important for Hall plasma discharges
   supported by the electron current due to the E x B drift. Most of the
   previous studies of this mode were based on the local approximation.
   Here, we consider the nonlocal model which takes into account the
   electron inertia as well as the effects of the entire profiles of plasma
   parameters such as the electric, magnetic fields, and plasma density.
   Contrary to local models, nonlocal analysis predicts multiple unstable
   modes, which exist in the regions, where local instability criteria are
   not satisfied. This is especially pronounced for the long wavelength
   modes which provide larger contribution to the anomalous transport.

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of using non-radioactive barium as
   a bone tracer for detection with synchrotron spectral K-edge subtraction
   (SKES) technique.
   Methods: Male rats of 1-month old (i. e., developing skeleton) and
   8-month old (i. e., skeletally mature) were orally dosed with low dose
   of barium chloride (33 mg/kg/day Ba2+) for 4 weeks. The fore and hind
   limbs were dissected for imaging in projection and computed tomography
   modes at 100 lm and 52 lm pixel sizes. The SKES method utilizes a single
   bent Laue monochromator to prepare a 550 eV energy spectrum to encompass
   the K-edge of barium (37.441 keV), for collecting both `above' and
   `below' the K-edge data sets in a single scan.
   Results: The SKES has a very good focal size, thus limits the
   `crossover' and motion artifacts. In juvenile rats, barium was mostly
   incorporated in the areas of high bone turnover such as at the growth
   plate and the trabecular surfaces, but also in the cortical bone as the
   animals were growing at the time of tracer administration. However, the
   adults incorporated approximately half the concentration and mainly in
   the areas where bone remodeling was predominant and occasionally in the
   periosteal and endosteal layers of the diaphyseal cortical bone.
   Conclusions: The presented methodology is simple to implement and
   provides both structural and functional information, after labeling with
   barium, on bone micro-architecture and thus has great potential for in
   vivo imaging of pre-clinical animal models of musculoskeletal diseases
   to better understand their mechanisms and to evaluate the efficacy of
   pharmaceuticals. (C) 2016 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica.

Title = {{C-DEVA: Detection, evaluation, visualization and annotation of clusters
   from biological networks}},
Journal = {{BIOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{78-86}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{With the progress of studies and researches on the biological networks,
   plenty of excellent clustering algorithms have been proposed.
   Nevertheless, not only different algorithms but also the same algorithms
   with different characteristics result in different performances on the
   same biological networks. Therefore, it might be difficult for
   researchers to choose an appropriate clustering algorithm to use for a
   specific network.
   Here we present C-DEVA, a comprehensive platform for Detecting clusters
   from biological networks and its Evaluation, Visualization and
   Annotation analysis. Ten clustering methods are provided in C-DEVA,
   covering different types of clustering algorithms, with a discrepancy in
   principle of each type. For the identified complexes, there are over ten
   popular and traditional bio-statistical measurements to assess them. And
   multi-source biological information has been integrated in C-DEVA, such
   as biology-functional annotations, and gold standard complex sets, which
   are collected from latest datasets in major databases or related papers.
   Furthermore, visualization analyses are available throughout the whole
   workflow, which endows C-DEVA with good usability and simple
   manipulation. To assure extensibility, development interfaces are
   offered in C-DEVA, for integrating new clustering as well as evaluating
   methods. Additionally, operations to the network as for example network
   randomization are also supported. C-DEVA provides a complete tool for
   identifying clusters from biological networks. Multiple options are
   offered during the analysis process, including detection methods,
   evaluation metrics and visualization modules. In addition, researchers
   could customize C-DEVA for the workflow according to the properties of
   their networks, and find the most ideal results.

Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{221-234}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study presents a technoeconomic analysis of commercial extraction
   of camelina oil as an aviation fuel feedstock. An engineering economic
   model was designed in Superpro Designer (R) to quantify capital
   investment, scale, production cost, and profitability for a
   120,000-1,500,000 tonnes annum(-1) solvent extraction plant. The
   corresponding estimated capital investment was \$24.7 - \$155 million.
   Feedstock cost (\$0.29-0.40 kg(-1)), seed yield (1400-2100 kg ha(-1)),
   oil content (38-47\%), scale, and camelina meal revenue are key factors
   in the break-even selling price (BESP) and competitiveness of camelina
   oil as a feedstock. Feedstock represented 81-90\% of operating cost. The
   BESP ranges from \$0.43 -\$1.22 L-1. Larger plants have lower BESP
   compared to smaller plants which require higher breakeven prices. This
   suggests better economies of scale associated with higher plant scale.
   Camelina can be introduced into underutilized summerfallow land of
   semiarid Canadian Prairies of Saskatchewan. Swift Current is an ideal
   extraction plant location. These results can guide R\&D and investment
   decisions for advancing camelina as an industrial feedstock within the
   innovation value chain. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study is focused on identifying the candidature of timothy grass as
   an energy crop for hydrogen-rich syngas production through supercritical
   water gasification. Timothy grass was gasified in supercritical water to
   investigate the impacts of temperature (450-650 degrees C),
   biomass-to-water ratio (1:4 and 1:8) and reaction time (15-45 min) in
   the pressure range of 23-25 MPa. The impacts of carbonate catalysts
   (e.g., Na2CO3 and K2CO3) and hydroxide catalysts (e.g., NaOH and KOH) at
   variable mass fractions (1-3\%) were examined to maximize hydrogen
   yields. In the non-catalytic gasification of timothy grass, highest
   hydrogen (5.15 mol kg(-1)) and total gas yields (17.2 mol kg(-1)) with
   greater carbon gasification efficiency (33\%) and lower heating value
   (2.21 MJ m(-3)) of the gas products were obtained at 650 degrees C with
   1:8 biomass-to-water ratio for 45 min. However, KOH at 3\% mass fraction
   maximized hydrogen and total gas yields up to 8.91 and 30.6 mol kg(-1),
   respectively. Nevertheless, NaOH demonstrated highest carbon
   gasification efficiency (613\%) and enhanced lower heating value of the
   gas products (4.68 MJ m(-3)). Timothy grass biochars were characterized
   through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and
   scanning electron microscopy to understand the behavior of the feedstock
   to rising temperature and reaction time. The overall findings suggest
   that timothy grass is a promising feedstock for hydrogen production via
   supercritical water gasification. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Aim: Cardiac tissue engineering aims to develop engineered constructs
   for myocardial infarction repair, where a challenge is the control of
   growth factor (GF) sequential release. Herein, bilayer polymeric
   nanoparticles composed of a GF-encapsulating core surrounded by
   rate-regulating shell were developed for sequential GF release.
   Materials \& methods: Single and bilayer polymeric nanoparticles were
   fabricated, characterized and biologically assessed. A novel
   `Geno-Neural model' was developed and validated for rate-programming of
   the nanoparticles. Results: The bilayer nanoparticles featured low burst
   effect and time-delayed release, and allowed for sequential release of
   PDGF following co-release of VEGFand bFGF, which promoted angiogenesis.
   Conclusion: The nanoparticulate delivery system, along with the
   Geno-Neural model, offers great potential for spatiotemporal control of
   GF release for cardiovascular regenerative medicine.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Vanadium oxides (VOx) have been widely studied as ``smart materials{''}
   because of their capability of going through a reversible
   metal-insulator-transition. They are of considerable technological
   interests for applications in optoelectronics, ultrafast optical
   switches, electrochomic devices, and lithium microbatteries. However,
   vanadium-oxygen system is complicated due to the multivalency of
   vanadium, which makes preparation of VOx with single stoichiometry
   difficult. Therefore, structural characterization of vanadium oxides of
   different stoichiometriesis highly desirable and would provide helpful
   guideline to both materials preparation and their structural
   characterization. In the present work, VOx thin films with different
   stoichiometries under various bonding states were successfully prepared
   by reactive sputtering with and without post oxidation or reduction and
   characterized using Raman spectroscopy. Characteristic Raman spectra of
   single and multi-valence states of VOx including V2O3, VO2, V6O13, and
   V2O5 are presented and discussed. The results have demonstrated that
   high purity VOx thin films with single stoichiometry can be obtained
   under well controlled conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The residual shear strength of Cretaceous Lea Park Formation shale near
   Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, was evaluated to determine its suitability
   for road construction. Exposure of these shales results in oxidation,
   leaching, and other geochemical changes, which may affect the
   physicochemical forces that control the shear strength behaviour. A
   laboratory geotechnical testing program was complemented with
   geochemical testing and modelling. In situ pore-water chemistry and
   cation-exchange site composition were determined from soil-water
   extracts using an equilibrium geochemical model. It was found that
   leaching by low ionic strength recharge removes dissolved and adsorbed
   sodium from surficial deposits. Sulfur oxidation overprinted the effects
   of leaching by releasing acidity and sulfate, increasing stored gypsum,
   and increasing dissolved and adsorbed magnesium. Shear testing indicated
   higher apparent residual friction angles for surficial samples with
   lower exchangeable sodium; however, this relationship is obfuscated by
   the impact of increased sand contents on increased strength. Samples at
   depth exhibited lower apparent residual friction angles with higher clay
   fractions and greater exchangeable sodium. Fully assessing the long-term
   stability of the material would require further laboratory testing, and
   a theoretical basis to link the geochemical model results to the
   calculation of physicochemical forces in multi-ion, multi-mineral
   systems. Qualitatively, it can be concluded that near-surface oxidized
   and leached shales have greater shear strength, with less risk of this
   strength changing as a result of post-construction weathering.}},

Abstract = {{Unique multicenter bonding in boron -rich materials leads to the
   formation of complex structures and intriguing properties. Here global
   structural searches are performed to unearth the structure of beryllium
   hexaboride (BeB6) synthesized decades ago. Three BeB6 phases (alpha,beta
   and gamma) were predicted to be stable at ambient and high pressures.
   The ground state at ambient pressure, alpha-BeB6, consists of a strong
   and uniformly distributed covalent B-B network, which results in
   exceptional elastic properties and a hardness of 46 GPa comparable to
   gamma-B. Even more surprisingly, alpha-BeB6 retains credible electron
   phonon coupling in the boron sublattice, and is predicted to be
   superconducting at 9 K. Above 4 GPa, beta-BeB6 is stabilized with
   alternating boron slabs and triangular beryllium layers analogous to the
   structure of MgB2. The beta-BeB6 is predicted to be superconducting at
   24 K, similar to Nb-3(AI,Ge). The gamma-BeB6 is stable above 340 GPa.
   The understanding of intrinsic multicenter-bonding mechanism and related
   properties demonstrated in the very example of BeB6 provides new
   insights for the design of tunable multifunctional materials.}},

Abstract = {{Catalysts containing Ni and/or Co supported by Mg-Al were prepared using
   impregnation and co-precipitation methods. They were firstly evaluated
   for hydrogen production via supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of
   lignin. The effects of preparation method, active metal, and catalyst
   loading were studied. The identified best catalyst was then evaluated
   using other biomass including cellulose, wheat straw, timothy grass, and
   canola meal. The results reveal that Ni-Co combination is better than
   either Ni or Co as active metals to achieve optimum hydrogen yield.
   Also, co-precipitation method is better than impregnation method for the
   catalyst preparation. The coprecipitated CopCat-Ni2Co4 catalyst showed
   highest hydrogen yield from SCWG of lignin and showed decent hydrogen
   yield from various biomass feedstocks. The maximum hydrogen yield of
   3.94 mmol/g was observed with SCWG of canola meal using the
   CopCat-Ni2Co4 catalyst. The results suggest that CopCatNi(2)-Co-4/Mg-Al
   catalyst is a flexible and capable catalyst for hydrogen production from
   the SCWG of biomass.

Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{435-446}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the Alberta oil sands, sand containing less than 8\% petroleum
   hydrocarbon (PHC) is referred to as lean oil sand (LOS) and is used as
   subsoil in reclamation. The objective of this study was to determine how
   bulk density and PHC concentration affect the hydraulic properties of
   LOS. The LOS was packed in soil cores at varying bulk densities and PHC
   concentrations, representing the range in these parameters that occur in
   the reclamation setting. The cores were placed on a tension table and
   pressure plates to measure water retention. The constant head method was
   used to measure the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-S) of the LOS.
   Results show that increasing PHC concentration reduced the water
   retention of LOS due to the presence of PHCs in soil micropores. PHC
   concentration also had a significant effect on the van Genuchten curve
   fitting parameters for the water retention curve, although the shape of
   the curves remained similar regardless of PHC content. Furthermore,
   there is a significant reduction in K-S at the high bulk density and
   high PHC concentrations (3.25\%-7.48\%), compared with low PHC
   concentrations (0\%-1.63\%). Due to the reduced K-S with increased PHCs
   and bulk density, LOS used as the base material in reclamation will
   reduce percolation and increase water storage in the reclamation soil
   cover.}},

Title = {{Improving Performance of a Switched Inertance Buck Converter Via
   Positioning of Reservoir Flow Valve}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A typical switched inertance buck converter includes digital valves
   controlling the flow of fluid to the load from the pressure supply and
   also from the reservoir. These valves are typically located at the same
   position, often packaged in the form of a single three-way valve, but
   also sometimes in the form of a two-way high-pressure supply valve and
   check valve from tank. This results in the situation where attempts to
   increase flow boosting performance by exploiting reflected pressure
   waves to draw additional fluid from tank will also tend to draw
   additional fluid through the valve from the high-pressure supply,
   causing increased energy loss at the valve. This paper presents a
   strategy that avoids this tradeoff by locating the tank flow valve along
   the length of the inertance tube such that the timing of pressure waves
   arriving at the tank valve can be optimized separately from those
   arriving at the high-pressure supply valve. A simulation study is
   presented, in which valve placement and inertance tube resonance are
   optimized for flow gain or energy efficiency, with results in both cases
   better than a conventional system with colocated valves. Two strategies
   for avoiding cavitation are also presented.}},

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{399-408}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Porous cellulose spheres (PCS) were fabricated by precipitating the
   spheres from a cellulose ionic liquid solution, followed by freezing,
   solvent exchange, and drying. PCS had low crystallinity and a large
   surface area that facilitated modification with trisodium
   trimetaphosphate (STMP) to introduce phosphate ester groups into the
   porous structure of the heterogeneous system. The STMP-modified PCS
   (SPCS) were used to remove heavy metal ions from aqueous solution. With
   increasing STMP dosage, the adsorption capacity of SPCS obviously
   improved due to chelation between Pb2+ and phosphate ester groups. The
   Idnetic adsorption and isotherm data matched the pseudo-second order
   model and the Langmuir model well. The maximum adsorption capacity
   reached 150.6 mg g(-1) for SPCS. SPCS were competitive with other
   absorbents because the phosphate ester groups and porous structure
   contributed to Pb2+ adsorption. Moreover, SPCS can be regenerated with
   ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA) solution for
   repetitious adsorption of Pb2+. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{Desiccant wheels are capable of recovering a considerable amount of
   moisture difference between two air streams. This study is aimed at
   determining the latent effectiveness of a rotary desiccant wheel through
   small-scale, transient testing. A coating of mesoporous silica gel
   particles (55 pm particle size pore width 77.5 angstrom) was deposited
   on an aluminum substrate. The physical properties (particle size, pore
   width, surface area, and surface functional groups) of the silica gel
   were characterized and its sorption properties were investigated by
   nitrogen gas adsorption at 77 K. In addition, the equilibrium condition
   and the kinetics of water vapor sorption on the silica gel sample were
   studied at 23 degrees C. A test facility was developed to obtain the
   exchanger transient response during the dehumidification process and the
   data was used to determine the latent effectiveness of a regenerator
   constructed with the silica gel coated aluminum. Moreover, the latent
   effectiveness was determined using a cyclic test with both
   dehumidification and regeneration cycles. Good agreement was observed
   between the latent effectiveness values obtained through the single
   dehumidification and cyclic tests. A correlation from the literature was
   used to calculate the latent effectiveness of the silica gel coated
   regenerator. Comparison between the latent effectiveness determined by
   transient test data and the correlation showed good agreement when
   Ntu(m) < 4.3 and omega > 4 rpm. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Liquid electrolytes play an important role in commercial lithium-ion
   (Li-ion) batteries as a conduit for Li-ion transfer between anodes and
   cathodes. It is generally believed that the Li-ions move along with the
   salt ions; thus, Li-ion diffusion is only affected by the viscosity and
   salt concentration in the liquid electrolytes based on the
   Stokes-Einstein equation. In this study, a novel and faster Li-ion
   diffusion mechanism in electrolytes containing a cyanogen group is
   identified from first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations.
   In this mechanism, the Li-ions are first detached from the Li-salt and
   then diffuse along with the solvent molecules, and the Li-ion diffusion
   does not obey the traditional StokesEinstein equation. The ionic
   conductivity of the electrolyte systems with this solvent-assisted
   Li-ion diffusion mechanism is further enhanced through Li-ion hopping.
   This novel Li-ion diffusion process explains recent findings of high
   Li-ion conductivity in electrolytes with cyanogen groups and furnishes a
   new paradigm for the design of fast-charging liquid electrolyte for
   Li-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{The equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is known to be an
   important source of interannual variability in the middle-and
   high-latitude stratosphere. The influence of the QBO on the
   stratospheric polar vortex in particular has been extensively studied.
   However, the impact of the QBO on the winds of the midlatitude
   mesosphere is much less clear. We have applied 13 years (2002-2014) of
   data from the Saskatoon Super Dual Auroral Radar Network HF radar to
   show that there is a strong QBO signature in the midlatitude mesospheric
   zonal winds during the late winter months. We find that the Saskatoon
   mesospheric winds are related to the winds of the equatorial QBO at 50
   hPa such that the westerly mesospheric winds strengthen when QBO is
   easterly, and vice versa. We also consider the situation in the late
   winter Saskatoon stratosphere using the European Centre for Medium-Range
   Weather Forecasts ERA-Interim reanalysis data set. We find that the
   Saskatoon stratospheric winds between 7 hPa and 70 hPa weaken when the
   equatorial QBO at 50 hPa is easterly, and vice versa. We speculate that
   gravity wave filtering from the QBO-modulated stratospheric winds and
   subsequent opposite momentum deposition in the mesosphere plays a major
   role in the appearance of the QBO signature in the late winter Saskatoon
   mesospheric winds, thereby coupling the equatorial stratosphere and the
   midlatitude mesosphere.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{571}},
Pages = {{643-657}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and persulfate are the most efficient and
   commonly used oxidants in in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) of organic
   contaminants. This review focuses on the principle and activation
   techniques used in H2O2 and persulfate based ISCO processes. It is
   crucial to understand the effect of activation techniques on process
   chemistry and free radicals behaviour in order to achieve high
   degradation efficiency. The chemistry of interaction of activated H2O2
   and persulfate with organic contaminants is complex and many parameters
   influence the performance of ISCO processes, namely non-productive
   reactants, reaction intermediates, oxygen and pH. The poor understanding
   of interaction behaviour and reaction chemistry of oxidants with organic
   contaminants prevents the utilization of full potential of the process.
   Therefore, particular attention has been given to the factors affecting
   degradation efficiency and the performance of ISCO processes. Further,
   the mechanism of contaminant degradation using activated H2O2 and
   persulfate significantly differ from each other. The interaction of SO4
   center dot(-) radical usually involves electron transfer reactions
   whereas HO center dot radical involve electron-transfer and hydrogen
   atom abstraction reactions. Moreover, the research gaps have been
   identified based on the knowledge of current research and
   recommendations are made for further understanding of ISCO processes.

Abstract = {{This study evaluated costs and profitability associated with small scale
   camelina oil extraction plant in the Canadian Prairies for the purpose
   of selling camelina oil for further biodiesel production. In this case,
   Camelina sativa is targeted for production on underutilized summerfallow
   land to avoid displacement of crop lands. Saskatchewan soil zone 7A has
   the capacity to provide camelina for oil extraction based on small scale
   capacities of 30,000-120,000 t annum(-1) and capital investment of
   \$10-24 million. Oil production price is reduced with increased camelina
   oil content, field yield, plant scale, and camelina meal price. Oil
   production costs range from \$0.39 to \$1.88 L-1 when camelina meal has
   a market value of \$0.30 kg(-1). These results provide an informative
   basis for investment decisions by farmers and investors vis-a-vis the
   advancement of farm-adoption of camelina as a dedicated industrial crop,
   as well as the development of an integrated camelina-to-processing

Abstract = {{Gold nanoclusters have attracted intense interests due to their unique
   applications as catalysts. The properties of the gold clusters can often
   be extended through alloying with other metals, by virtue of adding new
   degrees of freedom and increasing the versatility of bonding. Here, we
   reported a new series of bimetallic clusters AunAln (n = 110) determined
   from the density functional calculations. Particle swarm global minimum
   searches, coupled with density functional optimization, were used to
   identify low-lying structures of the AunAln clusters and the crystalline
   phase, in addition to the experimentally known AuAl and Au2Al2
   structures. Significantly enhanced binding energies were calculated in
   stable AunAln clusters compared with their pure Au or Al counterparts as
   a result of polarized AuAl interactions. The polarization is due to a
   high electron affinity of gold induced by strong relativistic and shell
   structure effects. In addition, an Au2Al2 unit was identified as the
   common motif for lowest-energy structures from Au2Al2 to Au10Al10, and
   up to the crystalline phase. This information serves to the
   understanding of new clusters formation and their growth mechanism to
   the corresponding bulk phase. The present results welcome experimental
   studies of the predicted clusters which may lead to the discovery of
   novel properties in this microscopic form of matter, bridging between
   free atoms and the bulk matter.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by the diverse properties of hydrogen (a) sulfide, iron
   sulfide, and iron hydrides, we combine first-principles calculations
   with structure prediction to find stable structures of Fe-S-H ternary
   compounds with various FexSyHz (x = 1-2; y = 1-2; z = 1-6) compositions
   under high pressure with the aim of finding novel functional materials.
   It is found that Fe2SH3 composition stabilizes into an orthorhombic
   structure with Cmc2(l) symmetry, whose remarkable feature is that it
   contains dumbbell type Fe with an Fe-Fe distance of 2.435 angstrom at
   100 GPa, and S and H atoms directly bond with the Fe atoms exhibiting
   ionic bonding. The high density of states at the Fermi level, mainly
   coming from the contribution of Fe-3d, indicates that it satisfies the
   Stoner ferromagnetic condition. Notably, its ferromagnetic ordering
   gradually decreases with increasing pressure, and eventually collapses
   at a pressure of 173 GPa. As a consequence, magnetic and nonmagnetic
   transition can be achieved by controlling the pressure. In addition,
   there is a very weak electron-phonon coupling in Cmc2(l)-structured
   Fe2SH3. The different superconducting mechanisms between Fe2SH3 and H3S
   were compared and analyzed.}},

Title = {{Searching for hidden-charm baryonium signals in QCD sum rules}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{We give an explicit QCD sum rule investigation for hidden-charm
   baryonium states with the quark content u (u) over bard (d) over barc
   (c) over bar, spin J = 0/1/2/3, and of both positive and negative
   parities. We systematically construct the relevant local hidden-charm
   baryonium interpolating currents, which can actually couple to various
   structures, including hidden-charm baryonium states, charmonium states
   plus two pions, and hidden-charm tetraquark states plus one pion, etc.
   We do not know which structure these currents couple to at the
   beginning, but after sum rule analyses we can obtain some information.
   We find some of them can couple to hidden-charm baryonium states, using
   which we evaluate the masses of the lowest-lying hidden-charm baryonium
   states with quantum numbers J(P) = 2(-)/3(-)/0(+)/1(+)/2(+) to be around
   5.0 GeV. We suggest to search for hidden-charm baryonium states,
   especially the one of J = 3(-), in the D-wave J/psi pi pi and P-wave
   J/psi rho and J/psi omega channels in this energy region.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the spatial distribution of snow is crucial to predict and
   assess its water resource potential and understand land-atmosphere
   interactions. High-resolution remote sensing of snow depth has been
   limited to terrestrial and airborne laser scanning and more recently
   with application of structure from motion (SfM) techniques to airborne
   (manned and unmanned) imagery. In this study, photography from a small
   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to generate digital surface
   models (DSMs) and orthomosaics for snow cover at a cultivated
   agricultural Canadian prairie and a sparsely vegetated Rocky Mountain
   alpine ridgetop site using SfM. The accuracy and repeatability of this
   method to quantify snow depth, changes in depth and its spatial
   variability was assessed for different terrain types over time. Root
   mean square errors in snow depth estimation from differencing
   snow-covered and non-snow-covered DSMs were 8.8 cm for a short prairie
   grain stubble surface, 13.7 cm for a tall prairie grain stubble surface
   and 8.5 cm for an alpine mountain surface. This technique provided
   useful information on maximum snow accumulation and snow-covered area
   depletion at all sites, while temporal changes in snow depth could also
   be quantified at the alpine site due to the deeper snowpack and
   consequent higher signal-to-noise ratio. The application of SfM to UAV
   photographs returns meaningful information in areas with mean snow depth
   >30 cm, but the direct observation of snow depth depletion of shallow
   snowpacks with this method is not feasible. Accuracy varied with surface
   characteristics, sunlight and wind speed during the flight, with the
   most consistent performance found for wind speeds < 10 m s(-1), clear
   skies, high sun angles and surfaces with negligible vegetation cover.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a systematic approach to coordinately design
   probabilistically-robust wide-area power system stabilizers (WPSSs) for
   suppressing inter-area oscillations of power systems incorporating wind
   power. Specifically, the operating point of the system varies
   stochastically due to wind power integration and each operating point
   corresponds to a wind power generation scenario in the steady state.
   Thus, the WPSSs tuned by solving a delicately formulated optimization
   problem can maximize the occurrence probability of scenarios where the
   inter-area modes possess the acceptable damping ratios, and strictly
   constrain their unfavorable impacts. Multiple contingencies are also
   directly considered. In addition, several advanced techniques are
   tactfully employed for accurate and efficient evaluation of occurrence
   probability (objective function) during the optimization so as to ensure
   the proposed tuning method can deal with the highly nonlinear
   relationships between the system eigenvalues and the steady-state power
   outputs of wind farms; a customized differential evolution algorithm is
   proposed as well to efficiently solve the formulated optimization
   problem. Simulations and comparisons conducted on two classic test
   systems with proper modifications show the effectiveness and efficiency
   of the proposed control design method.}},

Title = {{System State Estimation Considering EV Penetration With Unknown Behavior

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{4605-4615}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The growing population of electric vehicles (EVs) is resulting in the
   aggregate stochastic charging demand which puts additional pressure on
   the peak load. Therefore, the importance of having an accurate system
   state estimation (SSE) arises as some EV user behavior is unknown. In
   this paper, a new approach is proposed for forecasting EV charging load
   with both predictable and unknown user behaviors. The forecast charging
   load is then integrated with predictable base power load (load without
   EVs) and converted into system state forecast. An effective SSE
   algorithm based on quasi-Newton (QN) method is proposed to obtain a
   faster, more accurate and yet more reliable state estimation under
   potential forecast and measurement errors. The efficiency of the
   proposed approach is assessed with IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus systems using
   actual travel survey statistics and base load records. Finally, the
   estimation accuracy and computation time required are compared with
   weighted least square (WLS) method and extended Kalman filter (EKF)
   method. It is shown that the proposed QN method has the best performance
   under most scenarios.}},

Title = {{An Analytic Model for Fault Diagnosis in Power Systems Utilizing
   Redundancy and Temporal Information of Alarm Messages}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{4877-4886}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In modern transmission systems, duplicated protections are widely
   employed to enhance reliability, and global positioning system (GPS)
   substation clocks are set up to deliver a higher degree of
   synchronization. Thus, redundant alarms tagged with synchronized
   timestamps would be received during a fault. Both redundancy and
   timestamps of alarms consist of rich and useful information. Given this
   background, an effort is made to develop a novel analytic model for
   power system fault diagnosis so as to well utilize redundancy and
   temporal information of alarms. An alarm preprocessing procedure is
   proposed to preserve such properties without impairing diagnosis
   accuracy and efficiency. A new fault hypothesis is established to
   systematically take account of malfunctions of protective devices,
   missing and distorted alarm messages, and timestamp errors in the
   proposed model. An objective function is developed for fault diagnosis,
   and could accommodate various protection schemes and bus configurations.
   Based on the presented fault diagnosis method, a software package is
   developed. Several fault scenarios occurred in an actual power system in
   China are served for demonstrating the correctness and efficiency of the
   developed software package.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure and adhesion of diamond-like carbon (DLC) thin films
   on Ti6Al4V substrates were investigated using direct ion beam deposition
   with ion energy varying from 65 eV to 90 eV. The samples prepared were
   characterized by Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron near-edge X-ray
   absorption fine structure spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
   and X-ray diffraction. Indentation testing by Vickers hardness tester
   was used for adhesion evaluation. The results show that the adhesion of
   DLC thin films on Ti6Al4V substrates mainly depends on ion energy used
   in the deposition process. Higher ion energy results in higher sp(3)
   concentration in DLC thin films, which firstly increases then decreases
   the adhesion of DLC on Ti6Al4V substrate depending on the sp(3)
   fractions and ion energy of 70 eV provides the highest adhesion on both
   the bare and diamond nanopartide coated Ti6Al4V. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Absolute and relative mortalities of red flour beetle (Tribolium
   castaneum) infesting the rapeseeds of a small (196.3 cm(3)) and a large
   (1766 cm(3)) volumes during radio frequency (RF) heating (1.5 kW, 27.12
   MHz) were determined at different end temperatures (30-80 degrees C) and
   initial seed moisture contents (5\%, 7\%, 9\%, and 11\% wet basis).
   100\% absolute and relative mortalities of the adult insects were
   achieved at 80 degrees C for the small volume of the seeds at all
   moisture contents (MCs) and at 60 degrees C and 9\% and 11\% MCs, and 70
   degrees C and 5\% and 7\% MCs for the large volume. Over 80\% and 96\%
   of the absolute and the relative mortalities of the adult insects were
   achieved at over 60 degrees C for both volumes of the seeds. 100\%
   mortalities of larvae infesting the small and the large volume seeds
   were achieved at 55 degrees C at all MCs. Germination, major and minor
   axes, roundness, colour of the seeds and qualities of the rapeseed oil
   were not affected significantly by RF treatment temperature at entire
   MCs. Therefore, a complete mortality of the red flour beetle infesting
   the rapeseeds with acceptable thermal degradation to qualities of the
   seeds could be achieved at under 60 degrees C by the RF treatment with a
   proper design of RF.disinfestation. (C) 2016 IAgrE. Published by

Abstract = {{In this study, we used thermo-mechanical control process (TMCP)
   technique to investigate the effect of arisen dislocation density and
   texture components on hydrogen induced cracking susceptibility in
   as-received API X60 pipeline steel. Dislocations and texture components
   appeared during cold rolling and annealing treatments. X-ray diffraction
   and electron backscatter diffraction measurements were used to study
   these phenomena. We observed that the cold rolling and annealing
   treatments produced higher dislocation density in deformed and recovered
   regions. The increase of dislocation density also caused the increased
   hydrogen trap density. Macro-texture studies by x-ray method indicates
   that initial weak texture of as-received X60 steel was changed from
   -fiber to -fiber and -fiber in 90\% cold rolled and annealed specimen.
   Therefore, the number of grains with < 100 >||ND orientation which had a
   harmful effect on hydrogen induced cracking susceptibility increased.
   The \{100\} dominant texture and high density of hydrogen traps
   mitigated against any possible benefits of the other microstructural
   parameters such as coincidence site lattice boundaries and grain size.
   As a result, we could not consider this process as a suitable method to
   increase hydrogen induced cracking resistance in pipeline steel.}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Essential proteins are indispensable for the survival of a living
   organism and play important roles in the emerging field of synthetic
   biology. Many computational methods have been proposed to identify
   essential proteins by using the topological features of interactome
   networks. However, most of these methods ignored intrinsic biological
   meaning of proteins. Researches show that essentiality is tied not only
   to the protein or gene itself, but also to the molecular modules to
   which that protein belongs. The results of this study reveal the
   modularity of essential proteins. On the other hand, essential proteins
   are more evolutionarily conserved than nonessential proteins and
   frequently bind each other. That is to say, conservatism is another
   important feature of essential proteins. Multiple networks are
   constructed by integrating protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks,
   time course gene expression data and protein domain information. Based
   on these networks, a new essential protein identification method is
   proposed based on a combination of modularity and conservatism of
   proteins. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms
   other essential protein identification methods in terms of a number
   essential protein out of top ranked candidates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Rare-earth doped phosphors have been used in many applications including
   radiation measurements. In the latter applications, the radiation
   photons are converted to light so that we can indirectly detect the
   radiation using a conventional photodetector. In this work, we have
   prepared and characterized a Ce-doped SiO2 glass for dosimeter
   applications. Unlike conventional techniques such as sol-gel synthesis,
   the sample was prepared by spark plasma sintering. Although the PL
   emission seems to be only from the Ce3+ ions in the structure, due to
   the X-ray induced luminescence, we have also observed
   optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL), and thermally-stimulated
   luminescence (TSL), owing to a pair of silylenes and a set of
   dioxasilirane and silylene in addition to Ce3+. We have measured the
   detector response vs irradiation dose for both the OSL and TSL. The
   detector response in both cases is linear over the dose range from at
   least 1 mGy to 2 Gy. Particularly, the sensitivity of TSL is so high
   that it should be considered to be a good candidate for practical
   applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to determine the briquetting characteristics of biomass in a
   commercial setting, a hydraulic briquetter was used to study the
   compaction behavior of biomass grinds from barley, oat, canola and wheat
   straw. The selected straw samples were ground with a hammer mill using
   screen sizes of 19.05, 25.40 and 31.75 mm and conditioned to three
   moisture content levels of 0.09, 0.12 and 0.15 (w.b.). The residence
   time was about 6-10 min before being extruded from the briquetter. The
   specific energy, throughput, as well as the density, and durability of
   manufactured briquettes were measured during or after briquetting. The
   applied compression pressure at different parameter combinations ranged
   from 7 to 14 MPa. Higher pressure resulted at higher biomass moisture
   content. Hammer mill grinding of biomass with a large screen size (31.75
   mm) resulted in high energy consumption and low throughput during
   briquetting. The increase in moisture content decreased the total energy
   consumption and increased the throughput of the briquetter. Briquette
   densities were of consistently higher value when biomass samples were
   compressed at a lower moisture level. The moisture content and hammer
   mill screen size indirectly influenced the briquette densities by
   affecting the pressure and residence time in commercial briquette
   production. Briquettes were successfully formed without adding a binder.

Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{301}},
Pages = {{1159-1171}},

Abstract = {{When spouting binary mixtures of fine and coarse particles, poor mixing
   and particle segregation are often observed under certain operating
   conditions. The underlying mechanism of particle segregation is
   considered to be related to inter-particle and intra-particle friction
   stresses. In this work, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations
   with a multi fluid model (MFM) were employed to investigate the particle
   mixing and segregation in spouted beds with binary mixtures. Results
   show that when particle segregation occurs, coarse particles tend to
   circulate in the outer ring while fine particles are circulating in the
   inner circle. The mixing and segregation in the spouted bed of binary
   mixtures is greatly influenced by the particle density of coarse
   particles. This effect is more profound than that of the particle size
   of coarse particles used. The extent of particle segregation is found to
   decrease by increasing the spouting velocity. From the simulation
   results, particle segregation in a spouted bed of binary mixtures is
   observed in a region where there is a significant difference in the
   gas-solid drags of different particles. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The present study reports microstructural characteristics of two grades
   of steels, stainless steel (SS 304) and carbon steel welded using
   tungsten inert gas (TIG) and activated flux-TIG (A-TIG) processes.
   Activated fluxes such as TiO2, ZnO and MnO2 are effective for A-TIG
   welding of dissimilar weld between carbon steel to stainless steel.
   Mechanical properties, joint efficiency of A-TIG welds are found to be
   higher than normal TIG Welds. This study attempts to establish a
   correlation between observed mechanical behavior (hardness and strength)
   and the microstructural characteristics of the weld samples. Significant
   differences in microstructures are recorded in terms of grain size,
   local misorientation, grain and phase boundary characteristics in
   distinct regions of the welded samples. The microstructural observations
   exhibit: (1) the presence of Widmanstatten ferrite structure at the heat
   affected zone of the carbon steel part in the A-TIG welded specimen and
   (2) differences in structure at the interface of stainless steel and
   weld metal region under the two conditions of welding. These structures
   are morphologically different and shows differences in the number
   fraction of 45A degrees < 114 > phase boundary orientation relationship.
   The microstructure also displays significant heterogeneity in grain size
   and grain misorientation.}},

Abstract = {{We study the mass spectra of hidden-charm pentaquarks having spin J =
   1/2/3/2/5/2 and quark contents uudc (c) over bar. We systematically
   construct all the relevant local hidden-charm pentaquark currents, and
   we select some of them to perform QCD sum rule analyses. We find that
   the P-c(4380) and P-c(4450) can be identified as hidden-charm pentaquark
   states composed of an anti-charmed meson and a charmed baryon. Besides
   them, we also find (a) the lowest-lying hidden-charm pentaquark state of
   J(P) = 1/2(-) has the mass 4.33(-0.13)(+0.17) GeV, while the one of J(P)
   = 1/2(+) is significantly higher, that is, around 4.7-4.9GeV; (b) the
   lowest-lying hidden-charm pentaquark state of J(P) = 3/2(-) has the mass
   4.37(-0.13)(+0.18) GeV, consistent with the P-c(4380) of J(P) = 3/2(-),

Abstract = {{Transition metals (TM) such as palladium (Pd) and copper (Cu) atom were
   introduced on defect-free graphene and graphene with a single vacancy
   (SV) defect, to investigate their potential hydrogen storage using first
   principles calculation. All calculations were performed using plane wave
   based density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO
   (QE). Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange-correlation
   function as described by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) was used. The
   interaction between the valence electron and the ionic core was
   represented by ultrasoft pseudopotentials. In this study, the structure
   and geometry of complex hydrides were investigated, and the effect of a
   SV defect in graphene on hydrogen storage was explored. It was concluded
   that the introduction of a SV defect prevents the TM atom clustering and
   enables hydrogen molecule adsorption within the ideal usable range. (C)

Abstract = {{We have developed a Pd-graphene nano composite for hydrogen storage. The
   spherically shaped Pd nanoparticles of 5-45 nm in size are homogeneously

   has favorable features like desirable hydrogen storage capacity, ambient
   conditions of hydrogen uptake, and low temperature of hydrogen release.
   At a hydrogen charging pressure of 50 bar, the material could yield a
   gravimetric density of 6.7 wt \% in the 1\% Pd/graphene nanocomposite.
   As we increased the applied pressure to 60 bar, the hydrogen uptake
   capacity reached 8.67 wt \% in the 1\% Pd/graphene nanocomposite and
   7.16 wt \% in the 5\% Pd/graphene nanocomposite. This system allows

   charge density difference maps revealed qualitative features on the

Abstract = {{Structural polymorphism in dense carbon dioxide (CO2) has attracted
   significant attention in high-pressure physics and chemistry for the
   past two decades. Here, we have performed high-pressure experiments and
   first-principles theoretical calculations to investigate the stability,
   structure, and dynamical properties of dense CO2. We found evidence that
   CO2-V with the 4-coordinated extended structure can be quenched to
   ambient pressure below 200 K-the melting temperature of CO2-I. CO2-V is
   a fully coordinated structure formed from a molecular solid at high
   pressure and recovered at ambient pressure. Apart from confirming the
   metastability of CO2-V (I-42d) at ambient pressure at low temperature,
   results of ab initio molecular dynamics and metadynamics (MD)
   simulations provided insights into the transformation processes and
   structural relationship from the molecular to the extended phases. In
   addition, the simulation also predicted a phase V'(Pna2(1)) in the
   stability region of CO2-V with a diffraction pattern similar to that
   previously assigned to the CO2-V (P2(1)2(1)2(1)) structure. Both CO2-V
   and -V' are predicted to be recoverable and hard with a Vicker hardness
   of similar to 20 GPa. Significantly, MD simulations found that the CO2
   in phase IV exhibits large-amplitude bending motions at finite
   temperatures and high pressures. This finding helps to explain the
   discrepancy between earlier predicted static structures and experiments.
   MD simulations clearly indicate temperature effects are critical to
   understanding the high-pressure behaviors of dense CO2
   structures-highlighting the significance of chemical kinetics associated
   with the transformations.}},

Abstract = {{Hitachi-GE developed a 300-MWe-class modular simplified and medium small
   reactor (DMS) between 2000 and 2004. It was designed to have merits over
   traditional nuclear power plants in areas of lower initial capital
   investment, flexibility, enhanced safety, and security. The balance of
   plant (BOP) system of the DMS was originally designed for supplying just
   electricity. In this study, the cogeneration DMS that supplies both
   electricity and heat is under investigation. The heat exchanger (HX)
   network, mainly consisting of the BOP heat exchanger, water pump, and
   the heat exchangers that deliver heat to the thermal utilization (TU)
   applications, must operate in an efficient way to keep the overall
   system costs low. In this paper, the configuration of a heat exchanger
   network that serves for various TU applications is investigated first. A
   numerical model for the heat exchanger network is built, and sensitivity
   studies are performed to estimate the energy efficiency and exergy
   efficiency of the whole heat exchanger network under different design
   and operating conditions (e.g., different water temperatures and flow
   rates). Important design and operating parameters, which significantly
   impact the performance of the network, are evaluated and presented.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothetical spinel carbon nitride (gamma-C3N4) has received a large
   amount of attention due to its predicted hardness being comparable to
   that of diamond. The group 14 spinel binary nitrides that have been
   synthesized are limited so far to: gamma-Si3N4, gamma-Ge3N4 and
   gamma-Sn3N4. However, there still remains significant interest in
   gamma-C3N4 in the hope that it will eventually be synthesized, but there
   are no successful reports, thus making the study of gamma-C3N4 strictly
   theoretical. Through an empirical relationship that correlates hardness,
   crystal structure and the electronic band gap, we examine a series of
   group 14 spinel nitrides: gamma-C3N4 gamma-Si3N4, gamma-Ge3N4 and
   gamma-Sn3N4, as well as their ternary compounds. The hardness and
   electronic band gap of these materials are calculated using ab initio
   density functional theory. These results show that in the case of the
   solid solutions, gamma-(Si, Ge)(3)N-4 and gamma-(Ge, Sn)(3)N-4, the
   tetrahedral site is filled first by the larger cation, Ge and Sn,
   respectively. Furthermore, the deviation of carbon containing group 14
   spinel nitrides from the expected hardness and bandgap trend suggests
   that gamma-Si3N4 may remain the hardest known group 14 spinel nitride.
   Additionally, an improved method to calculate the hardness using the
   nitrogen bonding tetrahedron provides more unambiguous results and the
   trend of the hardness agrees with experimental measurements. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In the present study, optimization of biodiesel production from mixture
   of edible and nonedible vegetable oils with low to high free fatty acid
   (FFA) has been investigated. The selection of oils was based on richness
   of particular fatty acid in it. The combination of oils has been
   optimized to get suitable mixture for production of biodiesel. The
   mixture was analyzed in terms of physical properties and accordingly two
   step esterification process was applied. For optimization study, the
   response surface methodology (RSM) based central composite design (CCD)
   was used in Design of Experiments (DOE) software to optimize the various
   process variables such as reaction time, methanol to oil molar ratio,
   reaction temperature and catalyst concentration for biodiesel
   production. A quadratic model was created for the prediction of the
   Biodiesel yield. The R-2 value of the model was 0.96 which indicates the
   satisfactory accuracy of the model. The optimum conditions were obtained
   as follows: reaction temperature of 43.50 degrees C, methanol to oil
   molar ratio of 8.8:1, catalyst concentration of 1.9 g/100 cc feed,
   reaction time of 58.4 min. At these reaction conditions, the predicted
   and observed biodiesel yield was 97.02\% and 97.00\%, respectively.
   These values experimentally satisfied the accuracy of the model. GC and
   FTIR analysis of biodiesel was also done for biodiesel characterization.

Abstract = {{Coherent E region echoes were observed during the 17 March 2015 storm at
   midlatitudes by multistatic wide field of view radars operating in
   northern Germany. Two of the stations operated in a monostatic
   configuration, while one link was set in bistatic mode. Interferometry
   made it feasible to locate the targets. While the radars were built to
   measure mesospheric winds from specular meteor echoes, the storm was so
   intense that it allowed them to observe auroral E region echoes for more
   than 4 h. All stations detected numerous examples of narrow spectra with
   slow (approximate to 180 m/s) and fast (up to 1600 m/s) Doppler
   velocities. The target speeds were much faster than the Doppler
   velocities for the slow narrow echoes (more than 800 m/s versus 180 m/s)
   but comparable to the observed Doppler shift for the 1500 m/s narrow
   fast types. The narrow types came from localized horizontal structures
   50 to 80 km wide in range. The fast narrow types came from the upper
   part of the altitudes associated with Farley-Buneman waves. The slow
   narrow structures were typically from altitudes lower than 100 km.
   Unexpectedly, the great majority of the echoes associated with more
   ordinary ion acoustic turbulence had a positive Doppler shift and came
   from the east. A companion paper uses these new observations to
   reevaluate the origin of the narrow echoes and of the asymmetry in the
   counts. Irrespective of the generation mechanisms, our observations
   indicate that a combination of unusually large electric field and strong
   precipitation is needed to produce the unusual echoes.}},

Abstract = {{Stimulated by recent observations described in a companion paper, we
   have revisited existing theories of the Farley-Buneman instability
   throughout the altitude range 90 to 125 km. We have assumed that the
   irregularities detected by radars at a given altitude are dominated by
   structures moving at the threshold speed in a direction associated with
   maximum linear growth rate conditions. We included recent nonisothermal
   electron and ion theories, which can modify threshold speeds by
   considerable amounts. We included altitude-dependent models of ion and
   electron temperature and of the ion motion in the phase velocity
   calculations. Our treatment of the instability explains why some spectra
   are slow (Doppler shifts typically 200 m/s) and narrow, while others are
   fast (1500 m/s or close to the E x B) and narrow. These narrow spectra
   have all the characteristics of what has been labeled as ``Type III{''}
   and ``Type IV{''} in the past. Our calculations also offer an
   explanation for the observation of a strong asymmetry in the number of
   events with positive Doppler shifts near the nominal ion-acoustic speed
   and those with negative Doppler shifts of the same magnitude.}},

Title = {{Tool wear in disk milling grooving of titanium alloy}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The work efficiency of grooving machining can be improved by the
   approach of disk milling. However, the problem of tool wear was serious
   because of big milling force and high milling temperature in manufacture
   process, by which the tool life and the machined surface quality were
   influenced. In this study, disk-milling grooving experiments of titanium
   alloy were designed and conducted. First, milling force and milling
   temperature were examined, which provided theory basis to tool wear.
   Then, the tool life, wear patterns, and its corresponding mechanisms
   were investigated in detail through scanning electron microscope
   observation, X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometer, and automatic tool
   analyzer. By analyzing experimental results, it was found that, for an
   example of five-stage compressor blisk of a certain type aircraft
   engine, disk cutter can only remove about 50 tunnels' volume after five
   times grinding before wear-out failure, the tool life still needs to be
   greatly enhanced. The damage morphologies were delamination, thermal
   fatigue crack, plastic deformation, and tipping. Wear mechanisms were
   the synergistic interaction among adhesion wear, oxidation wear, and
   diffusion wear. Thermal crack and tipping were easily found for the
   cutting edges around the keyway. The oxidation degree of major cutting
   edge was higher than minor cutting edge; rake face was severe compared
   to flank face. The element W easily diffused into the titanium alloy,
   the diffusion ability of Co and C were weaker than W, and the element Ti
   was dead in diffusion process.}},

Abstract = {{In tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), there are several different
   fragmentation techniques possible, including, collision-induced
   dissociation (CID) higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD),
   electron-capture dissociation (ECD), and electron transfer dissociation
   (ETD). When using pairs of spectra for de novo peptide sequencing, the
   most popular methods are designed for CID (or HCD) and ECD (or ETD)
   spectra because of the complementarity between them. Less attention has
   been paid to the use of CID and HCD spectra pairs. In this study, a new
   de novo peptide sequencing method is proposed for these spectra pairs.
   This method includes a CID and HCD spectra merging criterion and a
   parent mass correction step, along with improvements to our previously
   proposed algorithm for sequencing merged spectra. Three pairs of
   spectral datasets were used to investigate and compare the performance
   of the proposed method with other existing methods designed for single
   spectrum (HCD or CID) sequencing. Experimental results showed that
   full-length peptide sequencing accuracy was increased significantly by
   using spectra pairs in the proposed method, with the highest accuracy
   reaching 81.31\%.}},

Title = {{The stable isotopes of site wide waters at an oil sands mine in northern

Abstract = {{Oil sands mines have large disturbance footprints and contain a range of
   new landforms constructed from mine waste such as shale overburden and
   the byproducts of bitumen extraction such as sand and fluid fine
   tailings. Each of these landforms are a potential source of water and
   chemical release to adjacent surface and groundwater, and consequently,
   the development of methods to track water migration through these
   landforms is of importance.
   The stable isotopes of water (i.e. H-2 and O-18) have been widely used
   in hydrology and hydrogeology to characterize surface water/groundwater
   interactions but have not been extensively applied in mining
   applications, or specifically to oil sands mining in northern Alberta. A
   prerequisite for applying these techniques is the establishment of a
   Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) to characterize precipitation at the
   mine sites as well as the development of a `catalogue' of the stable
   water isotope signatures of various mine site waters.
   This study was undertaken at the Mildred Lake Mine Site, owned and
   operated by Syncrude Canada Ltd. The LMWL developed from 2 years
   (2009/2012) of sample collection is shown to be consistent with other
   LMWLs in western Canada. The results of the study highlight the unique
   stable water isotope signatures associated with hydraulically placed
   tailings (sand or fluid fine tailings) and overburden shale dumps
   relative to natural surface water and groundwater. The signature
   associated with the snow melt water on reclaimed landscapes was found to
   be similar to ground water recharge in the region. The isotopic
   composition of the shale overburden deposits are also distinct and
   consistent with observations made by other researchers in western Canada
   on undisturbed shales. The process water associated with the fine and
   coarse tailings streams has highly enriched 2H and 180 signatures. These
   signatures are developed through the non-equilibrium fractionation of
   imported fresh river water during evaporation from cooling towers used
   within the raw water process circuit. This highly fractionated surface
   water eventually becomes part of the recycled tailings water circuit,
   and as a consequence it undergoes further non equilibrium fractionation
   as a result of surface evaporation, leading to additional enrichment
   along local evaporation lines. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{There is growing recognition of the role of micro-architecture in
   osteoporotic bone loss and fragility. This trend has been driven by
   advances in imaging technology, which have enabled a transition from
   measures of mass to micro-architecture. Imaging trabecular bone has been
   a key research focus, but advances in resolution have also enabled the
   detection of cortical bone micro-architecture, particularly the network
   of vascular canals, commonly referred to as `cortical porosity.' This
   review aims to provide an overview of what this level of porosity is,
   why it is important, and how it can be characterized by imaging. Moving
   beyond a `trabeculocentric' view of bone loss holds the potential to
   improve diagnosis and monitoring of interventions. Furthermore, cortical
   porosity is intimately linked to the remodeling process, which underpins
   bone loss, and thus a larger potential exists to improve our fundamental
   understanding of bone health through imaging of both humans and animal
   models.}},

Title = {{A Simple Parameter Estimation Approach to Modeling of Photovoltaic
   Modules Based on Datasheet Values}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a simple parameter estimation approach for a
   photovoltaic (PV) module using a single-diode five-parameter electrical
   model. The proposed approach only uses the information from manufacturer
   datasheet without requiring a specific experimental procedure or a curve
   extractor. The number of parameters to be determined is first reduced
   from five to two by gaining insight into electrical equations of the
   model at the standard test conditions (STCs). A nonlinear least square
   (NLS) objective function is then constructed and minimized by a complete
   scan for all possible values of the two parameters within some specific
   ranges based on their physical meaning. Consequently, the single-diode
   five-parameter electrical model at the STC is determined based on two
   optimal parameter values. Besides, a PV full characteristic model with
   consideration of both the irradiance and temperature dependencies is
   also constructed by using the data at the nominal operating cell
   temperature (NOCT) test conditions. The proposed approach is easy to
   implement and free of the convergence problem. The evaluations on
   several PV modules show that the proposed approach is capable of
   extracting accurate estimates of the model parameters.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first results of our search for transiting exoplanet
   candidates as part of the Kourovka Planet Search (KPS) project. The
   primary objective of the project is to search for new hot Jupiters which
   transit their host stars, mainly in the Galactic plane, in the R-c
   magnitude range of 11-14 mag. Our observations were performed with the
   telescope of the MASTER robotic network, installed at the Kourovka
   astronomical observatory of the Ural Federal University (Russia), and
   the Rowe-Ackermann Schmidt Astrograph, installed at the private Acton
   Sky Portal Observatory (USA). As test observations, we observed three
   celestial fields of size 2 x 2 deg(2) during the period from 2012 to
   2015. As a result, we discovered four transiting exoplanet candidates
   among the 39 000 stars of the input catalogue. In this paper, we provide
   the description of the project and analyse additional photometric,
   spectral, and speckle interferometric observations of the discovered
   transiting exoplanet candidates. Three of the four transiting exoplanet
   candidates are most likely astrophysical false positives, while the
   nature of the fourth (most promising) candidate remains to be
   ascertained. Also, we propose an alternative observing strategy that
   could increase the project's exoplanet haul.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A two-fluid model in the Eulerian-Eulerian framework has been
   implemented for the prediction of gas volume fraction, mean phasic
   velocities, and the liquid phase turbulence properties for gas-liquid
   upward flow in a vertical pipe. The governing two-fluid transport
   equations are discretized using the finite volume method and a low
   Reynolds number k-epsilon model is used to predict the turbulence field
   for the continuous liquid phase. In the present analysis, a fully
   developed one-dimensional flow is considered where the gas volume
   fraction profile is predicted using the radial force balance for the
   bubble phase. The current study investigates: (1) the turbulence
   modulation terms which represent the effect of bubbles on the liquid
   phase turbulence in the k-epsilon transport equations; (2) the role of
   the bubble induced turbulent viscosity compared to turbulence generated
   by shear; and (3) the effect of bubble size on the radial forces which
   results in either a center-peak or a wall-peak in the gas volume
   fraction profiles. The results obtained from the current simulation are
   generally in good agreement with the experimental data, and somewhat
   improved over the predictions of some previous numerical studies. (C)

Title = {{The energy absorption behavior of hybrid composite laminates containing
   nano-fillers under ballistic impact}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{11-22}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid composite laminates consisting of woven Kevlar fiber fabric,
   epoxy and AA 5086-H32 aluminum sheets were produced and the effects of
   addition of micro and nano-fillers to the fiber on ballistic response of
   the hybrid laminates were investigated. The micro and nano-fillers used
   in this study are powders of aluminum, gamma alumina, silicon carbide,
   colloidal silica and potato flour. They were introduced into the Kevlar
   fabrics by mixing with polyethylene glycol (PEG-400), followed by
   impregnation of the Kevlar fabric with the mixture and drying to
   eliminate the solvent. The energy absorption by the hybrid composite
   laminates containing the various nano-fillers under ballistic impact
   were determined and compared with laminate containing no nano-filler
   impregnation. The ballistic impact resistance of the produced hybrid
   composite laminates was tested according to NATO standards using a
   caliber 270 Winchester rifle. The projectile penetration and the
   resulting perforations of the hybrid laminates were studied in order to
   determine the influence of the deposited nano-fillers on Kevlar fibers
   on their energy absorption and impact resistance. The relationship
   between areal density and energy absorbed are discussed to determine
   which specimens perform better under ballistic impact. Protection levels
   achieved by targets were analyzed in relation to the initial impact
   energy from low caliber weapons. The results indicate that the ballistic
   impact resistance and impact energy absorption of the hybrid composite
   laminates were enhanced by deposition of micro and nano-fillers into
   surface of the Kevlar fibers fabrics. The highest impact energy
   absorption capacity was achieved by deposition of aluminum powder
   followed be colloidal silica and silicon carbide powder in that order.
   Addition of gamma alumina powder and potato flour has produced the least
   effect of enhancing the impact energy absorption capability of the
   laminates. These findings indicate that introduction of micro- and
   nano-fillers coating on Kevlar fabrics using PEG-400 is a promising
   method for strengthening interfacial bonding between the matrix and
   fibers in hybrid composite laminates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Frost formation in air-to-air heat/energy exchangers is a challenging
   problem in regions with very cold weather conditions, when energy
   recovery is most needed. Membrane-based energy exchangers may assist in
   overcoming frosting. In this paper, an experimental facility was
   developed to enable researchers to test air-to-air exchangers under
   frosting conditions. The test setup, sensors and data acquisition
   system, uncertainty bounds for major parameters, and experimental
   procedure are described. Two geometrically identical plate exchangers:
   one with a water vapor permeable membrane (energy exchanger), and one
   with an impermeable plate (heat exchanger) were tested under frosting
   conditions. The first step in frosting experiments is to find a reliable
   and cost-efficient method to detect frosting in the exchangers. Four
   methods were used to determine the onset of frost growth: visual
   inspection, change in the effectiveness (Delta epsilon), change in the
   pressure drop across the exchanger (Delta p), and change in the outlet
   temperature (Delta T). The main contributions of the paper are the
   detailed comparison of these methods and the introduction of a new frost
   detection method based on temperature measurements only (Delta T
   method).
   It is concluded that the Delta p and Delta T methods were more reliable
   and practical than the other methods for both heat and energy
   exchangers. The Delta T method detected frosting sooner and with lower
   uncertainties than the other methods. Furthermore, the Delta T method
   was least affected by the operating conditions. On the other hand, the
   Delta P method gave a better indication of the severity of frosting in
   the exchanger as more frost resulted in a higher pressure drop across
   the exchanger. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The conductive shell in reversed field pinch devices plays an important
   role in controlling plasma and in suppressing MHD instabilities. The
   shell in the Keda torus experiment reversed field pinch (KTX-RFP) device
   includes a 6-mm stainless steel vacuum chamber and a 1.5-mm stabilizing
   copper shell. This stabilizing shell has both poloidal and toroidal gaps
   to allow a coupling of electromagnetic energy to the plasma.
   Nevertheless, any gaps in this shell generate error fields. A 3D
   electromagnetic field model has been used to study effects of the gap on
   the shell. Using off-center current filaments instead of the distributed
   plasma current density, numerical analyses render the induced current
   distribution on the stabilizing shell and the resultant error field
   distribution at a specific frequency. From the analyses and comparisons
   of different configurations for the stabilizing shell, a suitable shell
   design is chosen consisting of three sections: one primary shell, two
   poloidal shield shells, and two toroidal shield shells. Moreover, the
   time evolution of the magnetic field inside and outside the stabilizing
   shell was obtained for this design and the dependence of the magnetic
   field penetration time on mode number and location has been
   investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A newly developed, austenitic lightweight steel, containing a
   low-density element, Al, exhibits tensile elongation up to 50\% as well
   as high ultimate-tensile stress (tensile fracture at 1800 MPa) without
   necking behavior. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis is carried
   out to investigate the orientation dependence of the martensitic
   transformation in tensile testing to 30\% strain at 323 K (25 degrees
   C). A pronounced gamma ->epsilon ->alpha' transformation is observed in
   <111 > and < 110 > parallel to TD (TD: tensile direction) gamma-grains.
   The alpha'-transformation textures is analyzed. Large misorientation
   spreads is seen in the < 100 > parallel to TD gamma-grains.
   Interestingly, twin-assisted martensitic transformation is detected in
   the < 111 > parallel to TD followed by the twin boundary directly moving
   to a gamma/alpha' phase boundary. These phenomena are related to a
   change of Schmid factor for different orientations of grains. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We study the rho pi and b(1)pi decay modes of the 1(-+) light hybrid

   interpolating currents to calculate the partial decay width of the
   b(1)pi decay mode. Comparing the sum rules obtained by using different
   currents, we obtain Gamma(pi(1) -> b(1)pi) =8-23, 32-86 and 52-151 MeV
   for m(1)-+ = 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 GeV respectively, which favor the results
   from the flux tube models and lattice simulations. We also use the

   stability criterion is needed, our results suggest a small partial decay
   width.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying interactions between drug compounds and target proteins is
   an important process in drug discovery. It is time-consuming and
   expensive to determine interactions between drug compounds and target
   proteins with experimental methods. The computational methods provide an
   effective strategy to address this issue. The difficulties of
   drug-target interaction identification include the lack of known
   drug-target association and no experimentally verified negative samples.
   In this work, we present a method, called PUDT, to predict drug-target
   interactions. Instead of treating unknown interactions as negative
   samples, we set it as unlabeled samples. We use three strategies (Random
   walk with restarts, KNN and heat kernel diffusion) to part unlabeled
   samples into two groups: reliable negative samples (RN) and likely
   negative samples (LN) based on target similarity information. Then,
   majority voting method is used to aggregate these strategies to decide
   the final label of unlabeled samples. Finally, weighted support vector
   machine is employed to build a classifier. Four datasets (enzyme, ion
   channel, GPCR and nuclear receptor) are used to evaluate the performance
   of our method. The results demonstrate that the performance of our
   method is comparable or better than recent state-of-the-art approaches.

Title = {{Intercomparison of soil pore water extraction methods for stable isotope
   analysis}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{3434-3449}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Measurements of H-2 and O-18 composition of pore waters in saturated and
   unsaturated soil samples are routinely performed in hydrological
   studies. A variety of in-situ and lab-based pore water extraction
   methods for the analysis of the stable isotopes of water now exist.
   While some have been used for decades (e.g. cryogenic vacuum extraction)
   others are relatively new, such as direct vapour equilibration or the
   microwave extraction technique. Despite their broad range of
   application, a formal and comprehensive intercomparison of soil water
   extraction methods for stable isotope analysis is lacking and long
   overdue. Here we present an intercomparison among five commonly used
   lab-based pore water extraction techniques (high pressure mechanical
   squeezing, centrifugation, direct vapour equilibration, microwave
   extraction, and cryogenic extraction). We applied these extraction
   methods to two physicochemically different soil types that were dried
   and rewetted with water of known isotopic composition at three different
   water contents. Our results showed that the extraction approach can have
   a significant effect on pore water isotopic composition as all methods
   exhibited significant deviations from the spiked reference water,
   depending secondarily on the soil type and soil water content. Most
   pronounced, cryogenic water extraction showed large deviations from the
   spiked reference water, whereas mechanical squeezing and centrifugation
   provided results closest to the spiked water for both soil types. We
   also compared results for each extraction method - where liquid water
   was obtained - on both an OA-ICOS and IRMS. Differences between these
   two analytical instruments were negligible for these organic
   compound-free waters. We suggest that users of soil water extraction
   approaches carefully choose an extraction technique that is suitable for
   the specific research question, adapted to the dominant soil type and
   water content of the study. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Pilot-scale UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process for municipal reuse
   water: Assessing micropollutant degradation and estrogenic impacts on
   goldfish (Carassius auratus L.)}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{157-166}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Low concentrations (ng/L-mu g/L) of emerging micropollutant contaminants
   in municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents affect the possibility
   to reuse these waters. Many of those micropollutants elicit endocrine
   disrupting effects in aquatic organisms resulting in an alteration of
   the endocrine system. A potential candidate for tertiary municipal
   wastewater treatment of these micropollutants is ultraviolet
   (UV)/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an advanced oxidation process (ADP)
   which was currently applied to treat the secondary effluent of the Gold
   Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant (GBWWTP) in Edmonton, AB, Canada. A new
   approach is presented to predict the fluence-based degradation rate
   constants (kappa(f)') of environmentally occurring micropollutants
   including carbamazepine {[}(0.87-1.39) x 10(-3) cm(2)/mJ] and
   2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) {[}(0.60-0.91) x 10(-3) cm(2)/mJ
   for 2,4-D] in a medium pressure (MP) UV/H2O2 system based on a previous
   bench-scale investigation. Rather than using removal rates, this
   approach can be used to estimate the performance of the MP UV/H2O2
   process for degrading trace contaminants of concern found in municipal
   wastewater. In addition to the ability to track contaminant
   removal/degradation, evaluation of the MP UV/H2O2 process was also
   accomplished by identifying critical ecotoxicological endpoints (i.e.,
   estrogenicity) of the treated wastewater. Using quantitative PCR, mRNA
   levels of estrogen-responsive (ER) genes ER alpha 1, ER alpha 2, ER beta
   1, ER beta 2 and NPR as well as two aromatase encoding genes (CYP19a and
   CYP19b) in goldfish (Carassius auratus L.) were measured during exposure
   to the GBWWTP effluent before and after MP UV/H2O2 treatment (a fluence
   of 1000 mJ/cm(2) and 20 mg/L of H2O2) in spring, summer and fall.
   Elevated expression of estrogen-responsive genes in goldfish exposed to
   UV/H2O2 treated effluent (a 7-day exposure) suggested that the UV/H2O2
   process may induce acute estrogenic disruption to goldfish principally
   because of the possible formation of various oxidation by-products.
   However, prolonged exposure of goldfish (60 days) in UV/H2O2 treated
   effluent showed a restoration trend of ER gene expressions, especially
   in the summer. Collectively, our findings provide valuable indications
   regarding the long-term in vivo assessment of the MP UV/H2O2 process for
   removing/degrading endocrine disrupting compounds detected in the
   municipal wastewater effluents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The impact response of three regions (top, mid and center) across the
   thickness of AISI 321 austenitic stainless steel plate at high strain
   rates ( > 6000 s(-1)) Was studied using the split Hopkinson pressure bar
   system. The result shows that texture and stored energy heterogeneity
   across plate thickness influenced the mechanical responses of the
   investigated steel in these regions. Microstructural evaluation using
   high-resolution electron bacicscattered diffraction (HR-EBSD) analysis
   showed that strengthening in AISI 321 steel originates from the
   evolution of strain-induced martensite and formation of nano-carbides in
   addition to plastic deformation by mechanical twinning and slip. This
   resulted in a desirable combination of high strength and good ductility
   (approx. 2000 MPa at 0.42 true strain). Phase transformation, dynamic
   recrystallization and formation of nano-carbides were confirmed within
   the adiabatic shear band (ASB) region. The average dynamic
   recrystallized (DRX) grain size in the shear band region is 0.28 mu m in
   comparison to grain size of 15 gm outside the shear bands. The
   nano-sized grain inside the shear bands is proposed to form by
   rotational dynamic recrystallization. A comparative study of the alloy's
   behavior under dynamic and quasi-static compression shows that the
   stability of austenite is higher at high strain rates and lower at a low
   strain rate. The strength in the dynamically impacted specimen is
   compromised as a result of the suppressed evolution of strain-induced
   martensite and mechanical twin. Martensitic transformation under both
   loading conditions follows the FCC gamma-austenite -> BCC
   alpha-martensite kinetic path and both phases obey the Kurdjumov-Sachs'

Abstract = {{Aluminum powder was ball milled for different durations of time with
   different weight percentages of water-soluble salts (NaCl and KCl). The
   hydrogen generation of each mixture in reaction with hot water was
   measured. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) as well as
   energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to investigate the
   morphology, surfaces and cross sections of the produced particles. The
   results show that the presence of salts in the microstructure of the
   aluminum considerably increases the hydrogen generation rate. At shorter
   milling times, the salt covers the aluminum particles and becomes
   embedded in layers within the aluminum matrix. At higher milling
   durations, salt and aluminum phases form composite particles. A higher
   percentage of the second phase significantly decreases the milling time
   needed for activation of the aluminum particles. Based on the EDS
   results from cross sections of the milled particles, a mechanism for
   improvement of the hydrogen generation rate in the presence of salts is
   suggested. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{In vivo precision of three HR-pQCT-derived finite element models of the
   distal radius and tibia in postmenopausal women}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: The distal radius is the most common osteoporotic fracture
   site occurring in postmenopausal women. Finite element (FE) modeling is
   a non-invasive mathematical technique that can estimate bone strength
   using inputted geometry/micro-architecture and tissue material
   properties from computed tomographic images. Our first objective was to
   define and compare in vivo precision errors for three high-resolution
   peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT, XtremeCT; Scanco)
   based FE models of the distal radius and tibia in postmenopausal women.
   Our second objective was to assess the role of scan interval, scan
   quality, and common region on precision errors of outcomes for each FE
   model.
   Methods: Models included: single-tissue model (STM), cortical-trabecular
   dual-tissue model (DTM), and one scaled model using imaged bone mineral
   density (E-BMD). Using HR-pQCT, we scanned the distal radius and tibia
   of 34 postmenopausal women (74 +/- 7 years), at two time points. Primary
   outcomes included: tissue stiffness, apparent modulus, average von Mises
   stress, and failure load. Precision errors (root-mean-squared
   coefficient of variation, CV\%(RMS)) were calculated. Multivariate ANOVA
   was used to compare the mean of individual CV\% among the 3
   HR-pQCT-based FE models. Spearman correlations were used to characterize
   the associations between precision errors of all FE model outcomes and
   scan/time interval, scan quality, and common region. Significance was
   accepted at P < 0.05.
   Results: At the distal radius, CV\%(RMS) precision errors were < 9 \%
   (Range STM: 2.8-5.3 \%; DTM: 2.9-5.4 \%; E-BMD: 4.4-8.7 \%). At the
   distal tibia, CV\%(RMS) precision errors were < 6 \% (Range STM: 2.7-4.8
   \%; DTM: 2.9-3. 8 \%; E-BMD: 1.8-2.5 \%). At the radius, Spearman
   correlations indicated associations between the common region and
   associated precision errors of the E-BMD-derived apparent modulus (rho =
   -0.392; P < 0.001) and von Mises stress (rho = -0.297; P = 0.007).
   Conclusion: Results suggest that the STM and DTM are more precise for
   modeling apparent modulus, average von Mises stress, and failure load at
   the distal radius. Precision errors were comparable for all three models
   at the distal tibia. Results indicate that the noted differences in
   precision error at the distal radius were associated with the common
   scan region, illustrating the importance of participant repositioning
   within the cast and reference line placement in the scout view during
   the scanning process.}},

Title = {{Distributed estimation in wireless sensor networks with semi-orthogonal
   MAC}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with distributed estimation of a scalar
   parameter using a wireless sensor network (WSN) that employs a large
   number of sensors operating under limited bandwidth resource. A
   semi-orthogonal multiple-access (MA) scheme is proposed to transmit
   observations from K sensors to a fusion center (FC) via N orthogonal
   channels, where K >= N. The K sensors are divided into N groups, where
   the sensors in each group simultaneously transmit on one orthogonal
   channel (and hence the transmitted signals are directly superimposed at
   the FC as opposed to be coherently combined). Under such a
   semi-orthogonal multiple access channel (MAC), performance of the linear
   minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimation is analyzed in terms of
   two indicators: the channel noise suppression capability and the
   observation noise suppression capability. The analysis is performed for
   two versions of the proposed semi-orthogonal MA scheme: fixed sensor
   grouping and adaptive sensor grouping. In particular, the
   semi-orthogonal MAC with fixed sensor grouping is shown to have the same
   channel noise suppression capability and two times the observation noise
   suppression capability when compared to the orthogonal MAC under the
   same bandwidth resource. For the semi-orthogonal MAC with adaptive
   sensor grouping, it is determined that N = 4 is the most favorable
   number of orthogonal channels when taking into account both performance
   and feedback requirement. In particular, the semi-orthogonal MAC with
   adaptive sensor grouping is shown to perform very close to that of the
   hybrid MAC, while requiring only log(2) N = 2 bits of information
   feedback instead of the exact channel phase for each sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Functionalized polymers were synthesized and applied in removing
   nitrogen and sulfur compounds from gas oils. In this work, the
   polyglycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate polymer
   incorporated with tetranitrofluorenone, PGMA-DAP-TENF, was synthesized
   with and without alumina support. Different techniques were used to
   characterize the synthesized polymers including Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method, dynamic light
   scattering, thermogravimetry/differenial thermal analyzer, carbon
   hydrogen nitrogen sulfur elemental analysis, and field emission scanning
   electron microscopy. The performance of the polymer with alumina,
   Al-PGMA-DAP-TENF, was compared to that without alumina using light gas
   oil. In addition, heavy gas oil feed was used to confirm the adsorption
   behavior of both polymers in a higher nitrogen and sulfur environment.
   The effect of adsorption time and temperature was tested using a 1:5, by
   weight, polymer to feed ratio. Results have shown that alumina particles
   enhanced the nitrogen removal efficiency of PGMA-DAP-TENF polymer while
   sulfur removal efficiency was not affected. The nitrogen removal
   efficiency of Al-PGMA-DAP-TENF polymer was more than twice that of
   PGMA-DAP-TENF polymer in LGO feed, and twice that in HGO feed. This was
   due to the higher surface area of Al-PGMA-DAP-TENF polymer, 202 m(2)/g,
   compared to that of PGMA-DAP-TENF polymer, 27 m(2)/g. In addition,
   Al-PGMA-DAP-TENF polymer removed more basic nitrogen compounds than
   PGMA-DAP-TENF polymer. This was attributed to the acidic nature of
   alumina particles that enhance the adsorption of basic nitrogen
   compounds present in gas oil feeds.}},

Abstract = {{Life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the production of nuclear
   power (in g CO(2)e/kWh) are uncertain due partly to a paucity of data on
   emissions from individual phases of the nuclear fuel cycle. Here, we
   present the first comprehensive life cycle assessment of GHG emissions
   produced from the mining and milling of uranium in Canada. The study
   includes data from 2006-2013 for two uranium mine-mill operations in
   northern Saskatchewan (SK) and data from 1995-2010 for a third SK
   mine-mill operation. The mine mill operations were determined to have
   GHG emissions intensities of 81, 64, and 34 kg CO(2)e/kg U3O8 at average
   ore grades of 0.74\%, 1.54\%, and 4.53\% U3O8, respectively. The
   production-weighted average GHG emission intensity is 42 kg CO(2)e/kg
   U3O8 at an average ore grade of 3.81\% U3O8. The production-weighted
   average GHG emission intensity drops to 24 kg CO(2)e/kg U3O8 when the
   local hydroelectric GHG emission factor (7.2 g CO(2)e/kWh) is
   substituted for the SK grid-average electricity GHG emission factor (768
   g CO(2)e/kWh). This results in Canadian uranium mining-milling
   contributing only 1.1 g CO(2)e/kWh to total life cycle GHG emissions
   from the nuclear fuel cycle (0.7 g CO(2)e/kWh using the local
   hydroelectric emission factor).}},

Title = {{Effects of Heat Loss/Gain on the Transient Testing of Heat Wheels}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Heat wheels are used in ventilation systems to provide indoor thermal
   comfort by recovering considerable amount of sensible energy from
   exhaust airstream. The transient single step test is a new testing
   method developed to determine the sensible effectiveness of heat wheels.
   In practice, heat loss/gain may create large uncertainty in the sensible
   effectiveness obtained through the transient testing. In this study, the
   transient analytical model in the literature is extended to account for
   heat loss/gain effects in the transient testing. The results state that
   in particular operating conditions, the sensible effectiveness can be
   affected by more than 10\% due to heat loss/gain. A new testing facility
   is developed to investigate the effects of heat loss/gain on the
   sensible effectiveness through transient testing of a small-scale heat
   exchanger. After decoupling heat loss/gain effects from transient test
   data, less than 2\% difference was observed in the sensible
   effectiveness while supply and exhaust flow rate was small (Re < 209)
   and the temperature difference between them was Delta T-st< 7.0 degrees
   C. However, the sensible effectiveness decreased more than 9\% while
   Delta T-st>37.5 degrees C or Re > 600. An empirical correlation was
   proposed based on the transient test data that correlates the sensible
   effectiveness with the heat capacity rate ratio. Comparing the results
   of proposed correlation with literature, less than 2\% difference was
   observed at the heat capacity rate ratio of greater than 0.5 after the

Abstract = {{Sprout damage in wheat is a serious problem worldwide because damaged
   wheat kernels contain alpha amylase, an enzyme that causes poor baking
   quality of wheat. A two-camera machine vision (MV) with a neural network
   was implemented to quantify alpha-amylase activity in wheat using 16
   visual properties of the kernels. Kernels were separated at image level
   using the marker-controlled segmentation algorithm before the properties
   (color, texture, and shape and size) of dorsal and ventral sides of
   kernels were extracted. Alpha-amylase activity in wheat was assessed
   analytically. The neural networks were trained, validated, and tested
   using the visual properties as the inputs and alpha-amylase activity as
   the output. The trained neural network predicted alpha-amylase activity
   with an accuracy of 6913 U/L (rmse) and R-2 value of 0.72 for the wheat
   samples with alpha-amylase activity ranging over 178 to 28935 (U/L).
   Differences between visual properties of wheat samples calculated from
   the top and the bottom images was less than 0.5\%. Light stability in
   time and influence of temperature on the cameras' color stability were
   less than 2\% of the mean values. The challenges associated with the
   system, and recommendations to improve the system accuracy and
   robustness, and to decrease the system cost are presented. (C) 2016

Title = {{Application of an Analytical Solution as a Screening Tool for Sea Water
   Intrusion}},

Abstract = {{Sea water intrusion into aquifers is problematic in many coastal areas.
   The physics and chemistry of this issue are complex, and sea water
   intrusion remains challenging to quantify. Simple assessment tools like
   analytical models offer advantages of rapid application, but their
   applicability to field situations is unclear. This study examines the
   reliability of a popular sharp-interface analytical approach for
   estimating the extent of sea water in a homogeneous coastal aquifer
   subjected to pumping and regional flow effects and under steady-state
   conditions. The analytical model is tested against observations from
   Canada, the United States, and Australia to assess its utility as an
   initial approximation of sea water extent for the purposes of rapid
   groundwater management decision making. The occurrence of sea water
   intrusion resulting in increased salinity at pumping wells was correctly
   predicted in approximately 60\% of cases. Application of a correction to
   account for dispersion did not markedly improve the results. Failure of
   the analytical model to provide correct predictions can be attributed to
   mismatches between its simplifying assumptions and more complex field
   settings. The best results occurred where the toe of the salt water
   wedge is expected to be the closest to the coast under predevelopment
   conditions. Predictions were the poorest for aquifers where the salt
   water wedge was expected to extend further inland under predevelopment
   conditions and was therefore more dispersive prior to pumping.
   Sharp-interface solutions remain useful tools to screen for the
   vulnerability of coastal aquifers to sea water intrusion, although the
   significant sources of uncertainty identified in this study require
   careful consideration to avoid misinterpreting sharp-interface results.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{7053-7069}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses ways in which the tree-ring-based reconstruction of
   paleohydrology can be better understood and better utilized to support
   water resource management, especially in cold semiarid regions. The
   relationships between tree growth as represented by tree ring
   chronologies (TRCs), runoff (Q), precipitation (P), and
   evapotranspiration (ET) are discussed and analyzed within both
   statistical and hydrological contexts. Data from the Oldman River Basin
   (OMRB), Alberta, Canada, are used to demonstrate the relevant issues.
   Instrumental records of Q and P data were available while actual ET was
   estimated using a lumped conceptual hydrological model developed in this
   study. Correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationships
   between TRCs and each of Q, P, and ET over the entire historical record
   (globally) as well as locally in time within the wet and dry subperiods.
   Global and local correlation strengths and linear relationships appear
   to be substantially different. This outcome particularly affects
   tree-ring-based inferences about the hydrology of wet and dry episodes
   when reconstructions are made using regression models. Important
   findings include (i) reconstruction of paleo-runoff may not be as
   credible as paleo-precipitation and paleo-evapotranspiration; (ii) a
   moving average window of P and ET larger than 1 year might be necessary
   for reconstruction of these variables; and (iii) the long-term mean of
   reconstructed P, Q, and ET leads us to conclude that there is
   uncertainty about the past climate. Finally, we suggest using the
   topographic index to prejudge side suitability for dendrohydrological
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Drug repositioning, which aims to identify new indications
   for existing drugs, offers a promising alternative to reduce the total
   time and cost of traditional drug development. Many computational
   strategies for drug repositioning have been proposed, which are based on
   similarities among drugs and diseases. Current studies typically use
   either only drug-related properties (e.g. chemical structures) or only
   disease-related properties (e.g. phenotypes) to calculate drug or
   disease similarity, respectively, while not taking into account the
   influence of known drug-disease association information on the
   similarity measures.
   Results: In this article, based on the assumption that similar drugs are
   normally associated with similar diseases and vice versa, we propose a
   novel computational method named MBiRW, which utilizes some
   comprehensive similarity measures and Bi-Random walk (BiRW) algorithm to
   identify potential novel indications for a given drug. By integrating
   drug or disease features information with known drug-disease
   associations, the comprehensive similarity measures are firstly
   developed to calculate similarity for drugs and diseases. Then drug
   similarity network and disease similarity network are constructed, and
   they are incorporated into a heterogeneous network with known
   drug-disease interactions. Based on the drug-disease heterogeneous
   network, BiRW algorithm is adopted to predict novel potential
   drug-disease associations. Computational experiment results from various
   datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach has reliable prediction
   performance and outperforms several recent computational drug
   repositioning approaches. Moreover, case studies of five selected drugs
   further confirm the superior performance of our method to discover
   potential indications for drugs practically.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect Tool Condition Monitoring (TCM) methods have shown significant
   potential to automatically detect worn tools without intervention in the
   machining process. This paper presents the development of a
   non-intrusive and online TCM system for large diameter indexable insert
   drills. The TCM system developed used two cutting force-related signals
   of a horizontal boring machine, namely the spindle motor current and the
   axial feed motor current, and features extracted from these signals were
   taken as the inputs to a series of models to predict the tool wear state
   and the hole diameter. A tool replacement strategy based on applying
   limits to the predicted hole diameter was also developed. Adjusting
   these limits allows the strategy to be tuned for either hole accuracy or
   tool life depending on the requirements of a specific application.
   Experiments of drilling of 39.0-mm-diameter holes in 2205 Duplex
   stainless steel in an industrial field were designed and performed with
   the results to illustrate the effectiveness of developed TCM and
   strategies. Specifically, the TCM system ensured that none of over
   tolerance holes would have been drilled, which is critically important
   since any over-tolerance hole can result in the failure of an entire
   finished product of tubesheet; the replacement strategy for tool life
   resulted in a 44 \% increase in tool life and a non-trivial reduction in
   machine down time due to fewer tool changes while holding a hole
   diameter tolerance of +/- 0.1 mm.}},

Title = {{Extension of the Concepts of Heat Capacity Rate Ratio and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The underlying concept of the standard effectiveness-number of transfer
   units (NTU) model is that the effectiveness of an exchanger can be
   correlated to two dimensionless parameters, namely, heat capacity ratio
   (Cr) and NTU. However, a limitation of this model is that it cannot
   account for the changes in effectiveness due to changes in operating
   temperature and humidity of simultaneous heat and moisture exchangers,
   specifically liquid-to-air membrane energy exchangers (LAMEEs). The
   purpose of this paper is to explain the reason for this limitation and
   also to explore the extension of the aforementioned concept of the
   effectiveness-NTU model to LAMEEs. The first contribution of this paper
   is to demonstrate that the reason for this limitation is that one of the
   simplifying assumptions of the standard effectiveness-NTU model, i.e.,
   that Cr represents the ratio between the changes in the temperatures of
   the two fluid streams across an exchanger, is not applicable to LAMEEs.
   Further analysis in this paper yields two new fundamental dimensionless
   parameters that are analogous to Cr, termed effective Cr and effective
   m{*}, which represent the actual ratios between the changes in the
   temperatures and humidity ratios of the fluid streams. Then, it is shown
   that models analogous to the standard effectiveness-NTU model can be
   used to correlate the dependency of the effectiveness of LAMEEs on the
   operating temperature and humidity to effective Cr and effective m{*}.}},

Abstract = {{Accounting for spatial variation of trabecular material anisotropy and
   orientation can improve the accuracy of quantitative computed
   tomography-based finite element (FE) modeling of bone. The objective of
   this study was to investigate the feasibility of quantifying trabecular
   material anisotropy and orientation using clinical computed tomography
   (CT). Forty four cubic volumes of interest were obtained from micro-CT
   images of the human radius. Micro-FE modeling was performed on the
   samples to obtain orthotropic stiffness entries as well as trabecular
   orientation. Simulated computed tomography images (0.32, 0.37, and 0.5
   mm isotropic voxel sizes) were created by resampling micro-CT images
   with added image noise. The gray-level structure tensor was used to
   derive fabric eigenvalues and eigenvectors in simulated CT images. For
   `best case' comparison purposes, Mean Intercept Length was used to
   define fabric from micro-CT images. Regression was used in combination
   with eigenvalues, imaged density and FE to inversely derive the
   constants used in Cowin and Zysset-Curnier fabric-elasticity equations,
   and for comparing image derived fabric-elasticity stiffness entries to
   those obtained using micro-FE. Image derived eigenvectors (which
   indicated trabecular orientation) were then compared to orientation
   derived using micro-FE. When using clinically available voxel sizes,
   gray-level structure tensor derived fabric combined with Cowin's
   equations was able to explain 94-97\% of the variance in orthotropic
   stiffness entries while Zysset-Curnier equations explained 82-88\% of
   the variance in stiffness. Image derived orientation deviated by
   4.4-10.8 degrees from micro-FE derived orientation. Our results indicate

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to elucidate the structure-activity
   relationship of new peptide-modified gemini surfactant-based carriers.
   Glycyl-lysine modified gemini surfactants that differ in the length and
   degree of unsaturation of their alkyl tail were used to engineer DNA
   nano-assemblies. To probe the optimal nitrogen to phosphate (N/P) ratio
   in the presence of helper lipid, in vitro gene expression and cell
   toxicity measurements were carried out. Characterization of the
   nano-assemblies was accomplished by measuring the particle size and
   surface charge. Morphological characteristics and lipid organization
   were studied by small angle X-ray scattering technique. Lipid monolayers
   were studied using a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. The highest activity of
   glycyl-lysine modified gemini surfactants was observed with the
   16-carbon tail compound at 2.5 N/P ratio, showing a 5- to 10-fold
   increase in the level of reporter protein compared to the 12 and 18:1
   carbon tail compounds. This ratio is significantly lower compared to the
   previously studied gemini surfactants with alkyl or amino- spacers. In
   addition, the 16-carbon tail compound exhibited the highest cell
   viability (85\%). This high efficiency is attributed to the lowest
   critical micelle concentration of the 16-tail gemini surfactant and a
   balanced packing of the nanoparticles by mixing a saturated and
   unsaturated lipid together. At the optimal N/P ratio, all nanoparticles
   exhibited an inverted hexagonal lipid assembly. The results show that
   the length and nature of the tail of the gemini surfactants play an
   important role in determining the transgene efficiency of the delivery
   system. We demonstrated here that the interplay between the headgroup
   and the nature of tail is specific to each series, thus in the process
   of rational design, the contribution of the latter should be assessed in
   the appropriate context.}},

Abstract = {{Joint optimization of the physical layer security with end-to-end delay
   management is studied in the uniquely constrained context of wireless
   body area networks (WBANs). A game-theoretic framework is proposed
   wherein body-worn sensor devices interact in the presence of wiretappers
   and under fading channel conditions to find the most secure multi-hop
   path to the hub, while adhering to the end-to-end delay requirements
   imposed by the application. We model the problem as the search for a
   Nash network topology where no unilateral deviation in strategy by any
   single sensor node improves the secrecy of its transmissions, and
   provide a distributed algorithm guaranteed to converge to a
   Pareto-dominant Nash solution. The framework is evaluated through
   numerical simulations in conditions approximating actual deployment of
   WBANs for moving and stationary scenarios. Results validate the merits
   of the proposed framework to improve the security of transmissions
   compared with the star topology and IEEE 802.15.6 two-hop topology
   extension with a best-channel algorithm, at the expense of an admissible

Abstract = {{Purpose: The numerical feasibility of reconstructing MRI signals
   generated by RF coils that produce B-1 fields with a non-linearly
   varying spatial phase is explored.
   Theory: A global linear spatial phase variation of B-1 is difficult to
   produce from current confined to RF coils. Here we use regularized least
   squares inversion, in place of the usual Fourier transform, to
   reconstruct signals generated in B-1 fields with non-linear phase
   variation.
   Methods: RF encoded signals were simulated for three RF coil
   configurations: ideal linear, parallel conductors and, circular coil
   pairs. The simulated signals were reconstructed by Fourier transform and
   by regularized least squares.
   Results: The Fourier reconstruction of simulated RF encoded signals from
   the parallel conductor coil set showed minor distortions over the
   reconstruction of signals from the ideal linear coil set but the Fourier
   reconstruction of signals from the circular coil set produced severe
   geometric distortion. Least squares inversion in all cases produced
   reconstruction errors comparable to the Fourier reconstruction of the
   simulated signal from the ideal linear coil set.
   Conclusion: MRI signals encoded in B-1 fields with non-linearly varying
   spatial phase may be accurately reconstructed using regularized least
   squares thus pointing the way to the use of simple RF coil designs for
   RF encoded MRI. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Essential proteins play an indispensable role in the
   cellular survival and development. There have been a series of
   biological experimental methods for finding essential proteins; however
   they are time-consuming, expensive and inefficient. In order to overcome
   the shortcomings of biological experimental methods, many computational
   methods have been proposed to predict essential proteins. The
   computational methods can be roughly divided into two categories, the
   topology-based methods and the sequence-based ones. The former use the
   topological features of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks while
   the latter use the sequence features of proteins to predict essential
   proteins. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to improve the
   prediction accuracy of the computational methods.
   Results: Comparing with nonessential proteins, essential proteins appear
   more frequently in certain subcellular locations and their evolution
   more conservative. By integrating the information of subcellular
   localization, orthologous proteins and PPI networks, we propose a novel
   essential protein prediction method, named SON, in this study. The
   experimental results on S.cerevisiae data show that the prediction
   accuracy of SON clearly exceeds that of nine competing methods: DC, BC,
   IC, CC, SC, EC, NC, PeC and ION.
   Conclusions: We demonstrate that, by integrating the information of
   subcellular localization, orthologous proteins with PPI networks, the
   accuracy of predicting essential proteins can be improved. Our proposed
   method SON is effective for predicting essential proteins.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{The mechanism of pressure-induced amorphous-to-amorphous transitions
   (AATs) in metallic glasses (MGs) has been a subject of intense research.
   Most AATs in MGs were found in lanthanide-based alloys and shown to
   originate from 4f orbital delocalization. Recently, evidence of an
   unexpected AAT in the main-group Ca-Al MGs was reported without a
   satisfactory explanation. Here, based on the results of first-principles
   molecular dynamics calculations, the suggested AAT at 12-15 GPa in the
   Ca72.7Al27.3 MG is confirmed. Contrary to the common belief that the
   coordinate of metallic glasses with close packing cannot be increased
   further, the coordination around Al atoms is found to increase suddenly
   at the transition as a consequence of atomic migration and the
   aggregation of Al atoms. This transition originates from
   pressure-enhanced bonding between Ca 3d and Al 3p orbitals and is
   confirmed by the good agreement on the predicted and measured electrical
   conductivities. The theoretical analysis not only uncovers a mechanism
   of pressure-induced AAT in main-group MGs, but it can be generalized to
   establish a different perspective to guide the understanding of
   transformation phenomena in compressed MGs.}},

   topological superconducting state can be strongly manifest in the vortex
   core structure and govern the response of the system to vorticity and a
   nonmagnetic impurity where the vortex is pinned. The Majorana zero mode
   in the vortex core is found to be robust against the nonmagnetic
   impurity in that it remains effectively a zero-energy bound state
   regardless of the impurity potential strength and the major chirality.
   The spin polarization of the Majorana bound state depends on the major
   chirality for weak spin-orbit coupling, while it is determined simply by
   the vorticity when spin-orbit coupling is relatively strong.}},

   layered structure}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium chloride (MgCl2) with the rhombohedral layered CdCl2-type
   structure (alpha-MgCl2) has been studied experimentally using
   synchrotron angle-dispersive powder x-ray diffraction and Raman
   spectroscopy using a diamond-anvil cell up to 100 GPa at room
   temperature and theoretically using first-principles density functional
   calculations. The results reveal a pressure-induced second-order
   structural phase transition to a hexagonal layered CdI2-type structure
   (beta-MgCl2) at 0.7 GPa: the stacking sequence of the Cl anions are
   altered resulting in a reduction of the c-axis length. Theoretical
   calculations confirm this phase transition sequence and the calculated
   transition pressure is in excellent agreement with the experiment.
   Lattice dynamics calculations also reproduce the experimental Raman
   spectra measured for the ambient and high-pressure phase. According to
   our experimental results MgCl2 remains in a 2D layered phase up to 100
   GPa and further, the 6-fold coordination of Mg cations is retained.
   Theoretical calculations of relative enthalpy suggest that this
   extensive pressure stability is due to a low enthalpy of the layered
   structure ruling out kinetic barrier effects. This observation is
   unusual, as it contradicts with the general structural behavior of
   highly compressed AB(2) compounds.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a portable hyperspectral goniometer system for
   measurement of hemispherical conical reflectance factor (HCRF) data for
   terrestrial applications, especially in the coastal zone. This system,
   the Goniometer for Portable Hyperspectral Earth Reflectance (GOPHER),
   consists of a computer-controlled Spectra Vista Corporation HR-1024
   full-range spectrometer mounted on a rotating arc and track assembly,
   allowing complete coverage in zenith and azimuth of a full hemisphere
   for recording HCRF. The control software allows customized scan patterns
   to be quickly modified in the field, providing for flexibility in
   recording HCRF and the opposition effect with varying grid sizes and
   scan ranges in both azimuth and zenith directions. The spectrometer
   track can be raised and lowered on a mast to accommodate variations in
   terrain and land cover. To minimize the effect of variations in
   illumination during GOPHER scan cycles, a dual-spectrometer approach has
   been adapted to link records of irradiance recorded by a second
   spectrometer during the GOPHER HCRF scan cycle. Examples of field data
   illustrate the utility of the instrument for coastal studies. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The presence of impurities decreases the economic value of glycerol.
   Thus, glycerol impurities must be greatly reduced if it is to be used as
   a fuel or feedstock for chemicals. A sequential procedure for crude
   glycerol refining that includes saponification, acidification,
   neutralization, membrane filtration, solvent extraction, and activated
   charcoal adsorption was investigated in the present work. Membrane
   filtration was studied at temperature and pressure ranges of 25-60
   degrees C and 50-350 kPa, respectively. A range of ultra-filtration (UF)
   and fine ultra-filtration (UFF) ceramic membranes (molecular weight cut
   off 1, 3, 5, 8, and 15 kDa) were utilized to obtain highly enriched
   glycerol. Membrane filtration at 60 degrees C and 350 kPa using 1 kDa
   membrane, followed by solvent and water evaporation, and activated
   charcoal treatment produced the maximum glycerol content (97.5 wt\%).
   Acid value and free fatty acid (FFA) content of all treated samples were
   found to be <1.1 and <0.6 wt\%, respectively. Crude, enriched crude
   (purified), and ACS grade glycerol were characterized using FTIR and
   bomb calorimeter which further confirmed the glycerol purity. The
   present study shows the potential of this treatment for crude glycerol
   purification. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Conformal complex singlet extension of the Standard Model: scenario for
   dark matter and a second Higgs boson}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{We consider a conformal complex singlet extension of the Standard Model
   with a Higgs portal interaction. The global U(1) symmetry of the complex
   singlet can be either broken or unbroken and we study each scenario. In
   the unbroken case, the global U(1) symmetry protects the complex singlet
   from decaying, leading to an ideal cold dark matter candidate with
   approximately 100 GeV mass along with a significant proportion of
   thermal relic dark matter abundance. In the broken case, we have
   developed a renormalization-scale optimization technique to
   significantly narrow the parameter space and in some situations, provide
   unique predictions for all the model's couplings and masses. We have
   found there exists a second Higgs boson with a mass of approximately 550
   GeV that mixes with the known 125 GeV Higgs with a large mixing angle
   sin theta approximate to 0.47 consistent with current experimental
   limits. The imaginary part of the complex singlet in the broken case
   could provide axion dark matter for a wide range of models. Upon
   including interactions of the complex scalar with an additional
   vector-like fermion, we explore the possibility of a diphoton excess in
   both the unbroken and the broken cases. In the unbroken case, the model
   can provide a natural explanation for diphoton excess if extra terms are
   introduced providing extra contributions to the singlet mass. In the
   broken case, we find a set of coupling solutions that yield a second
   Higgs boson of mass 720 GeV and an 830 GeV extra vector-like fermion F,
   which is able to address the 750 GeV LHC diphoton excess. We also
   provide criteria to determine the symmetry breaking pattern in both the
   Higgs and hidden sectors.}},

Title = {{Measurement of convective heat transfer coefficients in a randomly

Journal = {{APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{361-370}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this research is to determine the convective heat
   transfer coefficient (h(t)) for airflow through two randomly packed beds
   of microporous silica gel particles of nearly uniform diameter (i.e.,
   for the average diameter of 1.60 and 2.58 mm). The experimental test
   facility was developed to induce a transient step change in the inlet
   uniform airflow while the temperature was measured at several locations
   within the silica gel beds (x/L = 0.29, 0.48, 0.69). The transient test
   data were simulated numerically using the volume averaging method for
   air flow through a homogeneous packed bed of particles for a range of
   Reynolds numbers (40 < Re-dh < 100). The convective heat transfer
   coefficient was determined by using the numerical inverse method to
   minimize the difference between the simulated and experimental
   temperature profiles. The sensitivity analysis stated that the
   thermocouple placed at the middle of the test section (x/L = 0.48) had
   the highest sensitivity during the first 400 s of transient testing.
   Using the ht values obtained by the inverse calculations, a good
   agreement is obtained within the experimental uncertainty limits for the
   experimental and numerical temperature temporal profiles at different
   locations within the beds; but the agreement is best using the transient
   temperature data at x/L = 0.48. Based on the ht values, a new
   correlation between Nusselt number and Reynolds number is presented with
   lower uncertainty (the maximum uncertainty of +/- 30\%) compared to the
   correlations in the literatures. It was found that the proposed
   correlation is in agreement with the data in literature within their
   uncertainty bounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Characterization and mechanical property of Trinidad coir fibers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{133}},
Number = {{29}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Coir fibers were retted in distilled water (DW) and saline water (SW)
   for up to 12 weeks. Fibers had diameters of 0.16 mm to 0.56 mm, gauge
   lengths (GL) of 20 mm and 50 mm, and loaded at strain rates of 5, 20,
   40, and 60 mm/min. Tensile strength, Young's modulus, and strain at
   break properties were evaluated and the results statistically analyzed
   using analysis of variance (ANOVA). For non-retted fibers, as the gauge
   length decreased, the tensile and strain at break increased by 14\% and
   42\%, respectively, while the stiffness increased by 33\% for larger
   gauge lengths. As the fiber diameter decreased, the tensile strength
   increased from 48.45 MPa to 134.41 MPa for 50 mm gauge length fibers.

Abstract = {{In this study, two analogous nanometric catalysts consisting of
   carbon-supported cobalt or iron (Co/C and Fe/C) were synthesized by
   plasma and tested for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) in a
   continuously-stirred tank slurry reactor (CSTSR). Being pyrophoric in
   nature, these new materials were reduced in situ at 673 K (400 degrees
   C) for 24 h using pure H-2 gas. The FTS reaction was conducted at 493 K
   (220 degrees C), 2000 kPa pressure, and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV)
   of 3600 mL . g(cat)(-1) . h(-1) for 24 h, using a feed stream of 0.6 L/L
   (60 vol \%) H-2 and 0.3 L/L (30 vol \%) CO, with 0.1 L/L (10 vol \%) Ar
   for mass balance determination. Devoid of promoters and under similar
   reaction conditions, the Co/C catalyst showed higher CO conversion (42
   \%) than the Fe/C (25 \%), benchmarked against the commercial Fe-NanoCat
   1 (32 \%). Co/C was more selective toward gasoline production, while
   Fe/C was more selective toward the diesel fraction. From transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, no significant change in the mean
   particle size (similar to 12 nm) was observed in the plasma-synthesized
   catalysts before and after FTS reaction, implying that the catalysts did
   not sinter. Additionally, there were no internal mass transport
   limitations in these catalysts, making them favourable for FTS. Besides
   metallic species, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated the
   presence of carbides in fresh catalysts (Fe3C in Fe/C and Co3C in Co/C).
   Magnetite (Fe3O4) was the most prevalent phase in the used Fe-NanoCat 1
   sample, a phase that was below the detection limits of XRD in the used
   plasma-synthesized Fe/C sample.}},

Abstract = {{Baseline characteristics of dissolved methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6)
   and their stable isotopes in thick, low hydraulic conductivity,
   Cretaceous shales were determined using high-resolution core profiling
   at four sites in the Williston Basin (WB), Canada. Positive correlations
   with the conservative natural tracer Cl- reflected a lack of measureable
   production or consumption of gases in the shale to the depth
   investigated (150 m below ground, BG) and suggest CH4 and C2H6
   concentrations near the interface with overlying Quaternary sediments
   are controlled by lateral migration and dilution in permeable zones.
   Curvilinear increasing concentrations with depth in the shale at all
   sites coupled with 1-D solute transport modeling suggest long-term (over
   millions of years) upward diffusion of CH4 and C2H6 from deeper WB
   sources, likely the Second White Speckled Shale Formation (SWSS;
   approximate to 790 m BG). C-13-CH4 profiles in the shale are consistent
   with upward diffusional fractionation of isotopes from the SWSS.
   Distinct CH4 and C2H6 isotope values of gases in the shales versus
   C-13-enriched thermogenic isotopic signatures of CH4 and C2H6 in deeper
   oil-producing WB intervals could be used to identify fugitive gases
   originating deeper in the Basin.}},

Abstract = {{The development of in situ vapour sampling methods to measure H-2 and
   O-18 in pore water of deep, unsaturated soil profiles, including mine
   tailings and waste rock, is required to improve our ability to track
   water migration through these deposits. To develop appropriate field
   sampling methods, a laboratory study was first undertaken to evaluate
   potential materials and sampling methods to collect and analyse vapour
   samples from unsaturated mine waste. Field methods were developed based
   on these findings and tested at two mine sites using either on-site
   analyses with a portable isotope laser spectrometer or sample collection
   and storage prior to laboratory analyses. The field sites included a
   series of deep (>50 m) multiport profiles within a coal waste rock dump
   and open wells installed in a sand tailings dyke at an oil sands mine.
   Laboratory results show that memory effects in sample bags and tubing
   require 3-5 pore volumes of vapour flushing prior to sample collection
   and sample storage times are limited to 24 h. Field sampling highlighted
   a number of challenges including the need to correct for sample humidity
   and in situ temperature. Best results were obtained when a portable
   laser spectrometer was used to measure vapour samples in situ.}},

Abstract = {{The snow surface temperature (SST) is essential for estimating longwave
   radiation fluxes from snow. SST can be diagnosed using finescale
   multilayer snow physics models that track changes in snow properties and
   internal energy; however, these models are heavily parameterized, have
   high predictive uncertainty, and require continuous simulation to
   estimate prognostic state variables. Here, a relatively simple model to
   estimate SST that is not reliant on prognostic state variables is
   proposed. The model assumes that the snow surface is poorly connected
   thermally to the underlying snowpack and largely transparent for most of
   the shortwave radiation spectrum, such that a snow surface energy
   balance among only sensible heat, latent heat, longwave radiation, and
   near-infrared radiation is possible and is called the radiative
   psychrometric model (RPM). The RPM SST is sensitive to air temperature,
   humidity, ventilation, and longwave irradiance and is secondarily
   affected by absorption of near-infrared radiation at the snow surface
   that was higher where atmospheric deposition of particulates was more
   likely to be higher. The model was implemented with neutral stability,
   an implicit windless exchange coefficient, and constant shortwave
   absorption factors and aerodynamic roughness lengths. It was evaluated
   against radiative SST measurements from the Canadian Prairies and Rocky
   Mountains, French Alps, and Bolivian Andes. With optimized and global
   shortwave absorption and aerodynamic roughness length parameters, the
   model is shown to accurately predict SST under a wide range of
   conditions, providing superior predictions when compared to air
   temperature, dewpoint, or ice bulb calculation approaches.}},

Title = {{A risk-based framework for water resource management under changing

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{291-306}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Long-term water resource management requires the capacity to evaluate
   alternative management options in the face of various sources of
   uncertainty in the future conditions of water resource systems. This
   study proposes a generic framework for determining the relative change
   in probabilistic characteristics of system performance as a result of
   changing water availability, policy options and irrigation expansion.
   These probabilistic characteristics can be considered to represent the
   risk of failure in the system performance due to the uncertainty in
   future conditions. Quantifying the relative change in the performance
   risk can provide a basis for understanding the effects of multiple
   changing conditions on the system behavior. This framework was applied
   to the water resource system of the Saskatchewan River Basin (SaskRB) in
   Saskatchewan, Canada. A ``bottom-up{''} flow reconstruction algorithm
   was used to generate multiple realizations for water availability within
   a feasible range of change in streamflow characteristics. Consistent
   with observed data and projected change in streamflow characteristics,
   the historical streamflow was perturbed to stochastically generate
   feasible future flow sequences, based on various combinations of
   changing annual flow volume and timing of the annual peak. In addition,
   five alternative policy options, with and without potential irrigation
   expansion, were considered. All configurations of water availability,
   policy decisions and irrigation expansion options were fed into a
   hydro-economic water resource system model to obtain empirical
   probability distributions for system performance - here overall and
   sectorial net benefits - under the considered changes. Results show that
   no one specific policy can provide the optimal option for water resource
   management under all flow conditions. In addition, it was found that the
   joint impacts of changing water availability, policy, and irrigation
   expansion on system performance are complex and resemble nonlinear
   functions of changes in individual drivers. The proposed risk-based
   framework can be linked to any water resource system assessment scheme
   to quantify the risk in system performance under changing conditions,
   with the larger goal of proposing alternative policy options to address
   future uncertainties and management concerns. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) plays an important role in the
   diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases by capturing images of human
   small intestine. Accurate diagnosis of endoscopic images depends heavily
   on the quality of captured images. Along with image and frame rate,
   brightness of the image is an important parameter that influences the
   image quality which leads to the design of an efficient illumination
   system. Such design involves the choice and placement of proper light
   source and its ability to illuminate GI surface with proper brightness.
   Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are normally used as sources where
   modulated pulses are used to control LED's brightness. In practice,
   instances like under-and over-illumination are very common in WCE, where
   the former provides dark images and the later provides bright images
   with high power consumption. In this paper, we propose a low-power and
   efficient illumination system that is based on an automated brightness
   algorithm. The scheme is adaptive in nature, i.e., the brightness level
   is controlled automatically in real-time while the images are being
   captured. The captured images are segmented into four equal regions and
   the brightness level of each region is calculated. Then an adaptive
   sigmoid function is used to find the optimized brightness level and
   accordingly a new value of duty cycle of the modulated pulse is
   generated to capture future images. The algorithm is fully implemented
   in a capsule prototype and tested with endoscopic images. Commercial
   capsules like Pillcam and Mirocam were also used in the experiment. The
   results show that the proposed algorithm works well in controlling the
   brightness level accordingly to the environmental condition, and as a
   result, good quality images are captured with an average of 40\%
   brightness level that saves power consumption of the capsule.}},

Abstract = {{A game-theoretic approach is proposed to investigate the problem of
   relay selection and power control with quality of service constraints in
   multiple-access wireless body area networks (WBANs). Each sensor node
   seeks a strategy that ensures the optimal energy efficiency and, at the
   same time, provides a guaranteed upper bound on the end-to-end packet
   delay and jitter. The existence of Nash equilibrium for the proposed
   non-cooperative game is proved, the Nash power control solution is
   analytically calculated, and a distributed algorithm is provided that
   converges to a Nash relay selection solution. The game theoretic
   analysis is then employed in an IEEE 802.15.6-based WBAN to gauge the
   validity and effectiveness of the proposed framework. Performance
   behaviors in terms of energy efficiency and end-to-end delay and jitter
   are examined for various scenarios. Results demonstrate the merits of
   the proposed framework, particularly for moving WBANs under severe
   fading conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The knowledge of stoichiometries of alkaline earth metal nitrides, where
   nitrogen can exist in polynitrogen forms, is of significant interest for
   understanding nitrogen bonding and its applications in energy storage.
   For calcium nitrides, there were three known crystalline forms, CaN2,
   Ca2N, and Ca3N2, at ambient conditions. In the present study, we
   demonstrated that there are more stable forms of calcium nitrides than
   what is already known to exist at ambient and high pressures. Using a
   global structure searching method, we theoretically explored the phase
   diagram of CaNx and discovered a series of new compounds in this family.
   In particular, we found a new CaN phase that is thermodynamically stable
   at ambient conditions, which may be synthesized using CaN, and Ca2N.
   Four other stoichiometries, namely, Ca2N3, CaN3, CaN4, and CaN5, were
   shown to be stable under high pressure. The predicted CaNx compounds
   contain a rich variety of polynitrogen forms ranging from small
   molecules (N-2, N-4, N-5, and N-6) to extended chains (N-infinity).
   Because of the large energy difference between the single and triple
   nitrogen bonds, dissociation of the CaNx crystals with polynitrogens is
   expected to be highly exothermic, making them as potential
   high-energy-density materials.}},

Abstract = {{The parallelization of scalable elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)
   processors (ECPs) is investigated in this paper. The proposed scalable
   ECPs support all 5 pseudo-random curves or all 5 Koblitz curves
   recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
   without the need to reconfigure the hardware. The proposed ECPs
   parallelize the finite field arithmetic unit and the elliptic curve
   point multiplication (ECPM) algorithm to gain performance improvement.
   The finite field multiplication is separated such that the reduction
   step is executed in parallel with the next polynomial multiplication.
   Subsequently, the finite field arithmetic of the ECPs are further
   parallelized and the performance can be further improved by over 50\%.
   Since the multiplier blocks consume a low number of hardware resources,
   the latency reduction outweighs the cost of the extra multiplier
   resulting in more efficient ECP designs. The technique is applied for
   both pseudo-random curve and Koblitz curve algorithms. A novel ECPM
   algorithm is also proposed for Koblitz curves that take advantage of the
   proposed finite field arithmetic architecture. The implementation
   results show that the proposed parallelized scalable ECPs have better
   performance compared to state-of-the-art scalable ECPs that support the
   same set of elliptic curves. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Radio-photoluminescence (RPL) is a phenomenon seen in luminescent
   materials in which the appearance of new photoluminescence (PL) emission
   is induced by an incident ionizing radiation such as X-rays; and the
   signal is stable even after the irradiation and during the PL
   measurement. Since the induced PL intensity is proportional to the
   irradiation dose, the RPL can be used in radiation measurements. The
   distinct advantage of RPL over the conventional thermally- or
   photo-stimulated luminescence (abbreviated as TSL or PSL) dosimeters is
   the stability of response signal. With an RPL detector, it allows us to
   readout the signal multiple time without signal fading. In this work, we
   discovered that CsBr: Sm showed an RPL phenomenon by X-ray irradiation,
   and we characterized this new material as an RPL detector. While the
   sample showed PL emissions mainly in the visible range, after an X-ray
   irradiation additional emissions could be observed in the red to
   near-infrared range around 650-850 nm and 900-1000 nm and longer. The
   RPL response was fairly stable overall, but very interestingly the
   650-850 nm signal slightly increased while the 900-1000 nm decreased
   during PL readout. The dynamic range was confirmed over 1-10(4) mGy with

Abstract = {{Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an effective clinical method for tumour
   ablation with minimum intrusiveness. However, the use of RFA is mostly
   restricted to small tumours, especially those <3 cm in diameter. This
   paper discusses the state-of-the-art of RFA, drawn from experimental and
   clinical results, for large tumours (i.e. >= 3 cm in diameter). In
   particular, the paper analyses clinical results related to target tissue
   necrosis (TTN) and mathematical modelling of the RFA procedure to
   understand the mechanism whereby the TTN is limited to under 3 cm with
   RFA. This paper also discusses a strategy of controlling of the
   temperature of target tissue in the RFA procedure with the state-of-art
   device, which has the potential to increase the size of TTN. This paper
   ends with a discussion of some future ideas to solve the so-called 3-cm
   problem with RFA. (C) 2016 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica.

Title = {{A New Method for Blocking Third-Zone Distance Relays During Stable Power
   Swings}},

Abstract = {{The improper operation of the third-zone distance protection has been
   attributed as one of the factors for power system blackouts. The
   third-zone protection could incorrectly operate during power-swing
   scenarios. This research proposes a fast and practical methodology using
   local measurements for blocking the third-zone distance relays during
   stable power swings. The proposed scheme is referred to as the BTZ
   scheme. The proposed method calculates the relative speed of a
   fictitious equivalent machine from the local relay measurements. If the
   relative speed goes through a zero crossing, the swing is classified as
   a stable power swing; whereas if the speed does not go through a zero
   value, then the swing is classified as an unstable power swing. The
   benefit of the proposed method is that it analyzes the power swings from
   a system stability point of view, and does not need rigorous offline
   simulation studies to determine the relay settings. The performance of
   the proposed method in this paper is compared with an industry-standard
   method (conventional double blinder method). As is well known, the
   settings of the blinder-based methods are system specific and need
   several simulations to arrive at the blinder values. Transient
   simulation studies on a three-bus system and a modified Western
   Coordination Council 9-bus system are used to test the performance of
   the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigated temperature distribution in a packed -bed of
   canola seeds at various moisture contents (5\%, 7\%, 9\%, and 11\% wet
   weight basis) and bulk volumes (small - 196.3 cm(3), medium - 1766
   cm(3), and large - 6503 cm(3)) during RF heating (1.5 kW, 27.12 MHz).
   The samples were contained in RF-transparent cylindrical and rectangular
   sample holders. The RF exposure time required to reach a specific
   temperature decreased with seed moisture content (MC). The hottest spot
   (80 degrees C) was detected at the geometric center of the small and
   large volume canola seeds, but away from the geometric center and
   towards the edge of the medium volume canola seeds due to the edge
   effect. The temperature uniformity index values indicated that the most
   uniform RF heating was observed in the medium volume canola seeds in
   spite of the edge effect. The highest temperatures occurred between the
   middle and outer regions of the medium volume canola seeds. RF heating
   and thermal imaging were used to obtain temperature profiles for 2\%
   agar gels in small, medium and large holders. The temperature profiles
   for the gels supported the observations made for the canola seeds. (C)

Abstract = {{The ballistic impact behavior of hybrid composite laminates synthesized
   for armor protection was investigated. The hybrid materials, which
   consist of layers of aluminum 5086-H32 alloy, Kevlar (R) 49 fibers
   impregnated with shear thickening fluid (STF) and epoxy resin were
   produced in different configurations using hand lay-up technique. The
   hybrid materials were impacted by projectiles (ammunitions of 150 g
   power-point) fired from a rifle Remington 7600 caliber 270 Winchester to
   strike the target at an average impact velocity and impact energy of 871
   m/s and 3687 J, respectively. The roles of the various components of the
   hybrid materials in resisting projectile penetration were evaluated in
   order to determine their effects on the overall ballistic performance of
   the hybrid laminates. The effects of hybrid material configuration on
   energy dissipation during ballistic impacts were investigated in order
   to determine a configuration with high performance for application as
   protective armor. The energy dissipation capability of the hybrid
   composite targets was compared with the initial impact energy of low
   caliber weapons (according to NATO standards) in order to determinate
   the protection level achieved by the developed hybrid laminates.
   Deformation analysis and penetration behavior of the targets were
   studied in different stages; the initial (on target front faces),
   intermediate (cross-section), and final stages (target rear layers). The
   influence of target thickness on the ballistic impact response of the
   laminates were analyzed. Differences in ballistic behavior were observed
   for samples containing Kevlar (R) impregnated with STF and those
   containing no STF. Finally, mechanisms of failure were investigated
   using scanning electron microscopic examination of the perforations. (C)

Journal = {{BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{214}},
Pages = {{242-247}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The effects and mechanism of ball milling on the torrefaction process
   were studied. Ball- and hammer-milled (screen size 1 mm) pine sawdust
   samples were torrefied at three temperatures (230, 260, and 290 degrees
   C) and two durations (30 and 60 min) to investigate into their
   torrefaction behavior and physicochemical properties. The results showed
   that, under identical torrefaction conditions, torrefied ball-milled
   pine sawdust had a higher carbon content and fixed carbon, and lower
   hydrogen and oxygen contents than torrefied hammer-milled pine sawdust.
   Torrefied ball-milled pine sawdust produced lower mass and energy
   yields, but higher heating values than torrefied hammer-milled pine
   sawdust. Ball milling destroyed the crystalline structure of cellulose
   and thus reduced the thermal stability of hemicellulose, cellulose, and
   lignin, causing them to degrade at relatively lower temperatures. In
   conclusion, bio-mass pretreated with a combination of ball milling and
   torrefaction has the potential to produce an alternative fuel to coal.

Abstract = {{Nano-ceria coating was deposited onto a chromium oxide forming alloy
   through galvanostatic cathodic electro-deposition method in cerium
   nitrate electrolyte. The electrochemical behavior and influence of main

   with increasing of current density while micro-cracks were also observed
   at higher current density. Slightly increasing of crystal size and
   smoothing of surface morphology were seen with increasing of deposition
   time. It was reported that the bath temperature has the most significant
   effect on crystal size and surface morphology of the deposit. Green rust
   as corrosion product was also observed with deposition temperatures
   higher than 35 degrees C. Optimized deposition parameters were used to
   produce homogeneous, continuous and green rust-free coatings which
   enhance the oxidation resistance of alloy 230. The electro-deposition

Abstract = {{Background: Protein complexes play an important role in biological
   processes. Recent developments in experiments have resulted in the
   publication of many high-quality, large-scale protein-protein
   interaction (PPI) datasets, which provide abundant data for
   computational approaches to the prediction of protein complexes.
   However, the precision of protein complex prediction still needs to be
   improved due to the incompletion and noise in PPI networks.
   Results: There exist complex and diverse relationships among proteins
   after integrating multiple sources of biological information.
   Considering that the influences of different types of interactions are
   not the same weight for protein complex prediction, we construct a
   multi-relationship protein interaction network (MPIN) by integrating PPI
   network topology with gene ontology annotation information. Then, we
   design a novel algorithm named MINE (identifying protein complexes based
   on Multi-relationship protein Interaction NEtwork) to predict protein
   complexes with high cohesion and low coupling from MPIN.
   Conclusions: The experiments on yeast data show that MINE outperforms
   the current methods in terms of both accuracy and statistical
   significance.}},

Abstract = {{Nitridophosphates have emerged as advanced materials due to their
   structural variability and broad technical applicability. Their binary
   parent compound P3N5, a polymeric network of corner- and edge-sharing
   PN4 tetrahedra with N and N sites, is a particularly interesting
   example. We present a study of the band gap and electronic structure of
   -P3N5 by using soft X-ray spectroscopy measurements and DFT
   calculations. The band gap, which is crucial for all applications, is
   measured to be 5.87 +/- 0.20eV. This agrees well with the calculated,
   indirect band gap of 5.21eV. The density of states are found to show
   dramatic variation between the nonequivalent N sites and a high degree
   of covalency. Coupled to these results is what is, to our knowledge, the
   largest core hole shift reported to date for a soft X-ray absorption
   spectrum. We propose an intuitive bonding scheme for -P3N5 that explains
   the observed band gap and unique density of states, while providing a
   framework for predicting these properties in known and yet to be
   discovered PN compounds. We briefly consider the implications of these
   results for new low-dimensional P and PN materials, which alongside
   graphene, could become important materials for nanoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{High pressure can fundamentally alter the electronic structure of
   elemental metals, leading to the unexpected formation of intermetallics
   with unusual structural features. In the present study, the phase
   stabilities and structural changes of Na-Fe intermetallics under

   combined with density functional theory calculations. Two intermetallics
   with stoichiometries Na3Fe and Na4Fe are found to be thermodynamically
   stable at pressures above 120 and 155 GPa, respectively. An interesting
   structural feature is that both have form a host guest-like structure
   with Na sublattices constructed from small and large polygons similar to
   the host framework of the self-hosting incommensurate phases observed in
   Group I and II elements. Apart from the one-dimensional (1D) Fe chains
   running through the large channels, more interestingly, electrides are
   found to localize in the small channels between the layers. Electron
   topological analysis shows secondary bonding interactions between the Fe
   atoms and the interstitial electrides help to stabilize these

Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The paper is focused on the characterization of renewable fuel ashes and
   their impact on fouling and slagging during combustion. Biomass (A1) and
   sewage sludge (A2, A3) ashes were investigated for characterization of
   their corrosive properties. The chemical and phasemineral composition of
   ashes were studied using a variety of analytical techniques including
   XRF, ICP-MS, XRD, SEM-EDS, and the ash fusion characteristics by using a
   thermal microscope. The slagging and fouling indices, as well as thermal
   conductivity, were calculated and the sintering properties were
   predicted. The studied ashes had different concentrations of the main
   chemical compounds and mineral phases. The XRF results showed that CaO,
   SiO2, K2O, MgO, P2O5 and Al2O3 are the main compounds of A1 and A3
   ashes, whereas Na2O and SO3 dominated in A2. Consequently, SEM images
   showed surface differences between ash particles. Phase analyses
   indicated the existence of corrosive phases containing potassium and
   sodium K2Ca (CO3) 2, KAlSi2O6, KCl, NaAlSiO4 (A1) and Na2SO4, NaCl (A2).
   Such compounds can decrease the sintering temperature due to formation
   of low temperature eutectics. The lowest fusion temperatures below 1000
   degrees C were detected from the sewage sludge ash A2 and above 1200
   degrees C from A1 and A2 with high Ca, Si and Al contents. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We investigate the recent evidence for a charged X(5568) meson as an
   exotic open-flavor tetraquark state su (b) over bar(d) over bar with
   J(P) = 0(+)/1(+) in the framework of QCD sum rules. We use the color
   antisymmetric {[}(3) over bar (c)](su) circle times {[}3(c)]((b) over
   bar(d) over bar) tetraquark currents in both scalar and axial-vector
   channels to perform evaluations and numerical analyses. Our results
   imply that the X(5568) can be interpreted as both the scalar su (b) over
   bar(d) over bar tetraquark state and the axial-vector one, which are in
   good agreement with the experimental measurement. We also discuss the
   possible decay patterns of the X(5568) and suggest to search for its
   neutral partner in the radiative decay into B-s(0)gamma and B-s{*}gamma,
   which can be used to determine its spin-parity quantum numbers.
   Moreover, we predict its charmed partner state around 2.55 GeV with the

Abstract = {{In the present paper, we have investigated hole transport in stabilized
   a-Se films using interrupted-field-time-of-flight (IFTOF) experiments
   with interruption times up to 600 mu s. A distinct advantage of IFTOF
   measurements is that one can monitor the average ``free{''} hole
   concentration p(t) (= p(x, t) averaged over the thickness of the sample
   L) at a given location x(1) in the sample inasmuch as the applied field
   is removed at a certain time t(1) for an interruption period of ti. At
   time t(1) + t(i), the field is reapplied and the recovered photocurrent
   i(2) at t = t(1) + t(i) is measured with respect to the original
   photocurrent i(1) at t = t(1). The experimental results are interpreted
   by the comparison of experimental photocurrent transients with numerical
   and Monte-Carlo simulations of multiple trapping hole transport for
   different DOS models; and their agreement with a featureless DOS
   distribution in the vicinity of valence band is confirmed. The
   examination of IFTOF experiments (i(2)/i(1) as a function of ti) for
   very long interruption times puts the energy position of deep traps
   controlling the hole lifetime to be above 0.65 eV from Ev. The results
   are critically discussed in view of past experiments on the DOS in a-Se
   and recent structural modeling work on defects in the structure.
   Further, the work in this article vindicates the use of shallow trap
   controlled mobility and a single deep trapping time in the modeling of
   hole transport in recently developed a-Se based X-ray detectors; that is
   we only need shallow and deep traps to model the detector performance.

Abstract = {{Tissue scaffolds with living cells fabricated by three-dimensional
   bioprinting/plotting techniques are becoming more prevalent in tissue
   repair and regeneration. In the bioprinting process, cells are subject
   to process-induced forces (such as shear force) that can result in cell
   damage and loss of cell function. The flow behavior of the biomaterial
   solutions that encapsulate living cells in this process plays an
   important role. This study used a rheometer to examine the flow behavior
   of alginate solution and alginate-Schwann cell (RSC96),
   alginate-fibroblast cell (NIH-3T3), and alginate-skeletal muscle cell
   (L8) suspensions during shearing with respect to effects on cell
   viability and proliferation. The flow behavior of all the alginate-cell
   suspensions varied with alginate concentration and cell density and had
   a significant influence on the viability and proliferation of the cells
   once sheared as well as on the recovery of the sheared cells. These
   findings provide a mean to preserve cell viability and/or retain cell
   proliferation function in the bioprinting process by regulating the flow
   behavior of cell-biomaterial suspensions and process parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting protein complexes is crucial to understand principles of
   cellular organization. Plenty evidences have indicated that sub-graphs
   with high density in protein-protein interaction (PPI) network,
   especially dynamic PPI network (DPIN), usually correspond to protein
   complexes. As a well-known density-based clustering algorithm,
   Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) has
   been used in many areas due to its simplicity and the ability to detect
   clusters of different sizes and shapes. However, one of its limitations
   is that the performance of DBSCAN depends on two specified parameters
   epsilon and MinPts, where e represents the maximum radius of a
   neighborhood from an observing point while MinPts means the minimum
   number of data points contained in such a neighborhood. In this article,
   we develop a new method named as P-DBSCAN to detect protein complexes in
   DPIN by using Pigeon-Inspired Optimization (PIO) Algorithm to optimize
   the parameters e and MinPts in DBSCAN. The experiments on DIP and MIPS
   datasets show that P-DBSCAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for
   protein complex detection in terms of several criteria such as
   precision, recall and f-measure.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogels are particularly attractive as scaffolding materials for
   cartilage tissue engineering because their high water content closely
   mimics the native extracellular matrix (ECM). Hydrogels can also provide
   a three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment for homogeneously suspended
   cells that retains their rounded morphology and thus facilitates
   chondrogenesis in cartilage tissue engineering. However, fabricating
   hydrogel scaffolds or cell laden hydrogel constructs with a predesigned
   external shape and internal structure that does not collapse remains
   challenging because of the low viscosity and high water content of
   hydrogel precursors. Here, we present a study on the fabrication of
   (cell-laden) alginate hydrogel constructs using a 3D bioplotting system
   supplemented with a submerged cross-linking process. Swelling,
   mechanical properties and protein release profiles were examined and
   tuned by controlling the initial cross-linking density. Porous
   cell-laden alginate hydrogel constructs were also fabricated and cell
   viability, cell proliferation, and cartilaginous ECM deposition were
   investigated. The fabrication technique and the hydrogel scaffolds
   obtained supported high cell viability and the deposition of
   cartilaginous ECM, demonstrating their potential for applications in the
   field of cartilage tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{A proof-of-concept for a two-camera machine vision (MV) to classify the
   laboratory sprouted wheat kernels into sound, sprout-damaged, or
   severely sprout-damaged classes was developed. The marker controlled
   watershed segmentation technique was tailored to disjoin the clustered
   kernels in the digital images. Images were captured for both dorsal and
   ventral sides of the kernels. Segmentation accuracy of at least 95\% was
   achieved depending upon the sample size under some conditions. Sixteen
   features comprising of colour, texture, and shape and size were
   extracted from the images of dorsal and ventral sides of the test
   kernels. The alpha-amylase activities, a key enzyme found in the sprout
   damaged wheat were measured analytically for each kernel to categorise
   it into one of the three classes. A neural network model was developed
   with the kernels' features as the inputs and the alpha-amylase activity
   as the output. The MV with the trained neural network classified the
   test wheat kernels into three classes with an accuracy of 72.8\%. Some
   of the challenges associated with the system are discussed.
   Recommendations to improve the system accuracy and robustness, and to
   decrease the system cost are presented. (C) 2016 IAgrE. Published by

Abstract = {{Decimal floating-point (DFP) arithmetic has attracted attention in the
   applications of financial and commercial computing. However, the
   processing efficiency of DFP is still far away from that of binary
   designs. On the other hand, a floating-point fused multiply-add (FMA)
   function is widely used in many processors within functional iterations
   to implement division, square root, and many other functions due to the
   better accuracy achieved by a single rounding of continuous
   multiplication and addition. In this work, a new architecture of FMA is
   proposed to speed up the DFP processing. Compared with previous
   architectures, first, the proposed design applies a specific decimal
   redundant encoding system. The circuits to decide and shift the rounding
   position on a redundant result are therefore simplified. Second, the
   only digit-set conversion in the entire design is combined with the
   rounding operation to further reduce the critical path. Third, the
   techniques applied in different previous FMAs are merged in the proposed
   design. In addition the multiplier and adder referred to the previous
   designs are further optimised. Consequently, compared with the fastest
   previous design, the synthesis results show about 33.7\% speed advantage
   and about 16.6\% area advantage.}},

Abstract = {{The as-cast Al alloys contain heterogeneous distributions of
   non-deforming particles due to non-equilibrium solidification effects.
   Therefore, these alloys have poor tribological and mechanical behaviors.
   It is well known that using friction stir processing (FSP), very fine
   microstructure is created in the as-cast Al alloys, while their wear
   resistance can be improved. In this research work, FSP is used to
   locally refine a surface layer of the coarse as-cast microstructure of
   cast A413 Al alloy. The main objective of this study is to investigate
   the effect of FSP on microstructure and microtexture evolutions in A413
   cast Al alloy. The grain boundary character distribution, grain
   structure, and microtexture evolutions in as-cast and friction stir
   processed A413 Al alloy are analyzed by electron back scatter
   diffraction technique. It is found that with the FSP, the fraction of
   low aboundary such as a3, 7, and 9 are increased. The obtained results
   show that there are no deformation texture components in the structure
   of friction stir processed samples. However, some of the main
   recrystallization texture components such as BR and cube(ND) are formed
   during FSP which indicate the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization
   phenomenon due to the severe plastic deformation induced by the rotation
   of tool.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in achieving deep hydrodesulfurization with the
   conventional hydrotreating technology is the inhibition and deactivation
   of the catalyst caused by heterocyclic nitrogen compounds. In this
   research, novel polymeric adsorbents were introduced for the selective
   removal of nitrogen compounds from bitumen-derived light gas oil.
   Synthesis of polymers with high internal phase emulsion (polyHIPEs) was
   carried out using a monomeric mixture of unsaturated polyester resin,
   glycidyl methacrylate and divinylbenzene. To facilitate the selective
   removal of nitrogen compounds, reactive epoxy groups present in glycidyl
   methacrylate were used to functionalize the polyHIPEs with a fluorenone
   based it-acceptor, 2,4,5,7-tetranitro-9-fiuorenone (TENF). Successful
   application of the synthesized polymers was found in the batch
   adsorption experiments at ambient temperature. Functionalized polyHIPEs
   were capable of selectively adsorbing nitrogen species from light gas
   oil. The optimum ratio of monomers was found to be one of the key
   factors in determining the polymer performance. Particles with high
   glycidyl methacrylate content with toluene as the porogenic solvent were
   capable of removing 14.6\% of nitrogen compounds. Reusability studies
   were performed successfully by regenerating the used polymers with
   toluene; which aids the separation of complexing agent and the adsorbed
   nitrogen species. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Time scale effect and uncertainty in reconstruction of paleo-hydrology}},

Pages = {{1985-1999}},

Abstract = {{Tree-ring-based reconstructions of paleo-hydrology have proved useful
   for better understanding the irregularities and extent of past climate
   changes, and therefore, for more effective water resources management.
   Despite considerable advances in the field, there still exist challenges
   that introduce significant uncertainties into paleo-reconstructions.
   This study outlines these challenges and address them by developing two
   themes: (1) the effect of temporal scaling on the strength of the
   relationship between the hydrologic variables, streamflow in this study,
   and tree growth rates and (2) the reconstruction uncertainty of
   streamflow due to the dissimilarity or inconsistency in the pool of
   tree-ring chronologies (predictors in reconstruction) in a basin. Based
   on the insight gained, a methodology is developed to move beyond only
   relying on the annual hydrology-growth correlations, and to utilize
   additional information embedded in the annual time series at longer time
   scales (e.g. multi-year to decadal time scales). This methodology also
   generates an ensemble of streamflow reconstructions to formally account
   for uncertainty in the pool of chronology sites. The major headwater
   tributaries of the Saskatchewan River Basin, the main source of surface
   water in the Canadian Prairie Provinces, are used as the case study. It
   is shown that the developed methodology explains the variance of
   streamflows to a larger extent than the conventional approach and better
   preserves the persistence and variability of streamflows across time
   scales (Hurst-type behaviour). The resulting ensemble of
   paleo-hydrologic time series is able to more credibly pinpoint the
   timing and extent of past dry and wet periods and provides a dynamic
   range of uncertainty in reconstruction. This range varies with time over
   the course of the reconstruction period, indicating that the utility of
   tree-ring chronologies for paleo-reconstruction differs for different
   time periods over the past several centuries in the history of the
   region. The proposed ensemble approach provides a credible range of
   multiple-century-long water availability scenarios that can be used for
   vulnerability assessment of the existing water infrastructure and
   improving water resources management. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Modelling the hydrology of North American Prairie watersheds is
   complicated because of the existence of numerous landscape depressions
   that vary in storage capacity. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)
   is a widely applied model for long-term hydrological simulations in
   watersheds dominated by agricultural land uses. However, several studies
   show that the SWAT model has had limited success in handling prairie
   watersheds. In past works using SWAT, landscape depression storage
   heterogeneity has largely been neglected or lumped. In this study, a
   probability distributed model of depression storage is introduced into
   the SWAT model to better handle landscape storage heterogeneity. The
   work utilizes a probability density function to describe the spatial
   heterogeneity of the landscape depression storages that was developed
   from topographic characteristics. The integrated SWAT-PDLD model is
   tested using datasets for two prairie depression dominated watersheds in
   Canada: the Moose Jaw River watershed, Saskatchewan; and the Assiniboine
   River watershed, Saskatchewan. Simulation results were compared to
   observed streamflow using graphical and multiple statistical criterions.
   Representation of landscape depressions within SWAT using a probability
   distribution (SWAT-PDLD) provides improved estimations of streamflow for
   large prairie watersheds in comparison to results using a lumped, single
   storage approach. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{New V2O5 polymorphs have risen to prominence as a result of their open
   framework structures, cation intercalation properties, tunable
   electronic structures, and wide range of applications. The application
   of these materials and the design of new, useful polymorphs requires
   understanding their defining structure-property relationships. We
   present a characterization of the band gap and electronic structure of
   nanowires of the novel zeta-phase and the orthorhombic a-phase of V2O5
   using X-ray spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. The
   band gap is found to decrease from 1.90 +/- 0.20 eV in the alpha-phase
   to 1.50 +/- 0.20 eV in the zeta-phase, accompanied by the loss of the
   alpha-phase's characteristic split-off d(xy) band in the zeta-phase.
   States of d(xy) origin continue to dominate the conduction band edge in
   the new polymorph but the inequivalence of the vanadium atoms and the
   increased local symmetry of {[}VO6] octahedra results in these states
   overlapping with the rest of the V 3d conduction band. zeta-V2O5
   exhibits anisotropic conductivity along the b direction, defining a 1D
   tunnel, in contrast to alpha-V2O5 where the anisotropic conductivity is
   along the ab layers. We explain the structural origins of the
   differences in electronic properties that exist between the alpha- and
   zeta-phase.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Advances of next generation sequencing technologies and
   availability of short read data enable the detection of structural
   variations (SVs). Deletions, an important type of SVs, have been
   suggested in association with genetic diseases. There are three types of
   deletions: blunt deletions, deletions with microhomologies and deletions
   with microsinsertions. The last two types are very common in the human
   genome, but they pose difficulty for the detection. Furthermore, finding
   deletions from sequencing data remains challenging. It is highly
   appealing to develop sensitive and accurate methods to detect deletions
   from sequencing data, especially deletions with microhomology and
   deletions with microinsertion.
   Results: We present a novel method called Sprites (SPlit Read
   re-alIgnment To dEtect Structural variants) which finds deletions from
   sequencing data. It aligns a whole soft-clipping read rather than its
   clipped part to the target sequence, a segment of the reference which is
   determined by spanning reads, in order to find the longest prefix or
   suffix of the read that has a match in the target sequence. This
   alignment aims to solve the problem of deletions with microhomologies
   and deletions with microinsertions. Using both simulated and real data
   we show that Sprites performs better on detecting deletions compared
   with other current methods in terms of F-score.
   Availability and implementation: Sprites is open source software and
   freely available at https://github.com/zhangzhen/sprites.}},

Abstract = {{Large volumes of waters contaminated with naphthenic acids (NAs) are
   produced during the processing of oil sands. Anoxic biodegradation of
   trans-4-methyl-1-cyclohexane carboxylic acid (trans-4MCHCA) coupled to
   nitrate reduction was reported earlier. Given the generation of nitrite
   as an intermediate of nitrate reduction, its subsequent use as secondary
   electron acceptor and its potential inhibitory effect, biodegradation of
   trans-4MCHCA coupled to nitrite reduction was investigated in the
   current work. Batch experiments revealed the optimum temperature as 24
   +/- 2 degrees C and that the nitrite inhibitory effect was severe at
   1150 mg nitrite L-1. Maximum biodegradation rates in the stirred tank
   and biofilm reactors were 14.4 and 82.2 mg L-1 h(-1), and the
   corresponding nitrite reduction rates were 44.2 and 361.6 mg L-1 h(-1),
   respectively. Using the experimental data, maximum specific growth rate

   0.4h(-1), 20.9 mg trans-4MCHCA L-1, and 0.3 mg biomass (mg
   trans-4MCHCA)(-1), respectively. Comparison of anoxic biodegradation
   results with nitrate and nitrite demonstrated the superiority of nitrate
   as an electron acceptor for anoxic biodegradation of NAs. (C) 2016

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Geochemical characteristics of fluid fine tailings (FFT) were examined
   in Base Mine Lake (BML), which is the first full-scale demonstration oil
   sands end pit lake (EPL) in northern Alberta, Canada. Approximately 186
   Mm(3) of FFT was deposited between 1994 and 2012, before BML was
   established on December 31, 2012. Bulk FFT samples (n = 588) were
   collected in July and August 2013 at various depths at 15 sampling
   sites. Temperature, solid content, electrical conductivity (EC), pH, Eh
   and alkalinity were measured for all samples. Detailed geochemical
   analyses were performed on a subset of samples (n = 284). Pore-water pH
   decreased with depth by approximately 0.5 within the upper 10 m of the
   FFT. Major pore-water constituents included Na (880 +/- 96 mg L-1) and
   Cl (560 +/- 95 mg L-1); Ca (19 +/- 4.1 mg L-1), Mg (11 +/- 2.0 mg L-1),
   K (16 +/- 2.3 mg L-1) and NH3 (9.9 +/- 4.7 mg L-1) were consistently
   observed. Iron and Mn concentrations were low within FFT pore water,
   whereas SO4 concentrations decreased sharply across the FFT-water
   interface. Geochemical modeling indicated that FeS(s) precipitation was
   favoured under SO4-reducing conditions. Pore water was also
   under-saturated with respect to gypsum{[}CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O], and
   near saturation with respect to calcite {[}CaCO3], dolomite
   {[}CaMg(CO3)(2)] and siderite {[}FeCO3]. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   suggested that carbonate-mineral dissolution largely depleted calcite
   and dolomite. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy
   revealed the presence of FeS(s), pyrite {[}FeS2], and siderite.
   Carbonate-mineral dissolution and secondary mineral precipitation have
   likely contributed to FFT dewatering and settlement. However, the
   long-term importance of these processes within EPLs remains unknown.
   These results provide a reference for assessing the long-term
   geochemical evolution of oil sands EPLs, and offer insight into the
   chemistry of pore water released from FFT to the overlying water cover.

Abstract = {{In the past decade many charmonium-like states were observed
   experimentally. Especially those charged charmonium-like Z(c) states and
   bottomonium-like Z(b) states cannot be accommodated within the naive
   quark model. These charged Z(c) states are good candidates of either the
   hidden-charm tetraquark states or molecules composed of a pair of
   charmed mesons. Recently, the LHCb Collaboration discovered two
   hidden-charm pentaquark states, which are also beyond the quark model.
   In this work, we review the current experimental progress and
   investigate various theoretical interpretations of these candidates of
   the multiquark states. We list the puzzles and theoretical challenges of
   these models when confronted with the experimental data. We also discuss
   possible future measurements which may distinguish the theoretical
   schemes on the underlying structures of the hidden charm multiquark
   states. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The phi-Lambda(1520) interference effect in the gamma p -> K(+)K(-)p
   reaction has been measured for the first time in the energy range from
   1.673 to 2.173 GeV. The relative phases between phi and Lambda(1520)
   production amplitudes were obtained in the kinematic region where the
   two resonances overlap. The measurement results support strong
   constructive interference when K+K- pairs are observed at forward angles
   but destructive interference for proton emission at forward angles.
   Furthermore, the observed interference effect does not account for the
   root s = 2.1 GeV bump structure in forward differential cross sections
   for phi photoproduction. This fact suggests possible exotic structures
   such as a hidden-strangeness pentaquark state, a new Pomeron exchange,
   or rescattering processes via other hyperon states.}},

Title = {{Modulating mechanical behaviour of 3D-printed cartilage-mimetic PCL
   scaffolds: influence of molecular weight and pore geometry}},
Journal = {{BIOFABRICATION}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D)-printed poly(epsilon)-caprolactone (PCL)-based
   scaffolds are increasingly being explored for cartilage tissue
   engineering (CTE) applications. However, ensuring that the mechanical
   properties of these PCL-based constructs are comparable to that of
   articular cartilage that they are meant to regenerate is an area that
   has been under-explored. This paper presents the effects of PCL's
   molecular weight (MW) and scaffold's pore geometric configurations;
   strand size (SZ), strand spacing (SS), and strand orientation (SO), on
   mechanical properties of 3D-printed PCL scaffolds. The results
   illustrate that MW has significant effect on compressive moduli and
   yield strength of 3D-printed PCL scaffolds. Specifically, PCL with MW of
   45 K was a more feasible choice for fabrication of visco-elastic,
   flexible and load-bearing PCL scaffolds. Furthermore, pore geometric
   configurations; SZ, SS, and SO, all significantly affect on tensile
   moduli of scaffolds. However, only SZ and SS have statistically
   significant effects on compressive moduli and porosity of these
   scaffolds. That said, inverse linear relationship was observed between
   porosity and mechanical properties of 3D-printed PCL scaffolds in
   Pearson's correlation test. Altogether, this study illustrates that
   modulating MW of PCL and pore geometrical configurations of the
   scaffolds enabled design and fabrication of PCL scaffolds with
   mechanical and biomimetic properties that better mimic mechanical
   behaviour of human articular cartilage. Thus, the modulated PCL scaffold
   proposed in this study is a framework that offers great potentials for
   CTE applications.}},

Title = {{Toward a Resilient Holistic Supply Chain Network System: Concept, Review

Abstract = {{The recent financial crisis and other major crises have suggested that
   there are some strong interactions and interdependence between several
   supply chains and their external environments in various ways. A set of
   supply chains that are interdependent is called a holistic supply chain
   network (H-SCN) in this paper. There is a need to focus on building the
   resilience (in short, the ability of a system to recover from damage or
   disruption) of an entire H-SCN as it is believed that such a network
   system is strongly relevant to the recent economic recession that is
   triggered by financial crises. The objectives of this paper are to
   provide a classification of different SCNs in literature, leading to the
   identification of a new type of SCN system, i.e., an H-SCN, and to
   discuss the state of knowledge on the resilience of SCNs, particularly
   of an H-SCN. A systematic review approach is applied in this paper.
   Another contribution of this paper is the provision of a more
   comprehensive definition and description of resilient systems, including
   SCN systems. A final contribution of this paper is the proposal of the
   future directions of research on resilient SCN systems, particularly
   resilient H-SCN systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we have used Quantum ESPRESSO (QE), an open source first
   principles code, based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and
   pseudopotentials, along with quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) to
   calculate the thermo-mechanical properties of thorium dioxide (ThO2).
   Using Python programming language, our group developed qe-nipy-advanced,
   an interface to QE, which can evaluate the structural and
   thermomechanical properties of materials. We predicted the phonon
   contribution to thermal conductivity (k(L)) using the Slack model. We
   performed the calculations within local density approximation (LDA) and
   generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the recently proposed
   version for solids (PBEsol). We employed a Monkhorst-Pack 5x5x5 k-points
   mesh in reciprocal space with a plane wave cut-off energy of 150 Ry to
   obtain the convergence of the structure. We calculated the dynamical
   matrices of the lattice on a 4 x 4 x 4 mesh. We have predicted the heat
   capacity, thermal expansion and the phonon contribution to thermal
   conductivity, as a function of temperature up to 1400K, and compared
   them with the previous work and known experimental results.}},

Title = {{Identifying Individual-Cancer-Related Genes by Rebalancing the Training

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{309-315}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The identification of individual-cancer-related genes typically is an
   imbalanced classification issue. The number of known cancer-related
   genes is far less than the number of all unknown genes, which makes it
   very hard to detect novel predictions from such imbalanced training
   samples. A regular machine learning method can either only detect genes
   related to all cancers or add clinical knowledge to circumvent this
   issue. In this study, we introduce a training sample rebalancing
   strategy to overcome this issue by using a two-step logistic regression
   and a random resampling method. The two-step logistic regression is to
   select a set of genes that related to all cancers. While the random
   resampling method is performed to further classify those genes
   associated with individual cancers. The issue of imbalanced
   classification is circumvented by randomly adding positive instances
   related to other cancers at first, and then excluding those unrelated
   predictions according to the overall performance at the following step.
   Numerical experiments show that the proposed resampling method is able
   to identify cancer-related genes even when the number of known genes
   related to it is small. The final predictions for all individual cancers
   achieve AUC values around 0.93 by using the leave-one-out cross
   validation method, which is very promising, compared with existing
   methods.}},

   identification of the subtypes of glioblastoma multiforme and breast
   invasive carcinoma from three omics data. The results obtained have
   shown that it has achieved the performance comparable to
   state-of-the-art techniques (Normalized Mutual Information >0.8). In
   comparison to traditional systems biology tools, the proposed
   methodology has several significant advantages. It has the ability to
   correlate and integrate multiple data levels in a holistic manner which

Abstract = {{A novel radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) structure to reduce the
   single event transient (SET) amplitude in analog circuits is presented
   in this paper. This structure features an SET isolation technique, which
   contains a sensor and a switch. The sensor turns off the switch when it
   detects a voltage transient at the sensitive node, in which case the
   core circuit is temporarily isolated from the output. Once the voltage
   at the sensitive node recovers, the sensor turns on the switch again in
   order to connect the core circuit to the output. This RHBD technique was
   validated based on a typical bandgap reference circuit, which was
   fabricated in the IBM 130 nm technology. The simulation results
   demonstrated a significant reduction in the SET amplitude, which was
   further verified with the pulsed laser. The additional sensor and the
   switch in the circuit only produce a minor amount of additional power
   dissipation if they are properly chosen. The area overhead is rendered
   negligible by means of selecting the appropriate sizes of transistors
   for the RHBD structure.}},

Abstract = {{Photostimulable storage phosphors have been used in a wide range of
   applications including radiation measurements in one-and two-dimensional
   spaces, called point dosimetry and radiography. In this work, we report
   that an aluminum nitride (AlN) ceramic plate, which is practically used
   as a heat sink (SHAPAL (R), Tokuyama Corp., Yamaguchi, Japan), shows
   good optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) properties with
   sufficiently large signal and capability for imaging applications, and
   we have characterized the AlN plate for OSL applications. Upon
   interaction with X-rays, the sample color turns yellowish, due to a
   radiation-induced photoabsorption band in the UV-blue range below
   similar to 500 nm. After irradiating the sample with X-rays, an intense
   OSL emission can be observed in the UV (360 nm) spectral region during
   stimulation by red light. Although our measurement setup is not
   optimized, dose detection was confirmed as low as similar to 3 mGy to
   over 20 Gy. Furthermore, we have successfully demonstrated that the
   SHAPAL (R) AlN ceramic plate has great potential to be used as an

Abstract = {{Time domain signal processing techniques are employed by the Super Dual
   Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) to obtain bulk measurements of the
   velocity and spectral width of F region ionospheric plasma
   irregularities. The measurements are obtained by fitting estimates of
   the mean autocorrelation function (ACF) of the radar target. To
   accurately and consistently extract target parameters from the mean
   unnormalized ACF, it is necessary to utilize error-weighted fitting
   algorithms with a weight given by the variance of the ACF. Currently
   implemented weights are ad hoc, and a detailed description of the
   statistical characterization of SuperDARN ACFs is needed. Following the
   discussions in Farley (1969) and Woodman and Hagfors (1969), which
   describe the variance for the mean normalized ACF used with incoherent
   scatter radars, we present analytic expressions for obtaining the
   variance of the real and imaginary components of the mean unnormalized
   SuperDARN ACF. These expressions are based on models by Andre et al.
   (1999) and Moorcroft (2004) of the voltage signal received by SuperDARN
   radars but may be used for other soft target radar systems. An algorithm
   for obtaining the variance of both the magnitude and phase of the mean
   ACF is also presented. The results of this study may be directly
   integrated into existing SuperDARN data analysis software and other
   pulse-Doppler radar systems that utilize estimates of the mean
   unnormalized ACF.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a cost efficient nearly linear phase approximation
   to an square root raised cosine (SRRC) pulse shaping filter that
   satisfies the out-of-band spectral constraints of DOCSIS down-stream
   channels. A nearly linear phase filter structure is converted to an SRRC
   filter using a weighted and sampled least-squares criterion to fit the
   magnitude and phase responses. To ensure stability, the search for
   optimum coefficients is constrained using the Steigliz-McBride (SM) and
   Gauss-Newton (GN) methods, which unfortunately also eliminates sets of
   stable coefficients, one of which could be and probably is the optimum.
   To expand the sets of coefficients that produce stable filters in the SM
   and GN methods, the transfer function is parameterized in a special way.
   The effectiveness of the proposed filter is verified and compared with
   other approaches.}},

Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{As the primary determinants of the clinical behaviors of human cancers,
   the discovery of cancer stem cells (CSCs) represents an ideal target for
   novel anti-cancer therapies (Kievit et al., 2014). Notably, CSCs are
   difficult to propagate in vitro, which severely restricts the study of
   CSC biology and the development of therapeutic agents. Emerging evidence
   indicates that CSCs rely on a niche that controls their differentiation
   and proliferation, as is the case with normal stem cells (NSCs).
   Replicating the in vivo CSC microenvironment in vitro using
   three-dimensional (3D) porous scaffolds can provide means to effectively
   generate CSCs, thus enabling the discovery of CSC biology. This paper
   presents our study on a novel alginate-based platform for mimicking the
   CSC niche to promote CSC proliferation and enrichment. In this study, we
   used a versatile mouse 4T1 breast cancer model to independently evaluate
   the matrix parameters of a CSC niche including the material's mechanical
   properties, cytokine immobilization, and the composition of the
   extracellular matrix's (ECM's) molecular impact on CSC proliferation and
   enrichment. On this basis, the optimal stiffness and concentration of
   hyaluronic acid (HA), as well as epidermal growth factor and basic
   fibroblast growth factor immobilization, were identified to establish
   the platform for mimicking the 4T1 breast CSCs (4T1 CSCs) niche. The 4T1
   CSCs obtained from the platform show increased expression of the genes
   involved in breast CSC and NSC, as compared to general 2D or 3D culture,
   and 4T1 CSCs were also demonstrated to have the ability to quickly form
   a subcutaneous tumor in homologous Balb/c mice in vivo. In addition, the
   platform can be adjusted according to different parameters for CSC
   screening. Our results indicate that our platform offers a simple and
   efficient means to isolate and enrich CSCs in vitro, which can help
   researchers better understand CSC biology and thus develop more
   effective therapeutic agents to treat cancer.
   Statement of Significance
   As the primary determinants of the clinical behaviors of human cancers,
   the discovery of cancer stem cells (CSCs) represents an ideal target for
   novel anti-cancer therapies. However, CSCs are difficult to propagate in
   vitro, which severely restricts the study of CSC biology and the
   development of therapeutic agents. Emerging evidence indicates that CSCs
   rely on a niche that controls their differentiation and proliferation,
   as is the case with normal stem cells (NSCs). Replicating the in vivo
   CSC microenvironment in vitro using three-dimensional (3D) porous
   scaffolds can provide means to effectively generate CSCs, thus enabling
   the discovery of CSC biology. In our study, a novel alginate-based
   platform were developed for mimicking the CSC niche to promote CSC
   proliferation and enrichment. (c) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{The impact of graded levels of day length on turkey health and behavior
   was determined in hens and toms raised to 18 wk of age. Birds were
   allocated to one of 4 lighting treatments (trt) providing 14 (14L), 17
   (17L), 20 (20L), and 23 (23L) h of day length. Two time-replicated
   trials were completed with each, providing 2 rooms per lighting trt and
   each room having 3 hen (n = 720) and 3 tom (n = 480) pens. Data
   collection included gait score (GS), the incidence of footpad dermatitis
   (FPD), breast buttons and blisters, ocular size and pressure (males
   only), and behavioral observations (males only). Data were analyzed
   using SAS 9.3 based on a completely randomized design nested within 4
   lighting trt. Regression analysis established relationships between
   response criteria and day length. Differences were considered
   significant at P <= 0.05 and trends noted at P <= 0.10. Gait score, FPD,
   and the incidence of breast buttons and blisters were assessed on 5
   birds per pen at 11 and 17 wk of age. Average GS increased linearly with
   day length at 11 and 17 wk for both hens and toms, but the effect was
   larger in toms. Day length did not affect FPD, but more lesions and
   severe scores were found for hens than toms. The presence of breast
   buttons and blisters increased linearly with day length (11 wk) with the
   effect on blisters predominately seen in toms. Eye weight and size
   increased with increasing day length at 12 and 18 wk. Ocular pressure
   was not affected by day length. Infrared cameras recorded tom behavior
   over a 24 h period, and behaviors were classified over 10-min intervals
   using a scan sampling technique at 11 and 17 wk. Alterations in
   behavioral repertoire were observed with a linear increase in inactive
   resting and a linear decrease in standing, walking, preening, and
   environmental and feather pecking behaviors with increased day length.
   To conclude, day length affected bird mobility and incidence of breast
   blisters in an age-and gender-specific manner, and time spent inactive
   increased with longer day length.}},

Title = {{Valorization of horse manure through catalytic supercritical water
   gasification}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{147-158}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The organic wastes such as lignocellulosic biomass, municipal solid
   waste, sewage sludge and livestock manure have attracted attention as
   alternative sources of energy. Cattle manure, a waste generated in
   surplus amounts from the feedlot, has always been a chief environmental
   concern. This study is focused on identifying the candidacy of horse
   manure as a next generation feedstock for biofuel production through
   supercritical water gasification. The horse manure was gasified in
   supercritical water to examine the effects of temperature (400-600
   degrees C), biomass-to-water ratio (1:5 and 1:10) and reaction time
   (15-45 min) at a pressure range of 23-25 MPa. The horse manure and
   resulting biochar were characterized through
   carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur (CHNS), inductively coupled plasma-mass
   spectrometry (ICP-MS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). The effects of alkali catalysts such as NaOH,
   Na2CO3 and K2CO3 at variable concentrations (1-2 wt\%) were investigated
   to maximize the hydrogen yields. Supercritical water gasification of
   horse manure with 2 wt\% Na2CO3 at 600 degrees C and 1:10 biomass
   to-water ratio for 45 min revealed maximum hydrogen yields (5.31
   mmol/g), total gas yields (20.8 mmol/g) with greater carbon conversion
   efficiency (43.1\%) and enhanced lower heating value of gas products
   (2920 kJ/Nm(3)). The manure-derived biochars generated at temperatures
   higher than 500 degrees C also demonstrated higher thermal stability
   (weight loss <34\%) and larger carbon content (>70 wt\%) suggesting
   their application in enhancing soil fertility and carbon sequestration.
   The results propose that supercritical water gasification could be a
   proficient remediation technology for horse manure to generate
   hydrogen-rich gas products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Characterization of physical mass transport through oil sands fluid fine
   tailings in an end pit lake: a multi-tracer study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{189}},
Pages = {{12-26}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Soft tailings pose substantial challenges for mine reclamation due to
   their high void ratios and low shear strengths, particularly for
   conventional terrestrial reclamation practices. Oil sands mine operators
   have proposed the development of end pit lakes to contain the soft
   tailings, called fluid fine tailings (FFT), generated when bitumen is
   removed from oil sands ore. End pit lakes would be constructed within
   mined-out pits with FFT placed below the lake water. However, the
   feasibility of isolating the underlying FFT has yet to be fully
   evaluated. Chemical constituents of interest may move from the FFT into
   the lake water via two key processes: (1) advective-diffusive mass
   transport with upward pore water flow caused by settling of the FFT; and
   (2) mixing created by wind events or unstable density profiles through
   the lake water and upper portion of the FFT. In 2013 and 2014,
   temperature and stable isotopes of water profiles were measured through
   the FFT and lake water in the first end pit lake developed by Syncrude
   Canada Ltd. Numerical modelling was undertaken to simulate these
   profiles to identify the key mechanisms controlling conservative mass
   transport in the FFT. Shallow mixing of the upper 1.1 m of FFT with lake
   water was required to explain the observed temperature and isotopic
   profiles. Following mixing, the re-establishment of both the temperature
   and isotope profiles required an upward advective flux of approximately
   1.5 m/year, consistent with average FFT settling rates measured at the
   study site. These findings provide important insight on the ability to
   sequester soft tailings in an end pit lake, and offer a foundation for
   future research on the development of end pit lakes as an oil sands
   reclamation strategy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Many systems of interests in practices can be represented as complex
   networks. For biological systems, biomolecules do not perform their
   functions alone but interact with each other to form so-called
   biomolecular networks. A system is said to be controllable if it can be
   steered from any initial state to any other final state in finite time.
   The network controllability has become essential to study the dynamics
   of the networks and understand the importance of individual nodes in the
   networks. Some interesting biological phenomena have been discovered in
   terms of the structural controllability of biomolecular networks. Most
   of current studies investigate the structural controllability of
   networks in notion of the minimum driver node sets (MDSs). In this
   study, the authors analyse the network structural controllability in
   notion of the minimum steering node sets (MSSs). They first develop a
   graph-theoretic algorithm to identify the MSS for a given network and
   then apply it to several biomolecular networks. Application results show
   that biomolecules identified in the MSSs play essential roles in
   corresponding biological processes. Furthermore, the application results
   indicate that the MSSs can reflect the network dynamics and node
   importance in controlling the networks better than the MDSs.}},

Volume = {{293}},

Abstract = {{Research on the formulations of vegetable oils into biolubricants has
   gained significant interest due to their promising lubricity and
   eco-friendly properties. The epoxidation of unsaturated groups in
   vegetable oil followed by epoxide ring opening by acetic anhydride
   provides vicinal di-O-acetylated glyceryl fatty acid esters as a stable
   and potential biolubricant. The present study is emphasized on the
   development of a single and novel heterogeneous catalyst for both the
   reaction steps (epoxidation and di-O-acetylation) to produce
   biolubricants from canola oil and canola biodiesel (methyl fatty acid
   esters). Group VI metal oxides (Cr, W and Mo) impregnated on aluminium
   oxide were prepared and screened for their catalytic activity on the
   epoxidation and vicinal di-O-acetylation steps. MoO3/Al2O3 was found to
   be the most effective catalyst for the epoxidation of canola oil and
   canola biodiesel, and its further conversion to corresponding vicinal
   di-O-acetylated derivatives (biolubricants). The response surface
   methodology (RSM) was employed for optimizing the process conditions and
   statistical analysis for both the reaction steps separately. Based on
   the process optimization study, 10 wt\% MoO3/Al2O3 was found to be the
   best catalyst for 100\% conversion of unsaturated groups to the epoxide
   and its further conversion to vicinal di-O-acetylated products in
   one-pot synthesis. All the products were confirmed by H-1 NMR and mass
   spectrometry. The physico-chemical characterization of MoO3/Al2O3 was
   carried out to evaluate and understand the properties required for
   effective catalysis. This study discloses MoO3/Al2O3 as a promising
   catalyst for the synthesis of biolubricants from vegetable oils. (C)

   The quasi-steady performance (sensible and latent heat transfer rates,

Abstract = {{Supersaturation of inversely soluble salts, like calcium carbonate,
   causes crystallization fouling on heated surfaces of heat exchangers. In
   this paper, crystallization fouling of calcium carbonate is studied by
   CFD modelling. Crystallization fouling is modelled in 2D and 3D flat
   plate geometries, which correspond to an experimental set-up of an
   idealised heat exchanger. The model is validated with experimental data
   under various operating conditions and is used to identify the regions
   where different parameters have the greatest effect on fouling.
   The CFD model presented in this paper is a novel combination of a
   fouling model, which includes the surface integration term and the shear
   stress dependent residence time, and the hydrodynamics and heat transfer
   modelled by CFD. The crystallization fouling CFD model predicts the
   experimental mass deposition rate and the linear fouling resistance
   within the experimental uncertainty in most of the studied conditions.
   The crystallization fouling CFD model is very sensitive to the heat
   exchanger surface temperature, but also relatively sensitive to the
   shear stress.
   The validated crystallization fouling model may be utilised to study
   fouling of industrial heat exchangers when the fouling is controlled by
   the surface integration. If mass transfer controls the crystallization
   fouling, the mass transport of ions should be included to the model. (C)

Abstract = {{The fuzzy Petri net is a promising and efficient approach that can
   tackle the complexities of power system fault diagnosis. In this work,
   the temporal constraint between event occurrences in power systems is
   investigated. Then, it is introduced to a fuzzy Petri net (FPN) for
   fault diagnosis. The temporal attributes are assigned to the
   propositions in the Petri net, so that temporal information can be taken
   into account, which makes the true hypothesis distinguishable from the
   false ones. The modified matrix execution algorithm can enhance
   computational efficiency, with a ``weighted average{''} operation
   included to improve the fault-tolerance. The developed model possesses a
   modular structure, which is easy to adapt to topology changes, and to
   accommodate modern protection schemes. A preliminary evaluation of the
   operating performance of protective devices is also carried out after
   fault section identification. The testing results on the IEEE 14-bus
   power system and Zhejiang provincial power system in China demonstrate
   that the developed model is correct and efficient. Compared with three
   existing fault diagnosis methods, the proposed one has stronger
   fault-tolerance with lower computational cost, and is suitable for
   on-line fault diagnosis in large-scale power systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The development of a facile and sustainable approach to produce
   magnesium oxide (MgO) activated carbons impregnated through a
   single-step activation of biochar is reported. In a single-step
   activation process, biochar is impregnated with 3 and 10 wt \% of
   magnesium salt solutions followed by steam activation. In a two-step
   method, activated carbon, the product of steam activation of biochar, is
   impregnated with magnesium salt using the incipient wetness and excess
   solution impregnation process and calcined. The impacts of activation
   method, impregnation method, and metal content are evaluated, and the
   product qualities are compared in terms of porosity and surface
   chemistry. The sorbents are then used for CO2 capture in low partial
   pressure of CO2 at 25 and 100 degrees C from a feed containing 15\% CO2
   in N-2 in a fixed-bed reactor. The incipient wetness of activated
   carbons results in the highest CO2 uptake (49 mg/g) at 25 degrees C,
   while single-step impregnation of biochar with rinsing step yields the
   largest surface area (760 m(2)/g) and the second highest CO2 uptake (47
   mg/g). The increase in Mg content from 3 to 10 wt \% results in the
   smaller surface area and higher CO2 uptake suggesting that the metal
   content has a greater impact than porosity and surface area. Rinsing the
   Mg impregnated activated carbon with water results in the larger surface
   area and higher CO2 uptake in all samples. Moreover, the CO2 adsorption
   runs at 100 degrees C shows a 65\% increase using MgO impregnated
   activated carbon as compared to steam activated carbon indicating that
   MgO impregnation of activated carbon can overcome the limitation of
   using nontreated activated carbon at moderate operating temperature of
   100 degrees C and low partial pressure of CO2 of 15 mol}},

   the faulty section and the exact fault location can be identified by
   calculating the normalised fault distance for each section on the
   selected faulty branch. Computational burden of the proposed analytical
   scheme is very low because it avoids iterative computations. Promising

Abstract = {{Though energy storage system (ESS) is a promising approach to alleviate
   the variability of non-dispatchable wind power and other forms of
   renewable energy sources, its high investment cost has impeded its wide
   deployment. Aiming at exploiting the arbitrage benefit of ESS in reserve
   market and raising revenue of shareholders, this study explores the
   optimal planning and operation of ESS in radial networks. Besides load
   balancing, ESS is used to provide three kinds of operating reserve
   services in presence of high wind power penetration, including spinning
   reserve, upward and downward regulation reserves. In light of the
   capacity limitation of ESS, the time duration of reserve provision has
   been taken into account. In the proposed model, unit commitment and AC
   optimal power flow (AC-OPF) are combined together over sequential time
   series to find the optimal location and size of ESSs. In order to reduce
   the computational complexity, the extended DistFlow model of AC-OPF is
   adopted to convert the problem into a mixed-integer second-order cone
   programming. Numerical studies on the IEEE 34-bus distribution test
   feeder are used to investigate the effects of ESS with respect to
   various penetration levels of wind power and load scales.}},

Abstract = {{A new allotrope of nitrogen in which the atoms are connected to form a
   novel N-6 molecule is predicted to exist at ambient conditions. The N-6
   molecule is a charge-transfer complex with an open-chain structure
   containing both single and triple bonds. The charge transfer induces
   ionic characteristics in the intermolecular interactions and leads to a
   much higher cohesive energy for the predicted crystal compared to solid
   N-2. The N-6 solid is also more stable than a previously reported
   polymeric solid of nitrogen. Because of the kinetic stability of the
   molecules and strong intermolecular interactions, the N-6 crystal is
   shown by metadynamics simulations to be dynamically stable around room
   temperature and to only dissociate to N-2 molecules above 700 K. The N-6
   crystal can likely be synthesized under high-pressure high-temperature
   conditions, and the considerable metastability may allow for an ambient
   pressure recovery of the crystal. Because of the large energy difference
   between the single and triple bonds, the dissociation of the N-6 crystal
   is expected to release a large amount of energy, placing it among the
   most efficient energy materials known today.}},

   fermentation by using flocculating yeast}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Ethanol fermentation requires oxygen to maintain high biomass and cell
   viability, especially under very-high-gravity (VHG) condition. In this
   work, fermentation redox potential (ORP) was applied to drive the
   aeration process at low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels, which is
   infeasible to be regulated by a DO sensor. The performance and
   characteristics of flocculating yeast grown under 300 and 260 g
   glucose/L conditions were subjected to various aeration strategies
   including: no aeration; controlled aeration at -150, -100 and -50 mV
   levels; and constant aeration at 0.05 and 0.2 vvm. The results showed
   that anaerobic fermentation produced the least ethanol and had the
   highest residual glucose after 72 h of fermentation. Controlled
   aerations, depending on the real-time oxygen demand, led to higher cell
   viability than the no-aeration counterpart. Constant aeration triggered
   a quick biomass formation, and fast glucose utilization. However, over
   aeration at 0.2 vvm caused a reduction of final ethanol concentration.
   The controlled aeration driven by ORP under VHG conditions resulted in
   the best fermentation performance. Moreover, the controlled aeration
   could enhance yeast flocculating activity, promote an increase of flocs
   size, and accelerate yeast separation near the end of fermentation.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 9}},
Abstract = {{The behavior of diatomic molecular solids under pressure have attracted
   great interest and been extensively studied. Under ambient pressure, the
   structure of bromine is known to be a molecular phase (phase I). With
   increasing pressure, it transforms into an incommensurate phase (phase
   V) before eventually to a monoatomic phase (phase II). However, between
   phases I and V, the interatomic distance was found to first increase
   with pressure and then decreased abruptly. This anomalous bond length
   behavior is accompanied by the splitting of the Raman bands. These
   phenomena have not been resolved. Here we suggest a new solid phase that
   explains the Raman spectra. Furthermore, the anomalous bond length
   behavior is found to be the result of subtle second neighbor
   intermolecular interactions and is an intrinsic property of bromine in

Title = {{Application of Spent H2S Scavenger of Iron Oxide in Mercury Capture from

Abstract = {{A commercial H2S scavenger of iron-oxide base, namely TG-4 in the
   Chinese market, was found to have activity for mercury (Hg) capture from
   flue gas after its use in H2S removal. The technical feasibility of
   using this industrial spent material to replace expensive activated
   carbon for mercury capture from coal-fired power plant flue gas was
   studied in this paper. The effects of temperature, space velocity, and
   compositions of the flue gas on the efficiency of Hg removal was
   investigated using a packed-bed tubular reactor on the benchtop scale.
   The mercury sorbents prepared from the spent TG-4 H2S sorbent were
   characterized by sulfur measurement, thermogravimetric and differential
   thermal analysis (TG-DTA), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The
   Hg L-3-edge XAS was used to analyze the material after its contact with
   Hg. The results show that the spent TG-4 can efficiently remove
   elemental mercury from the gas at a temperature range between 80 and 240
   degrees C and at reasonable space velocity. The efficiency of Hg removal
   slightly decreased when acidic gases such as SO2, NO, and HC1 were
   present in the gas stream. HgS was observed in the adsorbent after its
   reaction with gases containing Hg vapor, indicating that the elemental
   sulfur was the active component for mercury capture. However, compared
   with the benchtop experimental results, the spent TG-4 gave lower Hg
   capture efficiency in the scaled-up test at SaskPower's Emission Control
   Research Facility.}},

Abstract = {{Bulk SiO2 glasses have been prepared by spark plasma sintering and
   characterized towards dosimeter applications. The temperature dependence
   studies of radioluminescence suggest that there are two possible groups
   of luminescent centres, which show emissions at 385 and 511 nm. At room
   temperature, the former emission is predominant while the latter
   emission significantly increases at low temperatures, especially below
   200 K. The origins of these emissions are attributed to a pair of
   silylene centres and dioxasilirane and silylene, respectively. After
   irradiating the sample, thermally-stimulated luminescence (TSL) is
   observed around 160 degrees C and above 300 degrees C, in which the
   emission is mainly the 385 nm component. The TSL intensity is linearly
   proportional to the radiation dose delivered, and a linear dynamic range
   has been demonstrated over 10(0)-10(4) mGy. (C) 2016 The Ceramic Society

Abstract = {{The forming process of biomass fuel pellets using a ring mold pelletizer
   was analyzed, optimized, tested and evaluated in this study. The effects
   of stress amplitude and the stress ratio on the fatigue failure of the
   ring mold under 4-, 3-, and 2-roller designs were investigated.
   Depending on the calculation of stress amplitude acting on the ring
   mold, the 4-roller design was chosen for having the smallest value of
   stress amplitude in this condition. After determining the main design
   parameters, a three-dimensional model of the ring mold pelletizer was
   established based on the Pro/Engineer software, and the model was
   transferred into ADAMS software through Mechanism/Pro which is a
   dedicated interface software. The ADAMS software was used to run
   simulations. In order to obtain the highest efficiency and the lowest
   power consumption, the optimal result was the 4-roller design. Finally,
   a prototype of the ring mold pelletizer with four rollers was designed
   and manufactured for biomass fuel pellet production. Corn stover biomass
   was used as material for experimental manufacturing of fuel pellets.
   Test and evaluation showed that the optimized pellet durability was
   99.79\% with ground corn stover particles passing a screen size of 1.97
   mm, moisture content of 21.2\% w.b. and a material moisture conditioning
   time of 3.82 h. Pellets formed in the prototype ring mold pelletizer
   using corn stover had acceptable durability according to European
   standards.}},

Abstract = {{By adopting Lemb,ge \& Pellat's 2D plasma-sheet model, we investigate
   the flankward flapping motion and Sunward ballooning propagation driven
   by an external source (e.g., magnetic reconnection) produced initially
   at the sheet center. Within the ideal MHD framework, we adopt the WKB
   approximation to obtain the Taylor-Goldstein equation of magnetic
   perturbations. Fourier spectral method and Runge-Kutta method are
   employed in numerical simulations, respectively, under the flapping and
   ballooning conditions. Studies expose that the magnetic shears in the
   sheet are responsible for the flapping waves, while the magnetic
   curvature and the plasma gradient are responsible for the ballooning
   waves. In addition, the flapping motion has three phases in its temporal
   development: fast damping phase, slow recovery phase, and
   quasi-stabilized phase; it is also characterized by two patterns in
   space: propagating wave pattern and standing wave pattern. Moreover, the
   ballooning modes are gradually damped toward the Earth, with a
   wavelength in a scale size of magnetic curvature or plasma
   inhomogeneity, only 1-7\% of the flapping one; the envelops of the
   ballooning waves are similar to that of the observed bursty bulk flows
   moving toward the Earth.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of graded levels of day-length on the productivity of hens
   and toms was studied in two trials. Daylength treatments (trts) were 14
   (14L), 17 (17L), 20 (20L), and 23 (23L) h and were started at 10 d of
   age. Turkeys (720 hens and 480 toms) were randomly allocated to 8 rooms
   (2 rooms per lighting trt) with six pens (3 hen - 30 per pen and 3 tom -
   20 per pen) per room in each trial. Body weight (BW) was assessed at 0,
   10, 21, 42, 63, 84, and 126 d of age; feed consumption (FC) was measured
   for the time periods between body weight determinations and feed
   efficiency (G:F; g of gain/g of feed) was calculated from BW and FC
   values. Birds were checked daily for mortality and culls, and affected
   birds were sent for necropsy. Data were analyzed according to a
   completely randomized block design with trial as the block and rooms
   nested within lighting trts. Regression analysis was used to study the
   relationship between dependent variables and daylength. Significance was
   declared at P <= 0.05 and trends at P <= 0.10. At both 21 and 42 d, body
   weight increased linearly with increasing daylength. At 84 d weights of
   toms decreased in a quadratic fashion and hen weights were unaffected.
   At 126 d, both tom and hen weights decreased linearly as daylength
   increased, with the magnitude of response gender dependent. Feed
   consumption corresponded with body weight changes, increasing for d 10
   to 21, and 21 to 42 and decreasing for d 63 to 84, 84 to 105, and 105 to
   126 with increasing daylength. Feed efficiency (G:F) was not affected by
   daylength for 10 to 84, 10 to 105 and 10 to 126 d periods. The incidence
   of mortality and culling was not affected by daylength for the 10 to 84
   d period, but increased in a quadratic manner with increasing daylength
   for the 10 to 105 and 10 to 126 d periods. To conclude, daylength
   affects the growth and feed intake of turkeys in an age and
   gender-specific manner, and mortality and culling increase with longer
   daylength.}},

Title = {{Performance of a quasi-counter-flow air-to-air membrane energy exchanger
   in cold climates}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},

Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{The merits of membrane energy exchanger applied for cold climates are
   less known and explained. In this study a novel quasi-counter-flow
   membrane energy exchanger (MEE) was built and tested under cold
   operating conditions. The quasi-counter-flow arrangement combines
   advantage of the ease sealing of cross-flow and high efficiency of
   counter-flow. The measured sensible and latent effectivenesses are in
   ranges of 88.5-94.5\% and 73.7-83.5\%, respectively. The correlations of
   heat transfer Colburn factor and friction factor for the MEE are fitted
   in terms of Reynolds number based on the experimental results. These
   correlations provide thermal and hydrodynamic characteristics and
   membrane energy exchanger design and selection in cold climates.
   This study developed an analytical model to predict heat and moisture
   transfer in the quasi-counter flow MEE for low operating temperatures.
   For the moisture transfer, resistances of dense and porous membranes are
   investigated. Niu and Zhang's dense membrane resistance is adjusted and
   adopted for low operating temperatures. The revised resistance formula
   of dense membrane presents theoretical optimal sorption isotherms under
   different operating conditions to minimize the diffusive resistance. The
   moisture transfer resistance of a porous membrane, which has a
   completely different moisture transfer mechanism with the dense
   membrane, is presented in this article. The comprehensive heat and
   moisture transfer resistance model yields consistent agreement with
   experimental results for the porous membrane used in this study. A
   preliminary parametric study was conducted to optimize the MEE design.

Title = {{Sediment Export Modeling in Cold-Climate Prairie Watersheds}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Nonpoint source pollution is a critical problem in Canadian prairie
   watersheds. However, sediment mobilization and export are poorly
   represented in existing models for these watersheds. The poor
   representation is partly because the hydrology of the region is highly
   influenced by the existence of numerous dynamically-connected landscape
   depressions that vary in storage capacity and because of the complex
   freeze-thaw cycles in the region. The objective of this research was to
   improve sediment export simulation modeling in these cold-climate
   prairie watersheds by incorporating a probability distribution function
   of depression storage capacity and a seasonally varying soil erodibility
   factor into the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model. The
   probability distribution function is used to represent the variation in
   storage capacity of the numerous depressions, whereas the seasonally
   varied soil erodibility factor is used to account for changes in
   erodibility as the soil freezes and thaws. Results from two case study
   watersheds confirm an improvement in sediment export predictions when
   varying storage capacity is represented and the sediment loss routine
   includes seasonally varying soil erodibility. (C) 2016 American Society

Abstract = {{Electrochemical hydrogen charging and permeation techniques were used to
   characterize hydrogen distribution, trapping, and diffusion in X60 and
   X60 sour service (X60SS) pipeline steels. The results obtained
   contribute to better understanding of hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC).
   SEM observations illustrated that all HIC cracks were formed at the
   center of cross section in the X60 steel after 3-h hydrogen charging and
   length of cracks increased with charging time. No HIC cracks were
   recorded at the cross section of X60SS steel after the same charging for
   different durations. Hydrogen permeation tests showed that the density
   of reversible hydrogen traps was lower at the center of cross section in
   the X60SS steel compared to the X60 one, and this is considered as one
   of the main reasons for high resistance of X60SS steel to HIC. EBSD
   orientation imaging results proved that the accumulation of < 111
   >||ND-oriented grains at the center of the cross section in the X60SS
   steel was high. This is also considered as another reason for higher
   resistance of this steel to HIC. Finally, the center segregation zone
   with higher hardness value in the X60 steel was more pronounced than in
   the X60SS steel which made the X60 steel susceptible to HIC cracking.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{10-18}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Concern over potential impact of shale gas development on shallow
   groundwater systems requires greater understanding of crustal scale
   fluid movement. We examined natural deeply circulating groundwater
   systems in northeastern British Columbia adjacent to a region of shale
   gas development, in order to elucidate origin of waters, depths of
   circulation, and controls on fluid flow. These systems are expressed as
   thermal springs that occur in the deformed sedimentary rocks of the
   Liard Basin. Stable isotope data from these springs show that they
   originate as meteoric water. Although there are no thermal anomalies in
   the region, outlet temperatures range from 30 to 56 degrees C,
   reflecting depth of circulation. Based on aqueous geothermometry and
   geothermal gradients, circulation depths up to 3.8 km are estimated,
   demonstrating connection of deep groundwater systems to the surface.
   Springs are also characterised by leakage of thermogenic gas from deep
   strata that is partly attenuated by methanotrophic microbial communities
   in the spring waters. Springs are restricted to anomalous structural
   features, cross cutting faults, and crests of fault-cored anticlines. On
   a regional scale they are aligned with the major tectonic features of
   the Liard Line and Larsen Fault. This suggests that while connection of
   surface to deep reservoirs is possible, it is rare and restricted to
   highly deformed geologic units that produce permeable pathways from
   depth through otherwise thick intervening shale units. Results allow a
   better understanding of potential for communication between deep shale
   gas units and shallow aquifer systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this study, a locally weighted linear regression (LWLR) method is
   proposed to predict damping ratio of a dominant mode online. The LWLR
   method, which is nonparametric and data-oriented, is essentially
   proposed for nonlinear data fitting; therefore, it can track the
   nonlinear power system operations and help damping ratio prediction in
   real power systems, which is hardly achieved by the conventional linear
   regression. To successfully implement this method, the measurement of
   weighting value and the choice of weighting function as well as its
   parameter setting, related to prediction accuracy and numerical
   conditions, are extensively discussed. Simulations are carried out in a
   two-area four-machine system and a large complex system, China Southern

Abstract = {{The recently-developed Two-sided Arnoldi and Sensitive Pole Algorithm
   (TSA-SPA) is effective and robust in computing the most sensitive
   eigenvalues with respect to control parameter changes in large-scale

   parameters, including control, system operating and network parameters.
   The proposed algorithm makes use of perturbation in reduced matrix
   obtained from Arnoldi/ TSA method through linearization and successfully
   avoids the need for TSA-SPA to formulate the whole state matrix of the
   system and to explicitly calculate the elements' variations in system
   state matrix. A new deflation method is also proposed and adopted in the
   generalized algorithm to find other sensitive eigenvalues. Simulation
   results illustrate that the generalized algorithm is able to not only
   maintain the excellent properties of TSA-SPA in terms of convergence and
   robustness, but also consider various parameter changes effectively in

Abstract = {{Synchrotron radiation inline phase-contrast imaging combined with
   computed tomography (SR-inline-PCI-CT) offers great potential for
   non-invasive characterization and three-dimensional visualization of
   fine features in weakly absorbing materials and tissues. For cartilage
   tissue engineering, the biomaterials and any associated cartilage
   extracellular matrix (ECM) that is secreted over time are difficult to
   image using conventional absorption-based imaging techniques. For
   example, three-dimensional printed polycaprolactone (PCL)/alginate/cell
   hybrid constructs have low, but different, refractive indices and
   thicknesses. This paper presents a study on the optimization and
   utilization of inline-PCI-CT for visualizing the components of
   three-dimensional printed PCL/alginate/cell hybrid constructs for
   cartilage tissue engineering. First, histological analysis using Alcian
   blue staining and immunofluorescent staining assessed the secretion of
   sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAGs) and collagen type II (Col2) in the
   cell-laden hybrid constructs over time. Second, optimization of inline
   PCI-CT was performed by investigating three sample-to-detector distances
   (SDD): 0.25, 1 and 3 m. Then, the optimal SDD was utilized to visualize
   structural changes in the constructs over a 42-day culture period. The
   results showed that there was progressive secretion of
   cartilage-specific ECM by ATDC5 cells in the hybrid constructs over
   time. An SDD of 3 m provided edge-enhancement fringes that enabled
   simultaneous visualization of all components of hybrid constructs in
   aqueous solution. Structural changes that might reflect formation of ECM
   also were evident in SR-inline-PCI-CT images. Summarily,
   SR-inline-PCI-CT images captured at the optimized SDD enables
   visualization of the different components in hybrid cartilage constructs
   over a 42-day culture period.}},

Abstract = {{A novel combinational digital device for finding maximum magnitude among
   the n' input numbers is proposed. This maximum magnitude generator
   (MaxMG) generates maximum magnitude as an output by utilising the bit by
   bit approach from multiple input (multi-bit) values simultaneously.
   MaxMG generates output from most significant bit (MSB) to least
   significant bit (LSB) in parallel, which utilises a minimum number of
   gate counts among the multi-bit of multiple input values. The minimum
   magnitude generator is also derived by applying the dual function to the
   MaxMG. The proposed design is implemented using Synopsys 90 nm generic
   library and RTL is written using Verilog HDL. The performance of the
   proposed design is compared with a rank based Kth max selection
   algorithm, a parallel tree based maximum generator utilised
   comparator-multiplexer combination, an array-based maximum finder (AB)
   and improved quad tree (IQT). The bit by bit parallel processing at the
   inputs - from MSB to LSB, and the simple architecture utilising a
   minimum number of gates, makes the proposed design more energy efficient
   when compared with the Kth max algorithm, the tree based maximum finder,
   the AB based maximum finder, and the IQT architecture.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of different nano-structural phase shapes on the mechanical
   properties of a SiC/Cu interpenetrating phase composite (IPC) at the
   atomic scale are investigated by using molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulation. Two different geometrical models, namely IPCs with a
   spherical interconnected phase and a cylindrical interconnected phase,
   are considered in the present study. In addition, the locations of SiC
   and Cu phases are altered as inner and outer phases in each model.
   Moreover, the effects of volume fraction on the Young's modulus and
   ultimate strength of the IPCs are investigated and validity of the
   Hashin-Shtrikman model at the atomic scale is examined. To further
   investigate the extent to which geometry of phases may affect the
   mechanical response of an IPC, thirty models with randomly generated
   geometries are created and their mechanical responses are studied. The
   effect of size of IPC on its mechanical response was also investigated.
   It is found that the effect of shape on the IPC's behavior is linked to
   both the volume fraction of the phases in the composite and the geometry
   of phases. The results show that an IPC's interconnected phase can
   noticeably affect both its elastic and plastic response. (C) 2016

   fibers produced at the optimum chemical concentrations of 4 wt\% NaOH
   and 5 wt\% of acidified sodium chlorite solution contained approximately
   89\% of cellulose, 4\% hemicellulose, and 6\% lignin. About 67\% of the
   prepared nanocellulose fibers showed a diameter range between 5 and 25
   nm. The tensile strength and modulus of the nano fiber films prepared at
   the optimized grinding condition were 273 MPa and 17 GPa, respectively.
   The high crystalline index (70\%) and improved thermal stability of the
   nanofibers indicate their suitability for manufacturing
   bionanocomposites. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, pool boiling heat transfer experiments are
   performed on a bare copper surface, a sandblasted copper surface, and
   carbon nanotube coated copper substrates. Experiments were conducted on
   the substrate surface area of 14 x 14 mm(2) using de-mineralized water
   as the working fluid. The substrate is fixed tightly on the heater
   block, which is embedded with six cartridge heaters of total capacity
   1500 W. Heat fluxes were measured using J-type thermocouples, which were
   aligned vertically along the heater block and also 1 mm from the top of
   the substrate. The pool boiling heat transfer experiments were conducted
   on bare, sandblasted and vertically aligned CNT coated copper
   substrates. The obtained results of sandblasted and CNT coated surfaces
   were compared with that of the bare copper surface. A remarkable
   enhancement of 38\% in the CHF was observed on the CNT coated surface.
   The CNT coated surface was found to be effective in increasing the
   nucleate boiling and the CHF. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Double-layer clustering method to predict protein complexes based on

Abstract = {{Identifying protein complexes from Protein-protein Interaction Networks
   (PINs) is fundamental for understanding protein functions and activities
   in cell. Based on the assumption that protein complexes are highly
   connected areas in PINs, many algorithms were proposed to identify
   protein complexes from PINs. However, most of these approaches neglected
   that not all proteins in complexes are highly connected, and proteins in
   PINs with different topological properties may form protein complexes in
   different ways and should be treated differently. In this paper, we
   proposed a double-layer clustering method based on the power-law
   distribution (PLCluster). To calculate the centrality scores of nodes,
   we proposed a Dense-Spread Centrality method. The centrality scores
   calculated by Dense-Spread Centrality method follow a power-law
   distribution. Based on the power-law distribution of the centrality
   scores, PLCluster divides the nodes into two categories: the nodes with
   very high centrality scores and the nodes with lower centrality scores.
   Then different strategies are applied to nodes in different categories
   for detecting protein complexes from the PIN, respectively. Furthermore,
   the predicted protein complexes, which are inconsistent with the fact
   that all proteins in a protein complex should be in the same sub
   cellular compartment, are filtered out. Compared with other nine
   existing methods on a high reliable yeast PIN, PLCluster shows great
   advantages in terms of the number of known complexes that are
   identified, Sensitivity, Specificity, f-measure and the number of
   perfect matches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies on In2O3 have revealed a rich phase diagram and have led
   to the discovery of new In2O3 polymorphs, including the synthesis and
   ambient recovery of Pbcn In2O3. The electronic properties of this new
   phase are studied together with other better-known polymorphs (Ia (3)
   over bar and R (3) over barc) using soft x-ray absorption and emission
   spectroscopy, directly probing the partial density of states and
   transition matrix elements. Together with complementary full-potential
   all-electron density functional theory calculations, this allows
   important material parameters, such as the electronic band gap and
   partial density of states, to be elucidated. Excellent agreement between
   experiment and theory is obtained, with band gaps of 3.2 +/- 0.3, 3.1
   +/- 0.3, and 2.9 +/- 0.3 eV determined for the Ia (3) over bar, R (3)
   over barc, and Pbcn In2O3 polymorphs, respectively. The effective mass
   of carriers in Pbcn In2O3 is predicted to be 12\% less than in the

Abstract = {{In this study the band gap and electronic structure of the

   through a combination of soft X-ray spectroscopy, density functional
   theory calculations, and thermal quenching data for the Eu2+ 5d -> 4f
   emissions. The results will be compared to those for the high-efficiency
   phosphor Sr{[}LiAl3N4]:Eu2+ (SLA), which shows different, yet
   exceptional emission characteristics in the red-spectral region. It is
   found that SMS has an indirect band gap of 3.28 +/- 0.20 eV, strong
   uniformity in the density of states of its nonequivalent nitrogen sites,
   and an estimated energetic separation between the lowest Eu2+ 5d state
   and the conduction band of approximate to 0.13 eV. The Eu2+
   5d-conduction band separation in SLA is found to be approximate to 0.28
   eV, which points to why the visible emissions of SLA, and not SMS, show
   outstanding thermal stability. A bonding scheme explaining the band gap
   difference of SMS and SLA is proposed based on the density of states of
   SMS. Modifications to each lattice are put forward for achieving
   optimized phosphor characteristics for use in pc-LEDs.}},

   an in situ hot isostatic pressing method, which were compared with those
   at 900 degrees C. The maximum trapped field B-T of 3.0 T at 19 K was
   realized at the Ti-doping level of 10\%-20\%. In spite of the lower
   filling factor of 700 degrees C Ti-doped bulks, i.e., f similar to 80\%,
   the obtained B-T = 3.0 T was 1.3 times larger than that of the nondoped
   bulk (f similar to 90\%) and was comparable with those for the 900
   degrees C Ti-doped bulks (f similar to 90\%) with the same Ti contents.
   The quantitative analysis of the chemical composition revealed that fine
   particles of higher borides, i.e., MgBy (y > 2), existed in the MgB2
   matrix. The low sintering temperature of 700 degrees C and the Ti doping
   strongly suppressed the grain growth of the MgB2 matrix. The increase in
   both the grain boundaries of MgB2 and the nonsuperconducting fine
   particles enhanced the trapped field of the present 700 degrees C

Abstract = {{Improved visual quality and color information in endoscopic images play
   an important role in diagnosing various gastrointestinal
   (GI)-tract-related diseases. This paper presents a grayscale-to-color
   image reproduction method, which is preceded by a pre-processing scheme,
   for endoscopic images. The color reproduction is achieved by generating
   a dictionary-based color mapping from a theme color image and then
   applying it to the pre-processed grayscale image. The theme color image
   is chosen from a nearby GI tract location of the input grayscale image
   so that the generated output color image contains similar color tone.
   The color map is dynamic as its contents change with the change of the
   theme image. The proposed method is used on low-contrast grayscale white
   light images and raw narrow band images to highlight the vascular and
   mucosa structures and to colorize the images. The method is also used to
   colorize grayscale video sequences of wireless capsule endoscopy. Based
   on the statistic visual representation, the proposed method can better
   highlight the mucosa structure compared to other methods. The color
   similarity was verified using the delta E color difference, structure
   similarity index, mean structure similarity index, and structure and hue
   similarity. The proposed algorithm has low and linear time complexity,
   which results in higher execution speed than those of related works.
   Finally, the quality of the generated color images was verified visually
   by several professional gastroenterologists, whose mean opinion score is
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{The current study separates colloidal organic carbon (COC) of municipal
   wastewater using membrane and ultrafiltration filters followed by
   characterization using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and UV
   absorbance with the goal of determination of size-specific
   characteristics, which may be used to correlate contaminant partitioning
   to natural COC. Passing fractions included 49.7, 44.8, 39.3, and 33.1
   mg/L COC for filter sizes 1.5 mu m, 0.45 mu m, 100 kDa, and 1 kDa,
   respectively. The methodology used for processing COC prior to H-1 NMR
   characterization was novel and successful in concentrating COC without
   modification of structures, which is the general drawback of other
   separation techniques such as resin extractions. This concentration
   technique is quite simple (i.e., not dependent on specialized
   instrumentation) and allows much shorter NMR experimental durations
   saving time and cost of analysis. Further work using NMR techniques will
   allow for greater understanding of COC molecular characteristics and be
   valuable for use in predictive modeling improvements.}},

Abstract = {{The surfaces of metal oxides often are reconstructed with a geometry and
   composition that is considerably different from a simple termination of
   the bulk. Such structures can also be viewed as ultrathin films,
   epitaxed on a substrate. Here, the reconstructions of the SrTiO3 (110)
   surface are studied combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM),
   transmission electron diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy
   (XAS), and analyzed with density functional theory calculations. Whereas
   SrTiO3 (110) invariably terminates with an overlayer of titania, with
   increasing density its structure switches from n X 1 to 2 X n. At the
   same time the coordination of the Ti atoms changes from a network of
   corner sharing tetrahedra to a double layer of edge-shared octahedra
   with bridging units of octahedrally coordinated strontium. This
   transition from the n X 1 to 2 X n reconstructions is a transition from
   a pseudomorphically stabilized tetrahedral network toward an octahedral
   titania thin film with stress-relief from octahedral strontia units at
   the surface.}},

   an extensive combination of two famous machine-learning algorithms: 1)
   the KNN learning; and 2) LWLR learning. Its mathematical derivation,

   is then validated based on an 8-generator 36-node system with the real

Abstract = {{We report the results of the microstructural characterizations and
   micro-texture analysis of a lightweight austenitic steel deformed at
   high strain rate (1200 s(-1)) using a split Hopkinson pressure bar.
   Formation of adiabatic shear bands (ASB) and plastic deformation
   mechanisms within neighboring grains are investigated by high-resolution
   electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD). HR-EBSD reveals formation of
   athermal epsilon-martensite and Inot sign-martensite within the shear
   bands, resulting in the formation of a brittle intersection structure.
   Crack initiation and propagation is seen in intersection structure. The
   thermally induced epsilon-martensite follows Shoji-Nishiyama
   crystallographic orientation relationship with parent austenite phase,
   while Inot sign-martensite shows Burgers relationship with
   epsilon-martensite. A detailed examination depicts the presence of
   deformation twins in grains adjacent to the ASB. Furthermore,
   strain-induced epsilon and Inot sign martensite are formed in the
   neighboring grains of ASB. The micro-texture of martensite variants is
   discussed in ASB and in the neighboring grains.}},

Abstract = {{The derivation of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function
   (BRDF) from Earth surface features provides vital data for improved
   remote estimation of Earth surface features and properties. The angular
   component of a reflectance signature represents a valuable source of
   information that has largely been ignored due to the lack of empirical
   data. BRDF data products are now readily available from a variety of
   remote sensing platforms, and these require extensive field validation
   to ensure data quality and validity. This paper presents a
   high-performance, low-cost, and computer -controlled goniometer system
   capable of sampling surface BRDF and demonstrates several example
   applications. The system introduces a number of technological advances,
   including real-time reflectance calibration, programmable sampling
   schemes, zero target interference structure, and ease of portability.
   Using this instrument, BRDF estimates were gathered from a variety of
   agricultural crops in field and laboratory settings, with performance
   gains of four times the speed of current designs. This system can
   provide very fast acquisition of a BRDF estimate, depending on the
   desired angular resolution. Initial experiments demonstrate that this
   new style of hyperspectral goniometer is a significant advance over
   previous designs, with respect to scan capabilities, angular resolution,
   calibration, and portability.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Biofuels and biomaterials are gaining increased attention because of
   their ecofriendly nature and renewable precursors. Biochar is a
   recalcitrant carbonaceous product obtained from pyrolysis of biomass and
   other biogenic wastes. Biochar has found many notable applications in
   diverse areas because of its versatile physicochemical properties. Some
   of the promising biochar applications discussed in this paper include
   char gasification and combustion for energy production, soil
   remediation, carbon sequestration, catalysis, as well as development of
   activated carbon and specialty materials with biomedical and industrial
   uses. The pyrolysis temperature and heating rates are the limiting
   factors that determine the biochar properties such as fixed carbon,
   volatile matter, mineral phases, surface area, porosity and pore size
   distribution, alkalinity, electrical conductivity, cation-exchange
   capacity, etc. A broad investigation of these properties determining
   biochar application is rare in literature. With this objective, this
   paper comprehensively reviews the evolution of biochar from several
   lignocellulosic biomasses influenced by pyrolysis temperature and
   heating rate. Lower pyrolysis temperatures produce biochar with higher
   yields, and greater levels of volatiles, electrical conductivity and
   cation-exchange capacity. Conversely, higher temperatures generate
   biochar with a greater extent of aromatic carbon, alkalinity and surface
   area with microporosity. Nevertheless, this coherent review summarizes
   the valorization potentials of biochar for various environmental,
   industrial and biomedical applications.

Title = {{Performance testing of a novel 3-fluid liquid-to-air membrane energy
   exchanger (3-fluid LAMEE) under desiccant solution regeneration
   operating conditions}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{773-786}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Liquid-to-air membrane energy exchangers (LAMEEs) use semi-permeable
   membranes to transfer heat and moisture between air and desiccant
   solution, and prevent the transfer of desiccant droplets to the air
   side. A 2-fluid flat-plate LAMEE is composed of several adjacent air and
   desiccant solution channels each separated by a semi-permeable membrane.
   A 3-fluid LAMEE is the new generation of LAMEEs which has a structure
   similar to a 2-fluid flat-plate LAMEE. The novelty of the 3-fluid LAMEE
   is that it includes titanium tubes inside the desiccant solution
   channels to control the temperature of the desiccant solution along the
   exchanger. In this paper, the performances of a 2-fluid LAMEE and
   3-fluid LAMEE are tested and compared under diluted desiccant solution
   regeneration operating conditions. Also studied are the effects of
   operating conditions (inlet heating water temperature, heating water
   mass flow rate, desiccant solution mass flow rate, and inlet desiccant
   solution temperature) on the performances of the 2-fluid and 3-fluid
   LAMEEs. For the chosen test conditions, results show that effectiveness
   and moisture removal rate of the 3-fluid LAMEE are higher than the
   2-fluid LAMEE under the entire range of inlet heating water temperature,
   heating water flow rate, and desiccant solution flow rate studied. The
   effectiveness and moisture removal rate of the 3-fluid LAMEE increase as
   the inlet heating water temperature and/or flow rate increases. The
   sensible, latent, and total effectivenesses, and moisture removal rate
   of the LAMEE increase by 38\%, 40\%, 39\%, and 6 times when the
   temperature of desiccant solution is maintained constant along the
   exchanger. Compared with the 2-fluid LAMEE, the sensible, latent, and
   total effectivenesses, and moisture removal rate of the 3-fluid LAMEE
   are improved by up to 104\%, 141\%, 128\%, and 17 times, respectively.

Abstract = {{To reduce the active power filter (APF) system switching loss, the usual
   method is to apply different soft-switching techniques. However, this
   would increase the system initial cost. In this study, a switching loss
   and switching noise reduction control strategy for APF under reactive
   power and current harmonics compensation is proposed, which can be
   applied to the existing APF systems in worldwide, thus causing economic
   benefits. The minimum dc-link operating voltage of APF is computed
   through both fundamental and harmonic frequencies analysis. Then an
   adaptive dc-link voltage controller for the APF is proposed, such that
   the compensating range of the APF is adaptively varied according to the
   variation of the loading. Thus, the switching loss and switching noise
   of the APF can be lowered. Moreover, the design criteria of the
   proportional and integral gains of the adaptive dc voltage controller
   are presented and discussed. Finally, simulation and experimental
   results of a 110 V, 5 kVA APF experimental prototype are given to prove
   the validity of the proposed control strategy for the APF in current
   quality compensation, and at the same time reducing switching loss and
   switching noise during operation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Although amorphous selenium (a-Se) has a long and successful history of
   application in optical and X-ray imaging, some of its fundamental
   properties are still puzzling. In particularly, the mechanism of carrier
   recombination following x-ray excitation and electric field and
   temperature dependences of the electron-hole pair creation energy
   (W-ehp) remain unclear. Using the combination of X-ray photocurrent and
   pulse height spectroscopy measurements, we measure W-ehp in a wide range
   of temperatures (218-320K) and electric fields (10-100 V/mm) and show
   that the conventional columnar recombination model which assumes
   Langevin recombination within a column (a primary electron track) fails
   to explain experimental results in a wide range of electric fields and
   temperatures. The reason for the failure of the conventional model is
   revealed in this work, and the theory of the columnar recombination is
   modified to include the saturation of the recombination rate at high
   electric field in order to account for the experimental results in the
   entire range of fields and temperatures. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{First principles calculations identified a phase transition in aluminium

   monoclinic 6-coordinated structure with space group C2/m. Density
   functional phonon calculations predicted its dynamical and mechanical
   stability. Infrared effective charge intensities and Raman scattering
   tensors were obtained to characterize its spectroscopic properties.
   First-principles metadynamics simulations were employed to reconstruct
   this phase transition and provide the mechanism details for

   adopts transition-metal properties via an s-d transition. At ambient

Abstract = {{We employ renormalization group (RG) summation techniques to obtain
   portions of Laplace QCD sum rules for scalar gluon currents beyond the
   order to which they have been explicitly calculated. The first two of
   these sum rules are considered in some detail, and it is shown that they
   have significantly less dependence on the renormalization scale
   parameter mu(2) once the RG summation is used to extend the perturbative
   results. Using the sum rules, we then compute the bound on the scalar
   glueball mass and demonstrate that the 3 and 4-Loop perturbative results
   form lower and upper bounds to their RG summed counterparts. We further
   demonstrate improved convergence of the RG summed expressions with
   respect to perturbative results. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Advanced concepts in thermochemical biomass conversion are indispensable
   today for efficient generation of high-quality energy products. One of
   such strategies used in this study is the impregnation of nickel
   catalyst into lignocellulosic biomasses (pinewood and wheat straw) for
   hydrothermal water gasification. The nickel-impregnated feedstocks were
   gasified in subcritical and supercritical water to study the impacts of
   temperature (300, 400 and 500 degrees C), biomass-to-water ratio (1:5
   and 1:10) and residence time (15, 30 and 45 min) at 23 -25 MPa. The
   gasification of nickel-impregnated biomasses showed considerably higher
   total gas yields (9.5-16.2 mmol/g) and hydrogen yields (2.8-5.8 mmol/g)
   with greater carbon gasification efficiency (19.6-32.6\%) when compared
   to non-catalytic gasification. Furthermore, hydrogen yields from
   nickel-impregnated biomasses were favored at an optimal temperature of
   500 degrees C, biomass-to-water ratio of 1:10 and residence time of 45
   min at 23 -25 MPa. The nickel particles doped into the lignocellulosic
   matrix acted as nanocatalysts by providing active sites for enhancing
   hydrogen production in supercritical water. Copyright (C) 2016, Hydrogen

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 8}},
Abstract = {{Guided by a simple strategy in search of new superconducting materials,
   we predict that high-temperature superconductivity can be realized in
   classes of high-density materials having strong sp(3) chemical bonding
   and high lattice symmetry. We examine in detail sodalite carbon
   frameworks doped with simple metals such as Li, Na, and Al. Though such
   materials share some common features with doped diamond, their doping
   level is not limited, and the density of states at the Fermi level in
   them can be as high as that in the renowned MgB2. Together with other
   factors, this boosts the superconducting temperature (T-c) in the
   materials investigated to higher levels compared to doped diamond. For
   example, the T-c of sodalitelike NaC6 is predicted to be above 100 K.
   This phase and a series of other sodalite-based superconductors are
   predicted to be metastable phases but are dynamically stable. Owing to
   the rigid carbon framework of these and related dense carbon materials,
   these doped sodalite-based structures could be recoverable as
   potentially useful superconductors.}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{The properties of epitaxial silicene monolayers on Ag(111) at various
   levels of oxidation are determined through complementary density
   functional theory calculations and soft X-ray spectroscopy experiments.
   Our calculations indicate that moderate levels of oxidation do not cause
   a significant bandgap opening in the epitaxial silicene monolayer,
   suggesting that oxygen functionalization is not a viable mechanism for
   bandgap tuning while the silicene monolayer remains on its metallic
   substrate. In addition, moderate oxidation is calculated to strongly
   distort the hexagonal Si lattice, causing it to cluster in regions of
   highest oxygen adatom concentration but retain its 2D sheet structure.
   However, our experiments reveal that beam-induced oxidation is
   consistent with the formation of islands of bulk-like SiO2. Complete
   exposure of the monolayer to ambient conditions results in a fully
   oxidized sample that closely resembles bulk SiO2, of which a significant
   portion is completely detached from the substrate.}},

   measurements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CERAMIC PROCESSING RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{We have studied X-ray induced effects on ZnO-P2O5 glass doped with Sm3+
   ion. The glass was synthesized by a conventional melt-quenching method
   in an ambient atmosphere. We have investigated the following three
   different effects induced by X-ray irradiation in this glass, which can
   be used for radiation sensing applications. First, although the
   as-prepared glass sample is highly transparent and homogeneous, upon
   irradiation with X-rays, the sample becomes slightly brownish due to an
   appearance of color centers induced by X-ray irradiation which can be
   measured as an optical absorption in the UV-Vis range. By utilizing the
   extent of absorption change by X-ray irradiation, it is possible to
   measure the incident radiation dose from about 0.5 to over 20 Gy.
   Second, with the Sm3+ ion included as a luminescent centre, the glass
   sample emits orange-red light upon X-ray irradiation. The integrated
   light emission is proportional to the incident X-ray dose, hence it can
   be used as a scintillator plate for online radiation monitoring. The
   confirmed exposure dose detection range for this use is approximately 1
   -300 R. Last, when an irradiated sample is heated at elevated
   temperatures from 100 to 400 degrees C, it shows a thermally-stimulated
   luminescence (TSL). The emission intensity increases with the
   accumulated X-ray dose delivered prior to the measurement, so our sample
   has a function to act as a TSL dosimeter as well. Over the radiation
   dose range we have tested, the X-ray induced effects above show linear
   response against the incident dose. The linear response is of particular
   importance for dosimetry applications since it enables us to calibrate
   the response of sample to radiation dose with high accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Automated annotation of protein function is challenging. As the number
   of sequenced genomes rapidly grows, the overwhelming majority of
   proteins can only be annotated computationally. Under new conditions or
   stimuli, not only the number and location of proteins would be changed,
   but also their interactions. This dynamic feature of protein
   interactions, however, was not considered in the existing function
   prediction algorithms. Taking the dynamic nature of protein interactions
   into consideration, we construct a dynamic weighted interactome network
   (DWIN) by integrating protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and time
   course gene expression data, as well as proteins' domain information and
   protein complex information. Then, we propose a new prediction approach
   that predicts protein functions from the constructed dynamic weighted
   interactome network. For an unknown protein, the proposed method visits
   dynamic networks at different time points and scores functions derived
   from all neighbors. Finally, the method selects top N functions from
   these ranked candidate functions to annotate the testing protein.
   Experiments on PPI datasets were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness
   of the proposed approach in predicting unknown protein functions. The
   evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms
   other competing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Space harmonics of synchronous machines are investigated in this paper
   through a specially designed synchronous machine. A 2-D finite-element
   method is used to calculate the magnetic field of the machine. The space
   harmonic magnitude and phase angle can be computed based on the magnetic
   flux density. The machine is specially designed and can be excited from
   the direct axis, quadrature axis, and various intermediate axes. The
   overall finite-element calculation accuracy is validated by the measured
   open-circuit characteristic curves. The space harmonic investigation in
   this paper provides valuable insight of the space harmonic contents of
   synchronous machines, which can help to develop a more advanced harmonic
   prediction method for the synchronous machine's design and operation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine differences in patellar subchondral bone mineral
   density (BMD) between knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients with differing
   levels of pain at rest. Methods: The preoperative knee of 41 total knee
   replacement (TKR) patients was scanned using QCT and scored for pain
   using Western Ontario McMasters Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). `Pain at
   rest' was defined as average pain while lying/sitting and nocturnal
   pain. Participants were divided into groups: `mild-to-no pain at rest'
   and `moderate-to-severe pain at rest'. We used a depth-specific CT-based
   mapping technique to measure patellar subchondral BMD at depths of 0-2.5
   mm, 2.5-5 mm, and 5-7.5 mm from the subchondral surface. Mean lateral
   and medial facet BMD were compared between groups using MANCOVA.
   Results: Mean adjusted BMD was lower in participants with
   `moderate-to-severe pain at rest' over the total lateral facet at depths
   of 0-2.5 mm (10\% lower, p=0.041), 2.5-5 mm (20\% lower, p=0.017), and
   5-7.5 mm (25\% lower, p=0.004), and over the total medial facet at 2.5-5
   mm (22\% lower, p=0.033) and 5-7.5 mm (28\% lower, p=0.016).
   Conclusions: In OA patients with `moderate-to-severe pain at rest',
   depth-specific density measures demonstrated up to 28\% lower lateral
   and medial subchondral BMD. Patients with high levels of pain at rest
   may have reduced amounts of native bone prior to TKR.}},

Abstract = {{Fast Fourier transform (FFT) coprocessor, having a significant impact on
   the performance of communication systems, has been a hot topic of
   research for many years. The FFT function consists of consecutive
   multiply add operations over complex numbers, dubbed as butterfly units.
   Applying floating-point (FP) arithmetic to FFT architectures,
   specifically butterfly units, has become more popular recently. It
   offloads compute-intensive tasks from general-purpose processors by
   dismissing FP concerns (e.g., scaling and overflow/underflow). However,
   the major downside of FP butterfly is its slowness in comparison with
   its fixed-point counterpart. This reveals the incentive to develop a
   high-speed FP butterfly architecture to mitigate FP slowness. This brief
   proposes a fast FP butterfly unit using a devised FP fused-dot-product-
   add (FDPA) unit, to compute AB +/- CD +/- E, based on
   binary-signed-digit (BSD) representation. The FP three-operand BSD adder
   and the FP BSD constant multiplier are the constituents of the proposed
   FDPA unit. A carry-limited BSD adder is proposed and used in the
   three-operand adder and the parallel BSD multiplier so as to improve the
   speed of the FDPA unit. Moreover, modified Booth encoding is used to
   accelerate the BSD multiplier. The synthesis results show that the
   proposed FP butterfly architecture is much faster than previous
   counterparts but at the cost of more area.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{534}},
Pages = {{616-629}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of the rate of water migration through unsaturated mine
   waste rock dumps is an essential element in assessing the chemical
   loading from these landforms; yet our understanding of how water moves
   into, through and out of waste rock is incomplete. To further understand
   the rates and magnitude of percolation through waste rock, deep
   high-resolution (every 0.1-4.5 m) depth profiles of the stable isotopes
   of water (delta H-2 and delta O-18) at two coal waste rock dumps and a
   natural alluvial deposit down-gradient of one of the dumps were
   collected in the Elk Valley, British Columbia, Canada. The profiles were
   generated using vapor equilibrium techniques applied to continuous core
   samples collected using dry sonic drilling methods. Elevated core
   temperatures (up to 80 degrees C) were measured during sonic coring. The
   isotopic values of pore waters measured in the core samples were
   corrected for water loss to the atmosphere attributed to the elevated
   core temperatures. The average isotopic composition of the core samples
   were compared to water collected from rock drains discharging from the
   base of the dumps. The results indicate that high-resolution profiles of
   delta H-2 and delta O-18 can be measured to depths of 86 m in coal waste
   rock dumps and, based on the seasonal cycles in the isotopic composition
   of recharging water, can be used to characterize the migration of
   recharge water within these dumps. These profiles also suggest that
   recharge into these dumps occurs from both rain as well as snow melt and
   may be as high as 400-600 mm/yr (60-75\% of annual precipitation).
   Combined with the relatively low volumetric water contents of these
   dumps (5-10\%) the rates of water migration through the dumps are tens
   of meters each year. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting of hybrid constructs is a promising
   biofabrication method for cartilage tissue engineering because a
   synthetic polymer framework and cell-impregnated hydrogel provide
   structural and biological features of cartilage, respectively. During
   bioprinting, impregnated cells may be subjected to high temperatures
   (caused by the adjacent melted polymer) and process-induced mechanical
   forces, potentially compromising cell function. This study addresses
   these biofabrication issues, evaluating the heat distribution of printed
   polycaprolactone (PCL) strands and the rheological property and
   structural stability of alginate hydrogels at various temperatures and
   concentrations. The biocompatibility of parameters from these studies
   was tested by culturing 3D hybrid constructs bioprinted with primary
   cells from embryonic chick cartilage. During initial two-dimensional
   culture expansion of these primary cells, two morphologically and
   molecularly distinct cell populations (rounded and fibroblastic) were
   isolated. The biological performance of each population was evaluated in
   3D hybrid constructs separately. The cell viability, proliferation, and
   cartilage differentiation were observed at high levels in hybrid
   constructs of both cell populations, confirming the validity of these 3D
   bioprinting parameters for effective cartilage tissue engineering.
   Statistically significant performance variations were observed, however,
   between the rounded and fibroblastic cell populations. Molecular and
   morphological data support the notion that such performance differences
   may be attributed to the relative differentiation state of rounded
   versus fibroblastic cells (i.e., differentiated chondrocytes vs.
   chondroprogenitors, respectively), which is a relevant issue for
   cell-based tissue engineering strategies. Taken together, our study
   demonstrates that bioprinting 3D hybrid constructs of PCL and
   cell-impregnated alginate hydrogel is a promising approach for cartilage
   tissue engineering.}},

   performed using small-scale energy exchangers coated with HAS15 and
   silica gel. Although N-2 gas adsorption tests showed lower sorption
   capacity for HAS(15) compared to the silica gel samples, higher sorption
   rates and uptake capacity were shown for HAS15 when measured by water
   vapor transient sorption results. In addition, the latent effectiveness,
   an indicator of moisture recovery efficiency for exchangers, exchanger.
   With the same amount of desiccant coated on the energy exchanger

Abstract = {{This review covers the characterization and distribution of metals and
   nonmetals in the Alberta oil sands region (AOSR) of Canada. The
   development of the oil sands industry has resulted in the release of
   organic, metal and nonmetal contaminants via air and water to the AOSR.
   For air, studies have found that atmospheric deposition of metals in the
   AOSR decreased exponentially with distance from the industrial emission
   sources. For water, toxic metal concentrations often exceeded safe
   levels leading to the potential for negative impacts to the receiving
   aquatic environments. Interestingly, although atmospheric deposition,,
   surface waters, fish tissues, and aquatic bird eggs exhibited increasing
   level of metals in the AOSR, reported results from river sediments
   showed no increases over time. This could be attributed to physical
   and/or chemical dynamics of the river system to transport metals to
   downstream. The monitoring of the airborne emissions of relevant
   nonmetals (nitrogen and sulphur species) was also considered over the
   AOSR. These species were found to be increasing along with the oil sands
   developments with the resultant depositions contributing to nitrogen and
   sulphur accumulations resulting in ecosystem acidification and
   eutrophication impacts. In addition to direct monitoring of
   metals/nonmetals, tracing of air emissions using isotopes was also
   discussed. Further investigation and characterization of
   metals/nonmetals emissions in the AOSR are needed to determine their
   impacts to the ecosystem and to assess the need' for further treatment
   measures to limit their continued output into the receiving
   environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An ion-pair reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
   method was developed for the analysis of sinigrin in Ethiopian mustard
   (Brassica carinata A. Braun) seed and seed fractions. Separation was
   compared on several RP-HPLC columns (Inertsil((R)) ODS-4 C-18 and
   ZORBAX((R)) Eclipse XDB-C-18) with an isocratic eluent containing 100\%
   aqueous (aq.) tetramethylammonium bromide (10mm, pH 5.0). Sinigrin
   retention was affected by HPLC variables including the type of ion-pair
   reagent, buffer strength and pH, acetonitrile concentration, column
   temperature and eluent flow rate. Partial validation demonstrated this
   optimised chromatographic condition to be linear, accurate and precise.
   Multistage extraction using 70\% (v/v) aq. methanol was more efficient
   than 50\% (v/v) aq. acetonitrile. In addition, the matrix effect and
   recovery rate as well as processing efficiency of the analytical
   protocol were determined. This method is suitable for high throughput
   analysis of sinigrin in Ethiopian mustard seed and seed fractions.}},

Abstract = {{In tissue engineering, non-invasive imaging of biomaterial scaffolds and
   tissues in living systems is essential to longitudinal animal studies
   for assessments without interrupting the repair process. Conventional
   X-ray imaging is inadequate for use in soft tissue engineering due to
   the limited absorption difference between the soft tissue and
   biomaterial scaffolds. X-ray phase-based imaging techniques that derive
   contrast from refraction or phase effects rather than absorption can
   provide the necessary contrast to see low-density biomaterial scaffolds
   and tissues in large living systems. This paper explores and compares
   three synchrotron phase-based X-ray imaging techniques computed
   tomography (CT) diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI), -analyzer based
   imaging (ABI), and-phase contrast imaging (PCI)-for visualization and
   characterization of low-density biomaterial scaffolds and tissues in
   situ for non-invasive soft tissue engineering assessments. Intact pig
   joints implanted with polycaprolactone scaffolds were used as the model
   to assess and compare the imaging techniques in terms of different
   qualitative and quantitative criteria. For long-term in vivo live animal
   imaging, different strategies for reducing the imaging radiation dose
   and scan time reduced number of CT projections, region of interest, and
   low resolution imaging were examined with the presented phase-based
   imaging techniques. The results demonstrated promising capabilities of
   the phase-based techniques for visualization of biomaterial scaffolds
   and soft tissues in situ. The low-dose imaging strategies were
   illustrated effective for reducing the radiation dose to levels
   appropriate for live animal imaging. The comparison among the imaging
   techniques suggested that CT-DEI has the highest efficiency in retaining
   image contrast at considerably low radiation doses. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   the extraction efficiency of naphthenic acids from oil sands
   process-affected water}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{146}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Naphthenic acids (NAs) from oil sand process-affected water (OSPW) were
   liquid liquid extracted using six organic solvents (n-pentane, n-hexane,
   cyclohexane, dichloromethane, ethyl ether, and ethyl acetate) at three
   pHs (2.0, 8.5, and 12.0). The NAs exist in ionic (ions) and non-ionic
   (molecules) forms in the water phase depending on their dissociation
   constants and the solution pH. Results showed the extractability of NA
   molecules depends on the solvent polarity and the extractability of NA
   ions on the water solubility in solvent. The organic solvent type and
   solution pH were found to not only impact the extracted amounts of each
   NA species, but also the NM distribution in terms of molecule carbon
   number and hydrogen deficiency. Overall, it is concluded that ethyl
   ether can be used as an alternative to dichloromethane (DCM) given their
   similar extraction efficiencies and extracted NA profiles. This is
   important since DCM is known to have metabolic toxicity and
   transitioning to the safer ethyl ether would eliminate laboratory DCM
   exposures and risk to human health. Despite the higher extraction
   efficiency of NAs at pH 2.0, extraction at pH 12.0 could be useful for
   targeted extraction of low-concentration nonpolar organic compounds in
   OSPW. This knowledge may assist in the determination of the specific NAs
   species that are known to have chronic, sub-chronic and acute toxicity
   to various organisms, and the potential targeting of treatment to these
   NAs species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the thermo-mechanical properties of thoria. Thoria is
   considered to be a candidate for a new safer nuclear fuel due to its
   higher thermal conductivity and because, unlike urania, it does not
   degrade in an oxidizing atmosphere. Thoria is also of interest since,
   like other metal oxides, it has high dielectric constant. Here we
   analyze thoria's thermo-mechanical properties using the ab initio
   method. We demonstrate that first principles calculations are valuable
   in complementing the limited experimental data available for thoria. The
   lambda phase transition is determined to be at higher temperature than
   in urania, where transition is observed at 2670 K, and therefore, in
   contrast to urania, we found that in thoria both atoms (Th and O) are
   confined at 2700 K. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{API X60 sour service (X60SS) pipeline steel was subjected to
   electrochemical hydrogen charging for different durations in order to
   evaluate its hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC) susceptibility. SEM
   observations of the hydrogen-charged specimens documented that no HIC
   cracks appeared at the cross section of steel, which is strong evidence
   of a high resistance to HIC. However, hydrogen-discharging results show
   that a considerable amount of hydrogen can enter the X60SS steel through
   its hydrogen traps. Moreover, a hydrogen-permeation test proved that the
   trapping behavior was almost identical at the center and surface layers
   of the cross section in this steel. However, the density of hydrogen
   traps at the center of the cross section was slightly higher than at the
   surface. Tensile and fatigue experiments were carried out in the air and
   in a hydrogen-charging environment using a newly constructed
   experimental setup. Tensile results show that the ductility dropped by
   83\% in the hydrogen-charging environment. Electron backscatter
   diffraction (EBSD) technique was used to analyze the HIC cracks in the
   X60SS steel. HIC cracks appeared after charging under tensile/fatigue
   tests. Therefore, high HIC-resistant steel showed susceptibility to HIC
   when charging and tensile stresses were applied simultaneously. The
   effects of different factors on HIC crack propagation such as micro
   texture, type of grain boundaries, Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM),
   special coincidence site lattice (CSL) boundaries and recrystallization
   fraction, were discussed. Copyright (C) 2016, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{This study proposes a novel optimal generation scheduling model for
   virtual power plant (VPP) considering the degradation cost of energy
   storage system (ESS). The VPP is generally formed by a mix of
   distributed energy resources, and the ESS is an important installation
   for flexible VPP dispatch due to its controllable and schedulable
   behaviours. For the operations of battery storage systems, the ambient
   temperature and depth of discharge have significant impacts on the wear
   and tear of the ESS as well as battery degradation cost. Furthermore,
   the battery degradation cost is modelled and approximated by a piecewise
   linear function, and then incorporated into the proposed optimal VPP
   scheduling model. Consequently, the optimal VPP scheduling problem is
   formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programming in
   order to maximise the expected profits of the VPP. The proposed model
   has been successfully implemented and tested through a representative
   case study, and the influence of battery degradation cost on optimal VPP
   scheduling has also been thoroughly analysed and demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Variability of wind power is one of the main concerns of power system
   operation with significant wind power. Energy storage can be employed in
   conjunction with wind power to reduce the uncertainty associated with
   wind power. This study assumes the storage facility being operated by
   the wind farm operator for the explicit purpose of minimising the risk
   of wind power commitment. A time-dependent wind power model is developed
   in conjunction with the energy storage model for short operating lead
   times that are conditional on the initial wind and storage conditions.
   This study presents a probabilistic method to assess the reliability
   contribution of energy storage using two probabilistic indices: the wind
   power commitment risk and the unit commitment risk.}},

   These structures are structurally and chemically distinct from those
   predicted for the high-pressure superconducting H2S phase, which has a
   different topology (i.e., does not contain S-S bonds). Phonon and
   electron-phonon coupling calculations indicate that both structures are
   dynamically stable and superconducting. The pressure dependence and
   critical temperature for the monoclinic (C2/m) phase of 83 K at 200 GPa
   are in excellent agreement with a recent experimental report.}},

Abstract = {{We use a pH-dependent solubility equilibrium to develop a one-pot
   aqueous synthesis of polymer carbon nanodots with novel structures. The
   chemical structure and photoluminescence (PL) were heavily influenced by
   the synthesis pH, with cross-linked polymer-carbon film (pH > 7),
   polymer carbon nanosheets (3 < pH < 7), and amorphous carbon structures
   (1 < pH < 3) achieved by altering the initial pH. Although pH-dependent
   structures frequently occur in typical semiconductors and supramolecular
   architectures involving metal, this is the first experimental work
   describing it in carbon nanodots. Supersmall carbon nanodots (SCNDs,
   similar to 0.5 nm) were obtained at pH < 1; their direct white emission
   can be easily applied as an inexpensive color-changing layer in white
   LEDs. Investigation of the PL mechanism of the SCNDs revealed an
   uncommon multilevel highly emissive recombination channel, which could
   be possibly derived from the wide distributions of surface-state PL
   centers. Theoretical calculation of the single layer of the carbon dots
   further explored their band gap changes.}},

Title = {{Gasification of fruit wastes and agro-food residues in supercritical
   water}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{296-306}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Considerable amounts of fruit wastes and agro-food residues are
   generated worldwide as a result of food processing. Converting the
   bioactive components (e.g., carbohydrates, lipids, fats, cellulose,
   hemicellulose and lignin) in food wastes to biofuels is a potential
   remediation approach. This study highlights the characterization and
   hydrothermal conversion of several fruit wastes and agro-food residues
   such as aloe vera rind, banana peel, coconut shell, lemon peel, orange
   peel, pineapple peel and sugarcane bagasse to hydrogen-rich syngas
   through supercritical water gasification. The agro-food wastes were
   gasified in supercritical water to study the impacts of temperature
   (400-600 degrees C), biomass-to-water ratio (1:5 and 1:10) and reaction
   time (15-45 min) at a pressure range of 23-25 MPa. The catalytic effects
   of NaOH and K2CO3 were also investigated to maximize the hydrogen yields
   and selectivity. The elevated temperature (600 degrees C), longer
   reaction time (45 min) and lower feed concentration (1:10
   biomass-to-water ratio) were optimal for higher hydrogen yield (0.91
   mmol/g) and total gas yield (5.5 mmol/g) from orange peel. However,
   coconut shell with 2 wt\% K2CO3 at 600 degrees C and 1:10
   biomass-to-water ratio for 45 min revealed superior hydrogen yield (4.8
   mmol/g), hydrogen selectivity (45.8\%) and total gas yield (15 mmol/g)
   with enhanced lower heating value of the gas product (1595 kJ/Nm(3)).
   The overall findings suggest that supercritical water gasification of
   fruit wastes and agro-food residues could serve as an effective organic
   waste management technology with regards to bioenergy production. (C)

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{Greigite (Fe3S4) is a ferrimagnetic mineral with vital functions in both
   the bio-geochemical cycle and novel technological applications. However,
   the ground state electronic structure of this material has not been
   fully characterized by either experiment or theory. In the present
   study, ab initio calculations using the hybrid functional method have
   been performed to investigate the electronic structure and magnetic
   properties. It is found that the cubic structure observed under ambient
   temperature is a half metal and is metastable. A more stable monoclinic
   structure slightly distorted from the cubic form is found. The
   structural distortion is induced by charge ordering and associated with
   a metal-to-insulator transition, resulting in a semiconductive ground
   state with a bandgap of similar to 0.8 eV and a magnetic moment of 4 mu
   B per formula unit. The results predict, similar to the magnetite
   (Fe3O4), a Verwey transition may exist in greigite, although it has not
   yet been observed experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{AA 2219 aluminum alloy is characterised by high temperature strength,
   good weldability and excellent suitability as choice material for
   several components in defense and aerospace structures. In this paper,
   the dynamic impact response of cylindrical specimens of AA 2219-T8 alloy
   was investigated using the split Hopkinson pressure bar while strain
   evolution during the dynamic deformation was monitored in situ using
   digital image correlation (DIC) technique. The results of DIC analysis
   and microstructural evaluation of the impacted specimens indicated
   occurrence of heterogeneous deformation characterised by intense shear
   strain localization. The strain localisation became noticeable after 80
   s from the start of deformation. Both transformed and deformed shear
   bands developed in the specimens and they cracked along the transformed
   bands at high strain rates. Microstructural analysis of the as-received
   alloy suggested that it consists of two type of dispersed second phase
   particles: coarse particles which are 10-45 mu m in size and fine
   precipitates of sizes less than 1 mu m. Intense adiabatic heating and
   strain localization led to the dissolution of the coarse second phase
   particles inside the transformed bands while the fine second phase
   particles survived the heat. The dynamic mechanical response of the
   alloy and its tendency to form adiabatic shear bands are influenced by
   the length to diameter ratio of the cylindrical test specimens. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Due to the intrinsic lack of restoring paths, dynamic logic circuits
   have significant single-event susceptibility, and thus, they are not

   static logic. However, in high speed applications, this circuit family
   is still very attractive. This papers presents two layout-based
   single-event resilient dynamic logic designs. The resultant SET pulse is
   suppressed because of charge-sharing in the layout-level. Simulation
   results verify that they enjoy higher single event tolerance.
   Experimental results validate the fact that approximately 20 similar to
   30 \% of magnitude reduction in cross-section is achieved in both
   designs. On the other hand, the increase in single-event performance is
   achieved at the expense of power and area overheads of 10 and 15 \%,
   respectively, using our layout style in 130 nm CMOS bulk technology.}},

Abstract = {{The void size distribution inside a packed bed is one of the most
   important parameters affecting the reactor performance. The non-uniform
   distribution of material and energy flows can be avoided by a reasonable
   arrangement of the void size distribution. In this work, the void size
   distributions in a packed bed with structured and random packing were
   investigated through both theoretical calculations and statistical
   analysis of experimental results to characterize the bed voids between
   the particles. In theoretical analysis, the equivalent diameters of
   voids at different two-dimensional layers in a packed bed with three
   types of structured packing were first calculated, and then the wax
   replacement method was adopted to measure the voids inside a randomly
   packed bed. Different two-dimensional layers of the bed were sliced and
   photographed for further analysis. The effects of particle size, shape,
   and packing method were investigated, and the results showed that the
   relative void size (void size/particle size) was not affected by the
   particle size. In contrast, the particle shape, which can be represented
   by particle sphericity, significantly affected the void size
   distribution. A more flat void size distribution curve was obtained for
   particles with sphericity close to unity. A new correlation was
   established based on statistical analysis of the experimental data to
   account for the void size distribution. This new correlation was
   validated by predicting the pressure drop of a packed bed and the
   results of comparison showed good agreement with experimental results.

Journal = {{QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the hydrogeological processes that caused
   unexpected instability and quick conditions during the excavation of a
   25 m deep cutting through a drumlin in County Down, Northern Ireland. A
   conceptual hydrogeological model of the cutting, based on pore pressures
   monitored during and after the excavation, demonstrates how quick
   conditions at the toe of the cutting caused liquefaction of the till.
   Stability of the cutting was re-established by draining the highly
   permeable, weathered greywacke that underlies the drumlin, through the
   use of a deep toe drain. In spite of this drainage, the cutting was only
   marginally stable, owing to the presence of a low-permeability zone in
   the till above the bedrock, which limits the reduction of elevated pore
   pressures within the upper to mid-depths of the drumlin. The factor of
   safety has been further improved by the addition of vertical relief
   drains at the crest and berm of the cutting to relieve the pore
   pressures within the upper till by intercepting the weathered bedrock.
   The paper also highlights the importance of carrying out an adequate
   site investigation compliant with Eurocode 7 and additional monitoring
   in excavations in stiff, low-permeability till.}},

Abstract = {{A Summary Precision errors of cortical bone micro-architecture from
   high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT)
   ranged from 1 to 16 \% and did not differ between automatic or manually
   modified endocortical contour methods in postmenopausal women or young
   adults. In postmenopausal women, manually modified contours led to
   generally higher cortical bone properties when compared to the automated
   method.
   Introduction First, the objective of the study was to define in vivo
   precision errors (coefficient of variation root mean square (CV\%(RMS)))
   and least significant change (LSC) for cortical bone micro-architecture
   using two endocortical contouring methods: automatic (AUTO) and manually
   modified (MOD) in two groups (postmenopausal women and young adults)
   from high-resolution pQCT (HR-pQCT) scans. Second, it was to compare
   precision errors and bone outcomes obtained with both methods within and
   between groups.
   Methods Using HR-pQCT, we scanned twice the distal radius and tibia of
   34 postmenopausal women (mean age +/- SD 74 +/- 7 years) and 30 young
   adults (27 +/- 9 years). Cortical micro-architecture was determined
   using AUTO and MOD contour methods. CV\%(RMS) and LSC were calculated.
   Repeated measures and multivariate ANOVA were used to compare mean CV\%
   and bone outcomes between the methods within and between the groups.
   Significance was accepted at P < 0.05.
   Results CV\%(RMS) ranged from 0.9 to 16.3 \%. Within-group precision did
   not differ between evaluation methods. Compared to young adults,
   postmenopausal women had better precision for radial cortical porosity
   (precision difference 9.3 \%) and pore volume (7.5 \%) with MOD. Young
   adults had better precision for cortical thickness (0.8 \%, MOD) and
   tibial cortical density (0.2 \%, AUTO). In postmenopausal women, MOD
   resulted in 0.2-54 \% higher values for most cortical outcomes, as well
   as 6-8 \% lower radial and tibial cortical BMD and 2 \% lower tibial
   cortical thickness.
   Conclusions Results suggest that AUTO and MOD endocortical contour
   methods provide comparable repeatability. In postmenopausal women,
   manual modification of endocortical contours led to generally higher
   cortical bone properties when compared to the automated method, while no
   between-method differences were observed in young adults.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated X-ray induced radioluminescence (XL) properties of
   Sm-doped fluorochlorozirconate (FCZ) glasses and glass-ceramics. The FCZ
   glass is a modified ZBLAN glass which shows a very high optical
   transmission over a wide spectral range. The glass matrix includes
   Sm3+-doped nanocrystals of BaCl2 after heat-treatment at temperatures
   above 250 degrees C. The glass-ceramic emits red light under UV and
   X-ray exposure. Since conventional Si-based photodetectors, e.g., CCDs,
   have the highest quantum efficiency to red light in general, the
   Sm-doped FCZ glass-ceramic plate can be a good candidate as a
   scintillator material for indirect radiation detection. Moreover, a very
   broad emission is present in the glass-ceramic around 300-500 nm, which
   is attributed to a self-trapped exciton (STE) emissions. The temperature
   dependence of X-ray induced luminescence and photoluminescence are very
   similar. The XL light yield is linearly proportional to the X-ray
   exposure rate for rates higher than 20mR/s. For low exposure rates,
   emissions by Sm2+ are more sensitive than others, leading to a nonlinear
   response. (C) 2016 The Japan Society of Applied Physics}},

Abstract = {{Manganese fluoride (MnF2) with the tetragonal rutile-type structure has
   been studied using a synchrotron angle-dispersive powder x-ray
   diffraction and Raman spectroscopy in a diamond anvil cell up to 60 GPa
   at room temperature combined with first-principles density functional
   calculations. The experimental data reveal two pressure-induced
   structural phase transitions with the following sequence: rutile. SrI2
   type (3 GPa). alpha-PbCl2 type (13 GPa). Complete structural
   information, including interatomic distances, has been determined in the
   case of MnF2 including the exact structure of the debated first
   high-pressure phase. First-principles density functional calculations
   confirm this phase transition sequence, and the two calculated
   transition pressures are in excellent agreement with the experiment.
   Lattice dynamics calculations also reproduce the experimental Raman
   spectra measured for the ambient and high-pressure phases. The results
   are discussed in line with the possible practical use of rutile-type

Title = {{Integrating Supply Uncertainties from Stochastic Modeling into
   Integrated Water Resource Management: Case Study of the Saskatchewan
   River Basin}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A warming climate and land management intensification have altered water
   supply characteristics in many regions of the world. Incorporation of
   water supply uncertainties into long-term water resources planning and
   management is, therefore, significant from both a scientific and
   societal perspective. This study proposes a set of analyses for
   integrated water resources management under changing water supply and
   demand expansion based on a newly developed methodology for
   vulnerability assessment. The basin of interest for the proposed
   analysis is the interprovincial Saskatchewan River Basin (SaskRB) in
   Canada, which supports a wide range of water demands, from municipal and
   industrial use to irrigated agriculture and hydropower. Proposals for an
   increase in irrigated area are used as a context for exploring the joint
   effects of current and future water supply uncertainty and increasing
   irrigation demand conditions on the water resources system. Changing
   water supply conditions are represented by perturbing annual volumes and
   the seasonal timing of the hydrograph peak as input to an integrated
   water resources model. The analysis enables evaluation of the effects of
   economic development plans as well as variations in volume and peak
   timing of flows on water availability and economic productivity,
   including possibilities for failure to meet demands. Results for the
   SaskRB show that a large increase in irrigated agriculture raises
   average net revenues, but these are highly dependent on water supply
   conditions and loss of revenue may arise under drought conditions.
   Hydropower production is more sensitive to changes in annual inflow
   volume than to changes in either annual timing of the peak flow or the
   magnitude of irrigation expansion. Irrigation expansion can considerably
   affect the peak flows in the Saskatchewan River Delta, the largest
   inland delta in North America, during low-flow conditions. For example,
   a 400\% increase in irrigated area under a 25\% decrease in inflow
   volume and 4-week-earlier annual peak timing can reduce the frequency of
   peak flows in the delta by more than 50\%, though potential effects on
   the riparian and aquatic ecosystems remain uncertain. This case study
   illustrates the practical utility of stochastic analysis of system
   vulnerability to feasible futures in such a way that socioeconomic
   trade-offs can be readily visualized and understood. Such performance
   assessments are useful for long-term water resources planning and
   management under water supply uncertainty. (C) 2015 American Society of

Abstract = {{Markov clustering (MCL) is a commonly used algorithm for clustering
   networks in bioinformatics. It shows good performance in clustering
   dynamic protein-protein interaction networks (DPINs). However, a
   limitation of MCL and its variants (e.g, regularized MCL and soft
   regularized MCL) is that the clustering results are mostly dependent on
   the parameters whose values are user-specified. In this study, we
   propose a new MCL method based on the firefly algorithm (FA) to identify
   protein complexes from DPIN. Based on three-sigma principle, we
   construct the DPIN and discuss an overall modeling process. In order to
   optimize parameters, we exploit a number of population-based
   optimization methods. A thorough comparison completed for different
   swarm optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   and firefly algorithm (FA) has been carried out. The identified protein
   complexes on the DIP dataset show that the new algorithm outperforms the
   state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy of protein complex
   identification. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Connections between chiral Lagrangians and QCD sum-rules}},
Journal = {{MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, it is shown how a chiral Lagrangian framework can be used
   to derive relationships connecting quark-level QCD correlation functions
   to mesonic-level two-point functions. Crucial ingredients of this
   connection are scale factor matrices relating each distinct quark-level
   substructure (e.g. quark-antiquark, four-quark) to its mesonic
   counterpart. The scale factors and mixing angles are combined into a
   projection matrix to obtain the physical (hadronic) projection of the
   QCD correlation function matrix. Such relationships provide a powerful
   bridge between chiral Lagrangians and QCD sum-rules that are
   particularly effective in studies of the substructure of light scalar
   mesons with multiple complicated resonance shapes and substantial
   underlying mixings. The validity of these connections is demonstrated
   for the example of the isotriplet a(0)(980)-a(0)(1450) system, resulting
   in an unambiguous determination of the scale factors from the combined
   inputs of QCD sum-rules and chiral Lagrangians. These scale factors lead
   to a remarkable agreement between the quark condensates in QCD and the
   mesonic vacuum expectation values that induce spontaneous chiral
   symmetry breaking in chiral Lagrangians. This concrete example shows a
   clear sensitivity to the underlying a(0)-system mixing angle,
   illustrating the value of this methodology in extensions to more
   complicated mesonic systems.}},

Abstract = {{CeO2 is a promising material for applications in optoelectronics and
   photovoltaics due to its large band gap and values of the refractive
   index and lattice parameters, which are suitable for silicon-based
   devices. In this study, we show that trivalent Sm, Nd and Yb ions can be
   successfully inserted and optically activated in CeO2 films grown at a
   relatively low deposition temperature (400 degrees C), which is
   compatible with inorganic photovoltaics. CeO2 thin films can therefore
   be efficiently functionalized with photon-management properties by
   doping with trivalent rare earth (RE) ions. Structural and optical
   analyses provide details of the electronic level structure of the films
   and of their energy transfer mechanisms. In particular, we give evidence
   of the existence of an absorption band centered at 350 nm from which
   energy transfer to rare earth ions occurs. The transfer mechanisms can
   be completely explained only by considering the spontaneous migration of
   Ce3+ ions in CeO2 at a short distance from the RE3+ ions. The strong
   absorption cross section of the f-d transitions in Ce3+ ions efficiently
   intercepts the UV photons of the solar spectrum and therefore strongly
   increases the potential of these layers as downshifters and
   downconverters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a low-noise amplifier (LNA) design for multifunction
   receiver front-end. Based on the conventional noise cancelling
   technique, a gain-enhanced noise cancelling structure is presented and
   the effect of gain-enhanced stage is discussed. The wideband input
   matching is realized by a current-reuse common-source stage with an
   active feedback structure to alleviate the tradeoffs between NF, gain,
   and bandwidth. A peaking gate inductor is inserted to improve gain
   flatness and bandwidth of the designed amplifier. The proposed LNA was
   implemented in the 0.130 mu m CMOS technology. It achieves a S11 of <-10
   dB in a wide frequency range 0.1-8 GHz and a gain of >14 dB with a 14.5
   dB peak. Over this range, a minimum NF of 2.6 dB is achieved and the
   total power consumption is only 17 mW from a power supply of 1.2V. The
   results indicate that the proposed structure effectively improves the
   gain of conventional noise cancelling technique while the noise
   elimination and wideband input matching are maintained.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Multiferroics have been of interest as materials for use in data storage
   due to their coexisting ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties. The
   properties of cupric oxide have been studied at pressures below 70 GPa,
   and it has even been suggested that it may be a room temperature
   multiferroic at pressures of 20 to 40 GPa. However, the properties of
   cupric oxide above these pressures have yet to be thoroughly examined.
   Here, we investigate changes in the crystal structure of cupric oxide
   via first principles methods. We find that the crystal structure
   transforms from a monoclinic structure at low pressure to a face-centred
   cubic and body-centred cubic structure at high pressure. We also find
   that the magnetic ordering switches from antiferromagnetic in the
   monoclinic phase to net zero magnetic moment in the face-centred cubic
   phase and ferromagnetic in the body-centred cubic phase. This shift in
   magnetic ordering is due to the superexchange interactions and
   Jahn-Teller instabilities, or the lack of thereof, arising from the
   d-orbital electrons of the cupric ions, which disrupt the mechanical
   stability of other possible magnetic orderings.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we used a combination of X-ray diffraction and electron
   backscatter diffraction (EBSD) to track the evolution of both the
   microstructure and texture in samples of X70 pipeline steel subjected to
   cold-rolling up to 80\% thickness reduction and subsequent annealing at
   800 degrees C and 850 degrees C. Our investigation of the macro-texture,
   using an X-ray method, indicates that weak texture in the
   as-received-steel was changed from zeta-fiber to gamma-fiber and circle
   minus-fiber after cold rolling. EBSD reveals a local grain refinement as
   a result of the formation of a substructure with a low angle grain
   boundary within cold-rolled ferrite grains near the gamma-fiber and
   circle minus-fiber textures. Development of a later substructure
   depended on the orientation of deformed ferrite grains. We observed
   partial recrystallization within grains with gamma-fiber texture and a
   grain size of about 1.5 +/- 0.5 mu m after cold rolling. Annealing at
   800 degrees C for 90 s caused incomplete static recrystallization with
   an inhomogeneous bimodal structure. Recrystallized grains depicted both
   gamma-fiber and circle minus-fiber textures, identical to their
   deformation textures. We achieved a homogeneous equiaxied grain
   structure using a higher annealing temperature of 850 degrees C, for 300
   s. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Naphthenic acids (NAs) found in oil sands process-affected waters (OSPW)
   have known environmental toxicity and are resistant to conventional
   wastewater treatments. The granular activated carbon (GAC) biofilm
   treatment process has been shown to effectively treat OSPW NAs via
   combined adsorption/biodegradation processes despite the lack of
   research investigating their individual contributions. Presently, the
   NAs removals due to the individual processes of adsorption and
   biodegradation in OSPW bioreactors were determined using sodium azide to
   inhibit biodegradation. For raw OSPW, after 28 days biodegradation and
   adsorption contributed 14\% and 63\% of NA removal, respectively. For
   ozonated OSPW, biodegradation removed 18\% of NAs while adsorption
   reduced NAs by 73\%. Microbial community 454-pyrosequencing of
   bioreactor matrices indicated the importance of biodegradation given the
   diverse carbon degrading families including Acidobacteriaceae,
   Ectothiorhodospiraceae, and Comamonadaceae. Overall, results highlight
   the ability to determine specific processes of NAs removals in the

Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{262}},

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The saturated hydraulic conductivity (KO is a key property in the design
   of reclamation soils, influencing key aspects of the water balance
   including infiltration and net percolation. The conventional field
   method of measuring K-s for reclamation soils has been the use of water
   infiltration tests such as the Guelph permeameter (GP). However, the
   time required to conduct a large number of water infiltration tests can
   make it difficult to obtain a sufficiently large dataset to define the
   spatial variability of the large areas associated with mine site
   reclamation. The objectives of this study were: (1) to compare the K-s
   estimated from air permeability measurements with those measured using a
   GP and (2) to use air permeability measurements to characterize spatial
   variations of K-s for two reclamation sites, one on a lean oil sands
   dump at the Aurora oil sands mine in Northern Alberta, and a second on a
   waste rock storage area at the Key Lake Uranium Mine in Northern
   Saskatchewan. The results indicated that the K-s values estimated from
   air permeability measurements were similar to,those measured using a GP
   if the air permeability measurements were adjusted for differences
   between in situ water contents and field capacity water contents. The
   probability distributions of K-s values obtained from both measurement
   methods were also found to be similar at a 0.01 level of confidence.
   Geostatistical analysis revealed a weak spatial dependency in K-s
   values, with an effective range of 158 m for the Aurora site and a
   non-significant spatial structure for Ks at the Key Lake mine site. This
   paper provides a practical example of how air permeability measurements
   combined with a limited program of GP testing can be used to
   characterize spatial variability of K-s on reclamation soils. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A kinetic study was carried out over Rh-Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst for the
   oxidative steam reforming of ethanol (OSRE). A Langmuir-Hinshelwood
   approach based on proposed surface reaction mechanisms was used to
   develop the kinetic models for the OSRE process. Oxidative steam
   reforming (OSRE), ethanol decomposition (ED), and water-gas shift (WGS)
   reactions were considered as the main reaction pathway to represent the
   Vera. OSRE process. Kinetic data were collected in a fixed bed reactor
   under the kinetic-control regime at three different temperatures. The
   kinetic parameters were estimated using a nonlinear regression method.
   The kinetic model was developed by considering dehydrogenation of
   adsorbed ethoxy species, decomposition of formate species, and
   decomposition of acetaldehyde as the rate-determining step for OSRE,
   WGS, and ED reactions, respectively. The developed model fitted well
   with the experimental observations at all studied temperatures and
   contact time. The activation energy for OSRE, WGS, and ED reactions
   obtained was 56.0, 46.1, and 34.8 kJ/mol, respectively. The results
   revealed that the proposed Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanistic kinetic
   model (model LH-II) is suitable for the OSRE process.}},

Abstract = {{High-pressure polymorphism and phase transitions have wide ranging
   consequences on the basic properties of ammonium nitrate. However, the
   phase diagram of ammonium nitrate at high pressure and high temperature
   is still under debate. This study systematically investigates the phase
   transitions and structural properties of ammonium nitrate at a pressure
   range of 5-60 GPa and temperature range of 250-400 K by ab initio
   molecular dynamics simulations. Two new phases are identified: one
   corresponds to the experimentally observed phase IV' and the other is
   named AN-X. Simultaneously, the lattice strains play a significant role
   in the formation and stabilization of phase IV', providing a reasonable
   explanation for experimental observation of phase IV-IV' transition
   which only appears under nonhydrostatic pressure. In addition, 12 O
   atoms neighboring the N-H (N atom in ammonium cation) atom are selected
   as reference system to clearly display the tanglesome rotation of
   ammonium cation.}},

Abstract = {{Synchrotron source propagation-based X-ray phase contrast computed
   tomography is increasingly used in pre-clinical imaging. However, it
   typically requires a large number of projections, and subsequently a
   large radiation dose, to produce high quality images. To improve the
   applicability of this imaging technique, reconstruction algorithms that
   can reduce the radiation dose and acquisition time without degrading
   image quality are needed. The proposed research focused on using a novel
   combination of Douglas-Rachford splitting and randomized Kaczmarz
   algorithms to solve large-scale total variation based optimization in a
   compressed sensing framework to reconstruct 2D images from a reduced
   number of projections. Visual assessment and quantitative performance
   evaluations of a synthetic abdomen phantom and real reconstructed image
   of an ex-vivo slice of canine prostate tissue demonstrate that the
   proposed algorithm is competitive in reconstruction process compared
   with other well-known algorithms. An additional potential benefit of
   reducing the number of projections would be reduction of time for motion
   artifact to occur if the sample moves during image acquisition. Use of
   this reconstruction algorithm to reduce the required number of
   projections in synchrotron source propagation-based X-ray phase contrast
   computed tomography is an effective form of dose reduction that may pave
   the way for imaging of in-vivo samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a real-time preprocessing algorithm for image
   enhancement for endoscopic images. A novel dictionary based color
   mapping algorithm is used for reproducing the color information from a
   theme image. The theme image is selected from a nearby anatomical
   location. A database of color endoscopy image for different location is
   prepared for this purpose. The color map is dynamic as its contents
   change with the change of the theme image. This method is used on low
   contrast grayscale white light images and raw narrow band images to
   highlight the vascular and mucosa structures and to colorize the images.
   It can also be applied to enhance the tone of color images. The
   statistic visual representation and universal image quality measures
   show that the proposed method can highlight the mucosa structure
   compared to other methods. The color similarity has been verified using
   Delta E color difference, structure similarity index, mean structure
   similarity index and structure and hue similarity. The color enhancement
   was measured using color enhancement factor that shows considerable
   improvements. The proposed algorithm has low and linear time complexity,
   which results in higher execution speed than other related works.}},

Abstract = {{Cylindrical specimens of AA 2017 alloy in T451, T651 and O temper
   conditions were subjected to quasi-static compressive loading at a
   strain rate of 3.2 x 10(-3) s(-1) dynamic impact loading at strain rates
   between 3000 s(-1) and 8000 s(-1). The effects of strain rates and
   temper condition on damage evolution were investigated. Deformation
   under quasi-static loading was dominated by strain hardening while high
   strain rates deformation was characterized by two-peak stress-strain
   curves, indicating simultaneous occurrence of hardening and softening
   controlling deformation. The degree of softening after the first peak is
   highest in the annealed sample while the age-hardened specimens showed
   higher degree of softening beyond the second peak. Both deformed and
   transformed shear bands were observed in the impacted age-hardened
   specimens, whereas only deformed bands developed in the annealed
   specimens. The critical strains for the onset of the thermomechanical
   instability leading to the formation of adiabatic shear bands are about
   the same for both T451 and T651 specimens, but much higher for the
   annealed (O) specimens. The age-hardened specimens fractured in a manner
   consistent with ductile fracture mode that is characterized by the
   sequential nucleation, growth and coalescence of micro-voids inside

Journal = {{ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-16}},

Abstract = {{Information systems are a kind of service systems and they are
   throughout every element of a modern industrial and business system,
   much like blood in our body. Types of information systems are
   heterogeneous because of extreme uncertainty in changes in modern
   industrial and business systems. To effectively manage information
   systems, modelling of the work domain (or domain) of information systems
   is necessary. In this paper, a domain modelling framework for the
   service system is proposed and its application to the enterprise
   information system is outlined. The framework is defined based on
   application of a general domain modelling tool called
   function-context-behaviour-principle-state-structure (FCBPSS). The
   FCBPSS is based on a set of core concepts, namely: function, context,
   behaviour, principle, state and structure and system decomposition.
   Different from many other applications of FCBPSS in systems engineering,
   the FCBPSS is applied to both infrastructure and substance systems,
   which is novel and effective to modelling of service systems including
   enterprise information systems. It is to be noted that domain modelling
   of systems (e.g. enterprise information systems) is a key to integration
   of heterogeneous systems and to coping with unanticipated situations
   facing to systems.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible load response allows to manage local power consumption in
   response to supply conditions, such as high market price, peak demand or
   regulation signal, thus, lower grid operating costs, increased system
   reliability and improved energy efficiency can be achieved. Besides,
   demand response becomes large contributor to overall building expense
   reduction, especially in large grid-congested cities. HVAC system in
   commercial building accounts for a huge amount of power consumption and
   greatly contributes to the peak load. In this work, we propose an
   economic model predictive controller based on a thermal dynamic building
   model that discussed in our previous work. Simulation results show that
   the proposed controller can effectively and optimally control the HVAC
   system to utilize the time-varying electricity prices and the future
   disturbances to minimize the electricity costs, significantly reduce the
   peak demand and increase energy saving and efficiency, while respecting
   the comfort level.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) plays a significant role in the
   non-invasive small intestine screening for obscure gastrointestinal
   bleeding detection. However, the task of reviewing 60,000 frames to
   detect the bleeding encumbers the clinician, leading to visual fatigue
   and false diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a color feature based
   bleeding detection system with feature selection using a modified ant
   colony optimization (MACO) algorithm. We have utilized the feature
   selection capability of MACO algorithm to find the optimum feature
   subset over the color space of RGB and HSV, which provided a classifier
   that outperforms the classifier formed from RGB and HSV features
   individually. Comprehensive experimental results reveal that the
   proposed MACO algorithm can detect the optimal feature subset with
   performance comparable to exhaustive search in case of individual
   classifier from RGB and HSV requiring 2\% of the computational time
   compared to exhaustive search. The comparative study of feature
   selection showed that MACO can provide the most relevant features and
   improve the performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and
   computational time.}},

Abstract = {{Capsule endoscopy (CE), introduced as a modality for non-invasive
   examination of entire gastrointestinal tract, demands for an efficient
   computer-aided decision making system to relieve the physician from the
   responsibility of screening around 60,000 video frames per patient. An
   automatic and robust segmentation algorithm can aid the automation of CE
   screening and decision making procedure. In this paper, we propose a new
   segmentation algorithm based on GrowCut and apply the algorithm for CE
   images containing bleeding. To substitute the manual seed input in
   traditional GrowCut segmentation, the proposed Automated GrowCut (AGC)
   algorithm initially segments the images using clustering. The cluster
   centroids, subsequently labeled as bleeding, non-bleeding and background
   by a trained SVM classifier, serve as seeds for the GrowCut
   segmentation. A comprehensive evaluation and comparison with respect to
   ground truth exhibits that the proposed method can achieve a Dice
   Similarity Coefficient of 0.81, comparable to the interactive GrowCut,
   requiring only 13.96\% of the computation time of interactive GrowCut.
   The comparison with two other state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation
   methods, unsupervised GrowCut and Fuzzy c-means, further justifies the
   suitability of the proposed method for automated segmentation and
   annotation of CE images.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a modification of reference-model adaptive control
   with a layered network of higher-order neural units (HONUs) as adaptive
   state-feedback controllers. The degree of freedom of such neural
   controller is deemed here as the number of applied HONUs of a
   customizable polynomial order and as of their individually customizable
   input vectors. Furthermore, the control scheme is enhanced because
   potentially occurring disturbances of controlled variable can result in
   that the sample-by-sample adapted controllers may tend to adaptively
   force the plant output to merely follow the reference model output
   because input data are affected by the error of disturbance, while the
   overall control loop dynamics would be more accurately adapted if no
   perturbation occurs or if the reference model is actuated with actually
   measured variables. Furthermore, the controller weight updates usually
   involve some step-delayed computations that might be in fact
   recalculated with the latest updated weights, so the controller learning
   can be improved.}},

Abstract = {{The circuit components of a Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) system are
   designed considering a fixed separation distance and fixed alignment
   between the transmitting and receiving sides of the WPT system. But, in
   practice, the separation distance and the alignment do not remain
   constant. This is especially true for a biomedical application where a
   moving instrumental part requires electric power. This change causes a
   variation in mutual coupling and consequently in the efficiency of the
   system. This paper describes how to maintain the efficiency more or less
   constant even if the separation distance and the alignment vary. First
   of all, the circuit elements for maximum efficiency are worked out, then
   simulation for various separation distances and misalignment are
   calculated. A means of controlling a particular parameter is worked out

Abstract = {{An efficient and automated abnormality detection method can
   significantly reduce the burden of screening of the enormous visual
   information resulting from capsule endoscopic procedure. As a
   pre-processing stage, color enhancement could be useful to improve the
   image quality and the detection performance. Therefore, in this paper,
   we have proposed a two-stage automated abnormality detection algorithm.
   In the first stage, an adaptive color enhancement method based on
   Retinex theory is applied on the endoscopic images. In the second stage,
   an efficient salient region detection algorithm is applied to detect the
   clinically significant regions. The proposed algorithm is applied on a
   dataset containing images with diverse pathologies. The algorithm can
   successfully detect a significant percentage of the abnormal regions.
   From our experiment, it was evident that color enhancement method
   improves the performance of abnormality detection. The proposed
   algorithm can achieve a sensitivity of 97.33\% and specificity of 79\%,
   higher than state-of-the-art performance.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the utilization of clinical resources and improve the
   efficiency of healthcare, it is often necessary to accurately locate
   patients and doctors in a healthcare facility. However, existing
   tracking methods, such as GPS, Wi-Fi and RFID, have technological
   drawbacks or impose significant costs, thus limiting their applications
   in many clinical environments, especially those with indoor enclosures.
   This paper proposes a low-cost and flexible tracking system that is well
   suited for operating in an indoor environment. Based on readily
   available RF transceivers and microcontrollers, our wearable sensor
   system can facilitate locating users (e. g., patients or doctors) or
   objects (e. g., medical devices) in a building. The strategic
   construction of the sensor system, along with a suitably designed
   tracking algorithm, together provide for reliability and dispatch in
   localization performance. For demonstration purposes, several simplified
   experiments, with different configurations of the system, are
   implemented in two testing rooms to assess the baseline performance.
   From the obtained results, our system exhibits immense promise in
   acquiring a user location and corresponding time-stamp, with high
   accuracy and rapid response. This capability is conducive to both
   short-and long-term data analytics, which are crucial for improving
   healthcare management.}},

Abstract = {{Stress testing is used to measure the performance of the heart in an
   elevated stress state, in order to monitor or diagnose certain heart
   problems. Many measurements can be used to determine the performance of
   the heart, with the Tei index being the measurement of interest in this
   work. The Tei index has been used as a reliable method to evaluate
   systolic and diastolic performance, as it overcomes some limitations of
   the classical echocardiographic indices. It is calculated based on the
   time intervals derived from echocardiography. This paper presents an
   exploratory study, which uses an accelerometer to record mechanical
   events occurring in each cardiac cycle, also known as the
   seismocardiogram (SCG). From timing measurements corresponding to
   various events in the heart, a metric for myocardial performance is
   calculated based on the Tei index. The use of SCG in addition to ECG has
   the potential to provide further insights about the heart during stress
   testing, since the SCG quantifies mechanical actions of the heart.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing evidences have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important
   roles in many diseases. The environmental factors (EFs) can regulate the
   expression level of miRNAs in human tissues. Therefore, identifying
   potential miRNA-environmental factor interactions is helpful not only
   for understanding the pathogenesis of diseases, but also for disease
   diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. In this paper, we propose a
   computational framework, MEI-BRWMLL (MiRNA-EF Interaction prediction
   based on Bi-Random walk and Multi-Label Learning), to identify
   interactions between miRNAs and environmental factors. The sequence and
   topology information of miRNA and structure, anatomical therapeutic
   chemical and topology information of environmental factor are employed
   to measure similarity of miRNAs and environmental factors, respectively.
   In addition, we use similarity network fusion method to integrate
   biological information of miRNAs and environmental factors,
   respectively. In the last, the bi-random walk and multi-label learning
   method are utilized to identify potential miRNA-environmental factor
   interactions. In order to evaluate the performance of MEI-BRWMLL, we
   implement the ten-fold cross validation in the experiment. The
   MEI-BRWMLL achieves an AUC of 0.8208. It has been shown that MEI-BRWMLL
   is able to identify known miRNA-environmental factor interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Networks are employed to represent many real world complex systems. For
   biological systems, biomolecules interact with each other to form
   so-called biomolecular networks. The explorations on the connections
   between structural control theory and biological networks have uncovered
   some interesting biological phenomena. Recently, some studies have paid
   attentions to the structural controllability of networks in notion of
   the minimum steering sets (MSSs). However, the MSSs for a complex
   network are not unique. Therefore, it is meaningful to find out the most
   special one with some centrality-based preference. The MSS of a network
   which has the maximum (minimum) average value of a certain centrality
   among all possible MSSs of the network can be identified by our method.
   Then we apply the method to the human liver metabolic network and find
   that centralities of steering nodes in different MSSs can be remarkably
   different. In addition, we observe that, for some centralities, the
   liver cancer reactions are significantly enriched in the MSSs with the
   minimum average centrality value. This result suggests that when
   investigating the controllability of biomolecular networks, the
   centralities, which could provide more meaningful biological
   information, can be taken into consideration.}},

Abstract = {{With the advances in high-throughput technology, a large number of
   protein interactions data have been burgeoning in recent years, which
   makes it possible for considering dynamic properties of protein
   interaction networks(PINs) instead of static properties. To address the
   limitation of the existing dynamic PIN analysis approaches, in this
   paper, we proposed a new model-based scheme for the construction of the
   Spatial and Temporal Active Protein Interaction Network (ST-APIN) by
   integrating time-course gene expression data and subcellular location
   information. To evaluate the efficiency of ST-APIN, the commonly used
   classical clustering algorithm MCL was adopted to identify protein
   complexes from ST-APIN and other three dynamic PINs, NF-APIN, DPIN,
   TC-PIN. The experimental results showed that, the performance of MCL on
   ST-APIN outperforms those on the three other dynamic networks in terms
   of matching with known complexes, sensitivity, specificity and
   f-measure. Furthermore, we evaluated the identified protein complexes by
   GO (Gene Ontology) function enrichment analysis. The validation showed
   that the identified protein complexes from ST-APIN were more
   biologically significance. This study provided a general paradigm for
   constructing the ST-APINs, which can be used for theoretical studies and
   clinic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of protein complexes is very important to investigate the
   characteristics of biological processes. Most of existing protein
   complex clustering algorithms were often run only on a static
   protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The dynamic characteristics
   of interactions were ignored. In order to solve the problem, a new
   clustering algorithm (TP-WDPIN) was proposed which is based on the
   concept of topological potential to measure the importance of proteins
   in the process of detecting seed proteins and then to mine protein
   complexes from weighted dynamic PPI network. The algorithm used features
   of core-attachment of complexes and split low density cores to improve
   density of cores for achieving better clustering results. Experiment
   results showed that the proposed TP-WDPIN algorithm has better
   performance than other algorithms on two PPI databases.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of disease genes is an essential issue to decipher
   the mechanisms of complex diseases. Many existing methods combine
   machine learning algorithms and network information to predict disease
   genes and are based on the `guilt by association' assumption, where
   disease genes are considered to be close to each other in a biomolecular
   network. Although these methods have gained many novel findings, most of
   them ignored the edge dynamic changes of biomolecular networks under
   different conditions when only utilizing the `guilt by association'
   principle, which will limit their performance. To address this problem,
   we propose an algorithm that combines the `guilt by association' and the
   `guilt by rewiring' of biomolecular networks at the same time. The
   difference of gene co-expression between case and control samples are
   first processed to obtain the edge dynamic changes (rewiring) of
   biomolecular networks through weighting the edges of protein-protein
   interaction (PPI) networks. Then, features are extracted from the
   weighted PPI network. Finally, a logistic regression is adopted to
   identify the disease genes. The algorithm achieves AUC values of 0.95,
   0.90 and 0.92 on the identification of breast-cancer-related,
   lung-cancer-related and schizophrenia-related genes, respectively. Two
   new schizophrenia-related genes are also found from the ranked unknown
   genes list.}},

   First, we constructed dynamic protein networks and detected protein

Abstract = {{Detecting protein complexes has become an important area of system
   biology for revealing cellular organization and function. It has been
   indicated that dense sub-networks in protein-protein interaction (PPI)
   network, especially dynamic PPI network (DPIN), usually correspond to
   protein complexes by plenty evidences. In this study, we develop a new
   approach, named OPTICS\_PSO, which combines two algorithms for
   clustering DPINs data: the Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering
   Structure (OPTICS) algorithm, for identifying protein complexes in
   dynamic PPI network, and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm
   used to optimize the parameter epsilon in OPTICS when clustering
   sub-networks. In the DPIN, all sub-networks have different scales.
   Although OPTICS is effective in clustering, its parameters are
   user-specified and cannot deal with networks with different scales. We
   adopt PSO algorithm to optimize OPTICS and adjust its parameters. The
   identified protein complexes on the DIP dataset and Krogan dataset show
   that the new algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in
   terms of several criteria such as precision and f-measure.}},

   structural topologies of compliant mechanisms (CMs) and actuator
   placements bending actuators and rotary actuators for motion generation.
   The approach has the following salient features: (1) the use of bending
   actuators and rotary actuators as the actuation of CMs, (2) the
   simultaneous optimization of the CM and the location and orientation of
   the actuator that is embedded in the CM, (3) the guiding of a flexible
   link from an initial configuration to a series of desired configurations
   (including precision positions, orientations, and shapes), and (4) a new
   connectivity checking scheme to check whether the regions of interest in
   a design candidate are well connected. A program was employed for the
   geometrically nonlinear finite element analysis of large-displacement
   CMs driven by either bending actuators or rotary actuators. Two design
   examples were presented to demonstrate the proposed approach. The design
   results were 3D printed, and they all achieved desired shape changes

Abstract = {{A commercial-grade mechanical refrigeration dehumidifier was installed
   in a tomato greenhouse for humidity control, and relative humidity was
   monitored for a year. The results indicated that the indoor RH condition
   was controlled much better by the dehumidifier than by the previous
   air-to-air heat exchanger. Considering a 10-year payback period, the
   annual cost of the dehumidifier was about \$4000 in 2013. Even though
   the capital cost and annual cost of the dehumidifier were high, the
   plant loss rate due to high relative humidity was dramatically reduced
   from 43.3\% prior to 2012 without dehumidification to 0.9\% in 2013. The
   annual revenue was also increased by about 10\% in 2012, compared with
   that in 2009 to 2011. The increased revenue indicated that the equipment
   payback period was within one year. Considering all the benefits,
   dehumidification is strongly recommended for greenhouse humidity control
   in cold regions.}},

   problem, what is the optimal range of class distribution in training

   class distributions to answer the above questions. Besides the standard
   performance metrics, we have defined a metric to measure the robustness
   of the classifiers to get the optimal range of class distribution for a

Abstract = {{Traditional prosthetic fingers use rigid links and kinematic joints,

   new design of fingers which are fully compliant for prosthetic
   applications. A home-based topology optimization method was used for the
   structural synthesis and dimensional analysis in order to determine the
   topology and geometry of the finger. A prototype was manufactured and
   experimented for its performance. In order to evaluate the performance
   of the prosthetic finger, the forces and displacements of the input end
   and output were measured. A spring was attached at the output end to
   mimic the stiffness of the work-piece in order to evaluate the grasping
   ability. Finite element analysis was also performed to compare with the
   experimental results. It was found that the compliant prosthetic finger
   met the design requirements and overcome some problems present in the
   traditional prosthetic fingers. The home-made topology optimization
   method is reliable for the design of prosthetic finger.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the neural function in acute stroke patients in a timely
   manner is important to identify time sensitive treatment. While a
   hospital may have clinical neurophysiology machines, these are complex
   to use and crucially expensive to own. A low-cost point-of-care system
   for assessing the neural function in such patients would have value in
   many clinical centers, and also potentially with EMS teams. A study to
   determine the effectiveness of such an approach, especially with a
   limited number of EEG channels, requires suitable devices to provide
   this functionality. This paper focuses on the design and performance
   considerations for such a system which will be used in this study. Of
   interest is the use of the devices the clinicians already have (e.g.
   smartphone, tablet) to access and control the system as well as
   real-time performance of sampling on low-cost commodity hardware and the
   provision of an extensible platform that can be upgraded and take
   advantage of cloud computing resources.}},

Abstract = {{The characteristics of wind energy generation are different from those
   of conventional energy sources. The uncertainty and variability of wind
   power creates considerable challenges in planning and operating an
   electric power system while maintaining an acceptable level of
   reliability. The contributions of wind energy sources to the reliability
   of the overall power system depend on many factors, such as the strength
   of the wind resource, the point of wind integration in the power grid,
   the generation system configuration, and the topology of the
   transmission network, etc. Wind energy sources are typically installed
   at locations with strong wind regimes. Composite generation and
   transmission system reliability studies can be conducted to identify the
   optimal network locations to inject new generation that will provide
   maximum reliability benefit to the system. The wind regime at an optimal
   bus location may, however, be relatively low. This paper illustrates the
   reliability benefits of wind power from both resource strength and the
   location points of view, and the impact of wind power diversification on
   the bulk system reliability.}},

   mid-term electricity MCP forecasting models. Based on much more detailed
   performance evaluation results and consideration of requirements for
   machine learning techniques utilizing in longer time horizon and highly
   nonlinear questions, the proposed paper concluded that SVM is more
   suitable than LSSVM in mid-term electricity MCP forecasting. Numerical

Abstract = {{Transformerless grid-connected PVs are more economical and efficient
   compared to transformer connected PVs; however, in this type of
   connection high leakage current flows between the PV arrays and the grid
   due to the parasitic capacitances of the system. This leakage current is
   one of the main culprits in causing electromagnetic interference in
   power system, saturation of distribution transformers and poses safety
   issues. Common mode voltage (CMV) is primarily responsible for the
   existence of this leakage current. To cope with issues which arise from
   omitting galvanic isolation (transformer), in this paper a predictive
   direct power control (PDPC) with reduced common voltage (CMV) called
   active zero predictive direct power control (AZ-PDPC) is proposed. Both
   theory and simulation show that the proposed method reduces the level of
   CMV along with general good performance. The proposed method's

Abstract = {{With the increase in awareness about the climate change, there has been
   a tremendous shift towards utilizing renewable energy sources (RES). In
   this regard, smart grid technologies have been presented to facilitate
   higher penetration of RES. Microgrids are the key components of the
   smart grids. Microgrids allow integration of various distributed energy
   resources (DER) such as the distributed generation (DGs) and energy
   storage systems (ESSs) into the distribution system and hence remove or
   delay the need for distribution expansion. One of the crucial
   requirements for utilities is to ensure that the system reliability is
   maintained with the inclusion of microgrid topology. Therefore, this
   paper evaluates the reliability of a microgrid containing prioritized
   loads and distributed RES through a hybrid analytical-simulation method.
   The stochasticity of RES introduces complexity to the reliability
   evaluation. The method takes into account the variability of RES through
   Monte-Carlo state sampling simulation. The results indicate the
   reliability enhancement of the overall system in the presence of the
   microgrid topology. In particular, the highest priority load has the
   largest improvement in the reliability indices. Furthermore, sensitivity
   analysis is performed to understand the effects of the failure of
   microgrid islanding in the case of a fault in the upstream network.}},

Abstract = {{One third of the world's population is affected by tuberculosis (TB).
   This pandemic presents several challenges to the health professionals.
   Hence, forecasting and controlling TB epidemics play an important role
   to deal with this disease. Transmission models are valuable tools for
   projecting and evaluating control strategies against TB, but lack
   capability to easily integrate noisy information from epidemiological
   data into projections and policy analysis. To overcome this shortcoming,
   a dynamical system for TB based on particle filtering algorithm was
   developed. We evaluated the effectiveness of different levels of
   particle filtering by running the particle filter to year 2000, then
   disabling it and judging the discrepancy of model predictions vs.
   observed data for the period 2000-2007. The successive results revealed
   similar patterns including a rise in force of infection during the
   1990s, but considering successively larger sets of observations yielded
   smaller discrepancies between particle filtered projections and observed
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Self-reconfigurable robot is a kind of robot that is able to recover its
   original function after partial damage of the robotic system. This is
   achieved by making changes on the partially damaged robot. This paper
   put forward a kind of self-reconfigurable quadruped robot based on the
   resilient theory. First, the concept of the self-reconfigurable robot
   and the recovery strategy were introduced. Secondly, a novel
   architecture of modular quadruped robot made by LEGO material was
   proposed. The connector of interfaces was taken into consideration. At
   last, the overall mode of the motion and control method with the help of
   NXT - G program were proposed. The analysis of the overall gait ensures
   the stability of motion in this phase. As for the uncertain
   environmental damage to the robot, the robot is able to repair itself by
   changing the movement type automatically to ensure it continues to work.
   The result shows that the quadruped robot meets the requirements of
   resilience and self-reconfiguration.}},

Abstract = {{Locating the position of the peak of an analog signal after it has been
   sampled is a challenging task with wide-ranging applications. The
   conventional methods of performing this operation involve either
   upsampling the digital signal or fitting a parabolic curve to the
   digital samples.
   This paper proposes a technique for finding the approximate location of
   the peak in an analog signal after it has been sampled. The technique
   involves transforming the sampled data into the logarithm domain and
   then fitting a parameterized function that is characteristic of the
   analog signal to the two points neighbouring the peak. The location of
   the peak is calculated from the parameters obtained in the fitting
   process. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator
   significantly outperforms the conventional estimators at a comparable or
   lower hardware cost.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a modified ant colony optimization algorithm has been
   proposed to find a feature subset most relevant to the classification
   task. The algorithm incorporates a new heuristic information component
   based on classification accuracy. The proposed methodology has been
   applied in a multiclass classification problem of capsule endoscopic
   images, where image regions will be classified as bleeding, non-bleeding
   and uninformative regions. 75 dimensional features extracted from five
   color spaces have been investigated in the experiments. The proposed
   MACO algorithm efficiently finds the optimum feature subset over the
   five color spaces including RGB, HSV, Lab, YCbCr, and CMYK, resulting in
   a feature subset outperforming those obtained individually from each
   color space. The comparative study with state-of-the-art methods of
   feature selection demonstrated that MACO can provide the most relevant
   features and improve the performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity

Abstract = {{We prove the existence and uniqueness of a Stackelberg equilibrium when
   different selfish single antenna sensor nodes try to access a multiple
   antenna hub in the uplink of a wireless body area network (WBAN). The
   hub is the game leader, capable of punishing the deviating sensors by
   using its multiple antennas to block reception for a specified period of
   time. Sensor nodes are the followers, each seeking to choose a transmit
   power to independently maximize its utility, modeled as a weighted
   difference between its achievable goodput and the expense of
   transmission. At the same time, the hub seeks to force the nodes to
   communicate their packets at certain transmit powers that maximize the
   welfare of the WBAN. We demonstrate this setup enables the Stackelberg
   game to reach a unique subgame perfect equilibrium. The proposed game
   model is employed in an IEEE 802.15.6-based ultra wideband WBAN to
   numerically validate the merits of the framework.}},

Abstract = {{The anticorrosion potential of a chemisorbed film formed from
   3-imidazol-1-ylpropan-1-amine (IMPA) against the degradation of X70
   steel in 1 M HCl has been investigated using electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization techniques. IMPA has
   been found to reduce the corrosion of X70 in the aqueous medium at pH 0
   to a great extent; an inhibition efficiency (IE\%) up to 90\% has been
   achieved for 500 ppm IMPA concentration at room temperature. Corrosion
   inhibition by IMPA is concentration-dependent and becomes more stable by
   virtue of adsorption of IMPA film on the X70 substrate. This adsorption
   phenomenon has been probed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic
   force microscopy (AFM) and infra-red (IR) spectroscopy. The formation of
   this film on the X70 surface fosters improved impedance against the flow
   of ionic currents of corrosive ions and molecules. IMPA acted as a
   mixed-type film-forming inhibitor as demonstrated from the results of
   potentiodynamic scans. The mechanism of X70 corrosion inhibition has
   been proposed using quantum structure/activity relations to explain the
   extent of influence of the molecular structure of IMPA on the corrosion
   inhibition of the IMPA film.}},

   reflectance, derived from raw terrestrial laser scanner intensity data,
   to model clay content within a potash mine. The mines of interest are
   located in the Prairie Evaporite Formation about 1 kilometre underground
   in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. It is shown that with an
   appropriate reflectance estimation process it is possible to produce
   consistent reflectance estimates over different distances and angles for
   a sylvinite deposit containing interbedded clays. The estimated
   reflectance values for different distinct regions were compared with
   assay results. If a linear relationship is assumed then R-2 values
   ranging from 0.48 to 0.90 were observed. The higher R-2 values (above
   0.86) were for SiO2, MgO, Al2O3, CaO, TiO2 and Fe2O3, which are
   indicative of increased clay content. This shows that there exists a
   possibility of using the estimated reflectance from a Riegl VZ-400
   (operating at 1550 nm) to map clay mineral content in underground potash
   mines. More research needs to be conducted to determine if the

Abstract = {{Hydrostatic or closed-circuit pump-controlled hydraulic systems are
   attractive due to their high energy efficiency; their lack of throttling
   losses and ability to recover energy onto the pump shaft have made them
   a common design choice in systems using rotary actuators such as ground
   drive transmissions. However, the natural asymmetrical flow of typical
   hydraulic cylinders have prevented the widespread adoption of
   closed-circuit systems for linear actuators. Some hydrostatic linear
   actuator systems have been developed, but these suffer from a large dead
   volume and reduced force if using a symmetrical dual rod cylinder, or
   increased cost and complexity if using a specialized cylinder geometry
   or flow balancing circuits. This paper presents a concept system which
   uses a pair of common single-rod hydraulic cylinders to achieve the
   efficiency of a pump-controlled hydrostatic system with the opportunity
   for energy recovery. The system's available force is equal to a standard
   valve-controlled system with a greater maximum velocity. This is

Abstract = {{Optical studies of the Aurora Australis have been conducted with a
   six-channel meridian scanning -photometer operating at the
   Amundsen-Scott Research Station at the South Pole (74 degrees magnetic
   latitude) through the last Solar Minimum. There are some striking
   differences from Arctic dayside results reported from Svalbard. The
   oxygen emissions are much weaker on average than in the Arctic dayside
   aurora. Antarctic results show that the 558-and 630-nm emissions can be
   as low as 30-40 R. At these low levels there is no evident relation
   between cusp intensity and solar wind dynamic pressure. The OI
   630/558-nm intensity ratio is also significantly lower than in the
   Arctic dayside aurora, suggesting a higher average electron energy
   influx. There are notable-differences in auroral forms, giving further
   evidence of asymmetries in the two dayside ovals.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Pages = {{1129-1140}},
Abstract = {{Interest in cartilage defect repair has been rapidly increasing with the
   growing number of sports related injuries, traumas, congenital defects,
   and pathological disorders, for example, resulting in osteoarthritis
   (OA), a complex degenerative joint disease that affects a large number
   of people every year. Although modern medicine has entered into an
   advanced stage, current surgical procedures still have several
   limitations. At present, among all therapeutic approaches, tissue
   engineering has shown great potential for cartilage joint repair.
   Several methodologies of utilizing cells, scaffolds, and signalling
   molecules have been explored and developed. However, in regenerative
   cartilage therapies, one of the major challenges yet to be overcome is
   its inability to regenerate functional tissue owing to poor mass
   transfer, and limited ability in controlling physiocochemical cultural
   parameters during in vitro cell culture. To solve these problems,
   bioreactors can play a promising role because of their ability to
   control physiocochemical culture parameters and to provide mechanical
   stimulation, thereby inducing improved chondrogenesis of
   tissue-engineered cartilage. In this paper, we review the role of
   bioreactors in repairing articular cartilage defects with recent
   advancements in these two areas.}},

   foot on the threats to human health and life and an integrated

Abstract = {{Artificial Neural network (ANN) has been widely used in solving complex
   real world problems. It is commonly known as a black-box approach in the
   sense that examples (input and output pairs) are learned in the process
   of establishing an ANN model. However, there is a long debate in
   literature on whether ANN is a white-box or a black-box approach. In
   this article, we take a more conceptual view towards the nature of
   modelling with ANN, leading to a conclusion that ANN can be a black-box
   or grey-box approach, depending on the way to create an ANN model, in
   particular whether the knowledge of the problem and/or domain of the
   problem to be modeled by ANN is used in the creation of the ANN model.
   Another contribution of this paper is the outline of a methodology for
   designing ANN models, which is based on our proposed view in this paper
   that designing an ANN model is like designing a product and then the
   design theory and methodology for general products is learned to
   designing an ANN model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a classification of in-pipe robots or robotic
   mechanisms in literature with the help of axiomatic design theory (ADT).
   The existing classification of these designs focuses on either their
   mobility or contact of the robot with the pipe inner surface. Such
   classification fails to provide a framework to guide the design of such
   robots. In this paper, we first propose a new approach to the devices
   classification and then apply it to the classification of in-pipe
   robots. This new approach has three features. The first feature is that
   classification of a device includes the function along with the context
   of the device. The second feature is that classification of a device
   starts with classification based on the operating principle of the
   device. The third feature is that classification of a device based on
   the complexity of the device especially the coupling property of the
   device. Classification of a device or system is an important step
   towards a more rational and systematic analysis and evaluation of the
   system, which is conducive to design innovation for discovery of new
   operating principles and new devices. Indeed, the future direction of
   research on in-pipe robots is discussed in this paper based on the
   proposed classification of in-pipe robots.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a computational model along with an algorithm for a
   new problem in computer-aided design of systems. The new problem stems
   from a so-called rapid prototyping of system (RPS) technology the
   authors developed elsewhere before. The RPS has learned from traditional
   rapid prototyping technique which is in essence to construct a component
   from the material (liquid, sheet, etc.); but the RPS is to build a
   system from modules or components. In the RPS technology, a space is
   divided into several regions that represent different components. For
   the visualization purpose, one can imagine that different regions are
   painted in different colors. Further, modules have different types. The
   core issue with the RPS is to ``fill{''} modules of different types to a
   colored space. This problem is called the RPS problem for simplicity.
   The proposed model is an optimization problem model and algorithm is a
   combination of the differential evolution and genetic algorithm. The
   proposed model along with the algorithm is tested and compared with
   other algorithms on three examples. The result of the comparisons has
   shown that the proposed model along with the algorithm can well solve
   this RPS problem.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, two control strategies are developed to control the
   piezoelectric inertia-friction actuator ( PIFA) systems with a great
   attention to counter for the thermal effect. The first strategy is to
   use two controllers: one is the main controller ( used to control the
   actuation) and the other is the auxiliary controller to adjust the
   contact pressure ( used to compensate the thermal effect). The second
   strategy is to use one controller, which serves for two purposes: to
   control the actuation and to compensate and the thermal effect. The two
   strategies are tested in a validated simulator. The result shows that
   the second strategy is better in terms of control accuracy and hardware
   cost. This paper may appear to be the first study on PIFA with
   consideration of the thermal effect.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{29-37}},
Abstract = {{Reliable characterization of unbound granular material and subgrade
   resilient modulus requires repeated load triaxial testing, advanced
   dynamic loading equipment, and technical experience not typically
   available in many geotechnical laboratories. For Level 2 design inputs,
   the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide recommends correlation
   models to estimate the resilient modulus of unbound granular material
   and subgrade from basic material properties (e.g., gradation, unconfined
   compressive strength, and California bearing ratio). These correlation
   models are developed from data on a wide range of soil and material
   types; this wide range increases the associated error with resilient
   modulus prediction. This paper compares laboratory measured resilient
   modulus for two types of locally available unbound granular materials to
   the predicted values; models developed under the Long Term Pavement
   Performance (LTPP) program were used. Resilient modulus tests of six
   gradations of two types of material-100\% crushed limestone and
   gravel-were conducted at two levels of moisture content. Results showed
   that the LTPP models significantly underestimated resilient modulus for
   the limestone material and showed high residuals associated with
   evaluating resilient modulus of both gravel and limestone materials. The
   coefficient of variation of the root mean square error was 50.3\% for
   gravel and 55.6\% for limestone. The high residuals associated with
   evaluating resilient modulus with the LTPP models justify the
   development of local prediction models to improve the reliability of
   Level 2 design inputs for unbound granular materials.}},

Abstract = {{Standard benchtop tests use a number of different heat sources for
   evaluating the performance of fabrics used in thermal protective
   clothing. These include convective sources (such as laboratory burners),
   radiative sources (such as quartz tubes), or a combination of convective
   and radiative sources. It is important to understand how the heat source
   used in a particular test will affect the thermal response and resulting
   test performance of fabrics due to factors such as the availability of
   oxygen to support thermal chemical reactions, the orientation of the
   heat source and fabric specimen, and the wavelength distribution of
   thermal radiation from the source. Temperatures at different locations
   within multiple-layer protective fabrics and benchtop test results were
   compared during 80-kW/m(2) exposures to a Meker laboratory burner and a
   cone calorimeter heater. In most locations within these specimens,
   temperatures in cone calorimeter tests were slightly higher than in the
   open flame tests, and the time to exceed the Stoll criterion was much
   shorter. Temperatures on the back of single-layer fabrics were compared
   during 10, 20, and 40-kW/m(2) exposures to the quartz tubes used in the
   Radiant Protective Performance (RPP) test and the cone calorimeter
   heater. Temperatures were higher in the cone calorimeter tests than in
   the RPP tests. These results are explained using a numerical heat
   transfer model and results of previous research. This paper also
   describes a cone calorimeter specimen holder that was developed to
   effectively test single- and multiple-layer fabrics in both horizontal
   and vertical orientations.}},

Abstract = {{Herein we aimed to use thermomagnetic analysis (TMA) to determine the
   nature of iron and nickel in the Chelyabinsk meteorite, and their effect
   on the meteorite's magnetism. Our magnetic measurements show that 3\% of
   the meteorite is metallic and consists of two ferromagnetic phases with
   Curie temperatures of T-C1 = 1049 K and T-C2 = 800 K. Using an Fe-Ni
   phase diagram, we show that the lower of the two temperatures is due to
   an Fe-Ni alloy with 51\% Ni, while the higher Curie temperature phase is
   due to a pure or nearly pure (Ni-free) iron phase, for which we can be
   certain the Ni content is less than 1\%. X-ray absorption (XAS)
   measurements show there are two clearly distinct iron oxidation
   environments: metallic and 2+, with the 2+ regions differing
   significantly from the standard FeO phase. We also demonstrate that
   beneath the immediate surface, iron exists virtually entirely in a
   metallic state. We are then able to estimate the surface composition
   using XPS, for which we found that 10\% of iron on the surface is still
   surprisingly unoxidized. Finally, our theoretical calculations show how
   the density of states for both Fe and Ni atoms is affected for different
   nickel concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Solving the issue of infection associated with implanted bone
   substitutes is one of the modern challenges of the biomedical
   engineering field. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel
   porous scaffold with sufficient antibacterial activity for bone repair
   or regeneration. Porous nanohydroxyapatite/polyurethane (n-HA/PU)
   composite scaffolds containing different amounts of silver phosphate
   particles were prepared through the in situ foaming method.
   Subsequently, their physicochemical properties, antibacterial abilities,
   and preliminary cytocompatibilities were evaluated. The results
   indicated that the porosity and mechanical properties of the n-HA/PU
   scaffolds incorporated with Ag3PO4 did not change significantly compared
   to n-HA/PU scaffold without Ag3PO4. The release of Ag+ was time and
   concentration dependent, increasing with the immersion time and Ag3PO4
   percentage in the scaffolds. A continuous Ag+ release can last more than
   3weeks. The antibacterial tests and cytocompatibility evaluation
   revealed that n-HA/PU scaffolds with 3 wt\% Ag3PO4 (n-HA/PU3) exhibit
   stronger antimicrobial effects as well as satisfactory
   cytocompatibility. The n-HA/PU3 scaffolds may hold great potential for
   application in the field of bone regeneration, especially for
   infection-associated bone defect repair.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new concept caller tictrit ton in the context of
   oneratiion management of a Resilience is a behavioral property of the
   system and it refers to the persistence of the system performance when
   the systeru is subject to damages. Operation managelllera of a system
   can be modeled as a mathematical problem. Algo\_ ritto i is are to
   generate a solution to the matheliiatical problem. When a system is
   subject to damage, the corresponding mathematical problem is changed.
   The resilience of a system thus reduces to the issue of how and whether
   the existing algorithm can still generate a solution to the changed
   problem. This paper further proposes a measure of the resilience of
   algorithm and takes a supply chain scheduling algorithm as an example to
   validate the proposed measure. A simulated experiment is provided. (C)

Abstract = {{Embryonic microenvironments can reverse the metastatic phenotype of
   aggressive tumors by inhibiting the Nodal signaling pathway. Here, we
   hypothesize that embryonic microenvironments can be transplanted for the
   purpose of oncotherapy. We report the development of an injectable
   bioactive hydrogel system containing the key antagonists of Nodal
   signaling-Cripto-1 receptor antibodies (2B11)-for the creation of
   embryonic microenvironments and the examination of their effect on tumor
   reversion treatment using a mouse model. Our in vitro results show that
   the hydrogel system can reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential of
   MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, promote cell apoptosis, and reduce the invasive
   ability of cells. Our in vivo results illustrate that the hydrogel
   system can significantly inhibit tumor growth in both breast cancer and
   melanoma tumor-bearing mouse models, as well as transform the cell
   morphology of melanoma B16 cells to melanin-like cells. Furthermore, the
   results of the up-regulation of tumor suppressor genes and the
   down-regulation of oncogenes by high-throughput sequencing confirm that
   the developed system can also selectively turn on some tumor suppressor
   genes and turn off certain oncogenes so as to prompt the benign
   reversion of the tumor phenotype. Taken together, our results
   demonstrate the injectable biomaterial system is able to create an
   effective microenvironment for melanoma and breast tumor therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Lignocellulosic biomasses are gaining attention for biofuel production
   to supplement the increasing energy demands. This study is focused on
   identifying the candidacy of pinewood for hydrogen production through
   subcritical (300 degrees C), near-critical (370 degrees C) and
   supercritical (550 degrees C) water gasification. Pinewood was gasified
   to study the impacts of temperature (300-550 degrees C), feed
   concentration (20-30 wt\%) and reaction time (20-60 min). The effects of
   metal catalysts (e.g., Ni/Al2O3, Ru/Al2O3, NaOH and KOH) were also
   examined to maximize hydrogen yields and carbon gasification efficiency.
   The individual gas yields, total gas yields and lower heating values
   were calculated for comparative evaluation between subcritical,
   near-critical and supercritical water gasification as well as between
   catalytic and non-catalytic gasification of pinewood. Supercritical
   water gasification at higher temperatures (550 degrees C), longer
   reaction time (60 min) and lower feed concentration (20 wt\%) improved
   water-gas shift reaction resulting in high hydrogen yields. Greater
   yields of hydrogen (0.52 mmol/g) and total gases (6.4 mmol/g) with lower
   heating value of 423 kJ/Nm(3) was found with 20 wt\% of pinewood at 550
   degrees C and 60 min. Ni/Al2O3 at a concentration of 5 wt\% showed
   highest yields for hydrogen (2.54 mmol/g) in the gas products when
   compared to other catalysts. The catalytic activity towards hydrogen
   production decreased as Ni/Al2O3 > KOH > Ru/Al2O3 > NaOH. The findings
   imply that pinewood is a promising feedstock for hydrogen production by
   supercritical water gasification.}},

Abstract = {{K-Edge Subtraction (KES) is a powerful synchrotron imaging method that
   allows the quantifiable determination of a contrast element (e.g.
   iodine) and matrix material (usually represented as water) in both
   projection imaging and computed tomography. A bent Laue monochromator
   has been developed that has very good focal and energy dispersive
   properties for KES. Approximately 5\% of the vertical beam profile is
   involved in ``edge crossing{''} energies, thus no splitter is employed
   as has been done with previous implementations where approximately 33\%
   of the beam size was blocked. The beam can be narrowed vertically
   allowing a smaller crossover angle than a splitter based system which
   minimizes artifacts. The combination of good spatial resolution, energy
   dispersive properties, flux and a unique approach to data analysis make
   this system nearly ideal for KES.
   Some of the relevant details of the monochromator will be discussed,
   especially the focal and energy dispersive properties. Example images of
   the beam and the object images will be presented as well.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{1645-1653}},
Abstract = {{Disc milling is used in manufacturing, especially for
   difficult-to-machine material such as titanium alloy, because of its
   strong force and high machining efficiency. However, research on the
   cutting mechanism of the disc-milling technique is still lacking in the
   literature. In the present study, first, a disc-milling grooving
   experiment was designed and carried out to test the milling temperature
   correlated to the milling force for titanium alloy samples. After
   machining, residual stress, microstructure and microhardness were
   investigated. Residual compressive stress was found on the milling
   surface, which changes to tensile stress gradually with the increase of
   depth. The impact of cutting factors on residual stress was also
   analyzed numerically and the results showed that with the increase of
   speed of the mainshaft, the residual stress reduced gradually. For the
   factors of depth of cut and feed speed, increasing them had the opposite
   effects on residual stress. Next, the microstructures of lattice tensile
   deformation and lattice fracture were observed under different cutting
   conditions. The metallographic structure changed on increasing the
   milling temperature, progressing from an initial equiaxed microstructure
   to an + duplex microstructure, and then formed a lamellar microstructure
   later. The microhardness in the plastic deformation zone was also taken
   into account, which showed that the hardness increased under the
   combined effect of the milling temperature and force.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure can induce significant changes in atomic and electronic

   elements that do not bond under ambient conditions. Here, we have
   extensively explored the Li-Fe system at high pressure using the

   calculations. Strikingly, our results show that the stoichiometries of
   LiFe, Li3Fe and Li3Fe2 have stability regimes on a phase diagram. It is
   found that both LiFe and Li3Fe2 adopted a fully developed
   three-dimensional framework. With an increasing Li content, a Li bonding
   pattern evolves from occupying diamond sublattice to armchair chains,
   and to the host frameworks constructed by 3- and 6-membered planar rings
   and 4- and 7-membered planar rings in which linear Fe chains are located
   in small channels. Our findings put forward a further understanding of
   the crystal structures and electronic properties of Li-Fe compounds at

Abstract = {{The synthesis of multifunctional high-quality oxide thin films is a
   major current research challenge given their potential applications.
   Herein, we report on p and n type tin oxides thin films as functional
   TCOs with photon management properties through doping with Nd3+ rare
   earth ions. We show that the structure, composition, carrier transport
   and optical properties of the sputtered Nd:SnOx films can be easily
   tuned by simply varying the Ar/O-2 gas flow ratio (R) during the
   deposition step. The increase of the oxygen content leads to drastic
   changes of the material properties from p-type SnO to n-type SnO2.
   Furthermore, all Nd:SnOx films are found to be highly conductive with
   resistivities as low as 1 x 10(-3) Omega cm (1) and carrier mobilities
   up to 129 cm(2) V (1) s (1). Thanks to deep XPS and NEXAFS
   spectroscopies, we gained insight into the coordination and oxidation
   degrees of the elements within the matrices. The insertion and optical
   activation of the incorporated Nd3+ ions have been successfully achieved
   in both matrices. As a consequence, strong NIR luminescence lines,
   typical of Nd3+ ions, were recorded under UV laser excitation. We
   experimentally show that the efficient Nd3+ photoluminescence in the
   near infrared region originates from efficient sensitization from the
   host matrix, through energy transfer. We found that the SnO2 host matrix
   provides more efficient sensitization of Nd3+ as compared to the SnO
   matrix. An energy transfer mechanism is proposed to explain the observed
   behaviour.}},

   carries a virtual probe is controlled by a medical expert and remotely
   reproduced at the patient site by a slave robot, carrying the ultrasound
   probe. In general a remote diagnostic system contains three divisions:
   expert station (or expert site), patient station (or patient site), and
   a communication network such as servers Wi-Fi or satellite network. The
   experiments demonstrate that the slave manipulator is capable of
   successfully following the motion of a master manipulator in a path

Abstract = {{The dominant transport mechanisms controlling the migration of
   contaminants in geologic media are advection and molecular diffusion. To
   date, defining which transport mechanism dominates in saturated,
   non-lithified sediments has been difficult. Here, we illustrate the
   value of using detailed profiles of the conservative stable isotope
   values of water (H-2 and O-18) to identify the dominant processes of
   contaminant transport (i.e. diffusion- or advection-dominated transport)
   in near-surface, non-lithified, saturated sediments of the Interior
   Plains of North America (IPNA). The approach presented uses detailed
   O-18 analyses of glacial till, glaciolacustrine clay, and fluvial sand
   core samples taken to depths of 11-50 m below ground at 22 sites across
   the IPNA to show whether transport in the fractured and oxidized
   sediments is dominated by advection or diffusion. Diffusion is by far
   the dominant transport mechanism in fine-textured lacustrine and glacial
   till sediments, but lateral advection dominates transport in sand-rich
   sediments and some oxidized, fine-textured lacustrine and glacial till
   sediments. The approach presented has a number of applications,
   including identifying dominant transport mechanisms in geomedia and
   potential protective barriers for underlying aquifers or surface waters,
   constraining groundwater transport models, and selecting optimum
   locations for monitoring wells. These findings should be applicable to
   most glaciated regions of the world that are composed of similar
   hydrogeologic units (i.e. low K clay till layers overlain by higher K
   coarse-textured aquifers or weathered clay till layers) and may also be
   applicable to non-glaciated regions exhibiting similar hydrogeologic
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{``Panta Rhei - Everything Flows{''} is the science plan for the
   International Association of Hydrological Sciences scientific decade
   2013-2023. It is founded on the need for improved understanding of the
   mutual, two-way interactions occurring at the interface of hydrology and
   society, and their role in influencing future hydrologic system change.
   It calls for strategic research effort focused on the delivery of
   coupled, socio-hydrologic models. In this paper we explore and
   synthesize opportunities and challenges that socio-hydrology presents
   for data-driven modelling. We highlight the potential for a new era of
   collaboration between data-driven and more physically-based modellers
   that should improve our ability to model and manage socio-hydrologic
   systems. Crucially, we approach data-driven, conceptual and physical
   modelling paradigms as being complementary rather than competing,
   positioning them along a continuum of modelling approaches that reflects
   the relative extent to which hypotheses and/or data are available to
   inform the model development process.}},

Abstract = {{Insertion of Li atoms into a B-substituted carbon cage produces two

   For each structure, phonon frequencies across the whole Brillouin zone
   are positive, indicating dynamic stability. Electronic structure
   calculations indicate that they are semiconductors under ambient
   conditions. Estimates of the Vickers hardness, based on a semi-empirical
   model, highlight the incompressible nature of these two compounds. We
   then performed calculations on the ideal strengths of these two
   structures to confirm the hardness and investigate origins of the
   mechanical properties. Strikingly, both LiBC11 and Li2B2C10 can be
   classed as superhard materials, with hardness values of 49 GPa and 41
   GPa, respectively. The current results shed light on the properties of
   new superhard carbon cage structures more generally.}},

Abstract = {{Tuning the electronic properties of graphene by doping atoms into its

   study of nitrogen doped graphene samples grown using chemical vapor
   deposition with a variety of synthesis conditions. Soft X-ray absorption
   and emission spectroscopy, which are techniques sensitive to the
   unoccupied and occupied partial electronic density of states,
   respectively, were used to study the electronic structure of N-doped
   graphene. Complementary full-potential, all-electron density functional
   theory calculations of the measured spectra reveal the existence of
   graphitic, pyridinic and nitrilic-like sites in the samples studied.
   Although our study shows that the defect type is sensitively related to
   the synthesis conditions, the graphitic configuration is found to be the
   most dominant one in each system studied. The dependence of the defect
   type on the sample growth conditions and the corresponding shifts in the
   Fermi energy level from the Dirac point, result in n- or p-type material

   equivalent to field scale, integrated over the entire root zone. The
   cosmic-ray neutron probe is a promising instrument to provide
   field-scale areal coverage, but these observations are shallow and
   require depth-scaling in order to be considered representative of the
   entire root zone. A study to identify appropriate depth-scaling
   techniques was conducted at a grazing pasture site in central
   Saskatchewan, Canada over a 2-year period. Area-averaged soil moisture
   was assessed using a cosmic-ray neutron probe. Root zone soil moisture
   was measured at 21 locations within the 500 m x 500 m study area, using
   a down-hole neutron probe. The cosmic-ray neutron probe was found to
   provide accurate estimates of field-scale surface soil moisture, but
   measurements represented less than 40\% of the seasonal change in root
   zone storage due to its shallow measurement depth. The root zone
   estimation methods evaluated were: (a) the coupling of the cosmic-ray
   neutron probe with a time-stable neutron probe monitoring location, (b)
   coupling the cosmic-ray neutron probe with a representative landscape
   unit monitoring approach, and (c) convolution of the cosmic-ray neutron
   probe measurements with the exponential filter. The time stability
   method provided the best estimate of root zone soil moisture (RMSE =
   0.005 cm(3) cm(-3)), followed by the exponential filter (RMSE = 0.014
   cm(3) cm(-3)). The landscape unit approach, which required no
   calibration, had a negative bias but estimated the cumulative change in
   storage reasonably. The feasibility of applying these methods to field
   sites without existing instrumentation is discussed. Based upon its
   observed performance and its minimal data requirements, it is concluded
   that the exponential filter method has the most potential for estimating
   root zone soil moisture from cosmic-ray neutron probe data.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue formation on scaffold outer edges after implantation may restrict

   insufficient interconnectivity, leading to incidence of a necrotic core.
   Herein, a nano-hydroxyapatite/polyamide66 (n-HA/PA66) anisotropic
   scaffold with axially aligned channels was prepared with the aim to
   enhance pore interconnectivity. Bone tissue regeneration and
   infiltration inside of scaffold were assessed by rabbit cranial defect
   repair experiments. The amount of newly formed bone inside of
   anisotropic scaffold was much higher than isotropic scaffold, e.g.,
   after 12 weeks, the new bone volume in the inner pores was greater in
   the anisotropic scaffolds (>50\%) than the isotropic scaffolds (<30\%).
   The results suggested that anisotropic scaffolds could accelerate the
   inducement of bone ingrowth into the inner pores in the non-load-bearing
   bone defects compared to isotropic scaffolds. Thus, anisotropic
   scaffolds hold promise for the application in bone tissue engineering.}},

   inspection application}},
Journal = {{MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new model for the piezoelectric actuator (PA) in
   the context of in the impact drive mechanism (IDM) for the in-pipe
   inspection application. The feature of the model is capturing the
   inertia of PA stack in a distributed manner as opposed to the lumped
   manner in literature. The benefit arising from this feature is a
   balanced trade-off between computational efficiency and model accuracy.
   The study presented in this paper included both theoretical development
   (i.e. the model of the piezoelectric actuator and the model of the
   entire IDM which includes the actuator) and experimental verification of
   the model. The study has shown that (1) the inertia of the PA in such a
   robot will significantly affect the accuracy of the entire model of IDM
   and (2) the simulation of the dynamic behavior with the proposed model
   is sufficiently accurate by comparing with the experiment. It is thus
   recommended that the inertia of the PA be considered in the entire model
   of the IDM robot. The model is an analytical type, which has a high
   potential to be used for the model-based control of the IDM robot and
   optimization of its design for a much improved performance of the IDM
   system.}},

   MIMO channels regardless of array parameters such as antenna spacing and
   Tx-Rx distance, provided the MIMO array is symmetric. For verifying the
   effectiveness of the proposed technique in channel orthogonalization, an
   experiment is conducted using a 4x4 MIMO array consisting of microstrip
   antennas and cascade-connected rat-race hybrid couplers. The results
   indicate a reduction in interference by approximately -28.3dB on average
   compared to desired signal power, and the ability to realize four-stream
   parallel MIMO transmission by using only analog passive networks. The

Title = {{Influence of mechanical properties of alginate-based substrates on the

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{In tissue engineering, artificial tissue scaffolds containing living
   cells have been studied for tissue repair and regeneration. Notably, the
   performance of these encapsulated-in-scaffolds cells in terms of cell
   viability, proliferation, and expression of function during and after
   the scaffold fabrication process, has not been well documented because
   of the influence of mechanical, chemical, and physical properties of the
   scaffold substrate materials. This paper presents our study on the
   influence of mechanical properties of alginate-based substrates on the
   performance of Schwann cells, which are the major glial cells of
   peripheral nervous system. Given the fact that alginate polysaccharide
   hydrogel has poor cell adhesion properties, in this study, we examined
   several types of cell-adhesion supplements and found that alginate
   covalently modified with RGD peptide provided improved cell
   proliferation and adhesion. We prepared alginate-based substrates for
   cell culture using varying alginate concentrations for altering their
   mechanical properties, which were confirmed by compression testing.
   Then, we examined the viability, proliferation, morphology, and
   expression of the extracellular matrix protein laminin of Schwann cells
   that were seeded on the surface of alginate-based substrates (or 2D
   culture) or encapsulated within alginate-based substrates (3D cultures),
   and correlated the examined cell performance to the alginate
   concentration (or mechanical properties) of hydrogel substrates. Our
   findings suggest that covalent attachment of RGD peptide can improve the
   success of Schwann cell encapsulation within alginate-based scaffolds,
   and provide guidance for regulating the mechanical properties of
   alginate-based scaffolds containing Schwann cells for applications in
   peripheral nervous system regeneration and repair.}},

Abstract = {{Switched inertance converters use digital valves to exploit the inertia
   of a flow in order to trade flow for pressure or vice versa. These
   components can be used to efficiently match load and supply pressures,
   avoiding the energy wasted by using resistive valves. While theoretical
   switched inertance converters can be highly efficient, practical
   implementations suffer from a number of energy losses. One of these
   losses is the valve switching loss: the energy wasted due to the flow
   experiencing a pressure drop across the partially open valve as the
   digital valve shifts from one position to the other. This paper
   quantifies the effect of this loss on the valve's overall performance.
   Two novel strategies for mitigating this effect are introduced: a shaped
   inertance tube design and positioning of the tank-flow valve along the
   length of the inertance tube.}},

Abstract = {{It is a fundamental challenge that identifying disease genes from a
   large number of candidates for a specific disease. As the biological
   experiment-based methods are generally time-consuming and laborious, it
   has become a new strategy to identify disease candidates by using
   computational approaches. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm based
   on the search engine ranking method, named PDGTR, to prioritize disease
   candidates. Firstly, we constructed a weighted human disease network by
   calculating the topological similarity and phenotype similarity of each
   pair of diseases. Then, we calculated the similarities of all the genes
   by using the protein-protein interaction network and the edge clustering
   coefficient. For a specific disease, a logistic regression model was
   used to generate the prior-knowledge of each gene. Finally, the search
   engine ranking based algorithm PDGTR was applied to prioritize the
   disease candidates. The proposed algorithm PDGTR was tested on five
   typical cancers: Breast Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Hepatocellular
   carcinoma, Gastric Cancer and Osteoporosis, and compared with four
   state-of-the-art algorithms: RWR, DADA, PRINCE and PRP. The experimental
   results based on the leave-one-out cross validation, precision, ROC
   curve, and enrichment show that the proposed algorithm PDGTR outperforms
   RWR, DADA, PRINCE and PRP. Moreover, some potential disease genes were
   predicted by PDGTR and already mentioned by some literatures.}},

Abstract = {{A SnOx/Au/SnOx transparent conductive oxide (TCO) multilayered film was
   fabricated with a total thickness of 75 nm using both e-beam and thermal
   evaporation techniques. X-ray diffraction confirms the amorphous nature
   of SnOx with a crystalline peak attributed to the presence of
   diffraction from the Au (111) plane. The morphological studies using
   atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   revealed a smooth top layer of the sandwich structure. A Rutherford
   backscattering spectrum has been used to probe the thickness of
   individual TCO layers, and reveals an oxygen deficient structure in the
   SnOx layer. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray emission
   spectroscopy (XES) measurements confirm the formation an SnO-rich phase
   and the presence of oxygen vacancies. The specimen exhibited resistivity
   and sheet resistance of 3.9 x 10(-4) Omega cm and 52 U sq. (-1),
   respectively, with an optical transparency of 83\% beyond 475 nm. The
   superior parameters exhibited by this stacked multilayer are due to
   relatively lower oxygen concentration in the tin oxide layer, and it is
   therefore proposed as a necessary ingredient to increase the overall
   conductivity in metal oxide multilayer thin films.}},

Abstract = {{Computer simulation models are continually growing in complexity with
   increasingly more factors to be identified. Sensitivity Analysis (SA)
   provides an essential means for understanding the role and importance of
   these factors in producing model responses. However, conventional
   approaches to SA suffer from (1) an ambiguous characterization of
   sensitivity, and (2) poor computational efficiency, particularly as the
   problem dimension grows. Here, we present a new and general sensitivity
   analysis framework (called VARS), based on an analogy to ``variogram
   analysis,'' that provides an intuitive and comprehensive
   characterization of sensitivity across the full spectrum of scales in
   the factor space. We prove, theoretically, that Morris
   (derivative-based) and Sobol (variance-based) methods and their
   extensions are special cases of VARS, and that their SA indices can be
   computed as by-products of the VARS framework. Synthetic functions that
   resemble actual model response surfaces are used to illustrate the
   concepts, and show VARS to be as much as two orders of magnitude more
   computationally efficient than the state-of-the-art Sobol approach. In a
   companion paper, we propose a practical implementation strategy, and
   demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability (robustness)
   of the VARS framework on real-data case studies.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the theoretical framework for sensitivity analysis called
   ``Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces'' (VARS), developed in the
   companion paper, we develop and implement a practical ``star-based''

   real-world problems. We also develop a bootstrap approach to provide
   confidence level estimates for the VARS sensitivity metrics and to
   evaluate the reliability of inferred factor rankings. The effectiveness,
   efficiency, and robustness of STAR-VARS are demonstrated via two
   real-data hydrological case studies (a 5-parameter conceptual
   rainfall-runoff model and a 45-parameter land surface scheme hydrology
   model), and a comparison with the ``derivative-based'' Morris and
   ``variance-based'' Sobol approaches are provided. Our results show that
   STAR-VARS provides reliable and stable assessments of ``global''

Abstract = {{In this paper, Maxwell stress of circular planar actuator at different
   applied voltages was estimated and then validated with the uniaxial
   compression test of three different dielectric elastomers (VHB, silicone
   and natural rubber). Pelrine's equation was revisited to estimate
   Maxwell stress which causes the actuation in the planar direction. More
   precise and accurate estimation of Maxwell stress could be made in this
   work by considering variation of dielectric constant with respect to
   frequency and pre-strain. Estimated Maxwell stress was validated through
   (i) out-of-plane strain or thickness strain obtained from measured area
   strain considering constant volume deformation, and (ii) out-of-plane
   mechanical compressive test results. The estimated Maxwell stress agrees
   well with the corresponding experimental compressive stress values for
   different pre-straining cases considered in this work.}},

Title = {{First responders' response area and response time analysis with/without
   grade crossing monitoring system}},
Journal = {{FIRE SAFETY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{100-110}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In North America, highway-railway grade crossings can lead to
   significant travel delays for emergency responders trying to reach an
   incident. Grade separation cannot be justified for most grade crossings,
   but a grade crossing monitoring system (GCMS) can detect a blockage and
   communicate the information to local emergency dispatchers in real-time.
   As every minute can be critical in emergency work, the potential for
   such systems clearly needs investigation. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan has
   numerous grade crossings and blockages caused by long slow moving or
   stationary freight trains. This study uses two Geographic Information
   System based analyses: service area analysis to show how the fire
   responders' service area changes with and without a grade crossing
   blockage; and network analysis to estimate the impact of GCMS on fire
   responders' response times both with and without a blockage. Both
   analyses are quantitative and both can present the results visually. The
   results from our examples in Saskatoon show significant savings in
   response times by, for example, avoiding detours made on the assumption
   that a road is blocked, avoiding taking a route found to be blocked and
   then having to take a detour, and choosing to wait at a crossing for a
   blockage to clear when the GCMS indicates that this is more efficient
   than taking a detour route. Although all cities and road networks are
   different, this study demonstrates that a GCMS can benefit certain
   jurisdictions by improving their emergency services and saving lives and
   property. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Lysine-functionalized nanodiamonds as gene carriers: development of
   stable colloidal dispersion for in vitro cellular uptake studies and
   siRNA delivery application}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{687-702}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Nanodiamonds (NDs) are emerging as an attractive tool for gene
   therapeutics. To reach their full potential for biological application,
   NDs should maintain their colloidal stability in biological milieu. This
   study describes the behavior of lysine-functionalized ND (lys-ND) in
   various dispersion media, with an aim to limit aggregation and improve
   the colloidal stability of ND-gene complexes called diamoplexes.
   Furthermore, cellular and macromolecular interactions of lys-NDs are
   also analyzed in vitro to establish the understanding of ND-mediated
   gene transfer in cells.
   Methods: lys-NDs were synthesized earlier through covalent conjugation
   of lysine amino acid to carboxylated NDs surface generated through
   re-oxidation in strong oxidizing acids. In this study, dispersions of
   lys-NDs were prepared in various media, and the degree of sedimentation
   was monitored for 72 hours. Particle size distributions and zeta
   potential measurements were performed for a period of 25 days to
   characterize the physicochemical stability of lys-NDs in the medium. The
   interaction profile of lys-NDs with fetal bovine serum showed formation
   of a protein corona, which was evaluated by size and charge distribution
   measurements. Uptake of lys-NDs in cervical cancer cells was analyzed by
   scanning transmission X-ray microscopy, flow cytometry, and confocal
   microscopy. Cellular uptake of diamoplexes (complex of lys-NDs with
   small interfering RNA) was also analyzed using flow cytometry.
   Results: Aqueous dispersion of lys-NDs showed minimum sedimentation and
   remained stable over a period of 25 days. Size distributions showed good
   stability, remaining under 100 nm throughout the testing period. A
   positive zeta potential of >+20 mV indicated a preservation of surface
   charges. Size distribution and zeta potential changed for lys-NDs after
   incubation with blood serum, suggesting an interaction with
   biomolecules, mainly proteins, and a possible formation of a protein
   corona. Cellular internalization of lys-NDs was confirmed by various
   techniques such as confocal microscopy, soft X-ray spectroscopy, and
   flow cytometry.
   Conclusion: This study establishes that dispersion of lys-NDs in aqueous
   medium maintains long-term stability and also provides evidence that
   lysine functionalization enables NDs to interact effectively with the
   biological system to be used for RNAi therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of graphene on polycrystalline
   copper (Cu) foil in a low pressure conditions has been presented, aiming
   to achieve the highest quality with large-scale fabrications, which
   requires comprehensive understanding and effective controlling of the
   growth process. Herein, few-layer graphene (FLG) films with large-domain
   sizes were grown on Cu metal catalyst substrates using a vertical
   mass-flow hot-filament CVD reactor, with the intention of large scale
   production, by optimizing the CVD system and three of the process
   parameters: (i) gas flow compositions, (ii) substrate annealing time and
   (iii) graphene deposition time. The detailed scanning electron
   microscope and Raman spectroscopy analysis indicate that all the above
   mentioned process parameters affect growth of FLG film on Cu substrate.
   The presence of two intense peaks, G and 2D-band at 1583.6 and 2702.6
   cm(-1), for synthesized sample at optimized condition's (H-2/CH4 ratio
   of 50:1 at graphene deposition time of 10 minutes and substrate annealed
   time for 20 minutes) revealed the formation of FLG films with large
   domain size. These graphene films on Cu have shown the room temperature
   field electron emission characteristics, hence appears to be prospective
   candidate for vacuum nanoelectronics.}},

Volume = {{110}},

Abstract = {{In cold climates, the water vapor in the warm and moist exhaust air may
   condense and form frost on the heat/energy exchangers' plate. In this
   study, a simplified theoretical model to predict the inlet conditions
   under which frost will form in the flat plate heat/energy exchangers is
   developed. The model uses the exchanger design parameters and operating
   conditions to determine the frosting limit. Experimental tests are
   conducted to validate the frosting limits model. The results show that
   the predicted frosting limits have consistent agreements with
   experiments, and energy exchangers have a lower risk of frosting than
   the heat exchangers. Furthermore, a parametric analysis using the
   theoretical model is performed to estimate the impacts of number of heat
   and moisture transfer units (NTUh and NTUm), aspect ratio of aluminum
   spacer, air flow rate, and membrane permeability on frosting limits of
   heat/energy exchangers. It is found that air flow rate has significant
   impacts on frosting limits. The combinations of sensible and latent
   effectiveness ensuring no frost inside energy exchanger are studied
   theoretically. The model can be applied to improve the design of
   exchangers to reduce or avoid frosting for cold climates. The frosting
   limits of cross-flow membrane energy exchanger can also be regarded as
   criteria to conduct selection and feasibility analysis of energy
   exchanger and compare with counter-flow exchanger as a reference in
   future study. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The development of methods to predict full-scale fire behaviour using
   small-scale test data is of great interest to the fire community. This
   study evaluated the ability of one model, originally developed during
   the European Combustion Behaviour of Upholstered Furniture (CBUF)
   project, to predict heat release rates. Polyurethane foam specimens were
   tested in the furniture calorimeter using both centre and edge ignition
   locations. Input data were obtained using cone calorimeter tests and
   infrared video-based flame area measurements. Two particular issues were
   investigated: how variations in incident heat flux in cone calorimeter
   tests impact heat release rate predictions, and the ability of the model
   to predict results for different foam thicknesses. Heat release rate
   predictions showed good agreement with experimental results,
   particularly during the growth phase of the fire. The model was more
   successful in predicting results for edge ignition tests than for centre
   ignition tests and in predicting results for thinner foams. Results
   indicated that because of sensitivity of the burning behaviour to foam
   specimen geometry and ignition location, a single incident heat flux
   could not be specified for generating input for the CBUF model.
   Potential methods to determine appropriate cone calorimeter input for
   various geometries and ignition locations are discussed. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{As part of the City of Edmonton's light rail transit expansion, twin 6.5
   m diameter oval shaped tunnels were constructed using conventional
   tunnelling methods. The geology of the site consists predominately of a
   hard, fissured cohesive till unit. The tunnel face construction was
   sequenced as top header, bench and invert excavations. At its narrowest,
   the pillar separating the twin tunnels was less than 1.5 m across or
   0.23 tunnel diameters. Typically, the minimum pillar spacing required to
   reduce the interaction between twin, side by side tunnels is one tunnel
   diameter. Because the tunnel construction was within an urban
   environment, there was considerable concern with ground loss and
   excessive surface settlements. This study demonstrates that within
   similar materials, a pillar width of 0.5 tunnel diameters sufficiently
   reduces the tunnel interactions and minimize the risk of damage to
   nearby structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread utilization of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) would incur
   more uncertainties, and thus challenge the traditional planning
   strategies for distribution systems. In this paper, a scenario-based
   comprehensive expansion planning (SCEP) approach for distribution
   systems is presented to cope with future uncertainties. This approach
   can not only take into account the initial investment and operation
   costs but also consider the expected adaptation cost to other future
   scenarios, and in this way the flexibility of an initial planning scheme
   can be achieved. Future scenarios are identified in line with three
   uncertainties, namely the conventional load levels, penetration levels
   of PEVs and whether or not with successful implementation of a
   coordinated charging strategy. The charging profile for dump charging
   mode has been determined straightforwardly, while that for coordinated
   charging mode is obtained by solving the proposed day-ahead dispatching
   model (DDM). Furthermore, a priority-based real time dispatching
   strategy (PRTDS) is proposed to obtain direct charging instructions for
   PEVs, and thus to demonstrate the rationality of utilizing the charging
   profile acquired from DDM in distribution system expansion planning
   (DSEP). Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology is
   demonstrated by numerical studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper extends evaluation of reliability of the distribution system
   to incorporate electric vehicles' (EVs') contribution in different modes

   operation, household demands can be supported by vehicle-to-home (V2H)

   further reduced by interregional V2G, which allows energy exchange among
   load points through healthy mains and laterals by sectionalizing the
   failure parts of the grid. Evaluation methods are proposed to determine
   the capacity contribution of EVs for each scenario. For the scenario of
   interregional V2G, optimal power flow is conducted to maximize the

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A novel probabilistic optimal power flow (P-OPF) model with chance
   constraints that considers the uncertainties of wind power generation
   (WPG) and load is proposed in this paper. An affine generation dispatch
   strategy is adopted to balance the system power uncertainty by several
   conventional generators, and thus the linear approximation of the cost
   function with respect to the power uncertainty is proposed to compute
   the quantile (which is also recognized as the value-at-risk)
   corresponding to a given probability value. The proposed model applies
   this quantile as the objective function and minimizes it to meet
   distinct probabilistic cost regulation purposes via properly selecting
   the given probability. In particular, the hedging effect due to the used
   affine generation dispatch is also thoroughly investigated. In addition,
   an analytical method to calculate probabilistic load flow (PLF) is
   developed with the probability density function of WPG, which is
   proposed to be approximated by a customized Gaussian mixture model whose
   parameters are easily obtained. Accordingly, it is successful to
   analytically compute the chance constraints on the transmission line
   power and the power outputs of conventional units. Numerical studies of
   two benchmark systems show the satisfactory accuracy of the PLF method,
   and the effectiveness of the proposed P-OPF model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of an experimental work on sonochemical
   degradation of benzophenone-3 (BP3), one of the most commonly used
   ultraviolet (UV) filters whose disruptive effect on the endocrine system
   of various living beings has been demonstrated. Ultrasound irradiation
   is a promising advanced oxidation technology that has received
   considerable interest as an alternative for degradation of persistent
   organic pollutants through hydroxyl free radicals that are generated
   from the cavitation bubbles implosion. Taking into account the potential
   risk due to the presence of BP3 in the environment and its possible
   removal using ultrasound, the effect of operating parameters such us
   ultrasonic applied power, pollutant initial concentration, pH, the
   presence of gases (including ozone), inorganic anions and alcohols on
   the substrate removal was investigated. During sonochemical treatment, a
   higher pollutant degradation rate was achieved by increasing the power
   in a range of 40.2-80.1 W. Likewise, at lower benzophenone-3 initial
   concentrations, higher extents of degradation were observed, which could
   be explained by a heterogeneous kinetics model. Acidic pH enhanced the
   pollutant initial degradation by 21 \%. Oxygen, ozone and bicarbonate
   ions affected positively the benzophenone-3 removal, while nitrogen,
   nitrate and chloride anions inhibited it. Measurements of concentration
   of hydroxyl free radicals indicated that by promoting OH. radical
   formation, the pollutant elimination rate can be increased.}},

Title = {{Design and testing of a novel 3-fluid liquid-to-air membrane energy

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},

Volume = {{92}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Liquid-to-air-membrane energy exchangers (LAMEEs) are constructed with
   micro-porous semi-permeable membranes and transfer heat and water vapor
   between two separate fluids (air and liquid desiccant). Over the last
   decade, research has shown that LAMEEs can significantly reduce the
   energy consumption of HVAC systems. In this paper, a novel 3-fluid LAMEE
   prototype is designed and tested. The main objective of the proposed
   3-fluid LAMEE is to enhance the performance (i.e. sensible, latent, and
   total effectivenesses, moisture removal rate, and sensible cooling
   capacity) of regular 2-fluid LAMEEs. The major difference between the
   proposed 3-fluid LAMEE and a 2-fluid flat-plate LAMEE is that,
   refrigeration tubes are placed inside the desiccant solution channels to
   enhance the cooling capacity and control the temperature of the
   desiccant solution along the length of the 3-fluid LAMEE. Water is used
   as the refrigerant in the current work. The main contribution of this
   paper is that it shows that the inlet temperature and mass flow rate of
   the cooling water have significant influences on the steady-state
   performance of the 3-fluid LAMEE. Compared to a 2-fluid LAMEE with the
   same design parameters, the sensible, latent, and total effectivenesses,
   moisture removal rate, and sensible cooling capacity of the 3-fluid
   LAMEE are improved by up to 69\%, 28\%, 39\%, 54\%, and 140\%
   respectively, depending on the inlet temperature and mass flow rate of
   the cooling water. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{283}},
Pages = {{1019-1032}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, systematic screening of 29 catalysts synthesised using
   five supports: Al2O3, activated carbon (AC), TiO2, ZrO2, MgO, and three
   promoters: Co, Cu, Ce (with two different Ce precursors) was performed.
   Then, the optimization of the Ni-Ce/Al2O3 catalyst was carried out by
   varying Ni loading (four levels) and Ce/Ni molar ratio (two levels). All
   these catalysts were screened for supercritical water gasification
   (SCWG) of lignin under the operating conditions of 650 degrees C, 26 MPa
   and water to biomass mass ratio of 5 in a tubular batch reactor. Various
   characterization techniques were used to investigate the properties of
   these catalysts further. As the result, using different supports, the
   activity of Ni-based catalysts for SCWG of lignin was found in the order
   of Al2O3 > TiO2 > AC > ZrO2 > MgO. As the best promoter, Ce enhanced the
   hydrogen selectivity by promoting the Ni dispersion and weakening the
   Ni-Al2O3 interaction. Use of different precursors for the Ce promoter
   (CeCl3 center dot 6H(2)O or Ce(NO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O) showed no
   effect on the hydrogen yield. For a fixed Ni loading, hydrogen yield
   increased with an increase in Ce/Ni molar ratio. The 20Ni-0.36Ce/Al2O3
   catalyst showed highest hydrogen yield of 2.15 mmol/g, which is 35\%
   higher than that for non-catalytic run. The better performance of
   Ni-Ce/Al2O3 catalyst can be attributed to enhanced coke resistance as
   well as increased reducibility for Ni by addition of Ce promoter. Crown

Abstract = {{In this study, two Cu-W (Cu30-W, Cu40-W) and one Cu50-WC composites (all

   for diamond coating in a microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor

   Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, indentation test and
   synchrotron-based high resolution X-ray near edge absorption
   spectroscopy were used to investigate the morphology, composition,
   microstructures and adhesion of diamond films. The results show that the
   adhesion of diamond coatings formed on these Cu-W alloy substrates is
   much higher than on pure Cu substrate. The adhesion improvement is
   primarily attributed to the reduced mismatch in the thermal expansion
   coefficients, and the formation of WC phase on the sub-surface of the
   substrate that strengthens the coating-substrate interfacial bonding.

Abstract = {{Because of the carbon diffusion into the substrate and the formation of
   graphite at the interface, direct deposition of adherent diamond
   coatings on Fe-based materials is difficult. To address the issue,
   Al-based interlayers including Al and Al/AIN interlayers were introduced
   on Fe based substrates (SS316, FeNiCo) to enhance diamond deposition,
   which was carried out in a microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition
   (MPCVD) reactor using a CH4-H-2 mixture. The obtained samples were
   characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy (XAS), and indentation testing. The results show that
   single Al layer can effectively suppress the formation of graphite and
   the inward diffusion of carbon into the substrate, and thus enhance
   diamond nucleation and growth. The dual layers of Al/AIN can further
   enhance the adhesion of diamond coatings comparing to the single Al
   interlayer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pure diamond-like-carbon (DLC) and nitrogenated diamond-like-carbon
   (N-DLC) were deposited by Ion Beam Deposition using a low energy
   End-Hall Source on titanium and silicon substrates. The beam energy used
   during the deposition had a mean value of 65 eV. The structure and
   composition of the films were investigated by visible Raman Spectroscopy
   and X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). Hardness and Young's modulus of
   the coatings were measured by nanoindentation. Adhesion of the coatings
   to the substrates was measured by Rockwell C indentation tests. To
   investigate the corrosion property of the coatings, Tafel polarization
   tests were performed from -1.5 V to 1.5 V in 0.89\% NaC1 solution using
   the Standard Calomel Electrode as a reference. In our studies, DLC
   deposited directly on bare titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4 V) shows poor
   adhesion and premature delamination. Pre-deposited nanodiamonds on
   titanium substrate greatly enhance the adhesion. The films produced on
   nano-diamond pretreated substrates are dense, smooth, and uniform, and
   DLC films show an average hardness value of 11 GPa, slightly higher than
   N-DLC (with an average hardness of 9 GPa). Despite its relatively lower
   hardness, nitrogen doping increases both adhesion and corrosion
   resistance of DLC coating. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication of self-healing anticorrosion coatings has attracted
   attention as it has the ability to extend the service life and prevent
   the substrate from corrosive attack. However, a coating system with a
   rapid self-healing ability and an improved corrosion resistance is
   rarely reported. In this work, we developed a self-healing anticorrosion
   coating on a magnesium alloy (AZ31). The coating comprises a
   cerium-based conversion layer, a graphene oxide layer, and a branched
   poly(ethylene imine) (PEI)/poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) multi-layer. We
   incorporated the graphene oxide as corrosion inhibitors and used the
   PEI/PAA multilayers to provide the self-healing ability to the coating
   systems. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy were used to
   characterize the composition of the multilayers, and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the surface morphology. The
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results illustrate the
   improved corrosion resistance of the coating. The proposed coating also
   has a rapid self-healing ability in the presence of water.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: In genome assembly, as coverage of sequencing and genome
   size growing, most current softwares require a large memory for handling
   a great deal of sequence data. However, most researchers usually cannot
   meet the requirements of computing resources which prevent most current
   softwares from practical applications.
   Results: In this article, we present an update algorithm called EPGA2,
   which applies some new modules and can bring about improved assembly
   results in small memory. For reducing peak memory in genome assembly,
   EPGA2 adopts memory-efficient DSK to count K-mers and revised BCALM to
   construct De Bruijn Graph. Moreover, EPGA2 parallels the step of Contigs
   Merging and adds Errors Correction in its pipeline. Our experiments
   demonstrate that all these changes in EPGA2 are more useful for genome
   assembly.}},

   results are presented separately based on the analyzed techniques:
   supply side closing, pre-heating and frosting effect ignoring. The
   results show the outdoor air preheating technique results higher energy

Abstract = {{Two different microstructures of Ni-Ti-Fe shape memory alloys processed
   through different thermo-mechanical treatments with nearly similar grain
   size and in-grain misorientation but different crystallographic textures
   were subjected to series of thermal cycles without external loading. The
   microstructures and the phase transformation behavior of the samples
   were examined after every seventy cycles. The experiment involved
   treating the samples with liquid nitrogen (LN2) for complete martensitic
   (B19') transformation and then heating it back to parent austenite (B2)
   condition. Thermal cycling introduced significant differences in
   microstructural parameters especially the grain boundary nature, stored
   elastic energy and the misorientation or defect densities. These
   microstructural alterations during thermal cycling were related to
   changes in transformation temperatures and enthalpy. Thermal cycling
   also brought out changes in crystallographic orientations of austenite
   grains. The present study aims to address the role of microstructure on
   the thermal fatigue behavior in Ni-Ti based shape memory alloys during

Abstract = {{The electronic structure of {[}6,6]-phenyl C-61 butyric acid methyl
   ester (PCBM), poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and P3HT/PCBM blends is
   studied using soft X-ray emission and absorption spectroscopy and
   density functional theory calculations. We find that annealing reduces
   the HOMO-LUMO gap of P3HT and P3HT/PCBM blends, whereas annealing has
   little effect on the HOMO-LUMO gap of PCBM. We propose a model
   connecting torsional disorder in a P3HT polymer to the HOMO-LUMO gap,
   which suggests that annealing helps to decrease the torsional disorder
   in the P3HT polymers. Our model is used to predict the characteristic
   length scales of the flat P3TH polymer segments in P3HT and P3HT/PCBM
   blends before and after annealing. Our approach may prove useful in
   characterizing organic photovoltaic devices in situ or even in operando.

   seeds varied from 1.30 to 48.0 m depending upon temperature, frequency,
   and moisture content. The distinct correlation of sensitivity of
   dielectric properties with moisture content was not observed except for
   that of penetration depth. The dielectric properties of the bulk canola
   seeds were higher than those of other oil seeds at various moisture
   contents; it might be affected by relatively higher linolenic acid
   content among other fatty acids. The large difference of the dielectric
   loss factors of insect pests cf. those of canola seeds showed potential
   for radio frequency disinfestation based on selective heating of insect
   pests in the canola seeds. The dielectric properties determined can be
   used for simulating temperature distribution within the bulk canola
   seeds during the radio frequency process.}},

Abstract = {{Many jurisdictions have developed a high-level traffic safety policy
   document, such as the American ``Strategic Highway Safety Plan'' (SHSP)
   or the Canadian ``raffic Safety Action Plan'' (TSAP). A SHSP and TSAP
   are both a scientific, data-driven, four to five year comprehensive
   safety document that is designed to identify a jurisdiction's areas of
   safety concern known as ``mphasis areas'' and establish target safety
   goals (i.e., collision reduction goal(s)) for each chosen emphasis area.
   A TSAP often includes additional information, such as network screening
   results and general safety strategies/programs for each chosen emphasis
   area. Most of the existing literatures focus on describing the process
   or outcome of the development of a state or province-level policy
   document and has little resources specifically for a small municipality.
   This study discusses the development of a TSAP for a small municipality
   through a case study for the City of Saskatoon. This study used themost
   recent ten years (2001-2010) of collision data in the City of Saskatoon,
   Saskatchewan. The study provides knowledge for those who wish to develop
   a TSAP by describing the process and highlighting the challenges in
   developing a TSAP for a small municipality. (C) 2015 World Conference on

Abstract = {{Flip-flop soft errors caused due to direct strikes on flip-flops as well
   as soft errors caused due to latched transients from combinational logic
   show frequency dependence. This frequency dependence in the case of
   high-speed sequential circuits can derate the soft error rate by as much
   as 5X. Circuit variables, such as voltage, frequency, logic delay, as
   well as environmental factors, such as particle type and linear energy
   transfer that affect the frequency dependence are studied. Heavy-ion
   irradiation of 28-nm sequential circuits shows that the cross-section
   decreases with frequency for low-LET particles and increases with
   frequency for higher-LET particles. Competing trends involving
   combinational logic and flip-flops are shown to be the reason. The
   voltage dependence of this trend is evaluated. The key insight that
   emerges from this work is that at sufficiently high frequencies, the
   cross-section of certain sequential circuits can be lower than that at
   lower frequencies. Similarly, lowering voltage may not always result in
   increased soft error rate at certain frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate highly-disturbed turbulent flows in a square channel with
   V-shaped ribs mounted on one wall. A planar particle image velocimetry
   (PIV) system is used to measure the fully developed turbulent flow at
   the channel midspan and two off-center planes. V-shaped rib
   configurations with three different inclinations (60 degrees, 45 degrees
   and 30 degrees) are studied and compared to the perpendicular (90
   degrees) rib case. The highly-disturbed turbulent flow in the V-shaped
   rib cases are studied by investigating the statistics of first and
   second order moments, including the mean velocity, mean shear, mean
   vorticity and Reynolds stresses. Owing to the geometrical skewness of
   the V-shaped ribs, strong secondary flows are induced which appear in
   the pattern of a pair of streamwise counter-rotating roll cells and have
   a significant impact on the momentum transport process. Near the channel
   midspan of the V-shaped ribs, turbulent intensity is suppressed above
   the ribs but enhanced below the rib height, and turbulent vortical
   motions exhibit isotropic patterns due to the strong disturbances from
   the ribs. The coherent flow structures have been systematically analyzed
   based on studying two-point auto-correlation coefficient, quadrant
   decomposition of Reynolds stresses, swirling strength, and proper
   orthogonal decomposition of the turbulent flow. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{290-304}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The flow above the free end of a surface-mounted finite-height cylinder
   was studied in a low-speed wind tunnel using particle image velocimety
   (Ply). Velocity measurements were made in vertical and horizontal
   measurement planes above the free end of finite cylinders of aspect
   ratios AR = 9, 7, 5 and 3, at a Reynolds number of Re = 4.2 x 10(4). The
   relative thickness of the boundary layer on the ground plane was delta/D
   = 1.7. Flow separating from the leading edge formed a prominent
   recirculation zone on the free-end surface. The legs of the mean arch
   vortex contained within the recirculation zone terminate on the free-end
   surface on either side of the centreline. Separated flow from the
   leading edge attaches onto the upper surface of the cylinder along a
   prominent attachment line. Local separation downstream of the leading
   edge is also induced by the reverse flow and arch vortex circulation
   within the recirculation zone. As the cylinder aspect ratio is lowered
   from AR = 9 to AR = 3, the thickness of the recirculation zone
   increases, the arch vortex centre moves downstream and higher above the
   free-end surface, the attachment position moves downstream, and the
   termination points of the arch vortex move upstream. A lowering of the
   aspect ratio therefore results in accentuated curvature of the arch
   vortex line. Changes in aspect ratio also influence the vorticity
   generation in the near-wake region and the shape of the attachment line.

Title = {{Numerical study of liquid coverage in a gas-liquid-solid packed bed}},
Journal = {{PARTICUOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Pages = {{90-99}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this work, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using the
   volume-of-fluid (VOF) model were employed to investigate the effects of
   liquid properties, liquid and gas flow rates, and wettability of
   particles on liquid maldistribution at the microscopic level in a fixed
   bed reactor. The simulation results show that the number of wetted
   particles decreases with increasing gas velocity, consequently leading
   to lower liquid-solid contact areas. The radial liquid distribution is
   greatly enhanced by increasing the liquid flow rate, whereas the time
   for the liquid to pass through the whole bed is decreased, as expected.
   Based on simulation results, it was found that the liquid-solid contact
   area can be increased by using liquids of high viscosities and more
   wettable particles. However, the flow-through time increases with
   increasing liquid viscosity. An increase in the gas density showed a
   minimal impact on the liquid flow-through time, and the liquid density

Abstract = {{Boron doped diamond-like carbon (B-DLC) film was synthesized on silicon
   (1 00) wafer by biased target ion beam deposition. High-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is employed to investigate the
   microstructure of the B-DLC thin film in cross-sectional observation.
   Many crystalline nanoparticles randomly dispersed and embedded in the
   amorphous matrix film are observed. Through chemical compositional
   analysis of the B-DLC film, some amount of O element is confirmed to be
   contained. And also, some nanoparticles with near zone axes are indexed,
   which are accordance with B2O phase. Therefore, the contained O element
   causing the B element oxidized is proposed, resulting in the formation
   of the nanoparticles. Our work indicates that in the B-DLC film a
   significant amount of the doped B element exists as boron suboxide
   nanoparticles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A radiation hardened by design (RHBD) latch and its temporally hardened
   version to tolerate double node upsets are proposed in this paper.
   C-Elements are used to construct structures for fault correction. The
   temporally hardened version can further tolerate some single-event
   transients (SETs) at input port and clock line. Compared with Quintuple
   Modular Redundancy (QMR), the proposed non-temporally and temporally
   hardened latches are more area and power efficient with improved
   propagation delays. Compared with several previously reported temporally
   hardened latches, the proposed temporally hardened latch may introduce
   lower performance loss induced as setup time increase. Several
   multi-node upset tolerant latches are also compared with these two
   designs in terms of area, power, and delay. A cell level soft error
   analysis (TFIT) shows that the upset threshold LETs of the proposed
   latches in 180 nm process are higher than 16 MeV-cm(2)/mg.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an Al thin film interlayer of 80 nm thick has been
   applied on FeCoNi alloy substrate which possesses a low coefficient of
   thermal expansion, to enhance the interfacial adhesion of diamond films
   produced by microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition.
   Characterization of the top deposit, interlayer and the underlying
   substrate was performed by Raman spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray
   analysis, X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy, X-scanning electron
   microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The Al interlayer has effectively
   inhibited the formation of graphitic carbon and markedly enhanced the
   nucleation, growth and adhesion of diamond films. The beneficial role Al
   plays is primarily attributed to the formation of an alumina barrier
   layer on the substrate surface, as verified by interfacial analysis.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{93}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Two experiments were done to assess the effects of season, truck type,
   and location in the truck on the gastrointestinal tract temperature
   (GTT) of market-weight pigs during transport. In Exp. 1, a total of 504
   sentinel pigs were selected from a total load of 3,756 pigs over 12 wk
   in summer or winter and transported in either a double-decked (DD)
   hydraulic truck or a pot-belly (PB) trailer for 2 h. In Exp. 2, a total
   of 330 sentinel pigs were selected from a total load of 2,145 pigs over
   11 wk in summer or winter and transported in a PB trailer for 8 h. In
   both experiments, sentinel pigs were equipped with a temperature data
   logger for the real-time GTT recording from the farm to slaughter.
   Transport was divided into 8 periods in Exp. 1 (rest, pretravel, initial
   travel, prearrival 1, prearrival 2, unloading, lairage 1, and lairage
   2]) and in Exp. 2 (rest, pretravel 1, pretravel 2, travel, prearrival 1,
   prearrival 2, lairage 1, and lairage 2). A delta GTT (Delta GTT) was
   calculated as the difference between the measured GTT at any determined
   event and the GTT measured at rest. In Exp. 1, the Delta GTT of pigs was
   greater (P < 0.001) in summer than in winter and only during the
   pretravel and initial travel periods. No difference was observed in the
   Delta GTT between the 2 truck types (P > 0.10). In summer, pigs located
   in the front top and rear top compartments of the PB trailer presented
   greater (P < 0.05) Delta GTT values than those transported in the middle
   top and front belly compartments during initial travel. In summer,
   during prearrival 1 and 2, a greater (P < 0.05) loss of GTT was found in
   pigs located in the rear top compartment of the DD truck compared with
   the rear lower compartment and in the front middle compartment compared
   with the rear middle compartment of the PB trailer. In Exp. 2, the Delta
   GTT of pigs was greater (P = 0.03) in summer than in winter during
   pretravel 2. Pigs in the front top compartment had a greater (P < 0.05)
   Delta GTT compared with pigs in the middle top, lower deck, and front
   belly compartments during the pretravel periods. Based on the results of
   the 2 experiments, modifications of the PB trailer model are recommended
   to limit body temperature increase due to physical stress at loading and
   unloading, and during transport due to inconsistent ventilation rate
   across vehicle locations.}},

Abstract = {{We study the P-wave bottom baryons using the method of QCD sum rule and
   heavy quark effective theory. Our results suggest that Lambda(b)
   (5912)(0) and Lambda(b) (5920)(0) can be well described by the baryon
   doublet {[}(3) over bar (F), 1, 1, rho], and they belong to the SU(3) IF
   multiplets of J(P) = 1/2(-) and 3/2(-). Their SU(3) flavor partners,
   Xi(b)(1/2(-)) and Xi(b) (3/2(-)), have masses 6.06 +/- 0.13 GeV and 6.07
   +/- 0.13 GeV, respectively, with mass splitting 9 {*} 4 McV. The results
   obtained using baryon doublet {[}(3) over bar (F), 1, 0, lambda] are
   similar and also consistent with the experimental data. We also study
   the SU(3) 6(F) multiplets by using the baryon multiplets {[}6(F), 0, 1,
   lambda], {[}6(F), 1, 0, rho] and {[}6(F), 2, 1, lambda], and our results
   suggest that the P-wave bottom baryons Sigma(b), Xi(b)' and Omega(b)
   have (averaged) masses of about 6.0 GeV, 6.2 GeV and 6.4 GeV,

Abstract = {{To evaluate clinical outcomes of pelvic artery embolization (PAE) for
   treatment of obstetric hemorrhage, and determine the predictive factors
   associated with failure.
   This retrospective study included all consecutive patients who underwent
   PAE for obstetric hemorrhage (not only in the post-partum setting),
   between January 2003 and January 2013 at three tertiary care centers.
   Medical records and imaging were reviewed to identify the study
   population and collect data on patient characteristics, PAE
   characteristics, and outcomes. Multiple parameters were compared between
   the failed and successful PAE groups, and univariate analysis was
   performed to determine the predictive factors for PAE failure.
   A total of 74 PAE procedures were performed in 68 patients. Primary
   clinical success rate was 78 \%. On univariate analysis, three factors
   were associated with PAE failure: hemodynamic instability (p < 0.022),
   hemoglobin level < 95 g/dL (p < 0.024), and disseminated intravascular
   coagulation (DIC) (p < 0.046). Other factors, including maternal
   characteristics, antecedent history, angiographic finding, embolic
   agent, operator experience, procedure done after hours, and unilateral
   versus bilateral embolization, did not show any statistically
   significant association with PAE failure. Only one major complication
   was encountered, which was fetal demise in a pregnant patient with a
   uterine arteriovenous malformations. Out of the 68 patients, there were
   61 total pregnancies at follow-up.
   PAE is an effective treatment for obstetric hemorrhage, with a low
   complication rate, and preserves fertility. Factors significantly
   associated with PAE failure include hemodynamic instability, hemoglobin
   level < 95 g/dL, and DIC.}},

Title = {{Toward a Unified Design Approach for Both Compliant Mechanisms and
   Rigid-Body Mechanisms: Module Optimization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rigid-body mechanisms (RBMs) and compliant mechanisms (CMs) are
   traditionally treated in significantly different ways. In this paper, we
   present a synthesis approach that is appropriate for both RBMs and CMs.
   In this approach, RBMs and CMs are generalized into modularized
   mechanisms that consist of five basic modules, including compliant links
   (CLs), rigid links (RLs), pin joints (PJs), compliant joints (CJs), and
   rigid joints (RJs). The link modules and joint modules are modeled
   through beam elements and hinge elements, respectively, in a
   geometrically nonlinear finite-element solver, and subsequently a
   beam-hinge ground structure model is proposed. Based on this new model,
   a link and joint determination approach-module optimization-is developed
   for the type and dimensional synthesis of both RBMs and CMs. In the
   module optimization approach, the states (both presence or absence and
   sizes) of joints and links are all design variables, and one may obtain
   an RBM, a partially CM, or a fully CM for a given mechanical task. Three
   design examples of path generators are used to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach to the type and dimensional
   synthesis of RBMs and CMs.}},

Title = {{Effect of Day Optimizing Throughput (Dot) Knee Software Implementation
   on Magnetic Resonance Imaging Workflow Efficiency}},

Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Attempts by magnetic resonance (MR) manufacturers to help
   imaging centres improve patient throughput has led to the development of
   more automated acquisition. This software is capable of customizing
   individual scan alignment; potentially improving imaging efficiency and
   standardizing protocols. However, substantial investments are required
   to introduce such systems, potentially deterring their widespread
   application. This study assessed the implementation costs and reduction
   in examination durations for automated knee MR imaging (MRI) software.
   Materials and Methods: Research activities were performed at a
   community-based academic centre on a 3-Tesla (3-T) system using Siemens'
   Day Optimizing Throughput (Dot) knee software. Examination acquisition
   times were extracted from the system before and after software
   implementation. Fiscal year 2012/13 finances were used to determine the
   average hourly cost of MRI utilization. Costs associated with automated
   software implementation were also calculated. Finally, the number of
   knee scans required to achieve a positive return on investment using the
   software was established.
   Results and Discussion: The mean (standard deviation, sample size)
   pre-and post-Dot software scan times were 23.20 (4.18, n = 266) and
   21.94 (4.51, n = 59) minutes, respectively, for a routine knee scan and
   11.88 (1.60, n = 74) and 11.24 (1.51, n = 27) minutes, respectively, for
   a fast knee scan. The overall weighted average resulted in a 64-second
   time savings per automated knee examination. This negligible time
   savings would be extremely difficult to make use of clinically. Dot
   simplified 29 unique knee protocols to two, improving the consistency of
   knee examinations. Current Dot software is not compatible with all
   patients and therefore has limitations that are a concern among MR
   technologists.
   Conclusion: Adoption of automated knee systems could assist in
   standardizing protocols; however, the cost of implementation and
   difficulty in modifying patient scheduling to reflect the minimal time
   savings would make a financial return unlikely to occur at small-and
   medium-sized institutions.}},

Abstract = {{The in vitro chondrocyte cell culture for cartilage tissue regeneration
   in a perfusion bioreactor is a complex process. Mathematical modeling
   and computational simulation can provide important insights into the
   culture process, which would be helpful for selecting culture conditions
   to improve the quality of the developed tissue constructs. However,
   simulation of the cell culture process is a challenging task due to the
   complicated interaction between the cells and local fluid flow and
   nutrient transport inside the complex porous scaffolds. In this study, a
   mathematical model and computational framework has been developed to
   simulate the three-dimensional (3D) cell growth in a porous scaffold
   placed inside a bi-directional flow perfusion bioreactor. The model was
   developed by taking into account the two-way coupling between the cell
   growth and local flow field and associated glucose concentration, and
   then used to perform a resolved-scale simulation based on the lattice
   Boltzmann method (LBM). The simulation predicts the local shear stress,
   glucose concentration, and 3D cell growth inside the porous scaffold for
   a period of 30 days of cell culture. The predicted cell growth rate was
   in good overall agreement with the experimental results available in the
   literature. This study demonstrates that the bi-directional flow
   perfusion culture system can enhance the homogeneity of the cell growth
   inside the scaffold. The model and computational framework developed is
   capable of providing significant insight into the culture process, thus
   providing a powerful tool for the design and optimization of the cell
   culture process. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2015;112: 2601-2610. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{Barium holds a distinctive position among all elements studied upon
   densification. Indeed, it was the first example shown to violate the
   long-standing notion that high compression of simple metals should
   preserve or yield close-packed structures. From modest pressure
   conditions at room temperature, barium transforms at higher pressures
   from its simple structures to the extraordinarily complex atomic
   arrangements of the incommensurate and self-hosting Ba-IV phases. By a
   detailed mapping of the pressure/temperature structures of barium, we
   demonstrate the existence of another crystalline arrangement of barium,
   Ba-VI, at low temperature and high pressure. The simple structure of
   Ba-VI is unlike that of complex Ba-IV, the phase encountered in a
   similar pressure range at room temperature. First-principles
   calculations predict Ba-VI to be stable at high pressure and
   superconductive. The results illustrate the complexity of the low
   temperature-high pressure phase diagram of barium and the significant
   effect of temperature on structural phase transformations. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{New polynitrides containing metastable forms of nitrogen are actively
   investigated as potential high-energy-density materials. Using a
   structure search method based on the CALYPSO methodology, we
   investigated the stable stoichiometries and structures of cesium
   polynitrides at high pressures. Along with the CsN3, we identified five
   new stoichiometric compounds (Cs3N, Cs2N, CsN, CsN2, and CsN5) with
   interesting structures that may be experimentally synthesizable at
   modest pressures (i.e., less than 50 GPa). Nitrogen species in the
   predicted structures have various structural forms ranging from single
   atom (N) to highly endothermic molecules (N-2, N-3, N-4, N-5, N-6) and
   chains (N-infinity). Polymeric chains of nitrogen were found in the
   high-pressure C2/c phase of CsN2. This structure contains a
   substantially high content of single N-N bonds that exceeds the
   previously known nitrogen chains in pure forms, and also exhibit
   metastability at ambient conditions. We also identified a very
   interesting CsN crystal that contains novel N-4(4-) anion. To our best
   knowledge, this is the first time a charged N-4 species being reported.
   Results of the present study suggest that it is possible to obtain
   energetic polynitrogens in main-group nitrides under high pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental and theoretical methods were employed to investigate the
   ambient-pressure, metastable phase transition pathways for Mg2C, which
   was recovered after high-pressure synthesis. We demonstrate that at
   temperatures above 600 K isolated C4- anions within the Mg2C structure
   polymerize into longer-chain carbon polyanions, resulting in the
   formation of the alpha-Mg2C3 (Pnnm) structure, which is another local
   energy minimum for the carbon-magnesium system. Access to the
   thermodynamic ground state (decomposition into graphite) was achieved at
   temperatures above similar to 1000 K. These results indicate that
   recoverable high-pressure materials can serve as useful high-energy
   precursors for ambient-pressure materials synthesis, and they show a
   novel mechanism for the formation of carbon chains from methanide
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{By ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, ammonium azide (AA, NH4N3)
   is predicted to be an effective precursor to form polynitrogen. Our
   simulations at 60 and 90 GPa show that the critical temperatures for
   nitrogen polymerization are about 2200 and 1600 K, respectively.
   Compared with molecular nitrogen (110 GPa and 2000 K), the synthesis
   pressure of polymeric nitrogen in AA significantly lowers. In the
   obtained polymeric nitrogen compounds, there are kinds of nitrogen
   backbones: one-dimensional chains, branched chains, and five-membered
   rings. By annealing simulations at 90 GPa, a one-dimensional pure
   nitrogen periodic chain is formed. Our finding might open a way for the
   practical application of polymeric nitrogen compounds as further
   depressurization simulations at 300 K confirm that both
   hydrogen-passivated polymeric networks and five-membered rings can be
   preserved at ambient conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Recent progress of high-pressure technology enables the synthesis of
   novel metal borides with diverse compositions and interesting
   properties. A precise characterization of these borides, however, is
   sometimes hindered by multiphase intergrowth and grain-size limitation
   in the synthesis process. Here, we theoretically explored new
   transition-metal borides (M = Co, Rh, and Ir) using a global structure
   searching method and discovered a series of stable compounds in this
   family. The predicted phases display a rich variety of stoichiometries
   and distinct boron networks resulting from the electron-deficient
   environments. Significantly, we identified a new IrB1.25 structure as
   the long-sought structure of the first synthesized Ir-B compound. The
   simulated x-ray diffraction pattern of the proposed IrB1.25 structure
   matches well with the experiment, and the convex hull calculation
   establishes its thermodynamic stability. Results of the present paper
   should advance the understanding of transition-metal borides and
   stimulate experimental explorations of these new and promising
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{As decimal floating-point (DFP) is better than binary floating-point in
   commercial and financial computing including billing systems, currency
   conversion, tax calculation and banking, many research activities have
   been focused on improving the performance of the DFP arithmetic unit
   recently. To achieve the high performance of the DFP arithmetic unit, a
   fast decimal fixed-point adder is the most important building block. The
   conventional three steps carry-free signed digit (SD) addition algorithm
   is first investigated. A new method for the decimal SD addition and
   subtraction based on the digit set {[}-9, 9] is proposed. Additionally,
   a digit-set converter which can directly generate the absolute value of
   the result is proposed. A model of the proposed decimal SD adder is
   implemented in VHDL. After exhaustive tests to ensure the correctness,
   the proposed design was synthesised in STM 90 nm technology. The results
   show that the proposed adder has a lower power and area consumption
   compared with previous designs.}},

   superior at a gas hourly space velocity of 6,000 mL.g(cat)(-1).h(-1),
   with Fe/C catalysts showing about 30\% CO conversion per pass while Co/C

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The controlling of complex networks is one of the most challenging
   problems in modern network science. Accordingly, the required energy
   cost of control is a fundamental and significant problem. In this paper,
   we present the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study
   the controllability of complex networks from the energy perspective.
   First, by combining theoretical derivation and numerical simulations, we
   obtain lower bounds of the maximal and minimal energy costs for an
   arbitrary normal network, which are related to the eigenvalues of the
   state transition matrix. Second, we deduce that controlling unstable
   normal networks is easier than controlling stable normal networks with
   the same size. Third, we demonstrate a tradeoff between the control
   energy and the average degree (or the maximum degree) of an arbitrary
   undirected network. Fourth, numerical simulations show that the energy
   cost is negatively correlated with the degree of nodes. Moreover, the
   combinations of control nodes with the greater sum of degree need less
   energy to implement complete control. Finally, we propose a
   multi-objective optimization model to obtain the control strategy, which
   not only ensures the fewer control nodes but also guarantees the less
   energy cost of control.}},

Volume = {{95}},

Abstract = {{Coarse-textured reconstructed soils are utilized extensively in the
   reclamation of mining waste. Accurate and continuous sensing of soil
   water content is required to understand soil water dynamics and evaluate
   the hydraulic characteristics of these soils. The EnviroSCAN (Sentek
   Pty. Ltd, Australia) is a semi-permanent multisensor capacitance probe
   (MCP) capable of continuous measurement of volumetric water content
   (theta(v)) and has been used to monitor reclamation soil cover
   performance. Calibration of these probes is required to improve the
   accuracy of field measurements. In this study, field and laboratory
   measurements were undertaken over a range of water contents and bulk
   densities to refine the relationship between theta(v) and scaled
   frequency (SF) measured by the MCP. The manufacturer's calibration
   equation tended to underestimate theta(v) under wet conditions (theta(v)
   > 0.35 cm(3) cm(-3)). Our experimental data showed that bulk density
   (rho(b)) did affect the MCP calibration and consequently a new
   calibration equation that includes the effect of rb is developed using
   laboratory measurements and validated using field measurements. This
   equation provided the highest degree of correlation and the smallest
   standard deviation of prediction to measured values of theta(v) for
   laboratory and field measurements, respectively. This calibration
   improves the application of the EnviroSCAN for coarse-textured soils
   such as those utilized in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Biosecurity protocols require a thorough cleaning of trucks and trailers
   used to transport live pigs. In western Canada, current trailer cleaning
   practices rely on manual labor and use extensive amounts of water. There
   exists a significant opportunity to automate the trailer cleaning
   process to help reduce the labor requirements of the operation, which
   would then potentially lower the cost to clean a trailer. It is also
   expected that an automated system will yield more consistent results in
   terms of cleaning quality. The investigation reported herein was aimed
   at demonstrating the viability of a vacuum-based system to clean
   livestock trailers. A wet vacuum system was developed and demonstrated
   The estimated capacity of the system suggests that the floor surfaces of
   a two-level straight trailer can be cleaned in 40 min while using 143 L
   (31.5 gal) of water. The power requirements of the vacuum system are
   estimated at 67 kW (90 hp). Several design considerations relevant to
   automating the system are discussed.}},

Title = {{The effect of a splitter plate on the flow around a finite prism}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{1-21}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The effect of a wake-mounted splitter plate on the flow around a
   surface-mounted finite-height square prism was investigated
   experimentally in a low-speed wind tunnel. Measurements of the mean drag
   force and vortex shedding frequency were made at Re =7.4 x 10(4) for
   square prisms of aspect ratios AR=9, 7, 5 and 3. Measurements of the
   mean wake velocity field were made with a seven-hole pressure probe at
   Re=3.7 x 10(4) for square prisms of AR=9 and 5. The relative thickness
   of the boundary layer on the ground plane was delta/D=1.5-1.6 (where D
   is the side length of the prism). The splitter plates were mounted
   vertically from the ground plane on the wake centreline, with a
   negligible gap between the leading edge of the plate and rear of the
   prism. The splitter plate heights were always the same as the heights of
   prisms, while the splitter plate lengths ranged from L/D=1 to 7.
   Compared to previously published results for an ``infinite{''} square
   prism, a splitter plate is less effective at drag reduction, but more
   effective at vortex shedding suppression, when used with a finite-height
   square prism. Significant reduction in drag was realized only for short
   prisms (of AR <= 5) when long splitter plates (of L/D >= 5) were used.
   In contrast, a splitter plate of length L/D=3 was sufficient to suppress
   vortex shedding for all aspect ratios tested. Compared to previous
   results for finite-height circular cylinders, finite-height square
   prisms typically need longer splitter plates for vortex shedding
   suppression. The effect of the splitter plate on the mean wake was to
   narrow the wake width close to the ground plane, stretch and weaken the
   streamwise vortex structures, and increase the lateral entrainment of
   ambient fluid towards the wake centreline. The splitter plate has little
   effect on the mean downwash. Long splitter plates resulted in the
   formation of additional streamwise vortex structures in the upper part
   of the wake. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},

Abstract = {{Dust kinetic Alfven solitary waves (DKASWs) have been examined in a
   low-beta dusty plasma comprising of negatively charged dust grains,
   superthermal electrons, and ions. A nonlinear Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)
   equation has been derived using the reductive perturbation method. The
   combined effects of superthermality of charged particles (via kappa),
   plasma beta, obliqueness of propagation (theta), and dust concentration
   (via f) on the shape and size of the DKASWs have been examined. Only
   negative potential (rarefactive) structures are observed. Further,
   characteristics of dust kinetic Alfven rogue waves (DKARWs), by deriving
   the non-linear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) from the KdV equation, are
   studied. Rational solutions of NLSE show that rogue wave envelopes are
   supported by this plasma model. It is observed that the influence of
   various plasma parameters (superthermality, plasma beta, obliqueness,
   and dust concentration) on the characteristics of the DKARWs is very
   significant. This fundamental study may be helpful in understanding the
   formation of coherent nonlinear structures in space and astrophysical
   plasma environments where superthermal particles are present. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background: Questions about the appropriateness of medical imaging
   exams, particularly related to magnetic resonance exams, have arisen in
   recent years. However, the prevalence of inappropriate imaging in Canada
   is unclear as inappropriate exam proportion estimates are often based on
   studies from other countries. Hence, we sought to compare and summarize
   Canadian studies related to magnetic resonance imaging appropriateness.
   Methods: We completed a systematic literature search identifying studies
   related to magnetic resonance appropriateness in Canada published
   between 2003 and 2013. Two researchers independently searched and
   evaluated the literature available. Articles that studied or discussed
   magnetic resonance appropriateness in Canada were selected based on
   titles, abstracts, and, where necessary, full article review. Articles
   relating solely to other modalities or countries were excluded, as were
   imaging appropriateness guidelines and reviews.
   Results: Fourteen articles were included: 8 quantitative studies and 6
   editorials/commentaries. The quantitative studies reported inappropriate
   proportions of magnetic resonance exams ranging from 2\%-28.5\%. Our
   review also revealed substantial variations among study methods and
   analyses. Common topics identified among editorials/commentaries
   included reasons for obtaining imaging in general and for selecting a
   specific modality, consequences of inappropriate imaging, factors
   contributing to demand, and suggested means of mitigating inappropriate
   medical imaging use.
   Conclusions: The available studies do not support the common claim that
   30\% of medical imaging exams in Canada are inappropriate. The actual
   proportion of inappropriate magnetic resonance exams has not yet been
   established conclusively in Canada. Further research, particularly on a
   widespread national scale, is needed to guide healthcare policies.}},

Abstract = {{Activated carbons are produced from different Canadian waste biomasses
   including agricultural waste (wheat straw and flax straw), forest
   residue (sawdust and willow ring), and animal manure (poultry litter).
   The precursors are carbonized through the fast and slow pyrolysis
   processes and then activated with potassium hydroxide. A fixed-bed
   reactor is used for temperature swing adsorption of CO2 in a gas mixture
   of N-2, O-2, and CO2 to study the cyclic CO2 adsorption capacity and
   selectivity of the produced activated carbons. The breakthrough
   adsorption capacity of the produced activated carbon is measured under a
   flue gas condition of 15 mol \% of CO2, 5 mol \% of O-2, and 80\% of N-2
   at 25 degrees C and atmospheric pressure. Slow pyrolysis based activated
   carbon has a lower surface area and total pore volume but higher
   adsorption capacity in the presence of N-2. Sawdust based activated
   carbon synthesized using the slow pyrolysis process creates the highest
   ultra-micropore volume of 0.36 cm(3)/g, and the highest adsorption
   capacity in N-2 (78.1 mg/g) but low selectivity (2.8) over O-2 because
   of the oxygen functional groups on the surface. Ultra-micropores and
   surface chemistry of adsorbents are far more important than particle
   size, total pore volume, and internal surface area of the adsorbents.
   All the samples fully recovered their initial adsorption capacity in
   each cycle (for up to 10 cycles). This work also demonstrates that
   adsorption capacity and selectivity of activated carbon can be
   controlled and optimized through the choice of starting material and
   carbonization conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructural evolutions and grain-boundary-character distribution
   during high-energy-beam welding of ultra-thin FeCo-V foils were studied.
   Detailed data about the boundaries, coincidence site lattice (CSL)
   relationships, grain sizes, and microstructural features were acquired
   from electron-backscatter diffraction (EBSD) maps. Moreover, the
   evolution of the magnetic properties during high-energy-beam welding was
   studied using vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). The fraction of
   low-angle boundaries was observed to increase in the fusion zones of
   both electron- and laser-beam-welded foils. The results showed that the
   fractions of low-AE (c) CSL boundaries (particularly twin boundaries, AE
   (c) 3) in the fusion zones of the welded foils are higher than those in
   the base metal. Because the strain rates produced during
   high-energy-beam welding are very high (because of the extremely high
   cooling rate), grain deformation by a slip mechanism is limited;
   therefore, deformation by grain twinning is dominant. VSM analysis
   showed that the magnetic properties of the welded foils, i.e., their
   remanence, coercive force, and energy product, changed significantly.
   The formation of large grains with preferred orientation parallel to the
   easy axis of magnetization was the main reason for the diminished
   magnetic properties.}},

Abstract = {{The architecture and the implementation of a high-performance scalable
   elliptic curve cryptography processor (ECP) are presented. The proposed
   ECP is able to support all five prime field elliptic curves recommended
   by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The design
   takes advantage of the high-performance capabilities of the DSP48E
   slices available in Xilinx field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to
   achieve high speed and low hardware resource utilization. The proposed
   design parallelizes the underlying prime field operations to reduce the
   latency of the elliptic curve point multiplication (ECPM) operation.
   Prime field inversion is performed efficiently using the same arithmetic
   blocks as the ones used for prime field multiplication and
   addition/subtraction. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the
   proposed scalable ECP is the fastest and smallest ECP that can support
   all five NIST recommended prime curves without the need to reconfigure
   the hardware. It can compute the ECPM between 1.709 and 28.04 ms using a
   Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA.}},

Volume = {{141}},

Abstract = {{The interpretation of pressuremeter test results in cohesive soils
   assumes that the soil is saturated and the rate of loading is such that
   undrained conditions apply. Pressuremeter tests in compacted soils or
   heavily overconsolidated clays may have a degree of saturation that is
   less than 100\%. Consequently, the soil may undergo volume changes
   during the initial stages of loading. Loading of the soil will result in
   the compression of occluded air and consequently the initial
   circumferential strains may be a function of volumetric changes and not
   a result of borehole expansion alone. A method to determine the applied
   radial total stress that will result in saturation for the pressuremeter
   test is developed based on Hilf's method of pore water pressure
   prediction during compressive loading of an unsaturated soil. A method
   to quantify the volume change that will occur within the plastic region
   around the pressuremeter probe prior to saturation is also developed.

Abstract = {{This paper describes a human-inspired method (HIM) and a fully
   integrated navigation strategy for a wheeled mobile robot in an outdoor
   farm setting. The proposed strategy is composed of four main actions:
   sensor data analysis, obstacle detection, obstacle avoidance, and goal
   seeking. Using these actions, the navigation approach is capable of
   autonomous row-detection, row-following, and path planning motion in
   outdoor settings. In order to drive the robot in off-road terrain, it
   must detect holes or ground depressions (negative obstacles) that are
   inherent parts of these environments, in real-time at a safe distance
   from the robot. Key originalities of the proposed approach are its
   capability to accurately detect both positive (over ground) and negative
   obstacles, and accurately identify the end of the rows of bushes (e.g.,
   in a farm) and enter the next row. Experimental evaluations were carried
   out using a differential wheeled mobile robot in different settings. The
   robot, used for experiments, utilizes a tilting unit, which carries a
   laser range finder (LRF) to detect objects, and a real-time kinematics
   differential global positioning system (RTK-DGPS) unit for localization.
   Experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique is capable of
   successfully detecting and following rows (path following) as well as
   robust navigation of the robot for point-to-point motion control.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a bifurcation analysis of steady states in a multistage

   A cascade of stirred tank reactors with a backflow was used to model the
   reactive flow in the MAC, and second-order reaction kinetics was
   employed to represent typical gas-liquid processes. In the developed
   model, the effect of temperature on gas solubility was taken into
   account. The multiplicity behaviour of steady states in such a reactor
   was investigated using a continuation method. Nonlinearity behaviours
   such as limit points and Hopf points were detected under various process
   parameters investigated in this work. A stability analysis was also
   conducted to determine whether the multiple steady state solutions
   observed were stable. The results suggested that a medium adiabatic
   temperature rise and small temperature difference are preferred to avoid
   system instability in operating such reactors.}},

Abstract = {{The in vitro chondrocyte cell culture process in a perfusion bioreactor
   provides enhanced nutrient supply as well as the flow-induced shear
   stress that may have a positive influence on the cell growth.
   Mathematical and computational modelling of such a culture process, by
   solving the coupled flow, mass transfer and cell growth equations
   simultaneously, can provide important insight into the biomechanical
   environment of a bioreactor and the related cell growth process. To do
   this, a two-way coupling between the local flow field and cell growth is
   required. Notably, most of the computational and mathematical models to
   date have not taken into account the influence of the cell growth on the
   local flow field and nutrient concentration. The present research aimed
   at developing a mathematical model and performing a numerical simulation
   using the lattice Boltzmann method to predict the chondrocyte cell
   growth without a scaffold on a flat plate placed inside a perfusion
   bioreactor. The model considers the two-way coupling between the cell
   growth and local flow field, and the simulation has been performed for
   174 culture days. To incorporate the cell growth into the model, a
   control-volume-based surface growth modelling approach has been adopted.
   The simulation results show the variation of local fluid velocity, shear
   stress and concentration distribution during the culture period due to
   the growth of the cell phase and also illustrate that the shear stress
   can increase the cell volume fraction to a certain extent.}},

Title = {{Effect of ball size on steady state of aluminum powder and efficiency of
   impacts during milling}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{284}},
Pages = {{149-158}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The concept of steady state milling time was examined for ball milling
   of aluminum powder. Four different setups of balls were used while the
   mill speed and charge ratio were kept fixed. Different criteria
   (morphology of particles, average particle size, deviation from the
   average particle size, lattice imperfections and change in
   crystallographic orientation) were used to study structural evolution of
   the milled particles and to compare the steady state time for the
   different milling conditions. Results showed that different criteria may
   not determine the same steady state time, however, all criteria were
   consistent in comparing efficiency of the different milling conditions.
   Moreover, it was found that at a given mill speed and ball to powder
   ratio (i.e. at a given consumed energy), a change in balls size and
   filling ratio of vials can improve milling efficiency. Finally, the
   effect of energy of each impact and the collective energy of all impacts
   were discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{251-259}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres and PLGA/alginate
   composite microspheres were prepared by a novel double emulsion and
   solvent evaporation technique and loaded with bovine serum albumin (BSA)
   or rabbit anti-laminin antibody protein. The addition of alginate and
   the use of a surfactant during microsphere preparation increased the
   encapsulation efficiency and reduced the initial burst release of
   hydrophilic BSA Confocal laser scanning microcopy (CLSM) of BSA-loaded
   PLGA/alginate composite microspheres showed that PLGA, alginate, and BSA
   were distributed throughout the depths of microspheres; no core/shell
   structure was observed. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that PLGA
   microspheres erode and degrade more quickly than PLGA/alginate composite
   microspheres. When loaded with anti-laminin antibody, the function of
   released antibody was well preserved in both PLGA and PLGA/alginate
   composite microspheres. The biocompatibility of PLGA and PLGA/alginate
   microspheres were examined using four types of cultured cell lines,
   representing different tissue types. Cell survival was variably affected
   by the inclusion of alginate in composite microspheres, possibly due to
   the sensitivity of different cell types to excess calcium that may be
   released from the calcium cross-linked alginate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Density (rho), specific heat (c(p)), thermal conductivity (k),
   diffusivity (alpha), and emissivity (epsilon) of canola seeds (Brassica
   napus L.) are important engineering parameters in the design of storage,
   heating, and cooling systems. The properties were determined at moisture
   content (MC) ranging from 5\% to 11\% (M/M) wet basis (w.b.) and
   temperature from 40 to 90 degrees C. Bulk (rho(b)) and particle (rho(p))
   densities of stored canola seeds decreased with temperature and ranged
   from 654.0 to 664.8 kg m(-3) and 1047 to 1131 kg m(-3), respectively.
   The c(p) of stored canola seeds increased with temperature and MC, and
   ranged from 2180 to 3498 J kg(-1) degrees C-1. The k of stored canola
   seeds at rho(b) and rho(p) increased with temperature and MC and ranged
   from 0.06 to 0.13 W m(-1).degrees C-1 and 0.15 to 0.25 W m(-1) degrees
   C-1, respectively. The a of stored canola seeds at rho(b) and rho(p)
   were calculated from the measured k, c(p), and rho, and ranged from 0.40
   x 10(-8) to 5.7 x 10(-8) m(2)s(-1), and 6.1 x 10(-8) to 8.0 x 10(-8)
   m(2) s(-1). The alpha of stored canola seeds at rho(b) increased with
   temperature and MC. The alpha of stored canola seeds at rho(p) exhibited
   descending-ascending trends with increasing MC at different temperatures
   except 40 degrees C. The epsilon of stored canola seeds decreased with
   MC and temperature and ranged from 0.93 to 0.99. Based on the
   experimental data, regression models for all the properties were
   developed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},

Abstract = {{The pressure-induced amorphization and subsequent recrystallization of
   SnI4 have been investigated using first principles molecular dynamics
   calculations together with high-pressure Sn-119 nuclear resonant
   inelastic x-ray scattering measurements. Above similar to 8 GPa, we
   observe a transformation from an ambient crystalline phase to an
   intermediate crystal structure and a subsequent recrystallization into a
   cubic phase at similar to 64 GPa. The crystalline-to-amorphous
   transition was identified on the basis of elastic compatibility
   criteria. The measured tin vibrational density of states shows large
   amplitude librations of SnI4 under ambient conditions. Although high
   pressure structures of SnI4 were thought to be determined by random
   packing of equal-sized spheres, we detected electron charge transfer in
   each phase. This charge transfer results in a crystal structure packing
   determined by larger than expected iodine atoms. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Title = {{Selective Area Band Engineering of Graphene using Cobalt-Mediated
   Oxidation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{This study reports a scalable and economical method to open a band gap
   in single layer graphene by deposition of cobalt metal on its surface
   using physical vapor deposition in high vacuum. At low cobalt thickness,
   clusters form at impurity sites on the graphene without etching or
   damaging the graphene. When exposed to oxygen at room temperature,
   oxygen functional groups form in proportion to the cobalt thickness that
   modify the graphene band structure. Cobalt/Graphene resulting from this
   treatment can support a band gap of 0.30 eV, while remaining largely
   undamaged to preserve its structural and electrical properties. A
   mechanism of cobalt-mediated band opening is proposed as a two-step
   process starting with charge transfer from metal to graphene, followed
   by formation of oxides where cobalt has been deposited. Contributions
   from the formation of both CoO and oxygen functional groups on graphene
   affect the electronic structure to open a band gap. This study
   demonstrates that cobalt-mediated oxidation is a viable method to
   introduce a band gap into graphene at room temperature that could be
   applicable in electronics applications.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by P-c(4380) and P-c(4450) recently observed by LHCb, a QCD sum
   rule investigation is performed, by which they can be identified as
   exotic hidden-charm pentaquarks composed of an anticharmed meson and a
   charmed baryon. Our results suggest that P-c(4380) and P-c(4450) have
   quantum numbers J(P) = 3/2(-) and 5/2+, respectively. Furthermore, two
   extra hidden-charm pentaqurks with configurations (D) over bar
   Sigma(c){*} and (D) over bar{*}Sigma(c){*} are predicted, which have
   spin-parity quantum numbers J(P) = 3/2(-) and J(P) = 5/2(+),
   respectively. As an important extension, the mass predictions of
   hidden-bottom pentaquarks are also given. Searches for these partners of
   P-c(4380) and P-c(4450) are especially accessible at future experiments

Title = {{Application of analyzer based X-ray imaging technique for detection of
   ultrasound induced cavitation bubbles from a physical therapy unit}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: The observation of ultrasound generated cavitation bubbles
   deep in tissue is very difficult. The development of an imaging method
   capable of investigating cavitation bubbles in tissue would improve the
   efficiency and application of ultrasound in the clinic. Among the
   previous imaging modalities capable of detecting cavitation bubbles in
   vivo, the acoustic detection technique has the positive aspect of in
   vivo application. However the size of the initial cavitation bubble and
   the amplitude of the ultrasound that produced the cavitation bubbles,
   affect the timing and amplitude of the cavitation bubbles' emissions.
   Methods: The spatial distribution of cavitation bubbles, driven by
   0.8835 MHz therapeutic ultrasound system at output power of 14 Watt, was
   studied in water using a synchrotron X-ray imaging technique, Analyzer
   Based Imaging (ABI). The cavitation bubble distribution was investigated
   by repeated application of the ultrasound and imaging the water tank.
   The spatial frequency of the cavitation bubble pattern was evaluated by
   Fourier analysis. Acoustic cavitation was imaged at four different
   locations through the acoustic beam in water at a fixed power level. The
   pattern of cavitation bubbles in water was detected by synchrotron X-ray
   ABI.
   Results: The spatial distribution of cavitation bubbles driven by the
   therapeutic ultrasound system was observed using ABI X-ray imaging
   technique. It was observed that the cavitation bubbles appeared in a
   periodic pattern. The calculated distance between intervals revealed
   that the distance of frequent cavitation lines (intervals) is one-half
   of the acoustic wave length consistent with standing waves.
   Conclusion: This set of experiments demonstrates the utility of
   synchrotron ABI for visualizing cavitation bubbles formed in water by
   clinical ultrasound systems working at high frequency and output powers
   as low as a therapeutic system.}},

Abstract = {{Electrides have attracted great attention since they not only show the
   fascinating chemical properties but also are of fundamental importance
   for science and technology application. Here we have systematically
   explored the two-dimensional (2D) structures of Li-C system with
   different stoichiometric (LixC, x = 1/3, 1/2, 1, 2, and 3) monolayer
   sheets using unbiased swarm structure search. Interestingly, the
   predicted 2D structures of LiC2 and LiC3 monolayers are metallic, which
   can be viewed as lithium doped graphene structures. For the two LiC
   monolayers (LiC-I and LiC-II), the calculations exhibit they are
   insulators with very large band gaps of 3.98 eV and 3.46 eV,
   respectively. Li2C monolayer is found to be a semiconductor with a
   narrow band gap of 0.21 eV, while Li3C is a metal. In Li-rich Li2C and
   Li3C monolayers, C atoms exit as the C-pairs in the center of the Li
   six-membered rings. More interestingly, the electron localization
   function suggests the Li C system is likely to become 20 electride
   compounds. The present results open an avenue to design and understand
   electride compounds in 2D materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, an optimized design for rhombic transposition flaps is
   created using a reliable finite element model that assures convergence
   for stress and deformation results. Defining a general configuration for
   rhombic flaps, the surgical process of wound closure is simulated for a
   wide variety of patterns. To address the intrinsic uncertainties
   associated with modelling skin's mechanical properties, four different
   sets of material parameters are considered, to investigate statistical
   measures. The results suggest that implementing the rhombic flap
   technique in a way similar to Z-plasty leads to an optimized surgical
   technique. The proposed flap, which can be employed for 60 to 90 rhombic
   defects, can reduce the maximum von Mises stress by 53\% (on average)
   with respect to the Dufourmentel flap, and, in the case of a 60 defect,
   43\% with respect to the Limberg flap. To avoid any depressed area such
   as dog-ear formation, the maximum compressive principal stress is
   examined to assure that it remains within the limits of the stresses in
   the existing surgical techniques. The deformed configuration is also
   taken into consideration. Ease of implementation, in terms of both
   construction and orientation with respect to the relaxed skin tension
   lines, is another design feature offered by the proposed flap. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A recent study has shown the thermoelectric performance of Al-doped
   Mg2Si materials can be significantly enhanced at moderate pressure. To
   understand the cause of this phenomenon, we have performed in situ angle
   dispersive X-ray diffraction and infrared reflectivity measurements up
   to 17 GPa at room temperature. Contrary to previous experiment, using
   helium as a pressure transmission medium, no structural transformation
   was observed in pure Mg2Si. In contrast, a phase transition from cubic
   anti-fluorite (Fm-3m) to orthorhombic anti-cotunnite (Pnma) was observed
   in the Al-doped sample at 10 GPa. Infrared reflectivity measurements
   show the electrical conductivity increases with pressure and is further
   enhanced after the phase transition. The electron density of states at
   the Fermi level computed form density functional calculations predict a
   maximum thermoelectric power factor at 1.9 GPa, which is in good
   agreement with the experimental observation. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Hydride-induced embrittlement is an important problem in hydride-forming
   materials. In this paper, a model is built for analysing a
   hydride-induced degradation process of the mechanical properties of
   zirconium alloys. A time-dependent criterion is proposed for determining
   the critical conditions of complete ductile-to-brittle transition. The
   dependence of this criterion on microstructure of Zr alloys is analysed
   in detail. The results show that many factors simultaneously govern the
   hydride-induced degradation. These factors include the susceptibility of
   hydrides to rupture, hydride size, hydride distribution, active slip
   systems, zirconium grain orientation, grain-boundary structure,
   grain-boundary density, hydrogen concentration, applied stress state and
   temperature. Intergranular hydrides have a more important influence on
   the loss in ductility than intragranular ones. The results obtained in

Abstract = {{Recent studies of the magnesium carbide (Mg-C) system under pressure
   were motivated by the successful high-pressure and high-temperature
   synthesis of Mg2C and Mg2C3. Here, we systematically investigate the
   high-pressure structures and chemical bonding of the Mg2C, Mg2C3, and
   MgC, system using the swarm optimization technique in combination with
   first-principles electronic structure methodology. The structural
   evolution with pressure of the Mg-C systems clearly shows a systematic
   trend with a progressive increase of electron donation from the Mg to C.
   To accommodate the electrons, the C valence sp orbitals rebybridized
   continually and adopted different modes of chemical bonding. We
   demonstrated that the evolution of the electronic and crystal structures
   can be explained from a Zintl-Rlemen charge-transfer concept. Therefore,
   at sufficiently high pressure metallic MgC2 and Mg2C transformed to
   semiconductors, while Mg2C3 undergoes an insulator-metal transition. The
   present results established the richness of carbon bonding of different
   stoichiometries under high pressure.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic study on the phase transformation behavior in a
   polycrystalline Ni-Ti-Fe shape memory alloy is reported. The
   investigation was carried out through series of differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) tests on three different samples with distinctly
   different microstructures of the alloy processed through different
   thermo-mechanical routes. The applied procedures involved cold rolling
   and marforming (rolling in liquid nitrogen) followed by short annealing
   treatments to recover the cold worked microstructure. These treatments
   altered the microstructure in terms of grain size, misorientation
   (defects) and texture. Three different microstructures were generated
   through adopted deformation processes (i) lower degree of texture, (ii)
   textured and (iii) refined grains with texture. The influence of the
   microstructural parameters on the phase transformations in terms of
   transformation temperature (TT) and associated energy of
   absorption/release was investigated. Temperature of transformation (TT)
   between different samples was affected predominantly by the grain size
   difference while enthalpy of transformation (austenite <-> martensite)
   was mainly due to differences in texture, stored energy and in-grain
   misorientation. Though the differences in TT and enthalpy were not very
   significant, these results form a guideline for microstructure tailoring
   of bulk scale manufacturing of these alloys. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Numerical analysis of the relationship between the area of target tissue

Abstract = {{Purpose: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is currently restricted to the
   treatment of target tissues with a small size (<3cm in diameter). To
   overcome this problem with RFA, some phenomena need to be understood
   first. The study presented in this paper investigated the relationship
   between the area of target tissue necrosis (TTN) and the size of target
   tissue in pulsed radiofrequency ablation (PRFA). Materials and methods:
   Liver tumour, one of the common targets of RFA in clinical practice, was
   used as the target tissue in this study. Two types of pulsed RF power
   supply methods (half-square and half-sine) and three target tissues with
   different sizes (25mm, 30mm and 35mm in diameter) were studied using
   finite element modelling. The finite element model (FEM) was validated
   by using an in vitro experiment with porcine liver tissue. The first
   roll-off occurrence or 720 s, whichever occurs first, was chosen as the
   ablation termination criterion in this study. Results: For each target
   tissue size, the largest TTN area was obtained using the maximum voltage
   applied (MVA) without roll-off occurrence. In this study, target tissues
   with a 25mm diameter can be ablated cleanly but target tissues with
   30-mm and 35-mm failed to be ablated. Conclusions: The half-square PRFA
   could achieve a larger TTN area than the half-sine PRFA. The MVA
   decreases with an increase in the target tissue diameter in both the
   half-square PRFA and the half-sine PRFA. The findings of this study are
   in agreement with the clinical results that lesions (3cm in diameter)
   have less favourable results from RFA.}},

Abstract = {{With the continuing development and improvement of genome-wide

   identify the most likely disease genes among a large number of
   candidates becomes a fundamental challenge in human health. A common
   view is that genes related to a specific or similar disease tend to
   reside in the same neighbourhood of biomolecular networks. Recently,
   based on such observations, many methods have been developed to tackle
   this challenge. In this review, we firstly introduce the concept of
   disease genes, their properties, and available data for identifying
   them. Then we review the recent computational approaches for
   prioritizing candidate disease genes based on Protein-Protein
   Interaction (PPI) networks and investigate their advantages and
   disadvantages. Furthermore, some pieces of existing software and network
   resources are summarized. Finally, we discuss key issues in prioritizing
   candidate disease genes and point out some future research directions.}},

Abstract = {{Pneumatic conveying is widely used for transporting granular materials
   and agricultural products. Traditional flow visualization methods are
   used extensively in experimental fluid dynamics but have not been
   commonly used with agricultural products as the flow seeding particles.
   A flow visualization method was developed to aid in understanding
   physical design changes made to agricultural pneumatic conveying
   systems. This optical flow profiling method is demonstrated by providing
   qualitative flow images and quantitative values to describe the
   behaviour of the particle flow, both upstream and downstream of a 25 mm
   spherical obstruction. The sphere was attached to the bottom of an
   acrylic conveying line that was conveying wheat particles {[}equivalent
   diameter: 3.66 mm] at an air speed of 20 m/s and a mass flow rate of
   approximately 5 kg/min. Probability density maps of particle occurrence
   were developed to describe the chance of a wheat particle being present
   in a particular location of the conveying line. The data contained in
   these maps were used to determine the centroid of the distribution and
   to plot the change in the cross-sections over the test area of the
   pneumatic conveying system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the influence of a solid wall on the wake
   structure of an infinite cylinder of square cross-section when it is
   placed in proximity to the wall. Three different values of the gap ratio
   were considered, i.e. g/D = 0, 0.5 and 1, in addition to the reference
   case of a cylinder in a free stream with no wall. The Reynolds number
   based on the cylinder width and free stream velocity was Re = 500. A
   coarse-grid Large Eddy Simulation was used to predict the resolved-scale
   velocity and pressure fields, and also generate the input data for the
   Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) analysis. When the cylinder was in
   close proximity to the wall, it introduced strong asymmetry into the
   near-wake, which was manifest in the reorientation of the upper and
   lower recirculation cells, as well as the development of a secondary
   recirculation zone on the bottom wall itself. For the case of the
   cylinder resting directly on the bottom wall, the wake was dominated by
   a single large, elevated recirculation zone, and vortex shedding was
   entirely suppressed. For each gap ratio, the coherent structures
   associated with the first three POD modes were identified and the
   results compared with the case of an infinite cylinder in a free stream.
   Both the energy distribution among the POD modes and the flow pattern
   associated with the coherent structures for each mode were strongly
   influenced by the presence of the wall for the two smallest gap ratios.

Abstract = {{The reclamation of shale overburden dumps from oil sands mining requires
   the placement of reclamation covers comprised of salvaged organic and
   mineral soils. The primary issues associated with the long-term
   performance of these covers are their ability to store sufficient water
   to meet transpiration demands and the potential threat of salt ingress
   into the cover from the underlying shale. The first issue has been
   addressed in previous studies, so the objective of this study was to
   evaluate controls on salt ingress through observations and modelling of
   the transport of the stable isotopes of water and salt within reclaimed
   profiles at the South Bison Hills overburden dump located north of Fort
   McMurray, Alberta. The water flow model was based on a dual porosity
   soil-vegetation-atmosphere model calibrated to observed field data. This
   model was then used to simulate deuterium and sulphate transport within
   the soil profiles. The optimized transport model for deuterium was used
   to estimate net percolation rates through the cover soil into the
   underlying shale. This model was then used to assess the controls on
   sulphate migration, including the rate of sulphate generation as a
   result of ongoing oxidation of the pyritic shale. The model results
   indicate that the average net percolation rate is a function of
   topographic location, ranging from 2.2 x 10(-5) mid at slope locations
   to 20.8 x 10(-5) m/d at plateau locations during the unfrozen days.
   These rates of net percolation should have produced observable patterns
   of salt flushing from the cover and upper shale. However, the observed
   sulphate levels could only be simulated by including a production term
   related to pyrite oxidation of the shale. The simulated oxidation rates
   ranged from 0.4 to 5.65 mg/L/d, similar to those estimated from previous
   laboratory and field investigations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A number of phase based X-ray imaging methods have been developed that
   derive contrast from phase effects from the object which make them
   particularly interesting because of the ability to visualize soft
   tissues. Shack-Hartmann is a wave-front diagnostic technique that
   emerged from optics which uses ray-line beams (beamlets) to interrogate
   the differences in the wave-front across a beam can also be used for
   X-ray imaging applications with phase sensitivity. This method, which
   has been applied in the X-ray regime, is very simple in that it only
   requires a screen to prepare an array of beamlets that then pass through
   the object and are allowed to propagate a distance onto a pixelated
   detector. Absorption and refraction information can be extracted from
   the detected beamlets. An untapped property is the additional ability to
   extract scatter distribution information based on the observed width of
   the detected spots. This paper describes experiments done at a
   synchrotron facility investigating the use of a Shack-Hartmann system
   for biomedical applications and include our method and examples of
   scatter contrast extraction from the method.}},

Title = {{The effect of low Reynolds number flows on pitot tube measurements}},
Journal = {{FLOW MEASUREMENT AND INSTRUMENTATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{247-254}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{An investigation on the low Reynolds number effect on
   hemispherical-tipped Pitot tube measurements was performed by measuring
   the center-line velocity during the laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in
   a 25 mm (1 in.) diameter vertical recirculating pipe loop. The primary
   objective of the study was to reconsider the available low Reynolds
   number Pitot tube data in the literature with modern instrumentation.
   Using the results of this experimental study, a correlation that
   accurately predicts the low Reynolds number Pitot tube behavior has been
   developed. The correlation accounts for an additional viscous term in
   the relationship for the pressure coefficient (C-p) which is not
   accounted for in Bernoulli's Equation. The correlation is semi-empirical
   and accurately fits experimental data gathered in this study, as well as
   a significant body of experimental data available in the literature. The
   correlation, which is based on a Pitot tube Reynolds number calculated
   using the opening diameter (d), has been shown to be provide more
   accurate predictions of Cp for a wide range of opening diameter to outer
   diameter ratios (0.22 <= d/D <= 0.6) than available correlations based
   on outer diameter.
   The transition Pitot tube Reynolds number, below which Bernoulli's
   Equation is no longer appropriate, was predicted to be approximately 35,
   compared to a value of 79 obtained from fitting data collected by
   Barker. The correlation developed in this study provides smoother
   transitions at both ends of the low Reynolds range. At the low end (Re <
   10) it converges with a Stokes Law' analogy, while at the critical
   transition (Re similar to 35) it converges asymptotically with
   Bernoulli's Equation. The correlation also accurately predicts the
   behavior of the pressure coefficient with Reynolds numbers between these
   ranges. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Biofabrication technologies involve the incorporation of living cells
   into various bioproducts by employing different cell manipulation
   techniques. Among them, bioprinting, delivering cell suspension through
   a fine needle under pressurized air, has been widely used because of its
   capability of precise process control. In the cell-printing process of
   bioprinting, cells are exposed to fluid stresses due to the velocity
   gradient in the fine needle. If the stresses exceed a certain level, the
   cell membrane may be overstretched, leading to membrane failure and thus
   causing mechanical cell damage. Modeling the mechanical cell damage in
   the bioprinting process is a challenging task due to the complex fluid
   flow and cell deformation involved. This paper introduces a novel method
   based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to represent the mechanical
   cell damage in the bioprinting process using a conical needle.
   Specifically, the cell deformation and movement during the cell-fluid
   interaction processes were represented by the immersed boundary method
   (IBM). A strain energy density (SED)-based cell damage criterion was
   developed and used to determine cell damage. Experiments were performed
   by using 3T3 fibroblasts and the results agree well with the proposed
   model.}},

Abstract = {{A method is proposed to decrease the matching frequency of the recently
   introduced self-excited electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) resonator antenna
   (SE-EBG-RA). The method is based on the application of a metal shorting
   plate at the open end of the antenna which reduces the resonance. EBG
   unit cells are comprised of thick metal patches on top of a PEC-backed
   substrate, which are separated by tiny high aspect ratio (HAR) gaps. Two
   to six cells, each electrically much smaller than wavelength, are
   deployed in one-dimensional (1-D) as a fragment of EBG microstripline
   with high radiation properties. Both open-circuit (OC) and short-circuit
   (SC) versions are presented, the SC version being electrically smaller.
   The miniaturization effect of dielectric loading of HAR gaps is also
   examined. The characteristics of proposed structures as improved
   radiators in terms of bandwidth (BW), size, gain, and efficiency are
   demonstrated through parametric and comparative analyses and also
   prototyping. The efficiency, BW, and footprint of the smallest
   dielectric-loaded version, a two-cell SC SE-EBG-RA, are 96\%, 3.5\%, and
   0.22. x 0.28., respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Distal radius (wrist) fracture (DRF) in women over age 50 years is an
   early sign of bone fragility. Women with a recent DRF compared to women
   without DRF demonstrated lower bone strength, muscle density, and
   strength, but no difference in dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
   measures, suggesting DXA alone may not be a sufficient predictor for DRF
   risk.
   Introduction The objective of this study was to investigate differences
   in bone and muscle properties between women with and without a recent
   DRF.
   Methods One hundred sixty-six postmenopausal women (50-78 years) were
   recruited. Participants were excluded if they had taken bone-altering
   medications in the past 6 months or had medical conditions that severely
   affected daily living or the upper extremity. Seventy-seven age-matched
   women with a fracture in the past 6-24 months (Fx, n = 32) and without
   fracture (NFx, n = 45) were measured for bone and muscle properties
   using the nondominant (NFx) or non-fractured limb (Fx). Peripheral
   quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) was used to estimate bone
   strength in compression (BSIc) at the distal radius and tibia, bone
   strength in torsion (SSIp) at the shaft sites, muscle density, and area
   at the forearm and lower leg. Areal bone mineral density at the
   ultradistal forearm, spine, and femoral neck was measured by DXA. Grip
   strength and the 30-s chair stand test were used as estimates of upper
   and lower extremity muscle strength. Limb-specific between-group
   differences were compared using multivariate analysis of variance
   (MANOVA).
   Results There was a significant group difference (p < 0.05) for the
   forearm and lower leg, with the Fx group demonstrating 16 and 19 \%
   lower BSIc, 3 and 6 \% lower muscle density, and 20 and 21 \% lower
   muscle strength at the upper and lower extremities, respectively. There
   were no differences between groups for DXA measures.
   Conclusions Women with recent DRF had lower pQCT-derived estimated bone
   strength at the distal radius and tibia and lower muscle density and
   strength at both extremities.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Contrary to the empirical Miedema and Hume-Rothery rules and a recent
   theoretical prediction, we report experimental evidence on the formation
   of Li-Cs alloys at very low pressure (> 0.1 GPa). We also succeeded in
   synthesizing a pure nonstoichiometric and ordered crystalline phase from
   an approximately equimolar mixture and resolved its structure using the
   maximum entropy method. The new alloy has a primitive cubic cell with
   the Li atom situated in the center and the Cs at the corners. This
   structure is stable to at least 10 GPa and has an anomalously high
   coefficient of thermal expansion at low pressure. Analysis of the
   valence charge density shows that electrons are donated from Cs to the
   Li ``p{''}-orbitals, resulting in a rare formal oxidation state of-1 for
   Li. The observation indicates the diversity in the bonding of the
   seeming simple group I Li element.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, a general trend exists to reduce usage of natural
   resources and re-use waste materials. This work aimed to study the
   performance of ground white and brown chicken eggshell waste powders as
   potential replacements of conventional quarried limestone in Portland
   cement mortars. A processing method to produce large quantities of
   eggshells was developed. Limestone amounts of 0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 15\% and
   20\% by weight were added as Portland cement replacements. Chemical
   composition, elevated temperature degradation and eggshell particle
   morphology were investigated. Compression and flexural strength
   measurements were carried out on mortar specimens. The results showed
   eggshells contain mostly calcite with small amounts of organic membrane
   and matrix. The powdered eggshell particles appeared to have an
   irregular morphology due to the grinding process utilized. The strength
   of the mortars were affected by the addition of various limestone
   materials. In conclusion, white and brown eggshells derived limestone
   powder were found to have inferior properties compared to natural
   conventional limestone even with 5 wt.\% Portland cement replacements.

Abstract = {{In this paper, a numerical model is developed and applied to investigate
   the fluid flow and heat and mass transfer in a counter-cross-flow
   liquid-to-air membrane energy exchanger (LAMEE). An iterative
   finite-difference method is used to solve two-dimensional steady-state
   flow field and the coupled heat and moisture transfer equations for the
   liquid desiccant and air streams. The model is validated with
   experimental data, and the agreement is within +/- 10\%. The results of
   the numerical model show that the phase change energy plays a key role
   in the establishment of the temperature and moisture content
   distributions in the LAMEE. In the process of air cooling and
   dehumidification, the liquid desiccant temperature is increased not only
   by the sensible heat transfer, but also by the moisture transfer. Also,
   the capacity of the liquid desiccant to absorb moisture from the air is
   shown to be affected by the sensible energy transfer between the two
   fluids. Moreover, it is shown that the counter-cross-flow LAMEE
   effectiveness is between the effectiveness of pure counter-flow and pure
   cross-flow LAMEEs with the same membrane area. It is recommended for a
   practical design that the aspect ratio and entrance ratio should be less
   than 0.2 and 0.1 respectively, in order to achieve a high performance of
   the counter-cross-flow design that approaches within 2\% the performance
   of a counter-flow design. Alternately, the membrane area of the
   practical design can be increased slightly (by 10\%) so that the
   counter-cross-flow LAMEE has the same performance as a counter-flow
   LAMEE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An assessment on the sustainability of lignocellulosic biomass for

Abstract = {{Biofuels are promoted in a wide-scale as a means of achieving energy
   security and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Biofuels derived from
   lignocellulosic biomass, particularly from agricultural crops are being
   massively supported worldwide for meeting multiple strategy objectives
   such as climate change mitigation, energy security and development of
   the rural economy. Recently, the negative implications of using food
   crops for fuel have been realized to possess a significant threat
   towards global food security and competition for arable land. In
   contrast, lignocellulosic biomass in the form of waste residues from
   agriculture, forestry and energy crop systems are geographically
   abundant worldwide and have the potential to support the sustainable
   production of liquid transportation fuels. This paper encompasses the
   improvement in biofuels sector in relation to revitalizing and
   restraining the rural economies across the globe along with the global
   statistics for lignocellulosic biomass availability. In addition, the
   socio-environmental impacts of energy and greenhouse gas emissions from
   biomass conversion technologies have been addressed through highlights
   on life-cycle assessment of several biomasses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
