Abstract = {{Fast restoration of critical loads and non-black-start generators can
   significantly reduce the economic losses caused by power system
   blackouts. In a parallel power system restoration scenario, the
   sectionalization of restoration subsystems plays a very important role
   in determining the pickup of critical loads before synchronization. Most
   existing research mainly focuses on the startup of non-black-start
   generators. The restoration of critical loads, especially the loads with
   cold load characteristics, has not yet been addressed in optimizing the
   subsystem divisions. As a result, sectionalized restoration subsystems
   cannot achieve the best coordination between the pickup of loads and the
   ramping of generators. In order to generate sectionalizing strategies
   considering the pickup of critical loads in parallel power system
   restoration scenarios, an optimization model considering power system
   constraints, the characteris-, tics of the cold load pickup and the
   features of generator startup is proposed in this paper. A bi-level
   programming approach is employed to solve the proposed sectionalizing
   model. In the upper level the optimal sectionalizing problem for the
   restoration subsystems is addressed, while in the lower level the
   objective is to minimize the outage durations of critical loads. The
   proposed sectionalizing model has been validated by the New-England
   39-bus system and the IEEE 118-bus system. Further comparisons with some
   existing methods are carried out as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of germanium substitution for silicon in
   bismuth doped Mg2Si. This alloying reduces the thermal conductivity from
   above 7W m(-1) K-1 to 2.7W m(-1) K-1 at around 300 K in part due to the
   added mass contrast. High resolution transmission electron microscopy
   (HRTEM) revealed the presence of Ge-rich domains within the
   Mg-2(Si,Ge,Bi) particles, contributing to decreasing thermal
   conductivity with increasing Ge content up to 0.3 Ge per formula unit.
   The electrical conductivity also decreases with Ge alloying because of
   the increasing amount of scattering centers, while the Seebeck
   coefficient increased only very slightly. In total, the positive effect
   of Ge substitution on the thermoelectric properties of Bi doped Mg2Si
   resulted in a figure of merit of 0.7 at 773 K for Mg2Si0.677Ge0.3Bi0.023
   sample. The optimum amount of Bi seems to be 0.023 per formula unit
   (0.77 at\%), since lower Bi content resulted in electrical conductivity
   that is too low, and higher Bi content generated the Mg3Bi2

Abstract = {{Ice-crystallite precursor formation in supercooled water was studied via
   molecular dynamics for systems ranging from similar to 10(6) to 8.6 x
   10(6) molecules, using a tetrahedrally biased single-site ``mW{''}
   model. This has established system-size effects in the early onset of
   nucleation, so as to study often-transient precursors' beguiling
   propensity to ``flicker{''} into instantaneous locally ordered molecular
   arrangements redolent of ice. In addition, the adoption of solidlike and
   liquidlike bimodal local configurational-energy distributions was
   observed, characteristic of early nucleation. Larger systems favored a
   higher probability of precursor formation, although such ones were not
   usually longer lived relative to those in smaller systems (which
   themselves are rather transient). It was concluded tentatively that
   subtle effects of differences in systemwide density fluctuations and
   accessible lower-frequency modes tend to favor precursor formation in
   larger systems, although not necessarily the precursor's kinetic
   stability.}},

Abstract = {{Transition metal polyborides (e.g., tetraborides or triborides) with
   intriguing boron configurations offer a unique combination of excellent
   mechanical, superconducting, optical, and thermoelectric properties.
   Unraveling the specific structures of polyborides is critical to
   understanding their underlying physical and electronic properties. Here,
   we perform first-principles calculations to focus on the predictions of
   geometrical structures, relative stabilities, and mechanical and
   electronic properties of vanadium tetraboride (VB4) and triboride (VB3).
   VB4 prefers to take Cmcm symmetry with a planar boron isosceles
   trapezoid, differing from earlier graphene-like or rhomboid boron
   arrangements in tetraborides. Upon compression, another new Amm2-type
   energetically favorable above 12.0 GPa and can be stabilized up to 50
   GPa. Both structures are qualified into incompressible and hard
   materials, comparable to previous reported tetraborides. Predicted
   C2/m-type VB3 possesses intriguing puckered boron bilayers and
   graphene-like boron sheet and shows excellent mechanical properties.
   Analysis of electronic structure, electron density distributions, and
   Mulliken overlap population demonstrated the significant contributions
   of special planar isosceles trapezoid boron units to the great stability
   and excellent mechanical property for VB4. Furthermore, the universal
   trend of structural features and mechanical behaviors was analyzed for
   the available 3d transition metal tetraborides.}},

Abstract = {{The deformation behaviour of an aluminium-lithium alloy heat treated to
   different tempering conditions was investigated at high strain rate in
   compression using a direct impact Hopkinson Pressure bar. Detailed
   microstructural investigation was carried out using electron back
   scatter diffraction and bulk crystallographic texture was determined
   using X-ray diffraction. All the impacted samples showed presence of
   adiabatic shear bands irrespective of the prior ageing condition,
   however, the extent of grain fragmentation and strength of < 101 >
   parallel to compression direction texture component was strongly
   dependent on the tempering condition of the alloy. The naturally aged
   sample showed less propensity to adiabatic shear band formation and
   therefore, highest toughness, compared to artificially aged samples.
   This can be attributed to higher resistance to instability by prolonged
   strain hardening from dislocation-precipitate interaction in the
   underaged sample compared to peak and over aged samples under dynamic
   loading conditions. The single stage peak-aged sample provides the best
   combination of high toughness with stable microstructure amongst the
   differently aged samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this work was to design, build and experimentally
   characterize a linear accelerator mounted mini-beam collimator for use
   at a nominal 6 MV beam energy. Monte Carlo simulation was used in the
   design and dosimetric characterization of a compact mini-beam collimator
   assembly mounted to a medical linear accelerator. After fabrication,
   experimental mini-beam dose profiles and central axis relative output
   were measured and the results used to validate the simulation data. The
   simulation data was then used to establish traceability back to an
   established dosimetric code of practice. The Monte Carlo simulation work
   revealed that changes in collimator blade width have a greater influence
   on the valley-to-peak dose ratio than do changes in blade height. There
   was good agreement between the modeled and measured profile data, with
   the exception of small differences on either side of the central peak
   dose. These differences were found to be systematic across all depths
   and result from limitations associated with the collimator fabrication.
   Experimental mini-beam relative output and simulation data agreed to
   better than +/- 2.0\%, which is well within the level of uncertainty
   required for dosimetric traceability of non-standard field geometries. A
   mini-beam collimator has now been designed, built and experimentally
   characterized for use with a commercial linear accelerator operated at a
   nominal 6 MV beam energy.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitivity approach has been widely used for various re-dispatching
   problems in power systems. The conventional sensitivity approach depends
   heavily on the detailed system model hence it suffers from the model
   bias problem. Existing sensitivity identification methods can indeed
   release the requirement of the system model, but the commonly-used
   constant sensitivity assumption is inconsistent with the actual
   situation. To solve this problem, this study proposes an online
   sensitivity identification method with the ability to track the system
   operating conditions. A general online re-dispatching procedure
   integrated with the proposed method is then introduced for various
   re-dispatching problems. Since the proposed method is data oriented and
   is comparable with the model-based method, it facilitates online
   implementation of the conventional sensitivity-based re-dispatching
   method. The key issue of the proposed approach, online sensitivity
   identification, is validated in a two-area four-machine system, compared
   with the conventional model-based method. Finally, the effectiveness of
   the whole re-dispatching procedure is demonstrated in a large complex

Abstract = {{The pressure-induced transformation of diatomic nitrogen into
   nonmolecular polymeric phases may produce potentially useful
   high-energy-density materials. We combine first-principles calculations
   with structure searching to predict a new class of nitrogen-rich boron
   nitrides with a stoichiometry of B3N5 that are stable or metastable
   relative to solid N-2 and h-BN at ambient pressure. The most stable
   phase at ambient pressure has a layered structure (h-B3N5) containing
   hexagonal B3N3 layers sandwiched with intercalated freely rotating N-2
   molecules. At 15 GPa, a three-dimensional C222(1) structure with single
   N-N bonds becomes the most stable. This pressure is much lower than that
   required for triple-to-single bond transformation in pure solid nitrogen
   (110 GPa). More importantly, C222(1)-B3N5 is metastable, and can be

Abstract = {{We construct charmoniumlike and bottomoniumlike molecular interpolating
   currents with quantum numbers J(PC) = 1(+-) in a systematic way,
   including both color singlet-singlet and color octet-octet structures.
   Using these interpolating currents, we calculate two-point correlation
   functions and perform QCD sum rule analyses to obtain mass spectra of
   the charmoniumlike and bottomoniumlike molecular states. Masses of the
   charmoniumlike (q) over barc (c) over barq molecular states for these
   various currents are extracted in the range 3.85-4.22 GeV, which are in
   good agreement with observed masses of the Z(c) resonances. Our
   numerical results suggest a possible landscape of hadronic molecule
   interpretations of the newly observed Z(c) states. Mass spectra of the
   bottomoniumlike \_ (q) over barb (b) over barq molecular states are
   similarly obtained in the range 9.92-10.48 GeV, which support the
   interpretation of the Z(b()10610) meson as a molecular state within
   theoretical uncertainties. Possible decay channels of these molecular
   states are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Scaffolds are used in bone tissue engineering to provide a temporary
   structural template for cell seeding and extracellular matrix formation.
   However, tissue formation on scaffold outer edges after implantation due
   to insufficient interconnectivity may restrict cell infiltration and
   mass transfer to/from the scaffold center, leading to bone regeneration
   failure. To address this problem, we prepared
   nanohydroxyapatite/polyamide66 (n-HA/PA66) anisotropic scaffolds with
   axially aligned channels (300 mu m) with the aim to enhance pore
   interconnectivity and subsequent cell and tissue infiltration throughout
   the scaffold. Anisotropic scaffolds with axially aligned channels had
   better mechanical properties and a higher porosity (86.37\%) than
   isotropic scaffolds produced by thermally induced phase separation
   (TIPS). The channels in the anisotropic scaffolds provided cells with
   passageways to the scaffold center and thus facilitated cell attachment
   and proliferation inside the scaffolds. In vivo studies showed that the
   anisotropic scaffolds could better facilitate new bone ingrowth into the
   inner pores of the scaffold compared to the isotropic scaffolds. The
   anisotropic scaffolds also had improved vascular invasion into their
   inner parts, increasing the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the cells
   and thus facilitating revascularization and bone ingrowth. Enhanced cell
   and tissue penetration to the scaffold center was observed in the
   anisotropic scaffolds both in vitro and in vivo, indicating the axially
   aligned channels positively influenced cell and tissue infiltration.
   Thus, such scaffolds have great potential for applications in bone
   tissue engineering.}},

   continuous treatment. The extraction efficiency was significantly
   improved by using 0.03 M HCl as extractant. Optimization of UAE
   parameters led to the development of a rapid, cost-effective,
   energy-efficient approach yielding 24.8\% +/- 1.28\% polysaccharide on
   dry weight basis, as compared to 11.08\% +/- 0.78\% by conventional

Abstract = {{A study of the ion Larmor radius effects on the solitary kinetic Alfven
   waves (SKAWs) in a magnetized plasma with superthermal electrons is
   presented by employing the kinetic theory. The linear dispersion
   relation of SKAW is shown to depend on the superthermal parameter kappa,
   ion to electron temperature ratio, and the angle of wave propagation.
   Using the Sagdeev potential approach, the energy balance equation has
   been derived to study the dynamics of SKAWs. The effects of various
   plasma parameters are investigated for the propagation of SKAWs. It is
   shown that only compressive solitons can exist and in the Maxwellian
   limit our results are in good agreement with previous studies. Further,
   the characteristics of small amplitude SKAWs are investigated. Present
   study could be useful for the understanding of SKAWs in a low beta
   plasma in astrophysical environment, where particle distributions are
   superthermal in nature. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Generous amount of waste food as refused fruits and vegetables are
   obtained on a global scale that is usually disposed in landfill or
   oceans. The waste fruits are enriched with fructose, glucose and sucrose
   along with minor amounts of cellulose and hemicellulose that could
   potentially be converted to biofuels and biochemicals. With this
   objective, fructose was used as a model compound of waste fruits and
   vegetables for gasification in supercritical water using a continuous
   flow tubular reactor. Different parameters influencing supercritical
   water gasification were investigated in this study such as temperature
   (550-700 degrees C), residence time (30-75 s), feed concentration (4-10
   wt\%) and catalyst concentration (0.2-0.8 wt\%) at a constant pressure
   of 25 MPa. Total gas yields, carbon gasification efficiency and hydrogen
   yields improved at an optimal temperature (700 degrees C), feed
   concentration (4 wt\%) and residence time (60 s). Fructose gasification
   with 0.8 wt\% KOH enhanced the selectivity for hydrogen (10.67 mol/mol)
   compared to those by 0.8 wt\% NaOH (9.86 mol/mol) and non-catalytic
   gasification (3.37 mol/mol). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{33-42}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Ni-based superalloy Haynes 230 is used in many applications such as very
   high temperature reactor (VHTR) or solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) where
   it is exposed to high temperature service environment. In order to
   improve the resistance for high temperature oxidation, the effect of
   crystallographic orientation on the early stage oxidation was
   investigated. It was demonstrated that different oxide thicknesses are
   formed on grains having different orientations. Comparison of electron
   backscatter diffraction (EBSD) orientation maps before and after
   oxidation at 900 degrees C indicates that grains near (111) orientation,
   especially with the deviation angle from < 111 > that is smaller than
   20, are more oxidation resistant than grains of other orientations.
   Correlation between the results of electron backscatter diffraction
   (EBSD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to compare the
   oxidation rate of grains having different crystallographic orientation.
   The oxidation rate was found to change with the crystallographic
   orientation as follows (111) < (110) < (100), also it was demonstrated
   that the oxidation rate changes are a nearly linear function of the
   angle of deviation from < 111 > direction. The morphology of surface
   oxide also depends on the orientation of grains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The epoxy ring opening and vicinal diacylation of fatty acids in
   vegetable oils was found to be promising reaction to synthesize stable
   biolubricants and bioplasticizers. The current research investigation is
   emphasized on the synthesis of a value added product vicinally
   diacylated canola oil by sulfated-ZrO2. The two-step research approach
   employed includes: (i) epoxidation, and (ii) epoxy ring opening and
   vicinal diacylation of epoxidized triglycerides in the canola oil.
   Sulfated-ZrO2 was prepared and characterized to measure the
   physico-chemical properties required for the effective catalysis. The
   Taguchi (L16 orthogonal array) statistical design method was employed to
   optimize the process conditions for the maximum formation of diacylated
   canola oil. Sulfated-ZrO2 demonstrated promising activity for the epoxy
   ring opening and vicinal diacylation of canola oil, and 99 \% conversion
   was achieved at the optimum process conditions of temperature 130 A
   degrees C, epoxy to acetic anhydride molar ratio (1:1.25), 16 wt\% of
   catalyst loading and reaction time of 1 h which were inferred from the
   Taguchi analyses. The products were characterized and confirmed with
   FT-IR, H-1 NMR and sodium spray mass spectroscopy. Spectroscopic
   analysis also confirmed the absence of intermediate products. The
   statistical analyses was undertaken to determine the order, rank and
   interactions among the process variables. The reaction followed
   Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson type mechanism and the kinetic data
   was fitted in overall second order equation. Calculated apparent
   activation energy was 23.1 kcal/mol.}},

Abstract = {{QCD Laplace sum rules are used to calculate heavy quarkonium (charmonium
   and bottomonium) hybrid masses in several distinct J(PC) channels.
   Previous studies of heavy quarkonium hybrids did not include the effects
   of dimension-six condensates, leading to unstable sum rules and
   unreliable mass predictions in some channels. We have updated these sum
   rules to include dimension-six condensates, providing new mass
   predictions for the spectra of heavy quarkonium hybrids. We confirm the
   finding of other approaches that the negative-parity J(PC) = (0, 1,
   2)(-+), 1(--) states form the lightest hybrid supermultiplet and the
   positive-parity J(PC) = (0, 1)+-, (0, 1, 2)(++) states are members of a
   heavier supermultiplet. Our results disfavor a pure charmonium hybrid
   interpretation of the X(3872), in agreement with previous work.}},

Abstract = {{Novel photoresist-based artificial bulk dielectrics with tall-embedded
   metal grids are investigated and their radiation characteristics are
   studied in detail. The embedded metal grid substantially increases
   (around six times) the effective permittivity of the low permittivity
   base photoresist material, and enables excitation with a simple direct
   microstrip feed to radiate effectively at frequencies similar to a
   high-permittivity dielectric resonator antenna (DRA). Moreover, the grid
   changes the near fields inside the resonator and introduces novel modes
   that are completely different than those of usual DRAs. A set of
   artificial resonator antennas is designed, lithographically fabricated,
   and measured to demonstrate the new modes resonating at 17 and 19 GHz
   with 2\% and 6\% bandwidth and 7.6 and 6.6 dB broadside gain,
   respectively, with suitable cross-polarization levels of better than -20
   dB. These new modes do not appear simultaneously, and can be excited
   separately by varying the length of the microstrip feed.}},

Title = {{Knee osteoarthritis patients with severe nocturnal pain have altered

Journal = {{OSTEOARTHRITIS AND CARTILAGE}},

Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Our objective was to investigate relationships between
   proximal tibial subchondral bone mineral density (BMD) and nocturnal
   pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).
   Methods: The preoperative knee of 42 patients booked for knee
   arthroplasty was scanned using quantitative computed tomography (QCT).
   Pain was measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
   Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and participants were categorized into three
   groups: `no pain', `moderate pain', and `severe pain' while lying down
   at night. We used depth-specific image processing to assess tibial
   subchondral BMD at normalized depths of 0-2.5 mm, 2.5-5.0 mm and 5-10 mm
   relative to the subchondral surface. Regional analyses of each medial
   and lateral plateau included total BMD and maximum BMD within a 10 mm
   diameter core or `focal spot'. The association between WOMAC pain scores
   and BMD measurements was assessed using Spearman's rank correlation.
   Regional BMD was compared pairwise between pain and no pain groups using
   multivariate analysis of covariance using age, sex, and BMI as
   covariates and Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.
   Results: Lateral focal BMD at the 2.5-5 mm depth was related to
   nocturnal pain (rho = 0.388, P = 0.011). The lateral focal BMD was 33\%
   higher in participants with `severe pain' than participants with `no
   pain' at 2.5-5 mm depth (P = 0.028) and 32\% higher at 5-10 mm depth (P
   = 0.049). There were no BMD differences at 0e2.5 mm from the subchondral
   surface.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that local subchondral bone density may
   have a role in elucidating OA-related pain pathogenesis. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{Caking may occur when granular potash fertilizer with a moisture content
   greater than 0.25 \% (w/w) undergoes drying. Since cake strength is
   proportional to the mass of crystal deposited per unit volume near
   contact points (and other factors) the modelling of mass deposition near
   contact points is important. The Young-Laplace equation for the
   air-salt-solution interface is used to determine the geometry of a 2-D
   planar saline film between two cubic potash particles. A 2-D theoretical
   model is developed and applied for ion diffusion and deposition near the
   contact point during drying. The numerical predictions of ion diffusion
   in an initially saturated salt illustrate the transient spatial
   distribution of new KCl deposits along the solid surfaces near the
   contact line. These results indicate the average salt deposition
   commences at the air-liquid-solid intersection, where the liquid film is
   thinnest, and moves toward the particle contact point with increasing
   area averaged KCl deposits, causing the formation of crystal deposits
   and bridges near contact points. It is concluded that the average salt
   deposit height increases inversely with distance from the contact point
   and decreases with initial contact angle of the contact region, but the
   deposition is nearly independent of the evaporation or drying rate near
   each contact region. Caking strength depends on, among other parameters,
   the amount of salt deposition near contact points.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging of a live animal within
   a lead-lined synchrotron light hutch presents several unique challenges.
   In order to confirm that the animal is under a stable plane of
   anaesthesia, several physiological parameters (e. g. heart rate,
   arterial oxygen saturation, core body temperature and respiratory rate)
   must be remotely monitored from outside the imaging hutch. In addition,
   to properly scan the thoracic region using CT, the animal needs to be
   held in a vertical position perpendicular to the fixed angle of the
   X-ray beam and free to rotate 180 degrees-360 degrees. A new X-ray
   transparent mouse restraint designed and fabricated using computer-aided

Abstract = {{Liquid-to-air membrane energy exchanger is a novel membrane base energy
   exchanger, which allows both heat and moisture transfer between air and
   a salt solution. The heat and mass transfer performance of a single one
   is significantly dependent on two dimensionless parameters: number of
   heat transfer units and the ratio of heat capacity rates between
   solution flow and air flow (Cr{*}). The performance of liquid-to-air
   membrane energy exchanger under high Cr{*} (i.e. Cr{*}1) has been
   comprehensively investigated experimentally and numerically in previous
   research. In this study, the effectiveness of a small-scale
   liquid-to-air membrane energy exchanger under low Cr{*} conditions (i.e.
   Cr{*}<1) is experimentally tested. Good agreement between the
   experimental and numerical results is achieved under low Cr{*}
   cases.Practical application: The ideal energy exchanger is one that can
   transfer both heat and moisture because during hot and humid conditions
   such an exchanger is capable of transferring up to four times as much
   energy as an exchanger that can transfer sensible heat only. It is
   beneficial if the exchanger can transfer heat and moisture also between
   remote supply and exhaust airstreams, as this may minimize the ducting
   required and reduces contaminant transfer from one airstream to the
   other. This is very important for applications such as hospitals,
   laboratories, and manufacturing facilities, where slight cross
   contamination can cause serious health effects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a topology optimization framework to design
   compliant mechanisms with a mixed mesh of both beams and flexure hinges
   for the design domain. Further, a new type of finite element, i.e.,
   super flexure hinge element, was developed to model flexure hinges.
   Then, an investigation into the effects of the location and size of a
   flexure hinge in a compliant lever explains why the point-flexure
   problem often occurs in the resulting design via topology optimization.
   Two design examples were presented to verify the proposed technique. The
   effects of link widths and hinge radii were also investigated. The
   results demonstrated that the proposed meshing scheme and topology
   optimization technique facilitate the rational decision on the locations
   and sizes of beams and flexure hinges in compliant mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Power systems can make use of electric vehicle (EV) charging to improve
   system reliability. EV charging can serve the grid with charging
   interruption and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capacity-injecting energy back
   into the system during the outage. However, the contribution of EVs is
   uncertain because they serve both the power system and the
   transportation sector. Scheduled EV charging can be affected either by
   failures of components such as charging facilities, or by human errors
   such as punctuality, rounding of time and errors in forecast of energy
   consumption. Moreover, with the introduction of the aggregator, the
   realization of EVs' grid services also plays an important role. This
   paper examines uncertainties of EV charging that can affect the EVs'
   capability to improve the system reliability. Methods are proposed to
   incorporate these uncertainties into generating system well-being
   analysis. Results show that the uncertainties identified directly affect
   EVs' contribution in the system well-being enhancement.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Usage of wide area PSSs (WAPSS) in actual power systems is limited
   because of their restricted adaptability to different operating
   conditions. Numerous adaptive control methods have been proposed to
   solve this problem, but they are limited due to strict prerequisites,
   such as the necessity of consistent excitations or large disturbances.
   This paper, therefore, presents a novel adaptive wide area PSS (AWAPSS),
   which has the ability of tracking system operating condition without the
   need for meeting the above prerequisites. The inherent dead-band
   structure of a WAPSS enables a steady system to perform like in an open
   loop, thus allowing the parameters of a WAPSS to be tuned adaptively
   through output-only modal analysis. The effectiveness of the novel
   AWAPSS has been validated in a two-area four-machine system as well as
   in a large complex system, China Southern Grid.}},

   propose a building-aggregator-grid contract framework and formulate a
   robust model predictive control (MPC) algorithm which both maximizes the
   profit of aggregator and minimizes the payment of each participating

Abstract = {{The spouting of fine particles is significantly different from that of
   coarse particles and a stable spouting can only be obtained under very
   constrained operating conditions. However, the stability of a spouted
   bed with fine particles can be effectively improved by addition of
   coarse particles. In this work, the flow regime transition and
   hydrodynamics of spouted beds with binary mixtures were experimentally
   investigated under a broad range of operating parameters. Effects of
   particle size, density, mixing ratio, gas velocity and nozzle diameter
   on flow regime transition and minimum spouting velocity in spouted beds
   were explored. The results show that a moderate increase in the mean
   particle diameter and density due to addition of coarse particles is
   beneficial to spouting stability. However, segregation is also observed
   when adding excess amount of coarse particles, thus leading to decreased
   spouting stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   crystalline phases were investigated with first-principles molecular
   dynamics calculations. The theoretical results reproduced the
   experimental trend. In all three systems the lithium migrations are
   found to be the similar through site-to-site hopping rather than free
   diffusion. The presence of vacant Li sites combined with the large
   surface area may be one of the reasons for the fast ionic conductivity
   in the nanoporous phase. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Boron incorporated diamond-like carbon (B-DLC) (up to 8wt.\% boron) thin
   films were synthesized on silicon wafers using biased target ion beam
   deposition technique, where diamond-like carbon (DLC) was deposited by
   ion beam deposition and boron (B) was simultaneously incorporated by
   biased target sputtering of a boron carbide (B4C) target under different
   conditions. Pure DLC films and B-C films were also synthesized by ion
   beam deposition and biased target sputtering of B4C under similar
   conditions, respectively, as reference samples. The microstructure and
   mechanical properties of the synthesized films have been characterized
   by various technologies. It has been found that B exists in different
   states in B-DLC, including carbon-rich and B-rich boron carbides, boron
   suboxide and boron oxide, and the oxidation of B probably occurs during
   the film deposition. The incorporation of B into DLC leads to the
   increase of sp(3) bonded carbon in the films, the increase of both film
   hardness and elastic modulus, and the decrease of both surface roughness
   and friction coefficient. Furthermore, the content of sp(3) bonded
   carbon, film hardness and elastic modulus increase, and the film surface
   roughness and friction coefficient decrease with the increase of B-rich
   carbide in the B-DLC films. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have shown that the electronic structure of graphene oxide is
   strongly, but reversibly, affected by temperature. Below 160 K, graphene
   oxide is much more completely oxidized, removing any last remaining
   pi-conjugated network. Through DFT simulations, we have shown that this
   is due to buckling-induced oxidation. As temperature is reduced, the
   lightly oxidized, graphene-like zones attempt to expand due to a
   negative thermal expansion coefficient (TEC), but the heavily oxidized
   zones, with a TEC that is near zero, prevent this from happening. This
   contributes to localized buckling. The deformed regions oxidize much
   more readily, and the 1,2-epoxide groups form a new type of functional
   group never before seen: a triply bonded oxygen, bonded at the 1,3,5
   sites of the hexagonal carbon rings. We have called this group
   TB-epoxide. Stable only under buckling, the TB-epoxide groups revert
   back to 1,2-epoxides once the lattice relaxes to a flatter profile. We
   have shown that one can alter the electronic structure of graphene oxide
   to induce temporary, but more complete, oxidation via strain.}},

Month = {{AUG 17}},
Abstract = {{Electron density distributions in alpha-Ge have been determined under
   high pressure using maximum entropy method with structure factors
   obtained from single crystal synchrotron x-ray diffraction in a diamond
   anvil cell. The results show that the sp(3) bonding is enhanced with
   increasing pressure up to 7.7(1) GPa. At higher pressures but below the
   alpha-beta transition pressure of 11.0(1) GPa, the sp(3)-like electron
   distribution progressively weakens with a concomitant increase of
   d-orbitals hybridization. The participation of d-orbitals in the
   electronic structure is supported by Ge K beta(2) (4p-1s) x-ray emission
   spectroscopy measurements showing the reduction of 4s character in the
   valence band at pressures far below the alpha-beta transition. The
   gradual increase of d-orbitals in the valence level in the stability
   field of alpha-Ge is directly related to the eventual structural
   transition. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{FOOD CHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{181}},

Abstract = {{Porous starch xanthate (PSX) and porous starch citrate (PSC) were
   prepared in anticipation of the attached xanthate and carboxylate groups
   respectively forming chelation and electrostatic interactions with heavy
   metal ions in the subsequent adsorption process. The lead(II) ion was
   selected as the model metal and its adsorption by PSX and PSC was
   characterized. The adsorption capacity was highly dependent on the
   carbon disulfide/starch and citric acid/starch mole ratios used during
   preparation. The adsorption behaviors of lead(II) ion on PSXs and PSCs
   fit both the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm
   model. The maximum adsorption capacity from the Langmuir isotherm
   equation reached 109.1 and 57.6 mg/g for PSX and PSC when preparation
   conditions were optimized, and the adsorption times were just 20 and 60
   min, respectively. PSX and PSC may be used as effective adsorbents for
   removal of heavy metals from contaminated liquid. Crown Copyright (C)

   damaged tissue or replace a defective organ. Common strategies in tissue
   engineering to repair and form new tissue containing a functional

   well-distributed, interconnected, and stable vascular network still
   remains challenging. In addition, anastomoses with host vasculature upon
   implantation and long-time survival of the new blood vessel in vivo are
   other critical issues to be addressed. This paper presents a brief
   review of recent advances in vascularization in vitro as well as in vivo
   for tissue engineering, along with suggestions for future research.}},

Title = {{Hydrogen segregation and its roles in structural stability and
   metallization: silane under pressure}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{We present results from first-principles calculations on silane (SiH4)
   under pressure. We find that a three dimensional P-3 structure becomes
   the most stable phase above 241 GPa. A prominent structural feature,
   which separates the P-3 structure from previously observed/predicted
   SiH4 structures, is that a fraction of hydrogen leaves the Si-H bonding
   environment and forms segregated H-2 units. The H-2 units are sparsely
   populated in the system and intercalated with a polymeric Si-H
   framework. Calculations of enthalpy of formation suggest that the P-3
   structure is against the decomposition into Si-H binaries and/or the
   elemental crystals. Structural stability of the P-3 structure is
   attributed to the electron-deficient multicenter Si-H-Si interactions
   when neighboring silicon atoms are linked together through a common
   hydrogen atom. Within the multicenter bonds, electrons are delocalized
   and this leads to a metallic state, possibly also a superconducting
   state, for SiH4. An interesting outcome of the present study is that the
   enthalpy sum of SiH4 (P-3 structure) and Si (fcc structure) appears to
   be lower than the enthalpy of disilane (Si2H6) between 200 and 300 GPa
   (for all previously predicted crystalline forms of Si2H6), which calls
   for a revisit of the stability of Si2H6 under high pressure.}},

Title = {{The electrical conductivity of Al2O3 under shock-compression}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{Sapphire (Al2O3) crystals are used below 100 GPa as anvils and windows
   in dynamic-compression experiments because of their transparency and
   high density. Above 100 GPa shock pressures, sapphire becomes opaque and
   electrically conducting because of shock-induced defects. Such effects
   prevent temperature and dc conductivity measurements of materials
   compressed quasi-isentropically. Opacities and electrical conductivities
   at similar to 100 GPa are non-equilibrium, rather than thermodynamic
   parameters. We have performed electronic structure calculations as a
   guide in predicting and interpreting shock experiments and possibly to
   discover a window up to similar to 200 GPa. Our calculations indicate
   shocked sapphire does not metallize by band overlap at similar to 300
   GPa, as suggested previously by measured non-equilibrium data.
   Shock-compressed Al2O3 melts to a metallic liquid at similar to 500 GPa
   and 10,000 K and its conductivity increases rapidly to similar to 2000
   Omega(-1)cm(-1) at similar to 900 GPa. At these high shock temperatures
   and pressures sapphire is in thermal equilibrium. Calculated
   conductivity of Al2O3 is similar to those measured for metallic fluid H,
   N, O, Rb, and Cs. Despite different materials, pressures and
   temperatures, and compression techniques, both experimental and
   theoretical, conductivities of all these poor metals reach a common end
   state typical of strong-scattering disordered materials.}},

Abstract = {{Corn stover and peanut shells are both abundantly available biomass
   feedstocks in China. To determine the compression characteristics and
   energy requirement of briquettes, mixtures of the corn stover and peanut
   shells were compressed under three different pressures (30, 60, and 90
   MPa) with three moisture contents (9\%, 14\%, and 19\%, wet basis) and
   five corn stover-peanut shell mixtures (0\%-100\%, 25\%-75\%, 50\%-50\%,
   75\%-25\%, and 100\%-0\%) by mass. The results showed that applied
   pressure, moisture content, and the corn stover-peanut shell mixture all
   significantly affected briquette density and specific energy
   consumption. The density of the briquette ranged from 646 to 1052
   kg/m(3) and the specific energy consumption varied from 6.6 to 25.1
   MJ/t. A moisture content of 9\% was found to be better for the
   compression of the corn stover and peanut shells mixture. Adding peanut
   shells to the corn stover improved briquette density and reduced the
   specific energy consumption. Linear models were developed to describe
   the briquette density and the specific energy consumption. The briquette
   durability ranged from 57\% to 94\% and durable briquettes can be
   obtained when corn stover and peanut shells are compressed with the
   mixing ratio of 1:1 (50\%-50\%) at moisture content of 9\%.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{68-76}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{In this work, the effects of different methods of activation on CO2
   adsorption performance of activated carbon were studied. Activated
   carbons were prepared from biochar, obtained from fast pyrolysis of
   white wood, using three different activation methods of steam
   activation, CO2 activation and Potassium hydroxide (KOH) activation. CO2
   adsorption behavior of the produced activated carbons was studied in a
   fixed-bed reactor set-up at atmospheric pressure, temperature range of
   25-65 degrees C and inlet CO2 concentration range of 10-30 mol\% in He
   to determine the effects of the surface area, porosity and surface
   chemistry on adsorption capacity of the samples. Characterization of the
   micropore and mesopore texture was carried out using N-2 and CO2
   adsorption at 77 and 273 K, respectively. Central composite design was
   used to evaluate the combined effects of temperature and concentration
   of CO2 on the adsorption behavior of the adsorbents. The KOH activated
   carbon with a total micropore volume of 0.62 cm(3)/g and surface area of
   1400 m(2)/g had the highest CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.8 mol/kg due to
   its microporous structure and high surface area under the optimized
   experimental conditions of 30 mol\% CO2 and 25 degrees C. The
   performance of the adsorbents in multi-cyclic adsorption process was
   also assessed and the adsorption capacity of KOH and CO2 activated
   carbons remained remarkably stable after 50 cycles with low temperature
   (160 degrees C) regeneration. (C) 2015 The Research Center for

   Commercial-Scale Sulfur Block}},
Journal = {{VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Elemental sulfur (S-0) is commonly stored in aboveground blocks formed
   by pouring molten S-0 in thin lifts. The long-term storage of S-0 blocks
   is a potential source of high acidity effluent as a result of the
   oxidation of S-0 to H2SO4, resulting in effluent waters with low pH and
   elevated SO42- concentrations. These blocks are currently managed during
   operations within a secure, engineered, containment facility.
   Characterization of the accessibility of the S-0 block to O-2 and water
   ingress is required to fully understand the generation of H2SO4 within
   the block. The O-2 and water ingress are defined by the gas (K-g) and
   liquid (K-l) conductivity of the S-0 block. We present the results of in
   situ gas pumping tests in vertical and angled boreholes conducted on an
   aboveground S-0 block to determine K-g within the block and to
   indirectly determine Kl. The K-g test results showed that the block is
   highly conductive in both the horizontal (geometric mean = 2.3 x 10(-4)
   m s(-1)) and vertical (geometric mean = 1.7 x 10(-5) m s(-1)) directions
   and heterogeneous with respect to K-g. Results of the cross-hole tests
   were considered to yield more representative estimates of bulk K-g than
   single-well tests because cross-hole tests are relatively insensitive to
   high head loss associated with turbulent flow conditions that develop
   near the borehole. In addition, numerical modeling of cross-hole test
   data provided insight into the anisotropic nature of K-g of the S0
   block. Corresponding values of anisotropic Kl computed from K-g were 2.6
   x 10(-3) m s(-1) (horizontal) and 1.9 x 10(-4) m s(-1) (vertical). Given
   that S-0 blocks are constructed in a similar manner throughout the
   world, the results of this study should be generally applicable to other
   S-0 blocks.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the allotropic phase transition and its effect on the

   After annealing at temperatures higher than 500 up to 750 degrees C, the
   y phase is observed in the structure, again. But, this phase is
   disappeared by annealing at temperatures above 750 degrees C due to the
   formation of vanadium-rich precipitates. Thermocalc software was used in
   order to elucidate the influence of vanadium percent on the stability of
   gamma phase in Fe-Co alloys. Also, magnetic studies showed that the
   saturation induction is reduced by annealing at temperatures from 500 up
   to 750 degrees C, which is related to the formation of residual
   non-magnetic gamma phase.}},

Abstract = {{Modulation instability of ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) is investigated in a
   collisionless unmagnetized one dimensional plasma, containing positive
   ions and electrons following the mixed nonextensive nonthermal
   distribution {[}Tribeche et al., Phys. Rev. E 85, 037401 (2012)]. Using
   the reductive perturbation technique, a nonlinear Schrodinger equation
   which governs the modulation instability of the IAWs is obtained. Valid
   range of plasma parameters has been fixed and their effects on the
   modulational instability discussed in detail. We find that the plasma
   supports both bright and dark solutions. The valid domain for the wave
   number k where instabilities set in varies with both nonextensive
   parameter q as well as non thermal parameter a. Moreover, the analysis
   is extended for the rational solutions of IAWs in the instability
   regime. Present study is useful for the understanding of IAWs in the

Abstract = {{Farley-Buneman modes are an example of the collisional instability,
   which is thought to be the dominant mechanism for the irregularities in
   low ionosphere region. Despite high collisionality due to
   electron-neutral and ion-neutral collisions, the kinetic effects
   associated with finite temperature are important for determination of
   the mode frequencies and growth rate. This is especially important for
   ion component that is largely unmagnetized due to low ion cyclotron
   frequency. The ion thermal effects are strongly pronounced for shorter
   wavelengths and are crucial for the growth rate cut-off at high
   wavenumbers. We develop an extended fluid model for ion dynamics to
   incorporate the effects of ion thermal motion. The model is based on the
   extended MHD model that includes the evolution equations for higher
   order moments such as ion viscosity and ion heat flux. We also develop
   the generalized Chapman-Enskog closure model that provides exact linear
   closures based on the linearized kinetic equation. The results of these
   models are compared and tested against the linear kinetic model. The
   dispersion of Farley-Buneman modes and growth rate behavior are
   investigated in the short wavelength region. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{The adult mammalian central nervous system has limited ability to
   regenerate after injury. This is due, in part, to the presence of
   myelin-associated axon growth inhibitory proteins such as Nogo-A that
   bind and activate the Nogo receptor, leading to profound inhibition of
   actin-based motility within the growing axon tip. This paper presents an
   in vitro study of the use of a Nogo receptor-blocking peptide to
   antagonize the inhibitory effect of Nogo-A on axon growth. Alginate
   nanospheres were fabricated using an emulsion technique and loaded with
   Nogo receptor-blocking peptide, or with other model proteins. Protein
   release profiles were studied, and retention of the bioactivity of
   released proteins was verified. Primary dorsal root ganglion neurons
   were cultured and their ability to grow neurites was challenged with
   Nogo-A chimeric protein in the absence or presence of Nogo receptor
   antagonist peptide-loaded alginate nanospheres. Our results demonstrate
   that peptide released from alginate nanospheres could overcome the
   growth inhibitory effect of Nogo-A, suggesting that a similar peptide
   delivery strategy using alginate nanospheres might be used to improve
   axon regeneration within the injured central nervous system.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper, microstructural changes across an as-welded
   dissimilar austenitic/duplex stainless steel couple welded by a super
   duplex stainless steel filler metal using gas tungsten arc welding
   process is characterized with optical microscopy and electron
   back-scattered diffraction techniques. Accordingly, variations of
   microstructure, texture, and grain boundary character distribution of
   base metals, heat affected zones, and weld metal were investigated. The
   results showed that the weld metal, which was composed of Widmanstatten
   austenite side-plates and allotriomorphic grain boundary austenite
   morphologies, had the weakest texture and was dominated by low angle
   boundaries. The welding process increased the ferrite content but
   decreased the texture intensity at the heat affected zone of the super
   duplex stainless steel base metal. In addition, through partial
   ferritization, it changed the morphology of elongated grains of the
   rolled microstructure to twinned partially transformed austenite
   plateaus scattered between ferrite textured colonies. However, the
   texture of the austenitic stainless steel heat affected zone was
   strengthened via encouraging reaystallization and formation of annealing
   twins. At both interfaces, an increase in the special character
   coincident site lattice boundaries of the primary phase as well as a
   strong texture with < 100 > orientation, mainly of Goss component, was
   observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of microstructure and texture across an as-welded
   dissimilar UNS S32750 super duplex/UNS S30403 austenitic stainless steel
   joint welded by UNS S30986 (AWS A5.9 ER309LMo) austenitic stainless
   steel filler metal using gas tungsten arc welding process was evaluated
   by optical micrography and EBSD techniques. Due to their fabrication
   through rolling process, both parent metals had texture components
   resulted from deformation and recrystallization. The weld metal showed
   the highest amount of residual strain and had large austenite grain
   colonies of similar orientations with little amounts of skeletal
   ferrite, both oriented preferentially in the < 001 > direction with
   cub-on-cube orientation relationship. While the super duplex stainless
   steel's heat affected zone contained higher ferrite than its parent
   metal, an excessive grain growth was observed at the austenitic
   stainless steel's counterpart. At both heat affected zones, austenite
   underwent some recrystallization and formed twin boundaries which led to
   an increase in the fraction of high angle boundaries as compared with
   the respective base metals. These regions showed the least amount of
   residual strain and highest amount of recrystallized austenite grains.
   Due to the static recrystallization, the fraction of low degree of fit
   (Sigma) coincident site lattice boundaries, especially 1,3 boundaries,
   was increased in the austenitic stainless steel heat affected zone,
   while the formation of subgrains in the ferrite phase increased the
   content of <5 degrees low angle boundaries at that of the super duplex
   stainless steel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Prediction of local proximal tibial subchondral bone structural

Abstract = {{Background: Quantitative computed tomography based subject-specific
   finite element modeling has potential to clarify the role of subchondral
   bone alterations in knee osteoarthritis initiation, progression, and
   pain initiation. Calculation of bone elastic moduli from image data is a
   basic step when constructing finite element models. However, different
   relationships between elastic moduli and imaged density (known as
   density-modulus relationships) have been reported in the literature. The
   objective of this study was to apply seven different trabecular-specific
   and two cortical-specific density-modulus relationships from the
   literature to finite element models of proximal tibia subchondral bone,
   and identify the relationship(s) that best predicted experimentally
   measured local subchondral structural stiffness with highest explained
   variance and least error.
   Methods: Thirteen proximal tibial compartments were imaged via
   quantitative computed tomography. Imaged bone mineral density was
   converted to elastic moduli using published density-modulus
   relationships and mapped to corresponding finite element models.
   Proximal tibial structural stiffness values were compared to
   experimentally measured stiffness values from in-situ macro-indentation
   testing directly on the subchondral bone surface (47 indentation
   points).
   Findings: Regression lines between experimentally measured and finite
   element calculated stiffness had R-2 values ranging from 0.56 to 0.77.
   Normalized root mean squared error varied from 16.6\% to 337.6\%.
   Interpretation: Of the 21 evaluated density-modulus relationships in
   this study, Goulet combined with Snyder and Schneider or Rho appeared
   most appropriate for finite element modeling of local subchondral bone
   structural stiffness. Though, further studies are needed to optimize
   density-modulus relationships and improve finite element estimates of
   local subchondral bone structural stiffness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Soft Error Rates (SER) of hardened and unhardened SRAM cells need to be
   experimentally characterized to determine their appropriate applications
   in radiation environments. This characterization is especially important
   when low supply voltage is preferred. In this paper, we developed an
   SRAM test chip with four cell arrays including two types of unhardened
   cells (standard 6T and subthreshold 10T) and two types of hardened cells
   (Quatro and DICE). This test chip was fabricated in a 65 nm bulk
   technology and irradiated by heavy ions at different supply voltages.
   Experimental results show that the SERs of 6T and 10T cells present
   significant sensitivities to supply voltages when the particle linear
   energy transfers (LETs) are relatively low. For Quatro and DICE cells,
   one does not consistently show superior hardening performance over the
   other. It is also noted that Quatro cells show significant advantage in
   single event resilience over 10T cells although they consume similar
   areas. TCAD simulations were carried out to validate the experimental
   data. In addition, the error amount distributions follow a Poisson
   distribution very well for each type of cell array.}},

Abstract = {{A hot-rolled Ni -Ti -Fe alloy was subjected to 50 \% cold rolling by
   laboratory rolling mill and was subsequently annealed at 800 degrees C
   for 1.5 h. This sample was then deformed through another 10 \% reduction
   in thickness by two different routes (i) conventional cold rolling and
   (ii) marforming (rolling in liquid nitrogen) followed by annealing under
   identical conditions. The grain refinement during normal cold rolling
   was attributed to relatively large presence of dislocations in the ND
   //< 110 > grains in the starting microstructure. The regions of higher
   dislocation densities became gradually textured to ND //< 111 >
   orientation, with cold rolling. Marforming (deformation in liquid
   nitrogen following phase transformation) on the other hand led to more
   significant grain refinement and also change in the bulk texture. The
   objective of this study was to compare the grain refinement and
   microstructural modification produced through marforming with that
   obtained in conventional cold deformation.}},

Abstract = {{The role of subchondral bone in OA pathogenesis is unclear. While some
   OA-related changes to morphology and material properties in different
   bone regions have been described, the effect of these alterations on
   subchondral bone surface stiffness has not been investigated. The
   objectives of this study were to characterize the individual (Objective
   1) and combined (Objective 2) effects of OA-related morphological and
   mechanical alterations to subchondral and epiphyseal bone on surface
   stiffness of the proximal tibia. We developed and validated a parametric
   FE model of the proximal tibia using quantitative CT images of 10
   fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens and in situ macro-indentation testing.
   Using this validated FE model, we estimated the individual and combined
   roles of OA-related alterations in subchondral cortical thickness and
   elastic modulus, and subchondral trabecular and epiphyseal trabecular
   elastic moduli on local surface stiffness. A 20\% increase in
   subchondral cortical or subchondral trabecular elastic moduli resulted
   in little change in stiffness (1\% increase). A 20\% reduction in
   epiphyseal trabecular elastic modulus, however, resulted in an 11\%
   reduction in stiffness. Our parametric analysis suggests that
   subchondral bone stiffness is affected primarily by epiphyseal
   trabecular bone elastic modulus rather than subchondral cortical and
   trabecular morphology or mechanical properties. Our results suggest that
   observed OA-related alterations to epiphyseal trabecular bone (e.g.,
   lower mineralization, bone volume fraction, density and elastic modulus)
   may contribute to OA proximal tibiae being less stiff than normal. (C)

Title = {{Quantification of the climate change-induced variations in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{527}},
Pages = {{990-1005}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves are typically used as a
   standard design tool for various engineering applications, such as storm
   water management systems. Warming climate, however, changes the extreme
   precipitation quantiles represented by the IDF curves. This study
   attempts to construct the future IDF curves in Saskatoon, Canada, under
   possible climate change scenarios. For this purpose, a stochastic
   weather generator was used to spatially downscale the daily projections
   of Global Climate Models (GCMs) from coarse grid resolution to the local
   point scale. The stochastically downscaled daily precipitation
   realizations were further disaggregated to ensembles of hourly and
   sub-hourly (as fine as 5-min) series using a disaggregation scheme
   developed based on the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) technique. This
   framework was applied to construct the future IDF curves in the city of
   Saskatoon. The sensitivity of the K-NN disaggregation model to the
   number of nearest neighbors (i.e. window size) was evaluated during the
   baseline period (1961-1990). The optimum window size was assigned based
   on the performance in reproducing the historical IDF curves. By using
   the simulated hourly and sub-hourly precipitation series and the
   Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution, future changes in IDF
   curves and associated uncertainties were quantified using a large
   ensemble of projections obtained from eight GCMs and three
   representative concentration pathways - RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. The
   constructed IDF curves were then compared with the corresponding
   historical ones and the IDF curves constructed using another genetic
   programming-based published method. The results show that the sign and
   the magnitude of future variations in extreme precipitation quantiles
   are sensitive to the selection of GCMs and/or RCPs, which seem to get
   intensified toward the end of the 21st century. The quantification of
   uncertainties suggests that GCMs are the main contributor to the
   uncertainty, followed by RCPs and the downscaling method. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Stainless steels are among the most economical and highly practicable
   materials widely used in industrial areas due to their mechanical and
   corrosion resistances. In this study, a dissimilar weld joint consisting
   of an AISI 316L austenitic stainless steel (ASS) and a UNS S32750
   dual-phase stainless steel was obtained under optimized welding
   conditions by gas tungsten arc welding technique using AWS A5.4:ER2594
   filler metal. The effect of welding on the evolution of the
   microstructure, crystallographic texture, and micro-hardness
   distribution was also studied. The weld metal (WM) was found to be
   dual-phased; the microstructure is obtained by a fully ferritic
   solidification mode followed by austenite precipitation at both ferrite
   boundaries and ferrite grains through solid-state transformation. It is
   found that welding process can affect the ferrite content and grain
   growth phenomenon. The strong textures were found in the base metals for
   both steels. The AISI 316L ASS texture is composed of strong cube
   component. In the UNS S32750 dual-phase stainless steel, an important
   difference between the two phases can be seen in the texture evolution.
   Austenite phase is composed of a major cube component, whereas the
   ferrite texture mainly contains a major rotated cube component. The
   texture of the ferrite is stronger than that of austenite. In the WM,
   Kurdjumov-Sachs crystallographic orientation relationship is found in
   the solidification microstructure. The analysis of the Kernel average
   misorientation distribution shows that the residual strain is more
   concentrated in the austenite phase than in the other phase. The welding
   resulted in a significant hardness increase in the WM compared to
   initial ASS.}},

Abstract = {{In tissue engineering, the cell and scaffold approach has shown promise
   as a treatment to regenerate diseased and/or damaged tissue. In this
   treatment, an artificial construct (scaffold) is seeded with cells,
   which organize and proliferate into new tissue. The scaffold itself
   biodegrades with time, leaving behind only newly formed tissue. The
   degradation qualities of the scaffold are critical during the treatment
   period, since the change in the mechanical properties of the scaffold
   with time can influence cell behavior. To observe in time the scaffold's
   mechanical properties, a straightforward method is to deform the
   scaffold and then characterize scaffold deflection accordingly. However,
   experimentally observing the scaffold deflection is challenging. This
   paper presents a novel study on characterization of mechanical
   properties of scaffolds by phase contrast imaging and finite element
   modeling, which specifically includes scaffold fabrication, scaffold
   imaging, image analysis, and finite elements (FEs) modeling of the
   scaffold mechanical properties. The innovation of the work rests on the
   use of in-line phase contrast X-ray imaging at 20 KeV to characterize
   tissue scaffold deformation caused by ultrasound radiation forces and
   the use of the Fourier transform to identify movement. Once deformation
   has been determined experimentally, it is then compared with the
   predictions given by the forward solution of a finite element model. A
   consideration of the number of separate loading conditions necessary to
   uniquely identify the material properties of transversely isotropic and
   fully orthotropic scaffolds is also presented, along with the use of an
   FE as a form of regularization.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of the effectiveness of large heat wheels using
   standard measured data and test conditions can be very expensive and
   time consuming. The main contribution of this paper is that it tests
   heat wheel components rather than the wheel itself. In addition, this
   paper deals directly with the question of what accuracy can be achieved
   for the determination of sensible energy effectiveness by using a
   transient step change method for the exchanger matrix materials in a
   test cell. In this study, the sensible effectiveness of heat wheels is
   predicted by performing a number of cyclic and single step change
   transient experiments on a parallel-plate heat exchanger. A new
   experimental facility is developed to cause a step change for the inlet
   air temperature of the exchanger. In the cyclic tests, the heat
   exchanger is exposed to a periodic inlet temperature steps; afterward,
   the sensible effectiveness of parallel-flow and counter-flow heat wheel,
   comprised of the same material as parallel-plate exchanger, is
   determined using the obtained temperature profiles. It is find that this
   method can be used to determine the sensible effectiveness of
   parallel-flow heat wheel. However, the high uncertainty found in the
   sensible effectiveness of counter-flow heat wheel, +/- 32\%, makes the
   results unreliable. In the single step-change test, a time constant is
   assigned to the exchanger response when it is subjected to a step change
   in inlet temperature. The time constant is obtained by fitting the
   experimental data to a first order exponential time response curve. An
   analytical solution posits that the effectiveness of the heat wheel
   depends only on the product of the time constant and the wheel angular
   speed, or angle ratio. Comparing values of the sensible effectiveness
   calculated through available empirical correlations and the ones
   obtained by single step change experiment showed less than 3\%
   difference in results when the heat capacity rate ratio is greater than
   5. It is concluded that due to simplicity, accuracy, and low cost of the
   single step change experiments, it is the preferred method to determine
   the effectiveness of heat wheels operating at a specified rotary speeds,
   provided the flow channel geometries and Reynolds numbers for both the
   wheel and the small-scale test cell. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Green diesel or straight chain hydrocarbons are produced by the
   hydrodeoxygenation of bio-based feedstocks such as vegetable oils and
   bio-oils. Usage of green diesel for commercial purpose can be economical
   to cater the energy demands of the present generation. Traditionally,
   transition metal sulfides have been used for hydrotreating reactions and
   more recently usage of transition metallic carbide, nitride, boride and
   phosphide catalysts are gaining importance. In this comprehensive
   review, it is intended to focus on some major developments in catalyst
   design methodology pertaining to hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction
   systems. The details related to the different catalysts used for the
   hydrodeoxygenation reaction are also discussed. Most of the research
   works have been carried out using model compounds such as guaiacol and
   phenol using moderately-highly acidic supports such as Al2O3, ZrO2 and
   TiO2 and active metals such as palladium, platinum, nickel and
   molybdenum. Factors to be considered for the choice of feed stock,
   selection of support material, active metals, promoters and their
   influence on the hydrodeoxygenation reaction, catalyst design procedure,
   catalyst preparation method and the influence of the catalyst treatment
   methods on the morphology of catalyst and their performance are
   discussed in this review paper. Most research works have focused on
   usage of acidic support materials and focus on basic support materials
   is scarce. Choice is promoters is highly dependent on the
   promoter-support interaction and it is essential to ensure minimum
   promoter-support interaction for the efficient performance of the
   catalyst. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of defrosting methods for air-to-air heat/energy exchangers
   on energy consumption of ventilation}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{32-40}},

Abstract = {{Energy consumption for ventilation is extensive in cold climates.
   Air-to-air heat/energy recovery is a well-known and effective method to
   reduce the energy consumption. However, frosting commonly occurs inside
   heat/energy exchangers in cold climates, which would significantly
   degrade the performance of the exchangers. Preheating the outdoor air
   and bypassing the outdoor airflow are two effective methods for frosting
   prevention or defrosting. In this study, the performance of two
   cross-flow heat/energy exchangers at frosting and defrosting periods are
   experimentally tested under different operating conditions and the
   values of frosting limit and defrosting time ratio are presented. As
   well, the effects of these two defrosting methods on energy consumption
   of ventilation in three cold cities (i.e. Saskatoon, Anchorage and
   Chicago) are evaluated. The results show the outdoor air preheating
   method performs better than the outdoor air bypassing method. In
   addition, the heat/energy recovery potential in Saskatoon undergoes the
   largest reduction under frosting, and the cold weather conditions have
   less impact on energy exchangers than heat exchangers for heat/energy
   recovery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates minimization of both the makespan and delivery
   costs in on-line supply chain scheduling for single-machine and
   parallel-machine configurations in a transportation system with a single
   customer. The jobs are released as they arrive, which implies that no
   information on upcoming jobs, such as the release time, processing time,
   and quantity, is known beforehand to the scheduler. The jobs are
   processed on one machine or parallel machines and delivered to the
   customer. The primary objective of the scheduling is time, which is
   makespan in this case. The delivery cost, which changes due to the
   varying number of batches (though the cost for each batch is assumed to
   be the same) in delivery, is also concerned. The goal of scheduling is
   thus to minimize both the makespan and the total delivery cost This
   scheduling involves deciding when to process jobs, which machine to
   process jobs, when to deliver jobs, and which batch to include jobs. We
   define 10 problems in terms of (1) the machine configuration, (2)
   preemption of job processing, (3) the number of vehicles, and (4) the
   capacity of vehicles. These problems (P1, P2,..., P10) have never been
   studied before in literature. The lower bound for each problem is first
   proved by constructing a series of intractable instances. Algorithms for
   these problems, denoted by H1, H2,..., H10, respectively, are then
   designed and a theoretical analysis is performed. The results show that
   H1, H2, H6, and H7 are optimal ones according to the competitive ratio
   criterion, while the other algorithms deviate slightly from the optimum.
   We also design the optimal algorithm for a special case of P5. A case
   study is provided to illustrate the performance of H5 and to demonstrate
   the practicality of the algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2), one of the most important planetary materials, has

   We have studied the molten structures of CO2-V with first-principles
   molecular dynamic calculations at 60GPa and different temperatures. The
   formation of oxygen molecules in the melt is consistent with
   experimental observations. In particular, the melting transition is
   accompanying by metallization. The metallic behavior is shown to
   originate from electron delocalization between oxygen via the overlap of
   the orbitals from the dissociated oxygen-rich species. Metallic molten
   CO2 is a potential candidate to explain the high conductivities of the
   Earth's lower mantle. Furthermore, theoretical results do not support

   to be ineffective for removal of organic compounds while it led to a
   gradual decrease in manganese concentration. Although UV-ozonation could
   remove manganese completely at initial ozone concentration of 15.2 ppm,
   oxidation with ozone alone at initial concentration of 6.2 ppm is found
   to be the most suitable condition for manganese removal. At low initial
   ozone concentration of 6.2 ppm, the removal for manganese reached
   97.2\%. The only limitation of ozonation is that over-oxidation occurs
   when the initial ozone concentration exceeds 6.2 ppm, and therefore the
   efficiency of the treatment decreases due to the production of soluble
   permanganate. It was also found that the highest oxidation efficiency
   for the organic carbon is 89\% which occurs in UV-ozonation treatment at

Abstract = {{In this study, the evolution of annealing texture in nanostructured
   steel-based composite processed by accumulative roll bonding (ARB) was
   investigated. Textural evolution after post-annealing of ARB-processed
   samples was evaluated using X-ray diffraction. There was a texture
   transition in the epsilon-fiber during ARB process and post-annealing
   treatment. Average grain size of the sample before and after the
   post-annealing was 73 nm and 1.8 mu m, respectively, and the
   microstructures were relatively uniform. It was found that with
   increasing the number of cycles, the volume fraction of the low angle
   grain boundary (LAGB) decreased and that of the high angle grain
   boundary (HAGB) increased. Also, the shear texture was dominant after
   the second and third ARB cycles, while for other samples, the rolling
   texture was dominant. The two-cycle and three-cycle samples obviously
   indicated a weak alpha-fiber and gamma-fiber and a relatively strong
   zeta-fiber. It was proposed that the recrystallization led to a decrease
   in the alpha-fiber and gamma-fiber and rolling texture components such
   as \{111\}< 110 > and \{111\}< 112 >. On the other hand, the grain
   growth after recrystallization resulted in an increase in the a-fiber

Abstract = {{In this study, the stability and electronic characteristics of epitaxial
   silicene bilayers and multilayers on the Ag(111) surface are
   investigated through synchrotron-based soft X-ray emission and
   absorption spectroscopy and first-principles, full-potential density
   functional theory simulations. The calculations predict a novel
   tristable AA-stacked bilayer structure that can explain the (3 x 3)R30
   degrees honeycomb topography commonly observed through scanning
   tunneling microscopy and noncontact atomic force microscopy. It is
   reported that the electronic structure of this epitaxial bilayer is
   similar to those of epitaxial monolayers on Ag(111), namely, metallic
   and showing significant interaction with the underlying substrate.
   However, the soft X-ray spectroscopy experiments suggest that during
   multilayer growth a majority of the epitaxial silicon reverts to a
   bulk-like state, a result that has significant implications toward the
   existence of large-area epitaxial silicene multilayers.}},

Abstract = {{Selenium (Se) reservoirs in coal waste rock from the Elk Valley,
   southeastern British Columbia, the location of Canada's major
   steelmaking coal mines, were characterized and quantified by analyzing
   samples collected from the parent rock, freshly blasted waste rock (less
   than 10 days old), and aged waste rock (deposited between 1982 and
   2012). Se is present throughout the waste rock dumps at a mean
   digestible (Se-D) concentration of 3.12 mg/kg. Microprobe analyses show
   that Se is associated with the primary minerals sphalerite, pyrite,
   barite, and chalcopyrite and secondary Fe oxyhydroxides. Selenium K-edge
   X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy analyses indicate that, on
   average, 21\% of Se is present as selenide (Se2-) in pyrite and
   sphalerite, 19\% of Se is present as selenite (Se4+) in barite, 21\% of
   Se is present as exchangeable Fe oxyhydroxide and clay-adsorbed Se4+ and
   39\% of Se is present as organoselenium associated with coaly matter.
   The dominant source minerals for aqueous-phase Se are pyrite and
   sphalerite. Secondary Fe oxyhydroxide sequesters, on average, 37\% of Se
   released by pyrite oxidation; Measured long-term Se fluxes from a rock
   drain at the base of a waste dump suggest that at least 20\% of
   Se2--bearing sulfides were oxidized and released from that dump over the
   past 30 year period; however, the Se mass lost was not evident in Se-D
   analyses.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE}},

Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{The self-healing materials attract a lot of attention as self-healing
   ability considerably improves reliability of service and extends the
   life time of materials. However, the present self-healing materials lack
   the mechanical strength and thus cannot be used in practical
   applications. The industrial elastomer (VHB 4910) is a strong polymer,
   which has been used as dielectric actuator. Surprisingly, we observed
   that VHB 4910 has autonomic self-healing ability. As this is an acrylic
   polymer, we analyzed the hydrogen bonding between carbonyl and hydroxyl
   groups and demonstrated that this bonding and the molecular chain
   entanglement contributes to its self-healing ability. The tensile test,
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectroscopy were employed to analyze the self-healing processes. This
   study provides an insight into the mechanism of self-healing behavior
   and ability of VHB 4910 to recover its strength. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{The current study evaluated 17 loads of cull beef cows transported in
   Canadian winter conditions to assess in-transit temperature and
   humidity, evaluation of events during loading and unloading, and animal
   condition and bruising. Regardless of the use of boards to block
   ventilation holes in trailers, temperatures were higher within trailers
   than at ambient locations during both travel and stationary periods (P <
   0.01). Boarding was associated with smaller differences in trailer
   temperature, compared with ambient conditions, while the trailer was
   traveling at highway speeds versus when trailers were stationary (P <
   0.01). Moisture levels within trailers were not different from ambient
   conditions when loads using boarding were traveling (P < 0.01), whereas
   loads without boarding had a larger difference (P < 0.01). The moisture
   within trailers relative to ambient conditions increased when trailers
   were stationary compared with traveling when boarding was used (P <
   0.01). The majority of cattle transported were in good body condition
   (97.4\% within BCS of 2 to 3.5) and had calm temperaments (96.7\%).
   Although all comparisons were made, only the dog-house compartment had
   an increased risk of severe bruising compared with all other
   compartments (odds ratio {[}95\% confidence interval]: 3.0 {[}1.6-5.5],
   3.7 {[}2.16.4], 2.2 {[}1.3-3.7] and 3.8 {[}1.5-9.6] in comparison with
   the back, belly, deck, and nose compartments, respectively; P < 0.05).
   Increasing the duration of waiting to unload 30 min relative to a 1 h
   duration increased the odds of severe bruising by 1.18 times (95\%
   confidence interval: 1.09-1.29; P < 0.01). Scoring systems that have
   been developed for auditing unloading of cattle had limited variation
   across loads at both loading and unloading. Pretransport assessment of
   animal condition using the American Meat Institute's compromised animal
   score was the only scoring system that was consistent with posttransport
   scores. We inferred from the temperature and humidity data in the
   current study that under commercial conditions, boarding may increase
   ventilation within trailers during travel and decrease ventilation
   during stationary periods. The current study provides the first
   indication that issues in Canadian cull cow transport may be related to
   pretransport animal condition and management of unloading.}},

Journal = {{RADIO SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{698-711}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Autocorrelation function (ACF) estimates from voltage data measured by
   high-frequency ionospheric radar systems that utilize the multiple-pulse
   technique of Farley (1972) are susceptible to interference from
   self-clutter. Self-clutter is caused by simultaneous returns from
   multiple transmitted pulses echoing from unwanted, or ambiguous ranges.
   Without accurate estimates of self-clutter it is impossible to account
   for all the uncertainty in estimates of the radar ACF. Voltage- and
   power-based self-clutter estimators are presented and evaluated using a
   modified version of the radar data simulator of Ribeiro et al. (2013a)
   and data from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN). It is
   shown that self-clutter caused by ambiguous ranges filled with ground
   scatter can be accurately estimated using a voltage-based self-clutter
   estimator but that for ionospheric origin self-clutter a maximal
   estimator must be used. Two maximal self-clutter estimators are
   discussed and verified using the radar data simulator. A discussion of
   the application of the self-clutter estimator as it is applied to ACFs
   obtained with Saskatoon SuperDARN radar is also presented.}},

   capable of achieving a tensile resistance similar to that of contact lap
   splices of the same length. Knockout webs within the splice region, used

Abstract = {{Results on X-ray near edge structure (XANES) study on Sn-doped BiFeO3
   (BFO) nanofibers with varying Sn concentrations of 1\%, 3\%, and 5\% are
   reported. The results indicate that the oxidation state of Sn ions in
   the BFO structure is +4. In addition, we observe a bismuth peak (Bi M-1)
   at 4000 eV in the XANES spectrum, suggesting the diffusion of Bi ions
   onto the surface of BFO nanostructure. The diffusion is attributed to
   the charge compensation between donor electrons from the Sn atoms and Bi
   vacancies. These findings are of high relevance to surface chemistry
   reactions in sensing and catalytic applications. Copyright (C) EPLA,

Abstract = {{Cluster analysis of biological networks is one of the most important
   approaches for identifying functional modules and predicting protein
   functions. Furthermore, visualization of clustering results is crucial
   to uncover the structure of biological networks. In this paper,
   ClusterViz, an APP of Cytoscape 3 for cluster analysis and
   visualization, has been developed. In order to reduce complexity and
   enable extendibility for ClusterViz, we designed the architecture of
   ClusterViz based on the framework of Open Services Gateway Initiative.
   According to the architecture, the implementation of ClusterViz is
   partitioned into three modules including interface of ClusterViz,
   clustering algorithms and visualization and export. ClusterViz
   fascinates the comparison of the results of different algorithms to do
   further related analysis. Three commonly used clustering algorithms,
   FAG-EC, EAGLE and MCODE, are included in the current version. Due to
   adopting the abstract interface of algorithms in module of the
   clustering algorithms, more clustering algorithms can be included for
   the future use. To illustrate usability of ClusterViz, we provided three
   examples with detailed steps from the important scientific articles,
   which show that our tool has helped several research teams do their
   research work on the mechanism of the biological networks.}},

Title = {{Charge transport in pure and stabilized amorphous selenium:
   re-examination of the density of states distribution in the mobility gap
   and the role of defects}},

Abstract = {{We re-examine electron and hole transport in pure and stabilized
   amorphous selenium (a-Se) and attempt to construct a DOS distribution in
   the mobility gap below E-c and above E-v based on time-of-flight (TOF)
   transient photoconductivity measurements. First, we review the current
   status of a-Se, its recent use in commercial X-ray detectors, and the
   scientific information that is available in terms of its density of
   states (DOS). We review and describe a convenient multiple trapping
   transport mechanism to calculate the TOF transient photocurrents in a
   system with a distributed DOS in the mobility gap and invoke a number of
   assumptions that allow the photocurrent to be calculated as an inverse
   Laplace transform. The assumptions behind the model are critically
   examined. Then, by comparing the calculated TOF photocurrent shapes
   directly with experimental waveforms, the DOS distribution has been
   extracted in a-Se in the vicinity of conduction and valence bands (below
   E-c and above E-v). Below the conduction band, the DOS distribution
   seems to demonstrate three peaks at around E-c-0.30 eV, E-c-0.45 eV and
   below E-c-0.55 eV. First principles atomistic modeling provided insight
   into the origins of these peaks and the peaks have been assigned to
   certain valence-alteration pairs (VAPs) appearing in different
   configurations. In contrast to the conduction band vicinity, the DOS
   distribution above the valence band seems to be almost totally
   featureless. Within the range of experimental uncertainties, a
   featureless DOS below E-v down to 0.55 eV seems to be able to explain a
   vast range of data, that is, it can explain hole transport not only as a
   function of the electric field and temperature down to 123 K, but also
   the thickness dependence of the mobility over two orders of magnitude.
   At room temperature, the hole transport is nondispersive but at
   temperatures below similar to 200 K, it becomes dispersive exactly along
   the lines argued by Pfister and Scher (Adv Phys 27: 747, 1978), and the
   mobility evinces a clear thickness dependence. The first principles
   calculations yield two defect levels related to VAP type defects in this
   region of the mobility gap but the valence band tail is so broad that it
   masks these peaks. This seeming asymmetry between the conduction and
   valence bands may be related to their physical origins: the conduction
   band arises from anti-bonding states and valence band is due to
   interacting lone pairs.}},

Title = {{A phase-space beam position monitor for synchrotron radiation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYNCHROTRON RADIATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{946-955}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The stability of the photon beam position on synchrotron beamlines is
   critical for most if not all synchrotron radiation experiments. The
   position of the beam at the experiment or optical element location is
   set by the position and angle of the electron beam source as it
   traverses the magnetic field of the bend-magnet or insertion device.
   Thus an ideal photon beam monitor would be able to simultaneously
   measure the photon beam's position and angle, and thus infer the
   electron beam's position in phase space. X-ray diffraction is commonly
   used to prepare monochromatic beams on X-ray beamlines usually in the
   form of a double-crystal monochromator. Diffraction couples the photon
   wavelength or energy to the incident angle on the lattice planes within
   the crystal. The beam from such a monochromator will contain a spread of
   energies due to the vertical divergence of the photon beam from the
   source. This range of energies can easily cover the absorption edge of a
   filter element such as iodine at 33.17 ke V. A vertical profile
   measurement of the photon beam footprint with and without the filter can
   be used to determine the vertical centroid position and angle of the
   photon beam. In the measurements described here an imaging detector is
   used to measure these vertical profiles with an iodine filter that
   horizontally covers part of the monochromatic beam. The goal was to
   investigate the use of a combined monochromator, filter and detector as
   a phase-space beam position monitor. The system was tested for
   sensitivity to position and angle under a number of synchrotron
   operating conditions, such as normal operations and special operating
   modes where the photon beam is intentionally altered in position and
   angle at the source point. The results are comparable with other methods
   of beam position measurement and indicate that such a system is feasible
   in situations where part of the synchrotron beam can be used for the
   phase-space measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Synchrotron-based in-line phase-contrast computed tomography (PC-CT)
   allows soft tissue to be imaged with sub-gross resolution and has
   potential to be used as a diagnostic tool. The reconstruction and
   processing of in-line PC-CT datasets is a computationally demanding
   task; thus, an efficient and user-friendly software program is
   desirable. Four freeware programs (NRecon, PITRE, H-PITRE and Athabasca
   Recon) were compared for the availability of features such as dark- and
   flat-field calibration, beam power normalization, ring artifact removal,
   and alignment tools for optimizing image quality. An in-line PC-CT
   projection dataset (3751 projections, 180 degrees rotation, 10.13 mm x
   0.54 mm) was collected from a formalin-fixed canine prostate at the
   Biomedical Imaging and Therapy Bending Magnet (BMIT-BM) beamline of the
   Canadian Light Source. This dataset was processed with each of the four
   software programs and usability of the program was evaluated. Efficiency
   was assessed by how each program maximized computer processing power
   during computation. Athabasca Recon had the least-efficient memory
   usage, least user-friendly interface, and lacked a ring artifact removal
   feature. NRecon, PITRE and H-PITRE produced similar quality images, but
   the Athabasca Recon reconstruction suffered from the lack of a native
   ring remover algorithm. The 64-bit version of NRecon uses GPU (graphics
   processor unit) memory for accelerated processing and is userfriendly,
   but does not provide necessary parameters for in-line PC-CT data, such
   as dark- field and flat-field correction and beam power normalization.
   PITRE has many helpful features and tools, but lacks a comprehensive
   user manual and help section. H-PITRE is a condensed version of PITRE
   and maximizes computer memory for efficiency. To conclude, NRecon has
   fewer imaging processing tools than PITRE and H-PITRE, but is ideal for
   less experienced users due to a simple user interface. Based on the
   quality of reconstructed images, efficient use of computer memory and
   parameter availability, H-PITRE was the preferred of the four programs
   compared.}},

Abstract = {{In this study acrylated epoxidized flaxseed oil was synthesized and then
   characterized by spectroscopic techniques. Triglycerides are the main
   constituents of flaxseed oil and the carbon-carbon double bond is the
   reaction site for epoxidation. Flaxseed oil was epoxidized by adding
   formic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Acrylic acid was then added to
   produce acrylated epoxidized flaxseed oil (AEFO). The change in the
   structure of the fatty acids chain after the epoxidation and acrylation
   reactions was measured and characterized by Hydrogen nuclear magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR) and Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR). The FTIR spectra of epoxidized flaxseed oil and
   flaxseed oil shows the disappearance of the = C-H (3012 cm(-1)) and C =
   C (1654 cm(-1)) peaks. The FTIR spectra confirmed the formation of AEFO
   since the presence of hydroxyl group (-OH) was shown by the peak at 3
   455 cm(-1) and the acrylate group (-CH = CH2), which was indicated by
   the peaks at 1406, 984 and 812 cm(-1). The changes in peaks of the H-1
   NMR spectra also confirmed the formation of AEFO. The number of acrylate
   groups/molecule of triglyceride was found to be 2.6 from H-1 NMR
   spectra.}},

Abstract = {{We perform an analysis of similar to 80 000 photometric measurements for
   the following 10 stars hosting transiting planets: WASP-2, -4, -5, -52,
   Kelt-1, CoRoT-2, XO-2, TrES-1, HD 189733, GJ 436. Our analysis includes
   mainly transit light curves from the Exoplanet Transit Database, public
   photometry from the literature, and some proprietary photometry
   privately supplied by other authors. Half of these light curves were
   obtained by amateurs. From this photometry we derive 306 transit timing
   measurements, as well as improved planetary transit parameters.
   Additionally, for 6 of these 10 stars we present a set of radial
   velocity measurements obtained from the spectra stored in the HARPS,
   HARPS-N and SOPHIE archives using the HARPS-TERRA pipeline. Our analysis
   of these transit timing and radial velocity data did not reveal
   significant hints of additional orbiting bodies in almost all of the
   cases. In the WASP-4 case, we found hints of marginally significant TTV
   signals having amplitude 10-20 s, although their parameters are model
   dependent and uncertain, while radial velocities did not reveal
   statistically significant Doppler signals.}},

Abstract = {{The sinterability of Al-Mg-Si powder metallurgy PM alloy was
   investigated. This alloy is equivalent to AA6061 and known commercially

   range of 100-500 MPa were sintered at temperatures in the range of
   610-640 degrees C. The investigated alloy shows a good sintering
   response and 98\% theoretical density (TD) was achieved. An optimal
   sintering profile has been selected and the mechanical properties were
   measured in T1, T6 tempers. Hardness, tensile strength and yield
   strength values obtained were close to the industrially published
   values. In addition to the sintering and heat treatment, the
   microstructure of sintered material has been examined and characterized
   using optical and scanning electron microscopy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The human-machine interface design is not a new problem; however,
   existing knowledge appears to be focused either on interface conceptual
   design, which determines what information at what time needs to be
   displayed, or on interface detailed design, which determines the form of
   display elements. This article presents a study on interface layout
   design. Three interface layout designs were proposed based on the
   proximity compatibility priniciple, which were on the same interface
   conceptual design. In particular, the first interface layout design is
   with the highest degree of proximity cognition and the second and third
   with a reduced degree of proximity cognition. They are called
   sophisticated, semisophisticated, and nonsophisticated interfaces,
   respectively. An experiment with a simple process plant was conducted to
   understand user behaviors on the three interfaces. It is noted that in
   order to provide an unbiased comparative evaluation of these interfaces
   the same application problem and similar look-and-feel forms of
   interfaces were designed. In the experiment, three general classes of
   tasks were considered, namely, normal control operation, fault detection
   (or monitoring), and fault diagnosis. Two categories of measures were
   used: the performance measure and the subjective measure. The major
   results obtained from the experiment are 1) the nonsophisticated
   interface is the best for fault detections in terms of performance
   measure; besides, this interface has the lowest mental workload for
   fault detection; 2) the sophisticated interface is the best for normal
   operation in terms of performance measure; 3) there appears no
   significant difference for fault diagnosis in terms of performance
   measures for all these three interfaces; 4) for normal operation and
   fault diagnosis, the mental workloads for the three interfaces have no
   significant difference. Overall, the experiment suggests that the
   nonsophisticated interface be used in practice with additional two
   reasons: 1) most of time in the chemical process plant today is the
   fault detection or operation monitoring task, and 2) it is relatively
   easier for the nonsophisticated interface to adapt to changes in the
   chemical process plant design, which are common in today's manufacturing
   environments. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The Pd supported activated carbon (Pd/AC) sorbents were pretreated by 5
   vol.\% O-2 or H-2, and the Hg-0 removal efficiency of the corresponding
   sorbents was compared in different atmospheres. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy were
   employed to analyze the sorbents at different stages. These results
   indicated that the Hg-0 removal efficiency of the untreated 1Pd/AC
   sorbent was higher than that of the pretreated sorbents. The efficiency
   of Hg removal from coal derived fuel gas is much higher in
   N-2-H2S-Hg-H-2 atmospheres than that in N-2-H2S-Hg atmospheres and it
   can be maintained at about 91.4\% for 360 min. There exist three types
   of Pd-0 forms over Pd/AC sorbent, i.e. Pd-0, Pd2+ and Pd2H, and among
   which Pd is the active species for Hg removal over Pd/AC sorbent H-2 can
   promote the Hg removal due to the in situ reducing of palladium oxide in
   the process of sorbent evaluation. H-2 and O-2 in the pretreated
   atmosphere suppressed the Hg-0 removal due to the formation of inactive
   palladium hydride and easily sulfidized palladium oxide, respectively,
   and then the decrease of Pd-0 content. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In the present paper, we report a systematic examination of sonication
   energy and the subsequent dispersion condition of nanoparticles in a
   vinyl ester resin. The nanoparticles were multi-walled carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNTs) functionalized with carboxylic acid groups. Two nanoparticle
   concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 wt\% with a variety of sonication
   amplitudes and duration were considered. Elastic moduli were determined
   using a 3-point flexural method and a nanoindentation technique. Glass
   transition temperatures (T (g)) were also evaluated by differential
   scanning calorimetry. The dispersion quality of MWCNTs was investigated
   by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM). Results
   indicated that with both concentrations, there is a gradual increase in
   elastic modulus and T (g) up to a certain sonication energy level beyond
   which both properties decreased. However, this threshold energy level
   varied with MWCNT concentration. For example, the threshold energy level
   was 60 kJ in case of 0.25 wt\% while it was only 15 kJ with 0.5 wt\%
   concentration. It was also observed that regardless of the level of
   threshold energy, enhancement in properties remained more or less the
   same. This suggests that there is interplay between particle
   concentration and sonication energy that dictates the dispersion
   condition and hence controls the nanocomposite properties. It is further
   evidenced by SEM studies that nanotubes undergo significant structural
   changes such as length reduction even at lower energies that eventually
   limits the threshold level.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work the influence of intermediate annealing and the

   texture of a 1 wt\% Si non-oriented electrical steel was investigated.
   Different processing conditions were tasted to develop favorable texture
   and better understand the relation between texture and important
   magnetic properties. The texture parameter (TP) was defined as ``theta
   fiber/gamma fiber{''} ratio. The results showed that the samples with
   the highest TP have the lowest magnetic anisotropy. Also average
   magnetocrystalline energy was calculated and it was demonstrated that
   the lowest energy can be Correlated with the highest ``theta fiber/gamma
   fiber{''} ratio. Regardless of the condition of intermediate annealing
   process, the uni-directional rolling produced very similar texture
   parameter (similar to 2). However, the cross rolled samples have very
   different texture parameters upon intermediate annealing. The cross
   rolled samples after intermediate annealing at 650 degrees C have the
   highest texture parameter (similar to 3). The proposed thermo-mechanical
   processing allow diminishing gamma fiber which is deleterious for
   magnetic properties of non-oriented electrical steels. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The increase of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data of different
   species makes it possible to identify common subnetworks (conserved
   protein complexes) across species via local alignment of their PPI
   networks, which benefits us to study biological evolution. Local
   alignment algorithms compare PPI network of different species at both
   protein sequence and network structure levels. For computational and
   biological reasons, it is hard to find common subnetworks with strict
   similar topology from two input PPI networks. Consequently some methods
   introduce less strict criteria for topological similarity. However those
   methods fail to consider the differences of the two input networks and
   adopt equally lenient criteria on them. In this work, a new
   dividing-and-matching-based method, namely UEDAMAlign is proposed to
   detect conserved protein complexes. This method firstly uses known
   protein complexes or computational methods to divide one of the two
   input PPI networks into subnetworks and then maps the proteins in these
   subnetworks to the other PPI network to get their homologous proteins.
   After that, UEDAMAlign conducts unequally lenient criteria on the two
   input networks to find common connected components from the proteins in
   the subnetworks and their homologous proteins in the other network. We
   carry out network alignments between S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster,
   H. sapiens and D. melanogaster, respectively. Comparisons are made
   between other six existing methods and UEDAMAlign. The experimental
   results show that UEDAMAlign outperforms other existing methods in
   recovering conserved protein complexes that both match well with known
   protein complexes and have similar functions.}},

Abstract = {{Stable isotopes have been used to study large-scale changes in hydrology
   during the Pleistocene epoch. Many of these efforts have required an
   estimate of the O-18 value of runoff generated by melting ice sheets.
   There is no consensus on representative values. Here we examine O-18
   values from fossil groundwater samples and isotope-enabled general
   circulation models (GCMs) to better understand the isotopic composition
   of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS). Groundwater O-18 values ranged from
   -12.5 to -25.3 and tended to increase southward. The O-18 precipitation
   values predicted by GCMs follow a similar trend but increase more
   steeply southward. The difference in groundwater and GCM output can be
   explained by invoking movement of glacial ice and meltwater, along with
   mixing within groundwater systems. Most groundwater O-18 values are
   higher than an average LIS O-18 value of -25.42.5 calculated based on
   estimated ice sheet volumes and sea level data.}},

Title = {{Rechecking the Centrality-Lethality Rule in the Scope of Protein
   Subcellular Localization Interaction Networks}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{Essential proteins are indispensable for living organisms to maintain
   life activities and play important roles in the studies of pathology,
   synthetic biology, and drug design. Therefore, besides experiment
   methods, many computational methods are proposed to identify essential
   proteins. Based on the centrality-lethality rule, various centrality
   methods are employed to predict essential proteins in a Protein-protein
   Interaction Network (PIN). However, neglecting the temporal and spatial
   features of protein-protein interactions, the centrality scores
   calculated by centrality methods are not effective enough for measuring
   the essentiality of proteins in a PIN. Moreover, many methods, which
   overfit with the features of essential proteins for one species, may
   perform poor for other species. In this paper, we demonstrate that the
   centrality-lethality rule also exists in Protein Subcellular
   Localization Interaction Networks (PSLINs). To do this, a method based
   on Localization Specificity for Essential protein Detection (LSED), was
   proposed, which can be combined with any centrality method for
   calculating the improved centrality scores by taking into consideration
   PSLINs in which proteins play their roles. In this study, LSED was
   combined with eight centrality methods separately to calculate
   Localization-specific Centrality Scores (LCSs) for proteins based on the
   PSLINs of four species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Mus
   musculus and Drosophila melanogaster). Compared to the proteins with
   high centrality scores measured from the global PINs, more proteins with
   high LCSs measured from PSLINs are essential. It indicates that proteins
   with high LCSs measured from PSLINs are more likely to be essential and
   the performance of centrality methods can be improved by LSED.
   Furthermore, LSED provides a wide applicable prediction model to
   identify essential proteins for different species.}},

Abstract = {{The catalytic oxidative and non-oxidative steam reforming of crude
   bio-ethanol for hydrogen production was studied in a tubular fixed bed
   reaction system over 30 wt.\%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 and 1 wt.\%Rh30
   wt.\%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalysts. The catalysts were prepared by
   impregnation-co-precipitation method and characterized by BET, XRD, TPR,
   TGA, XPS, XANES and EXAFS techniques. Characterization results revealed
   that the addition of Rh promotes reducibility of NiO at lower
   temperature for the bimetallic catalysts. Extended X-ray absorption fine
   structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)
   analysis depicted that NiO with 6-fold local co-ordination is present in
   all the samples. Ethanol conversion, hydrogen yield and product
   selectivity were investigated at 600 C and space time of 9.17 kgcat
   h/kgmol{[}EtOH]) at atmospheric pressure. In steam reforming of crude
   bio-ethanol, 81\% ethanol conversion was achieved with 59\% hydrogen
   selectivity on Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst, whereas, higher ethanol conversion
   (86\%) with 73\% hydrogen selectivity was achieved using Rh-Ni/CeO2-ZrO2
   catalysts. In oxidative steam reforming of crude bio-ethanol, hydrogen
   yield and selectivity reduced due to the partial oxidation of oxygenate
   compounds present in the feed. The used catalysts were also analysed by
   BET, TGA/DTA, TPR, TPO, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, and TEM techniques to
   identify the cause of catalyst deactivation. The results indicate that
   the catalyst deactivation occurred mainly due to amorphous and
   filamentous carbon deposition on the catalysts surface, due to the
   presence of the impurities in the feed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The search for stable polymeric nitrogen and polynitrogen compounds has
   attracted great attention due to their potential applications as
   high-energy-density materials. Here we report a theoretical prediction
   of an interesting LiN5 crystal through first-principles calculations and
   unbiased structure searching techniques. Theoretical calculations reveal
   that crystalline LiN5 is thermodynamically stable at pressures above 9.9
   GPa, and remains metastable at ambient conditions. The metastability of
   LiN5 stems from the inherent stability of the N-5(-) anions and strong
   anion-cation interactions. It is therefore possible to synthesize LiN5
   by compressing solid LiN3 and N-2 gas under high pressure and quench
   recover the product to ambient conditions. To the best of our knowledge,
   this is the first time that stable N-5(-) anions are predicted in
   crystalline states. The weight ratio of nitrogen in LiN5 is nearly 91\%,
   placing LiN5 as a promising high-energy material. The decomposition of
   LiN5 is expected to be highly exothermic, releasing an energy of
   approximately 2.72 kJ.g(-1). The present results open a new avenue to
   synthesize polynitrogen compounds and provide a key perspective toward
   the understanding of novel chemical bonding in nitrogen-rich compounds.}},

Abstract = {{In-situ electron backscatter diffraction of low stacking fault energy
   316L austenitic stainless steel was carried out in tension to study the
   evolution of microstructure and micro-texture as a function of strain
   till fracture. The microstructure was characterized by extensive
   twinning throughout the deformation process. At low and intermediate
   strain, scattered areas of twinned regions are observed in the
   microstructure with < 101 > grains with higher Schmid factor showing
   extensive twinning. However, not all the grains with < 101 > orientation
   show twinning despite the higher Schmid factor during initial stages of
   deformation. However, the entire microstructure appeared uniformly
   twinned irrespective of the orientation of the parent grains near the
   fractured region. Twinning was also accompanied with evolution of
   intragranular misorientation and concomitant roughness evolution in the
   deformed state. It was observed that the grains with < 100 > orientation
   show higher roughness evolution and contribute to failure. Crystal
   plasticity simulations indicate that saturation in twinning leads to
   lower work hardening rate, ultimately leading to failure. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Biosorbents have demonstrated great potential in the treatment of
   metal-containing wastewater. However, one of the bottleneck issues of
   using biosorbents is that amounts of organic carbon release from
   biosorbents into water. This seriously limits the application of
   biosorption technology in treating wastewater. In this work, a novel
   methodology was developed to greatly reduce the organic carbon release
   and enhance the stability of biosorbents by using barley straw as the
   model biosorbent material and nickel as the model metal ion. The raw
   barley straw was first made into cylindrical pellets, which were coated
   with a sodium alginate (SA) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) membrane. The
   coating conditions including the ratio of SA to PVA, glutaraldehyde (GA)
   dose, concentration of CaCl2 solution, and cross-linking time were
   optimized by L-9(3(4)) orthogonal array design. The pellets coated at
   the optimal conditions (1:1 mass ratio of SA to PVA, 1.0 mL of GA, 8\%
   CaCl2, and 20 min of cross-linking time) were then applied for nickel
   adsorption. The effects of the solution pH and ionic strength on the
   adsorption equilibrium and desorption of adsorbed nickel ions were
   investigated. Scanning electron microscopy and synchrotron X-ray
   fluorescence spectroscopy were used to locate the adsorption sites on
   the coated pellets. The results demonstrated that organic carbon release
   of the coated pellets was significantly reduced to 3.8-9.7 mg/g of dry
   barley straw pellets in the nickel adsorption process, while that of the
   raw barley straw particles was 44 mg/g. The nickel uptake increased to
   25.6 mg/g, higher than that of the raw barley straw particles.}},

Abstract = {{Multilayer covers are widely accepted reclamation designs in the oil
   sands region of northern Alberta, Canada, with an ultimate goal of
   revegetating to species characteristic of predisturbance native plant
   communities. To determine the optimal depth of reclamation material
   required to reclaim overburden shale from an oil sands mine, an
   evaluation was made of the long-term performance of six reclamation soil
   cover depths all placed over overburden. The measured soil water
   contents from different cover thicknesses at South Bison Hills located
   at the Syncrude Mine site north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, were used to
   calibrate and validate a dual-porosity model in HYDRUS-1D. The
   calibrated and validated model was then used to evaluate the influence
   of cover thickness and climatic variability on plant available water for
   forest growth. The frequency distributions of actual transpiration (T-r)
   for six cover treatments with a range of leaf area index (LAI) cases
   were developed. These T-r frequency distributions were then modified by
   coupling T-r and LAI. The modified frequency distributions for annual
   T-r for the six simulated cover thickness highlight the strong
   nonlinearity between the distributions of T-r over a long-term (60years)
   climate cycle in that incremental increases in cover thickness do not
   produce proportional increases in T-r. The results indicated that, once
   the cover thickness exceeds 100cm, there is little incremental increase
   in the median value of T-r over the 60-year climate cycle. Copyright (c)

Title = {{Optimization of nanoparticles for cardiovascular tissue engineering}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Nano-particulate delivery systems have increasingly been playing
   important roles in cardiovascular tissue engineering. Properties of
   nanoparticles (e.g. size, polydispersity, loading capacity, zeta
   potential, morphology) are essential to system functions. Notably, these
   characteristics are regulated by fabrication variables, but in a
   complicated manner. This raises a great need to optimize fabrication
   process variables to ensure the desired nanoparticle characteristics.
   This paper presents a comprehensive experimental study on this matter,
   along with a novel method, the so-called Geno-Neural approach, to
   analyze, predict and optimize fabrication variables for desired
   nanoparticle characteristics. Specifically, ovalbumin was used as a
   protein model of growth factors used in cardiovascular tissue
   regeneration, and six fabrication variables were examined with regard to
   their influence on the characteristics of nanoparticles made from high
   molecular weight poly(lactide-co-glycolide). The six-factor five-level
   central composite rotatable design was applied to the conduction of
   experiments, and based on the experimental results, a geno-neural model
   was developed to determine the optimum fabrication conditions. For
   desired particle sizes of 150, 200, 250 and 300 nm, respectively, the
   optimum conditions to achieve the low polydispersity index, higher
   negative zeta potential and higher loading capacity were identified
   based on the developed geno-neural model and then evaluated
   experimentally. The experimental results revealed that the polymer and
   the external aqueous phase concentrations and their interactions with
   other fabrication variables were the most significant variables to
   affect the size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, loading capacity
   and initial burst release of the nanoparticles, while the electron
   microscopy images of the nanoparticles showed their spherical geometries
   with no sign of large pores or cracks on their surfaces. The release
   study revealed that the onset of the third phase of release can be
   affected by the polymer concentration. Circular dichroism spectroscopy
   indicated that ovalbumin structural integrity is preserved during the
   encapsulation process. Findings from this study would greatly contribute
   to the design of high molecular weight poly(lactide-co-glycolide)
   nanoparticles for prolonged release patterns in cardiovascular
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical and microstructural responses of AA 2017-T451 and AA
   2624-T351 aluminum alloys to dynamic impact loading were investigated
   using the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) and electron backscattered
   diffraction (EBSD) analysis. Although both alloys were subjected to the
   same impact loads, the strain rate developed in the AA 2017 alloy was
   higher and the peak stress in the dynamic stresss-train curve is
   observed to be higher for the AA 2624 alloy. The higher deformation
   resistance observed in the AA 2624 alloy under dynamic impact loading is
   a consequence of its higher capacity for strain hardening that
   effectively overcomes the effects of thermal softening and dynamic
   recovery during impact loading. Strain hardening is quickly dominated by
   thermal softening in AA 2017-T451 alloy leading to a lower resistance to
   deformation and a higher tendency to form transformed adiabatic shear
   bands consisting of dynamic recrystallized (DRX) grains as observed in
   the EBSD measurements. Although shear bands were also observed in the AA
   2624 alloy, EBSD analyses suggest that the shear band region consist of
   deformed grains with high intensity of localized strains and dislocation
   accumulation. Whereas both alloys exhibited nearly the same high angle
   grain boundary fractions before dynamic impact loading, a higher
   in-grain (kernel) misorientation were observed in the AA 2624 alloy
   after impact. Larger fraction of high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) was
   observed in the impacted AA 2017 alloy. The results of the EBSD
   measurements on both the as-received alloys and the impacted specimens
   such as grain boundary fractions, area fractions of selected fibers as
   well as Schmid factor and the corresponding Schmid factor distribution
   are discussed. The study provides a consolidated understanding of the
   microstructure developments during deformation and its relation to the
   mechanical response of the alloys to dynamic impact loading. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Hardware implementation of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) function
   consists of multiple consecutive arithmetic operations over complex
   numbers. Applying floating-point arithmetic to FFT coprocessors leads to
   a wider dynamic range and allows the coprocessor to collaborate with
   general purpose processors via the standard floating-point arithmetic.
   This offloads compute-intensive tasks from the primary processor and
   overcomes floating-point concerns such as scaling and overflow/underflow
   detection. The downside, however, is that floating-point units are
   slower than the fixed-point counterparts. One of the popular ways to
   improve the speed of floating-point FFT units is to merge the arithmetic
   operations inside the butterfly units of a FFT architecture. This leads
   to a butterfly architecture based on multioperand adders. Butterfly
   units are designed, in two of the most recent works, using three-operand
   and four-operand adders. However, the work reported here by the present
   authors goes further and a butterfly architecture based on a
   five-operand adder is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the
   proposed butterfly architecture is 50\% smaller than the fastest
   previous work with about 17\% latency overhead. Compared with the
   smallest previous work, the proposed design is 47\% smaller and 8\%
   faster.}},

Abstract = {{Lignocellulosic feedstocks are potential resources for renewable fuels.
   However, the cross-linked and hydrophobic lignin makes the biomass
   recalcitrant to acids and enzymatic conversion. This study investigates
   the effect of hydrothermal pretreatment and delignification on
   lignocellulosic biomass from forestry (pinewood), agriculture (wheat
   straw) and energy crop systems (timothy grass). In order to understand
   their physico-chemical properties, the pretreated and delignified
   feedstocks were characterized through carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur
   analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning
   electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Hydrothermal pretreatment caused
   remarkable loss of hemicelluloses (up to 68.4\%) and intense lignin
   re-localisation. Delignification of feedstocks led to significant
   removal of lignin by 95.9\% and exposed the interwoven cellulose fibers.
   As a result of the removal of hemicelluloses and lignin, cellulose
   concentration increased by 28.4\% in hydrothermally treated feedstocks
   and 61.4\% in delignified feedstocks, respectively. The amplification in
   cellulose content in delignified feedstocks suggested enhanced
   accessibility of cellulolytic enzymes for improved bioconversion.}},

Abstract = {{With tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), spectra can be generated by
   various fragmentation techniques including collision-induced
   dissociation (CID), higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD),

   spectra from the same peptide generated by different fragmentation
   techniques is becoming popular in proteomics studies. The focus of this
   study is the use of paired spectra from CID (or HCD) and ECD (or ETD)
   fragmentation because of the complementarity between them. We present a
   de novo peptide sequencing framework for multiple tandem mass spectra,
   and apply it to paired spectra sequencing problem. The performance of
   the framework on paired spectra is compared to another successful method
   named pNono+. The results show that our proposed method outperforms
   pNono+ in terms of full length peptide sequencing accuracy on three

Abstract = {{In this study, we tested the antimicrobial activity of three metal
   nanoparticles (NPs), ZnO, MgO, and CaO NPs, against Salmonella enterica
   serovar Enteritidis in liquid medium and on solid surfaces. Out of the
   three tested metal NPs, ZnO NPs exhibited the most significant
   antimicrobial effect both in liquid medium and when embedded on solid
   surfaces. Therefore, we focused on revealing the mechanisms of
   surface-associated ZnO biocidal activity. Using the global proteome
   approach, we report that a great majority (79\%) of the altered proteins
   in biofilms formed by Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis were
   downregulated, whereas a much smaller fraction (21\%) of proteins were
   upregulated. Intriguingly, all downregulated proteins were enzymes
   involved in a wide range of the central metabolic pathways, including
   translation; amino acid biosynthetic pathways; nucleobase, nucleoside,
   and nucleotide biosynthetic processes; ATP synthesis-coupled proton
   transport; the pentose phosphate shunt; and carboxylic acid metabolic
   processes, indicating that ZnO NPs exert a panmetabolic toxic effect on
   this prokaryotic organism. In addition to their panmetabolic toxicity,
   ZnO NPs induced profound changes in cell envelope morphology, imposing
   additional necrotic effects and triggering the envelope stress response
   of Salmonella serovar Enteritidis. The envelope stress response effect
   activated periplasmic chaperones and proteases, transenvelope complexes,
   and regulators, thereby facilitating protection of this prokaryotic
   organism against ZnO NPs.}},

Abstract = {{Protection and operational quantities as defined by the International
   Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the International
   Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) are the two sets
   of quantities recommended for use in radiological protection for
   external radiation. Since the `80s, the protection quantities have
   evolved from the concept of dose equivalent to effective dose equivalent
   to effective dose, and the associated conversion coefficients have
   undergone changes. In this work, the influence of three different
   versions of ICRP photon dose conversion coefficients in the synchrotron
   radiation shielding calculations of an experimental enclosure has been
   examined. The versions are effective dose equivalent (ICRP Publication
   51), effective dose (ICRP Publication 74), and effective dose (ICRP
   Publication 116) conversion coefficients. The sources of the synchrotron
   radiation white beam into the enclosure were a bending magnet, an
   undulator and a wiggler. The ranges of photons energy from these sources
   were 10-200 keV for the bending magnet and undulator, and 10-500 keV for
   the wiggler. The design criterion aimed a radiation leakage less than
   0.5 mu Sv h(-1) from the enclosure. As expected, larger conversion
   coefficients in ICRP Publication 51 lead to higher calculated dose
   rates. However, the percentage differences among the calculated dose
   rates get smaller once shielding is added, and the choice of conversion
   coefficients set did not affect the final shielding decision.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the work of Dahrouj and Yu in applying the Han-Kobayashi
   transmission strategy for mitigating the intercell interference in a
   multi-cell multi-user multiple-input single-output interference network
   (MISOIN), this paper considers splitting messages into private and
   common parts in a multi-cell multi-user MIMO IN. Specifically, the
   covariances of the private messages and common messages are designed to
   optimize either the sum rate or the minimal rate. The common messages
   and private messages are decoded in sequence using successive decoding.
   This paper shows how these difficult optimization problems can be
   adequately solved by means of d.c. (difference of concave functions)
   optimization over a simple convex set. Numerical and simulation results
   also reveal the great advantage of our proposed solutions for various
   types of INs. In particular, the proposed solutions are shown to

Abstract = {{Background: Least Significant Change (LSC) assists in determining
   whether observed bone change is beyond measurement precision. Monitoring
   Time Interval (MTI) estimates time required to reliably detect skeletal
   changes. MTIs have not been defined for bone outcomes provided by high
   resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). The
   purpose of this study was to determine the LSCs and MTIs for HR-pQCT
   derived bone area, density and micro-architecture with postmenopausal
   women. Methods: Distal radius and tibia of 33 postmenopausal women (mean
   age: 77, SD: +/- 7 years), from the Saskatoon cohort of the Canadian
   Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos), were measured using HR-pQCT at
   baseline and 1-year later. We determined LSC from precision errors and
   divided them by the median annual percent changes to define MTIs for
   bone area, density, and micro-architecture. Results: Distal radius:
   HR-pQCT LSCs indicated a 1-8\% observed change was needed for reliable
   monitoring of bone area and density while a 3-18\% change was needed for
   micro-architectural measures. The longest MTIs (>3 years) pertained to
   cortical and trabecular area and density measures, cortical thickness
   and bone volume fraction; the shortest MTIs (similar to 2 years)
   pertained to bone micro-architectural measures (trabecular number,
   thickness, separation and heterogeneity). Distal tibia: LSCs indicated a
   <1-5\% observed change was needed for reliable monitoring of bone area
   and density, while a 3-19\% change was needed for micro-architectural
   measures. The longest MTIs (>3 years) pertained to trabecular density,
   bone volume fraction, number, separation and heterogeneity; the shortest
   MTIs (similar to 1 year) pertained to cortical and trabecular area,
   cortical density and thickness. Conclusion: MTIs suggest that performing
   HR-pQCT follow-up measures in postmenopausal women every 2 years at the
   distal radius and every 1 year at the distal tibia to monitor true
   skeletal changes as indicated by the LSCs.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of acid-catalyzed hemicellulose removal and also alkaline
   delignification of oat hull biomass were investigated. All three
   operational parameters namely, catalyst concentration (0.10-0.55 N
   H2SO4), temperature (110-130 degrees C), and residence time (up to 150
   min) affected the efficiency of hemicellulose removal, with 100\% of
   hemicellulose removed by appropriate selection of process parameters.
   Analysis of delignification kinetics (in the temperature range of 30-100
   degrees C) indicated that it can be expressed very well by a two-phase
   model for the crude biomass and also for the hemicellulose-prehydrolyzed
   material. The application of acid-catalyzed prehydrolysis improved the
   capacity of lignin dissolution especially at lower temperatures (30 and
   65 degrees C) and accelerated the dissolution of lignin. This
   acceleration of delignification by prehydrolysis was possible at all
   levels of temperature in the bulk phase; however, results were more
   significant at the lower temperatures in the terminal phase. (c) 2015

Title = {{Measuring the Resilience of Supply Chain Systems Using a Survival Model}},
Journal = {{IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{377-381}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Disruptions at any stage of a supply chain system can cause mammoth
   operational and financial losses to a firm. When there is a disruption
   with a supply chain system, it is highly desired that the system quickly
   recover. The ability of recovery is, in short, called resilience. This
   paper proposes a new measure of the resilience of a supply chain system
   based on the concept of survival and, subsequently, a survival model
   {[}Cox proportional hazard (Cox-PH) model]. The survival model
   represents a time interval or period from the time the system failed to
   function to the time the system gets back with its function (i.e.,
   recovery). The input to the model is, thus, a failure event; the output
   from the model is the recovery time. This model has been implemented.
   There is a case study to illustrate how the model is used to give a
   quantitative measurement of resilience, in terms of recovery time.}},

Abstract = {{Years of genetic selection have caused an increase in growth rate and
   market body mass in agricultural poultry species compared to earlier
   genetic strains, potentially altering their physiological requirements.
   The objective of this study was to expose Hybrid Converter tom turkeys
   on a weekly basis to the recommended rearing temperature regime (T-CON:
   control) or 4 degrees C below the recommended standard (T-TRT:
   treatment) to determine their thermal responses. Once per week for 12
   weeks, 12 turkeys were individually exposed to either T-CON or T-TRT for
   a 2-h period. Surface temperatures of the breast (T-BREAST), wing
   (T-WING), drumstick (T-DRUM), head (T-HEAD), and shank (T-SHANK) were
   measured at 20-min intervals using an infrared camera, while a thermal
   data logger measured the skin surface temperature under the wing
   (T-LOGGER) at 30-s intervals. The cloacal temperature (T-CORE) was
   measured using a medical thermometer at the start and end of the
   exposure period. Regardless of exposure temperature, the T-BREAST
   (T-CON: P < 0.001 and T-TRT: P < 0.001), T-WING (T-CON: P < 0.001 and
   T-TRT: P < 0.001), and T-DRUM (T-CON: P < 0.001 and T-TRT: P < 0.001)
   decreased from weeks 4 to 6 and remained constant from weeks 1 to 3 and
   8 to 12. T-HEAD was elevated in week 2 (T-CON: P < 0.001) or week 3
   (T-TRT: P < 0.001), T-SHANK increased slightly during week 3 for both
   T-CON (P < 0.001) and T-TRT (P < 0.001), and T-LOGGER (T-CON: P < 0.001
   and T-TRT: P = 0.001) and T-CORE (T-CON: P < 0.001 and T-TRT: P < 0.001)
   were lower during the first week. Thereafter, T-HEAD, T-SHANK, T-LOGGER,
   and T-CORE remained constant. Exposure to T-TRT resulted in lower
   T-BREAST, T-WING, and T-DRUM compared to T-CON. Generally, T-HEAD,
   T-SHANK, T-LOGGER, and T-CORE were not affected by the different
   exposure temperatures. The data demonstrated that the degree of thermal
   response expressed is dependent on the location of measurement, age, and
   exposure temperature.}},

Abstract = {{By applying a backward mapping technique, we solve the Boltzmann
   equation to investigate the effects of ion-neutral collisions on the ion
   velocity distribution and related transport properties in cylindrically
   symmetric, uniformly charged auroral ionosphere. Such a charge geometry
   introduces a radial electric field which increases linearly with
   distance from the axis of symmetry. In order to obtain complete
   analytical solutions for gaining physical insights into more complicated
   problems, we have substituted a relaxation collision model for the
   Boltzmann collision integral in the Boltzmann equation. Our calculations
   show that collisions drive the velocity distribution to a ``
   horseshoe{''} shape after a few collision times. This feature extends to
   all radial positions as long as the electric field keeps increasing
   linearly versus radius. If the electric field is introduced suddenly,
   there is a transition from the collision-free pulsating Maxwellian
   distributions obtained in previous work (Ma and St.-Maurice, J. Geophys.
   Res., 113: A05312, 2008) to the `` horseshoe{''} shapes on a time scale
   of within the few collision times. We also show how the transport
   properties evolve in a similar fashion, from oscillating to a
   non-oscillating features over the same time interval.}},

Abstract = {{Co-gasification of waste material with coal is a potentially effective
   method to utilize industrial wastes for power/heat and/or syngas
   generation and to solve their disposal problems. Canada with its
   large-scale oil sand industry is a major producer of unconventional oil.
   Petroleum coke is one of the main waste streams from oil sand refining
   processes. This study is an investigation of the effects of feed ratio,
   equivalence ratio and average particle size on the syngas production by
   means of co-gasification of petroleum coke with lignite coal in a
   stainless steel pilot scale fluidized bed gasifier with an inside
   diameter of 7 cm at 800 degrees C. Central composite design methodology
   was used for designing the experiments. Runs for 20 wt.\% of petroleum
   coke in the feed at different equivalence ratios and particle sizes
   showed positive synergetic effects for syngas yield (up to 61.0 mol/kg
   of feed), H-2 + CO yield (up to 332 mol/kg of feed), carbon efficiency
   (up to 70.2\%), and lower heating value (up to 9020 kJ/m(3)). Increasing
   the equivalence ratio improved gasification performance, but gas heating
   value and H-2/CO decreased. The effect of particle size (70-500 mu m)
   was insignificant. The use of petroleum coke (20 wt.\% in the feed) has
   resulted in an improvement in the lignite coal gasification performance
   and can be considered as an effective utilization method for petroleum
   coke. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   previously reported pQCT imaging methods}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{49-54}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) imaging has been used
   to quantify muscle area and density as well as intermuscular adipose
   tissue (IMAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) area in the lower
   and upper limb. Numerous protocols have been reported to derive these
   soft-tissue outcomes, but their precision has not been assessed in
   community-dwelling postmenopausal women. The objective of this study was
   to compare the precision of previously reported analysis protocols for
   quantifying muscle area and density, as well as IMAT and SAT area in
   postmenopausal women.
   Six image analysis protocols using two available software suites
   (Stratec XCT, Bone]) were identified from the pQCT literature. Analysis
   protocols were applied to a sample of 35 older female adults (mean age
   73.7; SD 72 years), randomly selected from a population based-cohort and
   scanned twice within an average of 9.7 (SD 3.6) days. Relative precision
   was calculated as absolute values and as a percentage of the sample mean
   (root mean square coefficient of variation; CV\%(RMS)). Soft-tissue
   outcomes across protocols were compared on their log-transformed
   coefficients of variation using multilevel linear models and Tukey
   contrasts.
   For most protocols, CV\%Rms for muscle area, density, and SAT area
   ranged between 2.1 and 3.7\%, 0.7 and 1.9\%, and 2.4 and 6.4\%,
   respectively. Precision for IMAT area varied considerably, from 3 to
   42\%. Consideration of these study results will aid in the selection of
   appropriate image analysis protocols for pQCT-derived soft-tissue
   outcomes in postmenopausal women. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{a(1) (1420) resonance as a tetraquark state and its isospin partner}},

Abstract = {{We systematically construct tetraquark currents of I(G)J(PC) = 1(-)1(++)
   and classify them into types A ( antisymmetric), S ( symmetric) and M (
   mixed), based on flavor symmetries of diquarks and antidiquarks
   composing the tetraquark currents. We use tetraquark currents of type M
   to perform QCD sum rule analyses, and find a tetraquark current eta(M)(5
   mu) with quark content qs (q) over bar(s) over bar (q = u or d) leading
   to a mass of 1.44 +/- 0.08 GeV consistent with the a(1)(1420) state
   recently observed by the COMPASS Collaboration. Our results support
   tetraquark explanations for both a(1)(1420) and f(1)(1420), assuming
   that they are isospin partners. We also study their possible decay
   patterns. As tetraquark candidates, the possible decay modes of
   a(1)(1420) are S- wave a(1)(1420) -> K{*}(892)K and P-wave a(1)(1420) ->
   f(0)(980)pi, while the possible decay patterns of f(1)(1420) are S-wave
   f(1)(1420) -> K{*}(892)K and P-wave f(1)(1420) -> a(0)(980)pi. We
   speculate that a(1)(1420) is partly responsible for the large isospin
   violation in the eta(1405) -> f(0)(980)pi(0) decay mode, which is
   reported by BESIII Collaboration in the J/psi -> gamma 3 pi process.}},

Abstract = {{First principles structural prediction and molecular dynamics (MD)
   calculations have been performed to examine the structures responsible
   for the recently reported metallic and superconducting phases of highly
   compressed CS2. The low pressure experimental molecular crystal
   structure was found to be metastable and transformed into a disordered
   structure above 10 GPa. At 60 GPa, the predicted low energy structures
   show molecular CS2 is separated into C and S dominant regions. A
   crystalline structure with the P2(1)/m symmetry was found to be most
   stable from 60 to 120 GPa. The structure is formed from alternate layers
   of hexagonal C rings and S 2D-square-nets linked by C-S bonds. A
   non-crystalline structure with similar features structure is also
   predicted by MD calculations. Electron-phonon coupling calculations show
   this crystalline phase is superconductive. Contrary to the suggestions
   made from the experiments, no magnetism was found in all predicted low

   coefficient of the scaling law decreases with volume fraction, whereas
   it increases with increasing the angle and maximizes when the
   magnetization direction is perpendicular to that of the tensile. This
   trend is opposite to that of coercivity. The behavior of the coefficient

Abstract = {{The search for high-temperature superconductors has been focused on
   compounds containing a large fraction of hydrogen, such as SiH4(H-2)(2),
   CaH6 and KH6. Through a systematic investigation of yttrium hydrides at
   different hydrogen contents using an structure prediction method based
   on the particle swarm optimization algorithm, we have predicted two new
   yttrium hydrides (YH4 and YH6), which are stable above 110 GPa. Three
   types of hydrogen species with increased H contents were found,
   monatomic H in YH3, monatomic H+molecular ``H-2{''} in YH4 and hexagonal
   ``H-6{''} unit in YH6. Interestingly, H atoms in YH6 form sodalite-like
   cage sublattice with centered Y atom. Electron-phonon calculations
   revealed the superconductive potential of YH4 and YH6 with estimated
   transition temperatures (T-c) of 84-95 K and 251-264 K at 120 GPa,

Abstract = {{Electron backscattered diffraction technique was used to investigate the
   microstructure of aluminum particles deformed by high-energy ball
   milling. The lengths of different types of boundaries per area were
   calculated for different samples. The results show that the deformation
   mechanism and the rate of grain subdivision changed considerably as
   milling time increased. At the beginning of the milling, deformation
   banding subdivided grains and dynamic recovery formed a cellular
   structure of low angle boundaries. After further milling, particles were
   flattened; an increase in the aspect ratio of the original grains
   together with cold welding of the particles contributed to the formation
   of high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs). Lattice rotation progressively
   increased the misorientation of low and medium angle boundaries and
   transformed them to HAGBs, which resulted in formation of new small
   equiaxed grains by continuous dynamic recrystallization. This research
   shows subgrain rotation was the main mechanism for formation of new
   HAGBs.}},

Abstract = {{Recently alginate-based tissue repair scaffolds fabricated using 3D
   printing techniques have been extensively examined for use in tissue
   engineering applications. However, their physical and mechanical
   properties are unfavorable for many tissue engineering applications
   because these properties are poorly controlled during the fabrication
   process. Some improvement of alginate gel properties can be realized by
   addition of hyaluronic acid (HA), and this may also improve the ability
   of cells to interact with the gel. Here, we report improvement of the
   physical properties of alginate-HA gel scaffolds by the addition of the
   polycation polyethyleneimine (PEI) during the fabrication process in
   order to stabilize alginate molecular structure through the formation of
   a polyelectrolyte complex. We find that PEI has a significant beneficial
   influence on alginate-HA scaffold physical properties, including a
   reduction in the degree of gel swelling, a reduction in scaffold
   degradation rate, and an increase in the Young's modulus of the gel.
   Further study shows that fabrication of alginate-HA gels with PEI
   increases the encapsulation efficiency of bovine serum albumin, a model
   protein, and reduces the subsequent initial protein release rate.
   However, it was also found that survival of Schwann cells or ATDC-5
   chondrogenic cells encapsulated during the scaffold fabrication process
   was modestly reduced with increasing PEI concentration. This study
   illustrates that the use of PEI during scaffold fabrication by plotting
   can provide an effective means to control alginate-based scaffold
   properties for tissue engineering applications, but that the many
   effects of PEI must be balanced for optimal outcomes in different
   situations.}},

Abstract = {{Many qualitative group decisions in professional fields such as law,
   engineering, economics, psychology, and medicine that appear to be crisp
   and certain are in reality shrouded in fuzziness as a result of
   uncertain environments and the nature of human cognition within which
   the group decisions are made. In this paper, we introduce an innovative
   approach to group decision making in uncertain situations by using fuzzy
   theory and a mean-variance neural approach. The key idea of this
   proposed approach is to defuzzify the fuzziness of the evaluation values
   from a group, compute the excluded-mean of individual evaluations and
   weight it by applying a variance influence function (VIF); this process
   of weighting the excluded-mean by VIF provides an improved result in the
   group decision making. In this paper, a case study with the proposed
   fuzzy-neural approach is also presented. The results of this case study
   indicate that this proposed approach can improve the er effectiveness of
   qualitative decision making by providing the decision maker with a new
   cognitive tool to assist in the reasoning process.}},

Title = {{What do we mean by sensitivity analysis? The need for comprehensive

Abstract = {{Sensitivity analysis is an essential paradigm in Earth and Environmental
   Systems modeling. However, the term ``sensitivity'' has a clear
   definition, based in partial derivatives, only when specified locally
   around a particular point (e. g., optimal solution) in the problem
   space. Accordingly, no unique definition exists for ``global
   sensitivity'' across the problem space, when considering one or more
   model responses to different factors such as model parameters or
   forcings. A variety of approaches have been proposed for global
   sensitivity analysis, based on different philosophies and theories, and
   each of these formally characterizes a different ``intuitive''
   understanding of sensitivity. These approaches focus on different
   properties of the model response at a fundamental level and may
   therefore lead to different (even conflicting) conclusions about the
   underlying sensitivities. Here we revisit the theoretical basis for
   sensitivity analysis, summarize and critically evaluate existing
   approaches in the literature, and demonstrate their flaws and
   shortcomings through conceptual examples. We also demonstrate the
   difficulty involved in interpreting ``global'' interaction effects,
   which may undermine the value of existing interpretive approaches. With
   this background, we identify several important properties of response
   surfaces that are associated with the understanding and interpretation
   of sensitivities in the context of Earth and Environmental System
   models. Finally, we highlight the need for a new, comprehensive
   framework for sensitivity analysis that effectively characterizes all of
   the important sensitivity-related properties of model response surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Ion sound instabilities driven by the ion flow in a system of a finite
   length are considered by analytical and numerical methods. The ion sound
   waves are modified by the presence of stationary ion flow resulting in
   negative and positive energy modes. The instability develops due to
   coupling of negative and positive energy modes mediated by reflections
   from the boundary. It is shown that the wave dispersion due to deviation
   from quasineutrality is crucial for the stability. In finite length
   system, the dispersion is characterized by the length of the system
   measured in units of the Debye length. The instability is studied
   analytically and the results are compared with direct, initial value
   numerical simulations. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the design of distributed precoding in the
   multiple access (MA) phase for two-way relaying communication (TWRC)
   systems using OFDM. The error probability analysis is conducted to
   establish the diversity and coding gains for three error types in the MA
   phase. Then, the design criteria of distributed precoding to achieve the
   maximum diversity and coding gains are given. The frequency-grouped
   linear constellation precoding (F-GLCP) is first investigated and shown
   not to be able to achieve the maximum diversity gain under type-3
   errors. A novel frequency-time GLCP (FT-GLCP) that performs precoding in
   both the frequency and time domains is then proposed. It is proved that
   the proposed FT-GLCP is able to achieve the maximum diversity gain under
   type-3 errors while maintaining the maximum diversity and coding gains
   under type-1 and type-2 errors. To corroborate the theoretical analysis,
   simulation results are provided to show the advantage of the proposed
   FT-GLCP over other schemes in both Rayleigh and Rician fading channels.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium alloys are widely used in automotive and aerospace industries,
   where they can be exposed to high strain rate conditions such as car
   crash and ballistic impact. Grain size is an important factor that can
   affect the mechanical behavior of magnesium alloys at high strain rates.
   Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the effects of grain size on
   the dynamic mechanical response of magnesium alloys under shock-loading
   conditions. In this research, texture evolution, microstructural changes
   and dynamic mechanical behavior of rolled Mg-4Y-3RE alloy samples, with
   grain sizes of 8, 25 and 46 mu m, deformed under compressive
   shock-loading are investigated. Dynamic shock loading tests were
   conducted using Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar at room temperature at a
   strain rate of 1200 s(-1). Texture measurements indicate development of
   a double-peak (00.2) basal texture in all the samples during shock
   loading. However, slightly higher intensities were observed for
   coarse-grained samples. Both strength and ductility were found to
   decrease with increasing grain size, while twining fraction and strain
   hardening rate increase with increasing grain size. The activity of
   double and contraction twins increased with increase in grain size.
   Furthermore, activation of pyramidal (c + a) slip system during the
   shock loading of the Mg-4Y-3RE alloy was confirmed using the `g.b'
   analysis method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating how many patients will require care, the nature of the care
   they require, and when and where they will require it, is critical when
   planning resources for a sustainable health-care system. Resource
   planning must consider how quickly patients move among stages of care,
   the various different pathways they may take and the resources required
   at each stage. This research presents a preliminary long-term,
   population-driven system dynamics simulation developed to support
   resource planning and policy development relating to osteoarthritis
   care. The simulation models osteoarthritis patients as they transition
   through the continuum of care from disease onset through end-stage care,
   and provides insight into the size and characteristics of the patient
   population, their resource requirements and associated health-care
   costs. Although the model presented is specific to the osteoarthritis
   care system in the Province of Alberta, Canada, similar methods could be
   applied to develop simulations relating to other chronic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Heat transfer due to groundwater flow can significantly affect closed

   conditions should not be expected where specific discharges exceed

   screening for advection based on rock or soil types. Identification of
   materials with very low hydraulic conductivity, such as shale and intact
   igneous and metamorphic rock, allow for analysis with considering
   conduction only. Variability in known hydraulic conductivity allows for
   the possibility of advection in most other rocks and soil types. Further
   screening relies on refinement of estimates of hydraulic gradients and
   hydraulic conductivity through site investigations and modeling until
   the presence or absence of conduction can be confirmed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of a parametric model for the
   rotational compliance of a cracked right circular flexure hinge. A right
   circular flexure hinge has been widely used in compliant mechanisms.
   Particularly in compliant mechanisms, cracks more likely occur in the
   flexure hinge because it undergoes a periodic deformation. A parametric
   model has many good uses, as opposed to a numerical model, including
   fault diagnosis, facility for the real-time control and optimization of
   design of a compliant mechanism. The rotational compliance of cracked
   right circular flexure hinge is derived in this paper. This is achieved
   by the superposition of the rotational compliance of flexure hinge and
   the compliance change induced by the crack. Without of loss of
   generality of the result, this paper only considers one type of flexure
   hinge, namely right circular flexure hinge. The experiment is performed,
   and the results show that the parametric model is accurate enough for
   the intended application. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The BioMedical Imaging and Therapy beamlines at the Canadian Light
   Source are used by many researchers to capture phase-based imaging data.
   These experiments have so far been limited by the small vertical beam
   size, requiring vertical scanning of biological samples in order to
   image their full vertical extent. Previous work has been carried out to
   develop a bent Laue beam-expanding monochromator for use at these
   beamlines. However, the first attempts exhibited significant distortion
   in the diffraction plane, increasing the beam divergence and eliminating
   the usefulness of the monochromator for phase-related imaging
   techniques. Recent work has been carried out to more carefully match the
   polychromatic and geometric focal lengths in a so-called `magic
   condition' that preserves the divergence of the beam and enables
   full-field phase-based imaging techniques. The new experimental
   parameters, namely asymmetry and Bragg angles, were evaluated by
   analysing knife-edge and in-line phase images to determine the effect on
   beam divergence in both vertical and horizontal directions, using the
   flat Bragg double-crystal monochromator at the beamline as a baseline.
   The results show that by using the magic condition, the difference
   between the two monochromator types is less than 10\% in the diffraction
   plane. Phase fringes visible in test images of a biological sample
   demonstrate that this difference is small enough to enable in-line phase
   imaging, despite operating at a sub-optimal energy for the wafer and
   asymmetry angle that was used.}},

Abstract = {{In the foreseeable future, power grids will be managed largely with
   demand-side management (DSM) programs. With the growing population of
   electric vehicles (EVs) and the emergence of aggregators, DSM will
   surely introduce more intense competition to the markets. Since EV
   charging produces a large amount of time-flexible load in power systems,
   competition of its management could become a major game. This paper
   first formulates the game of EV charging management to describe this
   major form of the future DSM competition and then studies three
   challenges inherent in it: 1) inefficiency of Nash equilibria; 2) the
   game of chicken; and 3) cheating on private information. It is found
   that a central regulator is required to prevent these drawbacks.
   Solutions are proposed and a central governing procedure is also
   presented. The notion of the game of EV charging management is
   compatible with DSM programs that are able to schedule load flexibly
   over multiple time periods.}},

Abstract = {{Friction-stir processing (FSP) has been proven as a successful method
   for the grain refinement of high-strength aluminum alloys. The most
   important attributes of this process are the fine-grain microstructure
   and characteristic texture, which impart suitable properties in the
   as-processed material. In the current work, FSP of the
   precipitation-hardenable aluminum alloy 2219 has been carried out and
   the consequent evolution of microstructure and texture has been studied.
   The as-processed materials were characterized using electron
   back-scattered diffraction, x-ray diffraction, and electron probe
   microanalysis. Onion-ring formation was observed in the nugget zone,
   which has been found to be related to the precipitation response and
   crystallographic texture of the alloy. Texture development in the alloy
   has been attributed to the combined effect of shear deformation and
   dynamic recrystallization. The texture was found heterogeneous even
   within the nugget zone. A microtexture analysis revealed the dominance
   of shear texture components, with C component at the top of nugget zone
   and the B and A(2){*} components in the middle and bottom. The bulk
   texture measurement in the nugget zone revealed a dominant C component.
   The development of a weaker texture along with the presence of some
   large particles in the nugget zone indicates particle-stimulated
   nucleation as the dominant nucleation mechanism during FSP. Grain growth
   follows the Burke and Turnbull mechanism and geometrical coalescence.}},

   mixtures of particles}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{276}},
Pages = {{134-143}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{When handling fine particles in spouted beds, addition of coarse
   particles has shown improved spouting stability than single particle
   systems. However, segregation may still occur because of insufficient
   mixing in binary mixtures, which will adversely influence the process
   performance. Therefore, in this study, analysis of pressure drop and its
   fluctuation signals were for the first time used to understand
   mechanisms of flow regime transitions in spouted beds with binary
   mixtures. The results showed that the typical varying sequence of
   pressure drop can be observed for spouted bed with binary mixtures and
   the peak pressure drop is related to the mixing degree of particles,
   which is mainly influenced by the inter-particle forces between fine
   particles and their counterpart coarse ones. The statistic
   characteristics of pressure drop time series, i.e., average value,
   standard deviation and probability distributions, were found to vary for
   different flow regimes. Therefore, they could be used for the
   characterization of these flow regimes. The spouting stability of binary
   mixtures can be reflected by power spectrum analysis; the influences of
   particles size and density difference on spouting stability were
   discussed through power spectral analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Sensitivity of the performance of a flat-plate liquid-to-air membrane
   energy exchanger (LAMEE) to the air and solution channel widths and flow
   maldistribution}},

Abstract = {{Liquid-to-air membrane energy exchangers (LAMEEs) are novel energy
   exchangers which use semi-permeable membranes to separate air and
   desiccant solution streams. The semi-permeable membrane allows
   simultaneous heat and water vapor transfer between the air and the
   desiccant solution streams. These exchangers, which include bonded
   elastic membranes, are prone to significant variations in the flow
   channel widths, which causes flow maldistribution, and this causes
   performance degradation. This paper uses a numerical model to show the
   sensitivity of the steady-state performance of a flat-plate LAMEE to the
   air and solution channel widths, when operated as a supply air
   dehumidifier and a diluted desiccant solution regenerator. Simulations
   show that, without air flow channel width variations, the effectiveness
   of both the dehumidifier and the regenerator can always be increased
   toward 1.0 by reducing the nominal air and solution channel widths. To
   account for variations in the air channel widths, which occur due to
   construction tolerances and pressure differences across the membrane,
   laminar fully developed flow equations are used to investigate the
   influence of random variations in the air channel widths on the
   performance (i.e. effectiveness and air pressure drop) of the flat-plate
   LAMEE. The main contribution of this paper is that it shows that there
   exists an optimal air channel width for flat-plate LAMEEs with flow
   maldistribution due to random variations in the air channel width.
   Decreasing the air channel width below this optimal value will result in
   a decrease in effectiveness. It is found that the optimum nominal air
   channel width for flat-plate LAMEEs may be 5-6 mm and the optimum
   nominal solution channel width is 1-2 mm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The welding behavior of the Fe-Co-7 wt\% V ultra-thin foils was examined
   using the Nd:YAG laser welding method. Scanning electron microscopy and
   electron backscattered diffraction were used to investigate
   microstructural changes and fracture mechanism of the weld joints.
   Tensile test and microhardness measurement were employed in order to
   study the mechanical behaviors of the welds. Microstructural
   observations indicated that a bimodal grain size distribution is seen in
   the fusion zone. It was found that the fracture surfaces of the welds
   consist of both cleavage sites and dimples. It was also revealed that
   the cleavage sites are mainly located in the coarse grain zone while
   numerous dimples are located in the fine grain zone. Considering the
   phase transformations which occur in the base metal, variation of the
   microhardness in different regions of the welds was discussed. The
   results demonstrated that the fusion zone and heat affected zone of
   welded samples experience a significant decrease in their hardness. (C)

Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{We use first-principles calculations to study structural, vibrational,
   and superconducting properties of H2S at pressures P >= 200 GPa. The
   inclusion of zero-point energy leads to two different possible
   dissociations of H2S, namely 3H(2)S -> 2H(3)S -> S and 5H(2)S -> 3H(3)S
   + HS2, where both H3S and HS2 are metallic. For H3S, we perform
   nonperturbative calculations of anharmonic effects within the
   self-consistent harmonic approximation and show that the harmonic
   approximation strongly overestimates the electronphonon interaction
   (lambda approximate to 2.64 at 200 GPa) and T-c. Anharmonicity hardens
   H-S bond-stretching modes and softens H-S bond-bending modes. As a
   result, the electron-phonon coupling is suppressed by 30\% (lambda
   approximate to 1.84 at 200 GPa). Moreover, while at the harmonic level
   T-c decreases with increasing pressure, the inclusion of anharmonicity
   leads to a T-c that is almost independent of pressure. High-pressure
   hydrogen sulfide is a strongly anharmonic superconductor.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, acrylated epoxidized flaxseed oil (AEFO) resin is
   synthesized from flaxseed oil, and flax fiber reinforced AFT
   biocomposites is produced via a vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding
   technique. Different amounts of flax fiber and styrene are added to the
   resin to improve its mechanical and physical properties. Both flax fiber
   and styrene improve the mechanical properties of these biocomposites,
   but the flexural strength decreases with an increase in styrene content.
   The mass increase during water absorption testing is less than 1.5\%
   (w/w) for all of the AEFO-based biocomposites. The density of the AEFO
   resin is 1.166 g/cm(3), which increases to 1.191 g/cm(3) when reinforced
   with 10\% (w/w) flax fiber. The flax fiber reinforced AEFO-based
   biocomposites have a maximum tensile strength of 31.4 +/- 1.2 MPa and
   Young's modulus of 520 +/- 31 MPa. These biocomposites also have a
   maximum flexural strength of 64.5 +/- 2.3 MPa and a flexural modulus of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Experiments are conducted to investigate turbulence enhancing effects of
   a porous mesh-screen with a sinusoidal shape normal to the flow
   direction inside a rectangular cross section air channel at low Reynolds
   numbers (i.e., Re = 1360-3800). The baseline measurements are obtained
   at the same channel and Reynolds numbers without the screen present. The
   surface of the screen pores are oriented parallel to the mean flow. Data
   are presented for the total and wall-static pressure drop along the
   channel, Nusselt number distributions on the heated wall at several
   constant heat rates, and air temperature distributions at the channel
   exit with and without (baseline cases) the screen. The heat transfer
   measurements are obtained with one wall heated as well as two parallel
   walls heated to simulate different applications for air channels in the
   flat plate heat exchangers. The results indicate that the ratio of
   screen channel to baseline Nusselt number (Nu/Nu(0)) and the ratio of
   screen channel to baseline friction factor (f/f(0)) increase with the
   Reynolds number (Re). The fully developed Nu/Nu(0) is 2.0-2.5 as the
   fully developed f/(f)0 is 4.4 at 3100 < Re <= 3800. However, the screen
   channel heat convection performance index, (Nu/Nu(0))/(f/f(0))(1/3) is
   only greater than 1.0 when Re > 2500 which is the design objective of
   reducing the pumping power and heat transfer area in the channel.
   Nonetheless, the screen insert is only beneficial to augment the
   convective heat transfer in the channel over the range of transition
   Reynolds number tested. The average total pressure drop across the
   channel and average exit air temperature suggest that the screen insert
   promotes good mixing of fluid across the channel for the Reynolds
   numbers tested.}},

Title = {{Ex Vivo Evaluation of Carpal Flexion After Partial Carpal Arthrodesis in

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo determine degrees of flexion after arthrodesis of the
   antebrachiocarpal (ABC) joint, middle carpal (MC), and carpometacarpal
   (CMC) joints combined (MC/CMC), and carpometacarpal (CMC) joint alone.
   Study DesignEx vivo study.
   AnimalsForelimbs (n=9) from 2- to 10-year-old Quarter Horses (5),
   Thoroughbred (2), and American Paint Horse (2).
   MethodsUsing 2 locking compression plates, 3 partial carpal arthrodesis
   techniques were performed. Cables and deadweights were connected to
   limbs and each angle of flexion determined 3 times using a protractor
   and then averaged. Control measurements were obtained before and after
   arthrodesis, the techniques randomized with Latin square design.
   Descriptive data were analyzed with Levene's test, Q-Q plots, ANOVA, and
   Bonferroni test.
   ResultsMeanSD carpal flexion results were: controls 150 degrees +/- 8
   degrees, CMC arthrodesis 149 degrees +/- 9 degrees, MC/CMC arthrodesis
   43 degrees +/- 7.6 degrees, and ABC arthrodesis 25 degrees +/- 6.3
   degrees. There was no significant reduction in flexion after a CMC
   arthrodesis compared with controls (P=.21), but there was after ABC
   (P<.001) and MC/CMC arthrodesis (P<.001), with the ABC arthrodesis
   significantly reduced compared with an MC/CMC arthrodesis (P<.001).
   ConclusionsWhereas CMC arthrodesis does not affect carpal flexion,
   CMC/MC and ABC arthrodesis markedly reduce the degree of carpal flexion.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1068-1085}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper free vibration of a Timoshenko beam with a tip payload,
   which is mounted on a cart (referred to as TBC) is studied. The cart
   (base) can only have lateral displacement and the tip payload has both
   mass and mass moment of inertia. The center of mass of the payload does
   not coincide with the point where the beam connects to the payload.
   Therefore, the tip of the beam is exposed to an extra bending moment due
   to the inertial force of the payload. By employing Hamilton's principle,
   the governing equations of motion and the associated boundary conditions
   for the TBC are first derived and then transferred into dimensionless
   forms. By using these governing equations and their associated boundary
   conditions, the closed-form frequency equation (characteristic equation)
   of the TBC is derived. This closed-form frequency equation is validated
   both analytically and numerically. The closed-form expressions for the
   mode shapes of the TBC and their orthogonality are also presented. By
   using the closed-form characteristic equation, a sensitivity study is
   performed and the changes in the natural frequencies versus changes in
   the physical parameters are investigated. The results presented in this
   paper are valuable for precise dynamic modeling and model-based control
   of flexible mobile manipulators; a flexible mobile manipulator is a
   flexible link manipulator with a moving base.}},

Abstract = {{Mathematical and computational modeling of the dynamic process where
   tissue scaffolds are cultured in perfusion bioreactors is able to
   provide insight into the cell and tissue growth which can facilitate the
   design of tissue scaffolds and selection of optimal operating
   conditions. To date, a resolved-scale simulation of cell growth in the
   culture process, by taking account of the influences of the supply of
   nutrients and fluid shear stress on the cells, is not yet available in
   the literature. This paper presents such a simulation study specifically
   on cartilage tissue regeneration by numerically solving the momentum,
   scalar transport and cell growth equations, simultaneously, based on the
   lattice Boltzmann method. The simulation uses a simplified scaffold that
   consists of two circular strands placed in tandem inside a microchannel,
   with the object of identifying the effect of one strand on the other.
   The results indicate that the presence of the front strand can reduce
   the cell growth rate on the surface of the rear strand, depending on the
   distance between them. As such, the present study allows for
   investigation into the influence of the scaffold geometry on the cell
   growth rate within scaffolds, thus providing a means to improve the
   scaffold design and the culture process.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},

Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{84-98}},

Abstract = {{Crystallization fouling occurs when dissolved salts precipitate from an
   aqueous solution to the walls of process equipment. In the case of
   inversely soluble salts, like CaCO3, this may lead to crystal growth on
   heated surfaces. In this study, crystallization fouling of CaCO3 on a
   flat-plate heat exchanger surface is studied. The mass deposition rates
   are determined from the measurements of the fouling thermal resistance
   and the properties of the porous fouling layer. The uncertainty of the
   fouling layer properties and the mass depositions rate are quantified
   with a detailed uncertainty analysis, which shows that the proposed
   method and experimental analysis provide values that are reasonably
   defined and acceptable. The obtained mass deposition rates are used to
   determine the kinetic parameters of different fouling models using a
   regression analysis. The validation of the models against the
   experimental data shows that the closest correspondence between the
   experimental and modeled results occurs when the crystallization fouling
   is described by the surface integration model including the time scaling
   factor which depends on the flow velocity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Progress in the development of portable MRI hinges on the ability to use
   lightweight magnets that have non-uniform magnetic fields. An image
   encoding method and mathematical procedure for recovering the image from
   the NMR signal from non-uniform magnets with closed isomagnetic contours
   is given. Individual frequencies in an NMR signal from an object in a
   non-uniform magnetic field give rise to integrals of the object along
   contours of constant magnetic field: generalized projections. With
   closed isomagnetic field contours a simple, cyclic, direct
   reconstruction of the image from the generalized projections is possible
   when the magnet and RF transmit coil are held fixed relative to the
   imaged object while the RF receive coil moves. Numerical simulations,
   using the Shepp and Logan mathematical phantom, were completed to show
   that the mathematical method works and to illustrate numerical
   limitations. The method is numerically verified and exact reconstruction
   demonstrated for discrete mathematical image phantoms. Correct knowledge
   of the RF receive field is necessary or severe image distortions will
   result. The cyclic mathematical reconstruction method presented here
   will be useful for portable MRI schemes that use non-uniform magnets
   with closed isomagnetic contours along with mechanically or
   electronically moving the RF receive coils. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The effect of deformation temperature on the strain localization has
   been evaluated by an adapted digital image correlation (DIC) technique
   during tensile deformation. The progress of strain localization was
   traced by the corresponding strain maps. The electron backscatter
   diffraction analysis and tint etching technique were utilized to
   determine the impact of martensitic transformation and deformation
   twinning on the strain localization in both elastic and plastic regimes.
   In elastic regime the narrow strain bands which are aligned
   perpendicular to the tension direction were observed in temperature
   range of 25 to 180 degrees C due to the stress-assisted epsilon
   martensite. The strain bands were disappeared by increasing the
   temperature to 300 degrees C and reappeared at 400 degrees C due to the
   stress-assisted deformation twinning. In plastic regime strain
   localization continued at 25 degrees C and 180 degrees C due to the
   strain-induced alfa-martensite and deformation twinning, respectively.
   The intensity of plastic strain localization was increased by increasing
   the strain due to the enhancement of martensite and twin volume
   fraction. The plastic strain showed more homogeneity at 300 degrees C
   due to the lack of both strain-induced martensite and deformation
   twinning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A pretreatment process employing porous polymer support coupled with
   electron withdrawing pi-acceptors has been developed for the selective
   removal of refractory nitrogen compounds from gas oil via charge
   transfer complex (CTC) mechanism. Copolymer of glycidyl methacrylate and
   ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, poly (GMA-co-EGDMA) was used as the
   porous polymer support for the immobilization of fluorenone based
   pi-acceptors. In order to study the effect of various pi-acceptors,
   2,7-dinitro-9-fluorenone (DNF); 2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone (TriNF) and
   2,4,5,7-tetranitro-9-fluorenone (TENF) were immobilized on poly
   (GMA-co-EGDMA) via hydroxylamine (ON) linker. BET, CHNOS elemental
   analysis, SEM and TG/DTA were employed for determining the chemical and
   physical properties of the synthesized compounds. Characterization by
   FT-IR revealed the immobilization of pi-acceptor on the polymers. Total
   Nitrogen/Sulfur analyzer affirmed the decrease in total nitrogen and
   sulfur content of bitumen derived light gas oil (LGO) after
   pre-treatment with immobilized polymers. This decrease in total nitrogen
   content of gas oil is a direct consequence of the formation of charge
   transfer complexes between pi-acceptors immobilized polymer and
   heterocyclic nitrogen species present in gas oil. Furthermore,
   spectroscopic features of the charge transfer interactions between
   pi-acceptors and basic and non-basic nitrogen species were confirmed by
   UV-vis spectrophotometer. C-13 NMR was used to calculate the decrease in
   aromatic content after treatment. The optimized polymers were successful
   in removing up to 14.4\% of the total nitrogen content in a single
   contact using 25 wt\% of the immobilized polymers with respect to LGO
   while only 1.4\% of the total sulfur moieties were removed at 25 degrees

Title = {{Crosstalk between DGP branes}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{If two DGP branes carry U(1) gauge theories and overlap, particles of
   one brane can interact with the photons from the other brane. This
   coupling modifies in particular the Coulomb potentials between charges
   from the same brane in the overlapping regions. The coupling also
   introduces Coulomb interactions between charges from the different
   branes which can generate exotic bound states. The effective
   modification of the fine structure constant in the overlap region
   generates a trough in signals at the redshift of the overlap region and
   an increase at smaller or larger redshift, depending on the value of the
   crosstalk parameter g(e)g(p). This implies potentially observable
   perturbations in the Lyman alpha forest if our 3-brane overlapped with
   another 3-brane in a region with redshift z less than or similar to 6.
   Crosstalk can also affect structure formation by enhancing or
   suppressing radiative cooling.}},

   be attributed to higher length scales involved in SPT which enables it
   to capture the effect of texture unlike routine micro-hardness

Abstract = {{The electronic structure of Li2RuO3 was investigated using x-ray
   emission and absorption spectroscopy and by theoretical calculations
   employing two approaches: the local density approximation (LDA) and a
   combination of LDA with the cluster extension of dynamical mean-field
   theory (LDA+DMFT). The evolution of the spectral properties with the
   strength of electronic correlations is analyzed. We show that for
   moderate values of on-site Coulomb repulsion U and intra-atomic Hund's
   rule exchange J(H), Li2RuO3 is in an orbital-selective strongly
   correlated state in the sense that a part of the t(2g) manifold (i.e.,
   xz/yz) behaves as local atomic orbitals susceptible to Hubbard
   correlations, while the remaining (xy) orbitals must be described as
   bond-centered molecular orbitals. Both theoretical approaches succeed in
   explaining the x-ray data, and a comparison of the theoretical and
   experimental spectra provides a reasonable estimate of the possible
   correlation strength (U) and Hund's coupling (J(H)) in Li2RuO3.}},

Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{We study the P-wave charmed baryons using the method of QCD sum rule in
   the framework of heavy quark effective theory. We consider
   systematically all possible baryon currents with a derivative for
   internal rho- and lambda-mode excitations. We have found a good working
   window for the currents corresponding to the rho- mode excitations for
   A(c) (2595), A(c) (2625), Xi(c) (2790), and Xi(c) (2815) that complete
   two SU(3) (3) over barF multiplets of J(P) = 1/2(-) and 3/2(-), while
   the currents corresponding to the lambda-mode excitations seem also
   consistent with the data. Our results also suggest that there are two
   Sigma(c) (2800 states of J(P) = 1/2(-) and 3/2(-) whose mass splitting
   is 14 +/- 7 MeV, and two Xi(c) (2980) states whose mass splitting is 12
   +/- 7 MeV. They have two Omega(c) partners of J(P) = 1/2(-) and 3/2(-),
   whose masses are around 3.25 +/- 0.20 GeV with mass splitting 10 +/- 6
   MeV. All of them together complete two SU (3) 6(F) multiplets of J(P) =
   1/2(-) and 3/2(-). They may also have J(P) = 5/2(-) partners. Xi(c)
   (3080) may be one of them, and the other two are Sigma(c) (5/2(-) ) and
   Omega(c) (5/2(-)), whose masses are 85 +/- 23 MeV and 50 +/- 27 MeV

Abstract = {{A series of new superconducting binary silicides and germanides have
   recently been synthesized under high-pressure high-temperature
   conditions. A representative member of this group, BaGe3, was
   theoretically investigated using evolutionary structure searches coupled
   with structural analogies in the pressure range from 1 atm to 250 GPa,
   where three new phases were discovered. At 1 atm, in addition to the
   synthesized P6(3)/mmc phase, we predicted two new phases, I4/mmm and
   Amm2, to be dynamically stable. The Amm2 structure comprises Ge clusters
   and triangular prisms intercalated with Ba and Ge atoms, a unique
   structural motif unknown to this group. The I4/mmm structure has been
   previously synthesized in binary silicides and is calculated to be
   thermodynamically stable in BaGe3 between 15.6 and 35.4 GPa. Above 35.4
   GPa, two new phases of P (6) over bar m2 and R (6) over bar symmetry
   become the global minima and remain so up to the highest pressure
   considered. These two phases have very similar enthalpies, and both
   feature layers of double Kagome nets of Ge intercalated with Ba-Ge
   layers. The predicted phases are suggested to be metallic with itinerant
   electrons and to be potentially superconducting from the considerable
   electron-phonon coupling strength. Density functional perturbation
   calculations combined with the Allen-Dynes-modified McMillan formula
   were used to estimate the superconducting critical temperatures (T-c)
   for these new phases, which, with slight pressure variations, are
   comparable to the experimental T-c measured for the P6(3)/mmc phase.}},

Title = {{EPGA: de novo assembly using the distributions of reads and insert size}},
Journal = {{BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Motivation: In genome assembly, the primary issue is how to determine
   upstream and downstream sequence regions of sequence seeds for
   constructing long contigs or scaffolds. When extending one sequence
   seed, repetitive regions in the genome always cause multiple feasible
   extension candidates which increase the difficulty of genome assembly.
   The universally accepted solution is choosing one based on read overlaps
   and paired-end (mate-pair) reads. However, this solution faces
   difficulties with regard to some complex repetitive regions. In
   addition, sequencing errors may produce false repetitive regions and
   uneven sequencing depth leads some sequence regions to have too few or
   too many reads. All the aforementioned problems prohibit existing
   assemblers from getting satisfactory assembly results.
   Results: In this article, we develop an algorithm, called extract paths
   for genome assembly (EPGA), which extracts paths from De Bruijn graph
   for genome assembly. EPGA uses a new score function to evaluate
   extension candidates based on the distributions of reads and insert
   size. The distribution of reads can solve problems caused by sequencing
   errors and short repetitive regions. Through assessing the variation of
   the distribution of insert size, EPGA can solve problems introduced by
   some complex repetitive regions. For solving uneven sequencing depth,
   EPGA uses relative mapping to evaluate extension candidates. On real
   datasets, we compare the performance of EPGA and other popular
   assemblers. The experimental results demonstrate that EPGA can
   effectively obtain longer and more accurate contigs and scaffolds.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of annealing treatment on macro- and micro-texture of cold
   rolled FeCo-7.15V ferromagnetic ultra thin foils were studied. The
   microstructural studies performed by held emission scanning electron
   microscope (FE-SEM) showed the formation of paramagnetic precipitations
   ((Fe, Co)(3)V) during annealing. During cold rolling of the FeCo-7.15V
   magnet, the texture components of type (113){[}1 (1) over bar0],
   (001){[}1 (1) over bar0], (111){[}1 (1) over bar0], and (111){[}1 (2)
   over bar1], all related to alpha and gamma-fibers were formed. X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and local texture measurements performed by electron
   backscatter diffraction (EBSD) were made on the annealed samples. Both
   methods revealed that the recrystallized samples have texture
   characterized by gamma fiber component, when the recovered samples were
   characterized by alpha fiber component. The grain boundary character
   distribution (GECD) and microstructures of the material were analyzed
   using EESD. The experimental results showed that annealing at 870
   degrees C for 2 h resulted in a high frequency of twin boundaries. The
   maximum CSL density could reach 7.5\% under annealing conditions: at 870
   degrees C for 2 h. Finally, in order to investigate the texture
   influence on the magnetic properties, magnetic properties of the samples
   were measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The results
   showed an improvement in remanence induction (B-r) with the formation of
   hard axis < 100 >. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{We report on the prediction of the zinc-blende structure BP into a novel
   C2/m phase from 113 to 208 GPa which possesses zigzag phosphorus chain
   structure, followed by another P4(2)/mnm structure above 208 GPa above
   using the particle-swarm search method. Strong electron-phonon coupling
   lambda in compressed BP is found, in particular for C2/m phase with the
   zigzag phosphorus chain, which has the highest lambda (0.56-0.61) value
   among them, leading to its high superconducting critical temperature T-c
   (9.4 K-11.5 K), which is comparable with the 4.5 Kto 13 Kvalue of black
   phosphorus phase I (orthorhombic, Cmca). This is the first system in the
   boron phosphides which shows superconductivity from the present
   theoretical calculations. Our results show that pressure-induced zigzag
   phosphorus chain in BP exhibit higher superconducting temperature T-C,
   opening a new route to search and design new superconductor materials
   with zigzag phosphorus chains.}},

Title = {{DEHUMIDIFICATION REQUIREMENT FOR A GREENHOUSE LOCATED IN A COLD REGION}},

Abstract = {{High levels of relative humidity (RH) commonly occur inside greenhouses,
   which leads to condensation on plant leaf surfaces. In addition,
   condensation on interior building surfaces occurs, resulting in water
   dripping on plants, providing an ideal growing condition for fungal
   diseases, and also contributing to the deterioration of equipment and
   building materials. Limited information exists on how to determine
   dehumidification requirements within greenhouses. In this study, an
   air-to-air heat exchanger was used to provide dehumidification for a
   commercial greenhouse under cold weather conditions, and the data were
   used to estimate the dehumidification requirements of the greenhouse.
   The experiment was conducted over a seven-month period during which the
   greenhouse environmental parameters were monitored. The results showed
   that the heat exchanger controlled the RH well during cold and mild
   seasons, although it did not meet the peak capacity requirement. It was
   found to be less effective and insufficient during the nights and early
   mornings of summer. Based on the experimental data, the dehumidification
   requirement for satisfactory control of humidity was estimated to be
   14.8 L h(-1) or 0.018 L h(-1) per square meter of greenhouse floor area;
   this dehumidification capacity could control RH at 75\% during nights
   and early mornings in cold and mild weather conditions, but can result
   in higher RH during the daytime. This dehumidification level could also
   reduce the occurrence of high RH during the summer season early in the
   morning and at night. The percentage of time the RH exceeded 75\% could
   be reduced to 26\% during the warm season, and 12\% during the cold and
   mild seasons. Meeting the peak requirement would require a 58.8\%
   increase of dehumidification capacity, which would be expensive.}},

Abstract = {{Natural proxy records of hydroclimatic behavior, such as tree ring
   chronologies, are a rich source of information of past climate-driven
   nonstationarities in hydrologic variables. In this study, we investigate
   tree ring chronologies that demonstrate significant correlations with
   streamflows, with the objective of identifying the spatiotemporal
   patterns and extents of nonstationarities in climate and hydrology,
   which are essentially representations of past climate changes. First and
   second-order nonstationarities are of particular interest in this study.
   As a prerequisite, we develop a methodology to assess the consistency
   and credibility of a regional network of tree ring chronologies as
   proxies for hydrologic regime. This methodology involves a cluster
   analysis of available tree ring data to understand and evaluate their
   dependence structure, and a regional temporal-consistency plot to assess
   the consistency of different chronologies over time. The major headwater
   tributaries of the Saskatchewan River basin (SaskRB), the main source of
   surface water in the Canadian Prairie Provinces, are used as the case
   study. Results indicate that stationarity might never have existed in
   the hydrology of the region, as the statistical properties of annual
   paleo-hydrologic proxy records across the basin, i.e., the mean and
   autocorrelation structure, have consistently undergone significant
   changes (nonstationarities) at different points in the history of the
   region. The spatial pattern of the changes in the mean statistic has
   been variable with time, indicating a time-varying cross-correlation
   structure across the tributaries of the SaskRB. Conversely, the changes
   in the autocorrelation structure across the basin have been in harmony
   over time. The results demonstrate that the 89 year period of
   observational record in this region is a poor representation of the
   long-term properties of the hydrologic regime, and shorter periods,
   e.g., 30 year periods, are by no means representative. This paper
   highlights the need to broaden the understanding of hydrologic
   characteristics in any basin beyond the limited observational records,
   as an improved understanding is essential for more reliable assessment
   and management of available water resources.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of essential proteins which are crucial to an organism's
   survival is important for disease analysis and drug design, as well as
   the understanding of cellular life. The majority of prediction methods
   infer the possibility of proteins to be essential by using the network
   topology. However, these methods are limited to the completeness of
   available protein-protein interaction (PPI) data and depend on the
   network accuracy. To overcome these limitations, some computational
   methods have been proposed. However, seldom of them solve this problem
   by taking consideration of protein domains. In this work, we first
   analyze the correlation between the essentiality of proteins and their
   domain features based on data of 13 species. We find that the proteins
   containing more protein domain types which rarely occur in other
   proteins tend to be essential. Accordingly, we propose a new prediction
   method, named UDoNC, by combining the domain features of proteins with
   their topological properties in PPI network. In UDoNC, the essentiality
   of proteins is decided by the number and the frequency of their protein
   domain types, as well as the essentiality of their adjacent edges
   measured by edge clustering coefficient. The experimental results on S.
   cerevisiae data show that UDoNC outperforms other existing methods in
   terms of area under the curve (AUC). Additionally, UDoNC can also
   perform well in predicting essential proteins on data of E. coli.}},

Abstract = {{Essential proteins are indispensable for cellular life. It is of great
   significance to identify essential proteins that can help us understand
   the minimal requirements for cellular life and is also very important
   for drug design. However, identification of essential proteins based on
   experimental approaches are typically time-consuming and expensive. With
   the development of high-throughput technology in the post-genomic era,
   more and more protein-protein interaction data can be obtained, which
   make it possible to study essential proteins from the network level.
   There have been a series of computational approaches proposed for
   predicting essential proteins based on network topologies. Most of these
   topology based essential protein discovery methods were to use network
   centralities. In this paper, we investigate the essential proteins'
   topological characters from a completely new perspective. To our
   knowledge it is the first time that topology potential is used to
   identify essential proteins from a protein-protein interaction (PPI)
   network. The basic idea is that each protein in the network can be
   viewed as a material particle which creates a potential field around
   itself and the interaction of all proteins forms a topological field
   over the network. By defining and computing the value of each protein's
   topology potential, we can obtain a more precise ranking which reflects
   the importance of proteins from the PPI network. The experimental
   results show that topology potential-based methods TP and TP-NC
   outperform traditional topology measures: degree centrality (DC),
   betweenness centrality (BC), closeness centrality (CC), subgraph
   centrality (SC), eigenvector centrality (EC), information centrality
   (IC), and network centrality (NC) for predicting essential proteins. In
   addition, these centrality measures are improved on their performance
   for identifying essential proteins in biological network when controlled
   by topology potential.}},

Abstract = {{Biomolecules do not perform their functions alone, but interactively
   with one another to form so called biomolecular networks. It is well
   known that a complex disease stems from the malfunctions of
   corresponding biomolecular networks. Therefore, one of important tasks
   is to identify drug targets from biomolecular networks. In this study,
   the drug target identification is formulated as a problem of finding
   steering nodes in biomolecular networks while the concept of network
   output controllability is applied to the problem of drug target
   identification. By applying control signals to these steering nodes, the
   biomolecular networks are expected to be transited from one state to
   another. A graph-theoretic algorithm has been proposed to find a minimum
   set of steering nodes in biomolecular networks which can be a potential
   set of drug targets. Application results of the method to real
   biomolecular networks show that identified potential drug targets are in
   agreement with existing research results. This indicates that the method
   can generate testable predictions and provide insights into experimental
   design of drug discovery.}},

Abstract = {{The genomes of different human beings are similar. There are only a
   relatively small number of genetic differences between people. The
   genetic differences between people are very worthy of study. Researchers
   have proposed the fixation index measurement to find the single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which can reflect human population
   differences. However, most SNPs have interactions and they work
   together, which leads to the differences among human populations. The
   number of all possible m-locus combinations chosen from SNPs grows
   exponentially. Most methods concern on 2-locus interactions. In this
   paper, we propose a novel method to find a new coordinate system under
   which the energy distributions of different populations are quite
   different. We select out candidate SNPs from SNPs by using the
   information of the axes in the coordinate system. The number of
   candidate SNPs is small, thus SNP-SNP interactions can be searched
   efficiently. The method can also find interactions of more than two
   loci. These interactions should be able to reflect the evolution of
   human populations from another way. The numbers of SNP-SNP interactions
   are regarded as the differences between pairwise populations and a
   hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to construct the evolutionary
   tree. In the experiments, we apply the method to SNP data of four
   chromosomes separately and the trees constructed on these four
   chromosomes are highly consistent. Furthermore, the trees are also
   consistent with previous studies, which indicates that evolutionary
   information is well mined. The method provides a new insight to analyze
   the human population differences.}},

   volume distribution, H-2-TPR, NH3-TPD, FTIR, SEM-EDX, TEM, and XRD
   techniques were used for the characterization of the pre-reduced
   catalyst. Incorporation of 2\% Zn on to 5\% Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalyst
   significantly improved the activity of the catalyst for methane
   conversion. Thermodynamic studies revealed that temperature below 600
   degrees C, methane aromatization is not possible, however, in the
   presence of methanol over bifunctional catalyst it becomes thermodynamic
   feasible (Delta G = -8.8, -15.5, and -22.2 kJ/mol at 400, 500, and 600
   degrees C). The main products of the reaction were ethylene, ethane,
   propane, butane butylenes and aromatics such as benzene, toluene, ethyl
   benzene and xylene. Selectivity of alkylated aromatic product enhance in
   the presence of methanol. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Phase transitions in amorphous alloys under pressure are an important
   fundamental problem. Here we report on a first-principles study that
   reproduces the recently discovered pressure-induced crystallization of
   amorphous Ce100-xAlx (x<25) alloys and reveals an atomistic
   transformation mechanism. Contrary to common belief, pressure-induced
   devitrification of an amorphous Ce-Al alloy is not due to the Ce 4f
   delocalization that is expected to bring the size of Ce atoms closer to
   that of Al atoms. Our theoretical results show that the Bader volume of
   Ce is always larger than that of Al. A continuous increase in the
   relative Ce/Al Bader volume leads to favourable conditions for forming a
   close-packed structure at high pressure. The results also show that the
   Hume-Rothery rules are not applicable to describe the structures of
   substitutional alloys at high pressure. This study provides a new
   perspective on the electron distribution in lanthanide alloys under the
   application of pressure.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, Central Composite Design (CCD) methodology was first
   introduced to noncatalytic SCWG of lignin for experimental design, model
   building, and data analysis. Noncatalytic SCWG of lignin was performed
   in a batch reactor with the specific focus on hydrogen yield
   optimization. By both experimental and statistical modeling, the main
   effects as well as interaction effects of three parameters including
   temperature, pressure, and water to biomass ratio were investigated in a
   wide range of 399-651 degrees C, 2329 MPa, 3-8, respectively. As the
   result, up to 651 degrees C higher temperature is desirable for hydrogen
   production; however, change of pressure from 23-29 MPa did not show
   significant effect on hydrogen yield. Strong interaction between
   temperature and water to biomass ratio was observed at temperatures
   higher than 525 degrees C, and a dramatic decrease in hydrogen yield
   with increase in water to biomass ratio was observed at 600 degrees C.
   According to the model, the maximum hydrogen yield can reach 1.60 mmol/g
   biomass when the reaction conditions are temperature = 651 degrees C,
   pressure = 25 MPa, and water to biomass ratio = 3.9.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this work, four poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol
   methacrylate) {[}PGMA-co-EDGMA] functionalized particles were
   synthesized and characterized, and tested in gas oil adsorption.
   Particles consisted of identical polymer support (PGMA-co-EDGMA,
   henceforth referred to as PGMA) and pi-acceptor moiety
   (2,4,5,7-tetranitroflorenone, TENF), while the linkers (linear diamines)
   were varied from a two- (diaminoethane, DAE (2)), a three-
   (diaminopropane, DAP(3)) to a four-carbon (diaminobutane, DAB(4))
   containing compounds. The particles notation takes the form:
   PGMA-DAE(2)-TENF, PGMA-DAP(3)-TENF, PGMA-DAB(4)-TENF and
   PGMA-DAB(4)5-TENF, where 5 denotes the synthesis in 5\% (vol./vol.)
   linker and 95\% (vol./vol.) toluene solution, while for other three,
   100\% (vol./vol.) linker was used. Particles were characterized by,
   among others, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), elemental carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen
   and sulfur analysis (CHNS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The
   change in linker length did not result in a significant effect on
   loading as similar amounts of TENF were immobilized on the polymeric
   particles regardless of the linker length. From the adsorption studies
   of light gas oil (LGO), results showed that diaminopropane
   (PGMA-DAP(3)-TENF) substituted particles gave the highest \% adsorption
   of nitrogen compounds, followed by the diaminobutane
   (PGMA-DAB(4)-TENF)-based particles, while no significant differences
   between the particles with diaminoethane (PGMA-DAE(2)-TENF) and
   PGMA-DAB(4)5-TENF were observed. The results further showed that all the
   four types of particles selectively adsorbed nitrogen compounds, while
   the sulfur concentration in LGO remained unchanged under the following
   adsorption process conditions: ambient temperature (24 degrees C), time
   (24 h), particles to oil loading ratio (1:4 wt./wt.) and stirring speed
   (400 rpm). Generally, steric hindrance around the TENF molecules, on the
   surface of the particles, had a major role to play in the adsorption
   process than the length of the linker.}},

Journal = {{GROUNDWATER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{187-194}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Injection of wastes into the deep subsurface has become a contentious
   issue, particularly in emerging regions of oil and gas production.
   Experience in other regions suggests that injection is an effective
   waste management practice and that widespread environmental damage is
   unlikely. Over the past several decades, 23 km(3) of water has been
   injected into the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). The oil and
   gas industry has injected most of this water but large amounts of
   injection are associated with mining activities. The amount of water
   injected into this basin during the past century is 2 to 3 orders
   magnitude greater than natural recharge to deep formations in the WCSB.
   Despite this large-scale disturbance to the hydrogeological system,
   there have been few documented cases of environmental problems related
   to injection wells. Deep injection of waste appears to be a low risk
   activity based on this experience but monitoring efforts are
   insufficient to make definitive statements. Serious uncharacterized
   legacy issues could be present. Initiating more comprehensive monitoring
   and research programs on the effects of injection in the WCSB could
   provide insight into the risks associated with injection in less
   developed sedimentary basins.}},

Abstract = {{The I-4(9/2)-I-4(13/2) emission band of Er3+ is potentially interesting
   for CH4 detection because it can overlap with the optical absorption
   band of CH4. GaLaS and GeGaS glasses doped with Er3+ ions show the
   desirable emission under 808 nm excitation. An attempt of spectrally
   shifting I-4(9/2)-I-4(13/2) emission band by substituting S by O or Se
   to obtain a perfect match to the absorption band of CH4 leads to the
   weakening and disappearance of the I-4(9/2)-I-4(13/2) band. This
   phenomenon is tentatively related to the acceleration of non-radiative
   relaxation in the case of oxygen addition and to the suppression of
   up-conversion in the selenium substitution case. The relative intensity
   of the I-4(9/2)-I-4(13/2) band (with respect to the I-4(13/2)-I-4(15/2)
   band) varies significantly in powdered and bulk materials. This effect
   is discussed in terms of the radiation diffusion (i.e. radiation
   trapping) model and is confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulations. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Silicon-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are fabricated using p-type
   silicon implanted with C+ ions and postannealed at 1000 degrees C in
   flowing nitrogen. The ion implantation is carried out at ambient
   temperature (AT) and 400 degrees C to investigate the influence of
   high-temperature implantation on the luminescence of LEDs. Transmission
   electron microscopy shows a near-surface layer of amorphous silicon
   (a-Si) with nanoscale carbon-rich inclusions in both ambient and heated
   targets while an additional polycrystalline Si layer is observed in the
   heated target only. A Schottky diode is constructed from C+-implanted Si
   (C:Si) with a semitransparent gold layer on the implanted surface and
   aluminum on the back of the target. Contact firing at 400 degrees C in
   flowing nitrogen is used to optimize diode performance. Turn-ON voltage
   is determined to be about 3 V for all devices. Electroluminescence (EL)
   spectra show visible orange-red emission indicating luminescence
   primarily due to a-Si and Si nanoparticles in the LEDs fabricated from
   C: Si implanted at AT. The high-temperature samples produced EL
   attributed to a-Si and porous silicon carbide.}},

Abstract = {{The present study is to understand the impact of process conditions on
   the quality attributes of wheat oat, barley, and canola straw
   briquettes. Analysis of variance indicated that briquette moisture
   content and initial density immediately after compaction and final
   density after 2 weeks of storage are strong functions of feedstock
   moisture content and compression pressure, whereas durability rating is
   influenced by die temperature and feedstock moisture content. Briquettes
   produced at a low feedstock moisture content of 9 \% (w.b.) yielded
   maximum densities > 700 kg/m(3) for wheat, oat, canola, and barley
   straws. Lower feedstock moisture content of < 10 \% (w.b.) and higher
   die temperatures > 110 A degrees C and compression pressure > 10 MPa
   minimized the briquette moisture content and maximized densities and
   durability rating based on surface plots observations. Optimal process
   conditions indicated that a low feedstock moisture content of about 9 \%
   (w.b.), high die temperature of 120-130 A degrees C, medium-to-large
   hammer mill screen sizes of about 24 to 31.75 mm, and low to high
   compression pressures of 7.5 to 12.5 MPa minimized briquette moisture
   content to < 8 \% (w.b.) and maximized density to > 700 kg/m(3).
   Durability rating > 90 \% is achievable at higher die temperatures of >
   123 A degrees C, lower to medium feedstock moisture contents of 9 to 12
   \% (w.b.), low to high compression pressures of 7.5 to 12.5 MPa, and
   large hammer mill screen size of 31.75 mm, except for canola where a

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was the utilization of waste canola meal to
   produce activated carbons for environmental applications. Activated
   carbons were produced from de-oiled canola meal (DOCM) by slow-pyrolysis
   followed by physical (steam and CO2) and chemical (NH3 and KOH)
   activations. Physicochemical characteristics of the precursor and
   activated carbons were investigated using BET, FTIR, SEM, TGA, Boehm,
   CHNSO, and particle size analysis. The effect of activation methods on
   porous structure and surface chemistry of activated carbons was
   investigated. Activated carbons produced from canola meal were evaluated
   for their efficiency as adsorbents for ammonium ion adsorption from
   aqueous solutions. The effect of pH, surface area, and surface
   functional groups of activated carbons was examined on adsorption of
   ammonium ion at 260.0 mg/L. The role of both porous structure and
   surface functionality of activated carbons was studied as a function of
   adsorption of ammonium ion. The results showed that the maximum
   adsorption (q(e)) of ammonium ion was 55.4 mg/g for steam activated
   carbon, 17.9 mg/g for CO2 activated carbon, 56.7 mg/g for
   ammonia-treated activated carbon, and 148 mg/g for KOH activated carbon.

Abstract = {{Sulfur transformations during pyrolysis of four high sulfur coals with
   different ranks are studied by measuring the release of S-containing
   gaseous products using online gas chromatography with a flame
   photometric detector and analyzing the sulfur forms in raw coals and
   chars using sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Results show
   that the sulfur forms in different coals are different and they behave
   differently during pyrolysis. More active disulfide and sulfide in lower
   rank coal can be decomposed and released as gas products below 500
   degrees C; while a more complex thiophenic structure in the higher rank
   coal is difficult to decompose even at 1000 degrees C. Decomposition of
   pyrite in coal plays an important role in sulfur transformation during
   pyrolysis of coals rich in pyritic-sulfur. Pyrite begins to convert to
   FeS above 300 degrees C; while FeS will also react with nascent char or
   volatiles above 600 degrees C. The inter-conversions among sulfur
   species in solid play a dominant role in the transformation of sulfur
   forms above 600 degrees C. The minerals in coal are valuable in
   understanding conversions of sulfate and sulfide. The sulfur retention
   in solid form is correlated well with the releasing trend of H2S and COS
   during the coal pyrolysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Synthesis and application of functionalized polymers for the removal of
   nitrogen and sulfur species from gas oil}},
Journal = {{FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{473-482}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Functionalized polymers, which consist of polymer support, linker, and
   pi-acceptor, have shown promising results in removing nitrogen and
   sulfur compounds from heavy gas oil via charge transfer complex (CTC)
   mechanism. In this work, the effect of polymer support in the efficiency
   and selectivity of the functionalized polymers toward nitrogen removal
   was studied by synthesizing three different polymers, consisting of
   hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer supports, with the same linker and
   pi-acceptor. Hydrazine (-H2N-NH2) and 2,4,5,7-Tetranitro-9-fluorenone
   (TENF) were chosen as the common linker and pi-acceptor, respectively.
   The polymer supports were: polyacrylamide (PAM),
   polystyrene-co-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB), and polyglycidyl
   methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PGMA-co-EGDMA). In the
   first stage, the functionalized polymers, PGMA-NN-TENF, PS-NN-TENF, and
   PAM-NN-TENF, were synthesized and characterized using different methods
   and techniques including Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
   (FT-IR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Scanning Electron Microscopy
   (SEM), Thermogravimetric Analysis/Differential Thermal Analysis
   (TGA/DTA), CHNS elemental analysis, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
   spectroscopy. A Nitrogen/Sulfur analyzer was used to determine total
   nitrogen and sulfur adsorption by the synthesized polymers in 4
   different feeds: model compound (MC), light gas oil (LGO), heavy gas oil
   (HGO), and a blend of heavy and light gas oil (BGO). Results have shown
   that PGMA was the best polymer support with LGO, HGO, and BGO feeds,
   while PS-DVB showed the highest nitrogen removal with MC feed. The
   higher efficiency and selectivity of PGMA-NN-TENF toward nitrogen
   species, in the presence of sulfur and other aromatic species in the
   feed, were due to the combination of hydrophilic nature and high surface
   area of PGMA-NN-TENF compared to other polymers. Modifying the
   pretreatment conditions of the polymers with BGO feed showed that
   increasing temperature, contact time, and polymer to oil ratio increased
   the efficiency of the PGMA-NN-TENF polymer. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{A methodology for scaling a small-scale energy exchanger performance
   results to a full-scale energy exchanger}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{555-567}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In energy exchangers, heat and moisture simultaneously transfer between
   two fluids (i.e. liquid and air) which are directly in contact or
   separated by a semi-permeable membrane. The membrane is permeable for
   water vapor but impermeable for liquids. Testing a full-scale energy
   exchanger is often expensive and time consuming, so a small-scale model
   of the energy exchanger, which is smaller and often simpler than the
   full-scale energy exchanger, can be used to predict the performance of
   the full-scale energy exchanger at different conditions. This paper
   presents a scaling methodology to investigate a similarity between
   small-scale and full-scale energy exchangers. The scaling methodology
   consists of 5 main steps: (1) develop and build a small-scale energy
   exchanger and a test facility to test the small-scale energy exchanger;
   (2) test the small-scale energy exchanger under various test conditions;
   (3) model the couple heat and mass transfer in the energy exchanger, and
   validate the model with the experimental data; (4) test a full-scale
   energy exchanger with similar design as the small-scale energy exchanger
   under various test conditions; and (5) investigate the similarity
   between the small-scale and full-scale energy exchangers. The similarity
   between a small-scale single-panel liquid-to-air membrane energy
   exchanger (LAMEE) and a full-scale LAMEE is investigated in this paper
   using the scaling methodology. A LAMEE is a novel flat-plate
   membrane-based energy exchanger where the heat and moisture transfer
   between air and solution streams through a semi-permeable membrane. The

Abstract = {{The Swarm satellites observe strongly anisotropic ion temperatures at
   500 km altitude. The ion temperature anisotropy ratios going up to 5 for
   the strongest electric fields presented in this paper. The largest
   observed anisotropy ratios exceed the values predicted by theories of
   collisional heating in strong flows by a factor of 2, indicating that
   collisional cross sections should perhaps be revised for O+ ion
   colliding with O. Temperature anisotropy is also found not to be a
   simple function of electric field strength. This could be understood in
   terms a time delay needed to advect hot anisotropic ion velocity
   distributions from strongly collisional regions below 400 km to weakly
   collisional regions at 500 km and above. The mirror force associated
   with these events is insufficient to account for the observed upward
   flows (> 500 m/s). For gyroresonant heating to be consistent with our
   observations, an additional mechanism for field-aligned acceleration is
   required.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution in situ measurements from the three Swarm spacecraft, in
   a string-of-pearls configuration, provide new insights about the
   combined role of flow channel events and particle impact ionization in
   creating F region electron density structures in the northern
   Scandinavian dayside cusp. We present a case of polar cap patch
   formation where a reconnection-driven low-density relative westward flow
   channel is eroding the dayside solar-ionized plasma but where particle
   impact ionization in the cusp dominates the initial plasma structuring.
   In the cusp, density features are observed which are twice as dense as
   the solar-ionized background. These features then follow the polar cap
   convection and become less structured and lower in amplitude. These are
   the first in situ observations tracking polar cap patch evolution from
   creation by plasma transport and enhancement by cusp precipitation,
   through entrainment in the polar cap flow and relaxation into smooth
   patches as they approach the nightside auroral oval.}},

Abstract = {{A supramolecular structure was initially formed between amylose and

   thermogravimetric analyses, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
   In comparison to its counterpart HNT-TiO2 composite, the
   amylose-HNT-TiO2 composite exhibited better dispersion, a larger
   specific surface area, and photocatalytic activity that was more
   effective for the photodegradation/removal of methylene blue (MB) and
   the persistent organic pollutant 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) under UV
   irradiation. After four successive UV irradiation treatments,
   amylose-HNT-TiO2 removed about 90\% of 4-NP or MB. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, we applied a thermo-mechanical process to alter the grain
   boundary characteristic distribution (GBCD) with a view to the
   feasibility of grain boundary engineering in Incoloy 800H/HT. In order
   to optimize the GBCD through increasing the low Sigma coincidence-site
   lattice (CSL) boundaries, we applied various thickness reductions with
   two different rolling modes followed by annealing. We used Electron
   Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) to analyze the GBCD and CSL boundaries.
   We found that the coincidence-site lattice boundaries, particularly
   Sigma 3 and its variants, increased with the pre-deformation level in
   cross-rolled (CR) samples. In contrast, the fraction of these CSL
   boundaries had an optimum in 50\% reduction for unidirectionally rolled
   (UDR) samples. In fact, different Sigma 3(n) interactions led to
   different GBCD in UDR and CR processed samples. Low to medium
   deformation with UDR and medium to high deformation with CR on the
   Incoloy 800H/HT samples showed potential for grain boundary engineering.

Abstract = {{The evolution of microstructure and texture across the fusion boundary
   of a dual-layer super duplex stainless steel clad metal produced on a
   high strength low alloy steel substrate by gas tungsten arc welding
   process was examined by optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron
   backscatter diffraction, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. It
   was found that a martensitic band with occasional Type I and Type II
   boundaries separated the substrate's heat affected zone from the high
   austenite containing region of the clad metal. Due to the competitive
   growth, both the ferrite and austenite grains showed almost the same <
   001 > parallel to ND orientation near the fusion boundary. While the
   texture of the austenite was not as strong as that of the ferrite across
   the cladding layers, the results confirmed that the austenite daughter
   phase was formed with a close Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship
   with respect to the parent ferrite phase. It was also found that
   although both the residual stress and reheating caused some
   microstructural transformation and texture modification to some parts of
   the cladding, the major factors affecting the texture were
   unidirectional solidification, competitive growth, and alpha/gamma
   orientation relationship. The only exception was related to the
   occasional highly deformed mostly austenite area adjacent to the fusion
   boundary, where partial recrystallization led to formation of some
   annealing twins. The findings suggested that the reheating which
   occurred during the deposition of the second layer generated higher
   ferrite content and produced some secondary austenite with dominant
   Widmanstatten morphology across the first cladding layer. Moreover, it
   imposed higher residual strain and also promoted limited
   recrystallization adjacent to the fusion boundary. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A chemical splitting cycle of H2S to produce H-2 for sustainable oil
   sands bitumen upgrading was recently developed in our research group
   which includes three reactions (Wang, H. Hydrogen production from a
   chemical cycle of H2S splitting. International Journal of Hydrogen
   Energy 2007; 32:3907-14):
   H2S + H2SO4 -> S + SO2 + 2H(2)O (H2S Oxidation) (1)
   2H(2)O + I-2+SO2 -> H2SO4 + 2HI (Bunsen Reaction) (2)
   2HI -> H-2 + I-2 (HI decomposition) (3)
   With iodine provided by iodine-toluene solution, the Bunsen reaction can
   be conducted at room temperature. Compared with the General Atomics
   stoichiometry and operation condition for the sulfur iodine cycle, this
   modification can minimize or avoid problems such as side reactions,
   corrosion and iodine deposition. In addition, it reduces the unnecessary
   transportation of the excessive cycling agents in the cycle. This work
   studies the apparent reaction rate of the Bunsen reaction in a gas
   liquid liquid multiphase system resulted from the presence of toluene in
   a closed, fixed-volume batch reactor using the initial rate analysis
   method. The reaction rate was found to be the first order with respect
   to SO2 and 12, respectively. The temperature effect on the reaction rate
   showed activation energy of 6.02 kJ/mol, which suggests that the
   rate-controlling step of the Bunsen reaction in the gas liquid liquid
   system is the step of SO2 absorption into the liquid phases. The
   variation of operating conditions including toluene/water volume ratio,
   agitation speed, and temperature confirmed the mass transfer
   rate-limiting step. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications,

Abstract = {{Catalytic steam reforming of bio-ethanol in presence of oxygen for
   hydrogen production was studied over Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 and Rh Ni/CeO2-ZrO2
   catalysts. The catalysts were prepared by an
   impregnation-co-precipitation method and characterized by various
   characterization techniques. Characterization results revealed that
   addition of ZrO2 improves the oxygen storage capacity of CeO2 which
   improves catalytic activity. The effects of temperature,
   ethanol/water/oxygen molar ratio, and space time on ethanol conversion
   and product selectivities were investigated using a tubular fixed bed
   reactor at atmospheric pressure. Complete ethanol conversion was
   achieved at 600 degrees C with a maximum hydrogen yield of 4.6 moVmol on
   the 1\%Rh-30\%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst. Ethanol conversion and H-2
   selectivity were increased with increasing contact time, while CO and
   CH4 selectivity decreased. Investigation revealed Rh promoted catalyst
   exhibited better catalytic activity than 30\%Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst for
   oxidative steam reforming of ethanol, indicating that addition of Rh
   improved the catalytic activity significantly by promoting water gas
   shift reaction. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{Valence band energy shifts for pure zirconium and a model zirconium
   alloy (Zircaloy-4) in oxidized and hydrided states have been
   investigated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray
   Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES) technique. With XANES, we show
   that O/H interactions in oxidized Zr can be detected in the near-edge
   region of O K. Using density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we
   have determined where H atoms bond in the monoclinic ZrO2 lattice. The
   preferred stoichiometry is ZrO2:H, but the O-H bond is weak; increasing
   H causes the H atoms to form H-2 molecules rather than O-H bonds. These
   interactions cause energy shifts in the Zr 3d XPS spectra. The results
   illustrate the complex processes of hydrogen and oxygen interactions at
   the Zr surface. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We systematically construct I (J(P)) = 0(3(+)) six-quark local
   interpolating currents without derivative operators. We discuss the best
   choice of operator and select three Delta-Delta-like operators to
   perform QCD sum rule analyses to calculate the mass of the d{*}(2380).
   The mass extracted from this analysis is M-d{*} = 2.4 +/- 0.2 GeV,
   consistent with the d{*}(2380) mass observed by the WASA detector at
   COSY. We also obtain a sum rule lower mass bound M-d{*} > 2.25 GeV. We
   also consider the effect of mixing of singlet dibaryon fields with the
   same quantum numbers, and perform the QCD sum rule analysis of the mixed
   interpolating current and extract the mass of the d{*}(2380) and its
   lower mass bound. With optimized mixing parameters, we find that the
   mixed current does not change the numerical result significantly.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of crystalline structure changes of sputtered ZnO interfacial
   layer on performances of inverted organic solar cells (OSCs) has been
   investigated. We find that the structural modification of the ZnO
   cathode interfacial layer, obtained by thermal annealing, plays a
   crucial role in the origin and solving of the S-curve in conjugated
   polymer/fullerene photovoltaics. Our results show that the
   crystallization (i.e. crystallites size) of poly(3hexylthiophene) (P3HT)
   evolves as a function of that of ZnO according to the annealing
   temperature. This evolution can directly impact the interfacial
   orientation and organization of the chains of P3HT at the ZnO buried
   interface. Such an ordered profile favors the vertical phase segregation
   and raises the carrier mobility, which explains the disappearance of the
   S-shape observed in current density-voltage device characteristics for
   annealing temperatures above 200 degrees C. These results adequately
   address recent research and provide an important insight into the
   interfacial layers of inverted OSCs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{15-26}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) of soil covers used in land
   reclamation is known to change over time as the result of weathering
   processes. Guelph permeameter (GP) measurements have been used to track
   the evolution of K-s for soil covers at an oil sands mine near Ft.
   McMurray, Alberta. Although successful, the method was time consuming
   and consequently a rapid method of estimating K-s based on in situ air
   permeability measurements was developed. The objectives of this study
   were: (1) to use air permeability measurements to characterize the
   spatial variations of K-s for typical reclamation soils and (2) to
   compare air permeability measurements to direct measurements obtained
   through laboratory and GP measurements. The results highlight that the
   values of K-s estimated from measured air permeability values were
   higher than the values of K-s measured directly using the GP. This is
   likely due to swelling of clay soils or air-entrapment during GP
   measurements. Although the magnitude was over-estimated, the variability
   of K-s was captured by the air permeability measurements. Consequently,
   a limited program of comparative GP and air permeameter measurements
   could be used to more rapidly characterize the K-s of reclamation covers
   over time.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial and spectral characteristics of the turbulent plasma
   density, electric fields, and ion drift in ionospheric E region are
   studied using a new set of nonlinear plasma fluid equations. The fluid
   model combines both Farley-Buneman (Type-I) and Gradient-Drift (Type-II)
   plasma instabilities in the equatorial electrojet. In our unified model
   of the plasma instabilities, we include the ion viscosity in the ion
   momentum equation and electron inertia in the electron momentum
   equation. These two terms play an important role in stabilizing the
   growing modes in the linear regime and in driving the Farley-Buneman
   instability into the saturation state. The simulation results show good
   agreements with a number of features of rocket and radar observations,
   such as (1) saturation of plasma density perturbations depends on the
   solar condition and reaches 7-15\% relative to the background, (2)
   fluctuation of the horizontal secondary electric field reaches 8-15
   mV/m, (3) stabilization of the phase velocity of the perturbed density
   wave around the value of the ion-acoustic speed inside the electrojet,
   (4) up-down asymmetry in the vertical fluxes of the plasma density, (5)
   east-west asymmetry of the plasma zonal drifts, and (6) generation of
   small scale of the order of meter scale lengths irregularities embedded
   in large-scale structures. Spectral analysis of the density fluctuations
   reveals the energy cascade due to the nonlinear coupling between
   structures of different scales. The break-up of the large-scale
   structures into small-scale structures explains the disappearance of
   Type-II echoes in the presence of Type-I instabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to verify the effect of adding glycerol for
   pelleting of selected agricultural crop residues, namely, wheat, barley,
   oat and canola straw. Single pelleting tests were conducted to study the
   effect of biomass type, hammer mill screen size, and crude glycerol
   content (co-product of biodiesel industry) on pellet quality (density
   and durability), ash content and gross heat of combustion. Four types of
   biomass were ground at three different hammer mill screen sizes of 6.4,
   3.2 and 1.6 mm. Each biomass was mixed with three levels of glycerol of
   2.5\%, 5.0\% and 7.5\% by weight. Pellets were made at a pre-set load of
   4 400 N (138.9 MPa) using single-pelleting unit attached to an Instron
   testing machine. Quality of pellets was determined by measuring pellet
   density, relaxed density, durability (measured by pellet drop test) and
   specific energy required to make a pellet. The gross heat of combustion
   and ash content of pellets were also determined and compared. The
   highest pellet density (988-1 133 kg/m(3)) and relaxed density (992-1
   142 kg/m(3)) were obtained from biomass ground using a hammer mill
   screen size of 6.4 mm. A decrease in hammer mill screen size resulted in
   reduced durability. The highest durability of biomass obtained from
   hammer mill screen size of 6.4 mm ranged from 97\%-100\%. Addition of
   glycerol resulted in lower ash content in majority of pellets. The
   highest gross heat of combustion was observed in pellets made from wheat
   straw with 7.5\% glycerol content (38.3 MJ/kg). Addition of glycerol
   resulted in lower pellet densities, lower ash content, no change in
   durability and higher gross heating values.}},

Abstract = {{The fast electron flux driven by Lower Hybrid Wave (LHW) in the
   scrape-off layer (SOL) in EAST is analyzed both theoretically and
   experimentally. The five bright belts flowing along the magnetic field
   lines in the SOL and hot spots at LHW guard limiters observed by charge
   coupled device and infrared cameras are attributed to the fast electron
   flux, which is directly measured by retarding field analyzers (RFA). The
   current carried by the fast electron flux, ranging from 400 to 6000
   A/m(2) and in the direction opposite to the plasma current, is scanned
   along the radial direction from the limiter surface to the position
   about 25 mm beyond the limiter. The measured fast electron flux is
   attributed to the high parallel wave refractive index n(jj) components
   of LHW. According to the antenna structure and the LHW power absorbed by
   plasma, a broad parallel electric field spectrum of incident wave from
   the antennas is estimated. The radial distribution of LHW-driven current
   density is analyzed in SOL based on Landau damping of the LHW. The
   analytical results support the RFA measurements, showing a certain level
   of consistency. In addition, the deposition profile of the LHW power
   density in SOL is also calculated utilizing this simple model. This
   study provides some fundamental insight into the heating and current
   drive effects induced by LHW in SOL, and should also help to interpret
   the observations and related numerical analyses of the behaviors of
   bright belts and hot spots induced by LHW. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a study on the ternary NaCl-KCl-H2O system was carried
   out by an extractive metallurgy technique from mixed brine solutions of
   different compositions at room temperature (23 degrees C). The surface
   morphology and microstructure were examined using a scanning electron
   microscope (SEM), electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and an
   energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The presence of Na-< aq >(+)
   was found to reduce the stability of the solutions and increase the
   crystallization induction period, interfacial energy, energy of
   formation of the nucleus and greatly reduce the nucleation rate of KCl
   crystal. The surface morphology of KCl crystals is significantly changed
   due to presence of 5 to 10\% (w/w) of NaCl as impurities in the binary
   solutions and shows the formation of co-crystals of different
   crystallographic orientation of NaCl on the KCl surface. In addition
   X-ray di ff raction studies performed on KCl crystals grown in
   halite-sylvite binary solutions reveals that these crystals are cubic in
   nature and its lattice constant is 6.2952 angstrom when the NaCl

Abstract = {{A recovery process for indium from waste liquid crystal display panels

   subsequent recovery of the dissolved metals was achieved using two
   column adsorption tests: The first column was packed with a porous resin
   impregnated with Aliquat 336, a commercially available solvent
   extraction reagent based on a quaternary ammonium compound, and the
   resin contained in the second column was impregnated with Cyanex 923,
   also a commercially available solvent extraction reagent based on
   trialkylphosphine oxide. In the first column, tin, iron, and zinc were
   removed from the leach liquor. In the second column, only indium was
   selectively recovered. The metal ions trapped in these columns were
   eluted with 0.1 M H2SO4, yielding a solution purified indium solution
   with a concentration 10 times that of the feed solution.}},

Abstract = {{The 3-D integrated circuit technologies with through-silicon via (TSV)
   structure have been attracting increasing attentions due to enhanced
   microchip function and performance. However, the high residual stress in
   the TSV structure caused by a mismatch of thermal expansion between
   copper and its surrounding substrate is a potential risk for the
   reliability of the chip performance. In this paper, the characteristics
   of thermomechanical behavior in a wafer with copper TSVs were studied
   using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and finite-element
   modeling. The high-resolution strain distribution maps were obtained
   using EBSD-based kernel average misorientation method. The results
   provided direct observation of the local strain in copper TSV, and the
   microstructural characteristics of copper TSV were also investigated.
   Finite-element analysis was performed to determine the stress
   distributions and to account for the strain in TSV observed through EBSD
   and scanning electron microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that magnesium alloys can be rolled up to a large thickness
   reduction and develop a unique texture when the rolling speed is high (>
   1000 m/min). In order to understand the texture formation mechanism
   during high-strain-rate deformation, high-speed rolling of AZ31
   magnesium alloy samples having different initial textures was conducted.
   The main components of the textures after the rolling were the RD-split
   basal, which consisted of 10A degrees-20A degrees inclining basal poles
   from the normal direction toward the rolling direction of the sheet,
   regardless of the different initial textures. With preheating at 473 K,
   all the samples were rolled without cracking while all were cracked when
   preheating was not applied. The optical micrographs and EBSD
   measurements showed a significant amount of twins and the cracks that
   developed along the shear bands consisted with laminated twins. Based on
   the texture simulation using the visco-plastic self-consistent model, it
   is concluded that the rapid development of the RD-split basal component
   from the initial basal alignment along the transverse direction was
   attributable to the tension twinning, The effect of the initial texture
   on the crack formation can be explained by the activation of the
   twinning system.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric elastomers (DEs) are gaining acceptance as potential actuator
   materials because of their exhibition of a large amount of deformation
   when stimulated by electrostatic forces. However, time-dependent
   behaviour such as creep and stress relaxation still pose a great
   challenge for the design, modelling and control of the DE-based
   actuators. In this work, attempts are made for experimental estimation
   and modelling of creep and relaxation properties of one of the most
   widely used dielectric acrylic elastomers, VHB 4910. Experimental
   investigation shows that the material possesses strong time-dependent
   creep and stress relaxation. It has been shown that creep and stress
   relaxation characteristics vary with the holding stress and holding
   strain respectively. Creep and stress relaxation properties are also
   shown to depend on the number of cycles in the case of cyclic loading.
   Results also show that Findley's power law can successfully model the
   creep and stress relaxation behaviour of the VHB 4910 elastomer.}},

Abstract = {{Dependence of initial oxidation behavior on crystalline orientation of
   Haynes 230 at 900 degrees C was investigated by a novel method. Analysis
   of oxidation rate reveals that the oxide thicknesses are different for
   grains having different orientations. Orientation mapping was performed
   on oxidized specimen and grains having near \{1 1 1\} were easily
   indexed by electron backscattered diffraction. We determined that planes
   with deviation angle lower than 20 degrees were all well indexed after
   oxidation. Results demonstrate that substrate orientation plays an
   important role on oxidation rate during the initial stage. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Twenty-seven wall-splice specimens reinforced with number (No.) 15 (0.6

   spacing on the tensile resistance of the lap-spliced reinforcement. All
   specimens were 21/2 blocks wide and 13 courses tall and were constructed

   bars were located within a single block cell and were either spaced 0,
   25, or 50 mm (0, 1, or 2 in.) apart. It was determined that the
   calculated tensile resistance of the reinforcement was greater for bars
   that were in contact and furthermore, is insensitive to the magnitude of
   the transverse spacing provided in the case of noncontact lap splices.

   clipped absolute deviation, are proposed to infer GRNs from time-course

Abstract = {{We report the determination of critical current density J(c) flowing in
   YBa2Cu3O7-delta superconducting thin films by two independent criteria.
   The estimation of J(c) was carried out by an inductive technique, i.e.,
   the so-called screening technique. Both the imaginary part of the
   fundamental harmonic of susceptibility chi(1)'' and the third harmonic
   of the voltage V-3 criteria were used to determine the full penetration
   field. Our goal is to shed light on the selection of the criterion for
   the determination of J(c). In order to compare the inductive criteria,
   we investigated the homogeneity of J(c) via transport measurements
   conducted on microbridges patterned in the films. Based on the transport
   method, we found that, for temperatures close to critical temperature
   T-c, both techniques yield similar results in the determination of J(c).
   However, at temperatures relatively far from T-c, the V-3 criterion
   showed better agreement with the transport data. Furthermore, using both
   criteria, we propose an alternative methodology to estimate in situ the
   coil factor associated with the V-3 criterion, avoiding in this way the
   need for implementing an additional technique.}},

Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JAN 29}},
Abstract = {{Clustering is one of main methods to identify functional modules from
   protein-protein interaction (PPI) data. Nevertheless traditional
   clustering methods may not be effective for clustering PPI data. In this
   paper, we proposed a novel method for clustering PPI data by combining
   firefly algorithm (FA) and synchronization-based hierarchical clustering
   (SHC) algorithm. Firstly, the PPI data are preprocessed via spectral
   clustering (SC) which transforms the high-dimensional similarity matrix
   into a low dimension matrix. Then the SHC algorithm is used to perform
   clustering. In SHC algorithm, hierarchical clustering is achieved by
   enlarging the neighborhood radius of synchronized objects continuously,
   while the hierarchical search is very difficult to find the optimal
   neighborhood radius of synchronization and the efficiency is not high.
   So we adopt the firefly algorithm to determine the optimal threshold of
   the neighborhood radius of synchronization automatically. The proposed
   algorithm is tested on the MIPS PPI dataset. The results show that our
   proposed algorithm is better than the traditional algorithms in
   precision, recall and f-measure value.}},

Title = {{Identifying essential proteins from active PPI networks constructed with
   dynamic gene expression}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{JAN 29}},
Abstract = {{Essential proteins are vitally important for cellular survival and
   development, and identifying essential proteins is very meaningful
   research work in the post-genome era. Rapid increase of available
   protein-protein interaction (PPI) data has made it possible to detect
   protein essentiality at the network level. A series of centrality
   measures have been proposed to discover essential proteins based on the
   PPI networks. However, the PPI data obtained from large scale,
   high-throughput experiments generally contain false positives. It is
   insufficient to use original PPI data to identify essential proteins.
   How to improve the accuracy, has become the focus of identifying
   essential proteins. In this paper, we proposed a framework for
   identifying essential proteins from active PPI networks constructed with
   dynamic gene expression. Firstly, we process the dynamic gene expression
   profiles by using time-dependent model and time-independent model.
   Secondly, we construct an active PPI network based on co-expressed
   genes. Lastly, we apply six classical centrality measures in the active
   PPI network. For the purpose of comparison, other prediction methods are
   also performed to identify essential proteins based on the active PPI
   network. The experimental results on yeast network show that identifying
   essential proteins based on the active PPI network can improve the
   performance of centrality measures considerably in terms of the number
   of identified essential proteins and identification accuracy. At the
   same time, the results also indicate that most of essential proteins are
   active.}},

Abstract = {{The Swarm mission represents a strong new tool to survey polar cap
   patches and plasma structuring inside the polar cap. In the early
   commissioning phase, the three Swarm satellites were operated in a
   pearls-on-a-string configuration making noon-midnight transpolar passes.
   This provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine the potential role
   of the gradient drift instability (GDI) process on polar cap patches by
   systematically calculating GDI growth times during their transit across
   the pole from day to night. Steep kilometer-scale gradients appeared in
   this study as initial structures that persisted during the approximate
   90 min it took a patch to cross the polar cap. The GDI growth times were
   calculated for a selection of the steep density gradients on both the
   dayside and the nightside. The values ranged from 23 s to 147 s, which
   is consistent with recent rocket measurements in the cusp auroral region
   and provides a template for future studies. Growth times of the order of
   1 min found both on the dayside and on the nightside support the
   existing view that the GDI may play a dominant role in the generation of
   radio wave scintillation irregularities as the patches transit the polar
   cap from day to night.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, effect of yttrium on the texture formation,
   microstructural evolution and mechanical response of AE42 and AE44 cast
   magnesium alloys were investigated under ballistic impact. The selected
   strain rates were 800 and 1100 s(-1) and the tests were conducted using
   Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar. It was inferred that after high velocity
   impact, a weaker basal texture developed in the samples with lower
   content of yttrium. Experimental results also showed that by increasing
   the concentration of yttrium in the cast AE alloys, strength, ductility
   and dislocation density of the impacted alloys increased but, the
   fraction of twinning decreased, which indicate the effective influence

Abstract = {{Mechanism of failure by hydrogen induced cracking (HIC) in pipeline
   steel has not been extensively investigated in the past. In the present
   work, an API X70 pipeline steel was electrochemically charged with
   hydrogen for different durations in order to find crack nucleation and
   propagation sites. After 3 h charging, suitable regions for crack
   initiation and propagation were found. These regions were studied by
   color metallography, EDS and EBSD techniques. The results brought out
   that HIC cracks nucleated from regions rich of manganese sulphide
   inclusions, some complex carbonitride precipitates such as (Ti, Nb, V)
   (C, N) and further propagated through the segregation area of some
   elements, such as manganese, carbon, silicon and sulfur. It is
   worth-mentioning that all these potential sites for crack nucleation and
   propagation appeared at the center of cross section of the specimens.
   EBSD measurements were carried out at the center of cross section in
   as-received and hydrogen-charged specimens in order to find a pattern
   between microstructural parameters (texture, grain boundary nature and
   Taylor factor) and probability of HIC cracking. The results showed that
   fine grain colonies (less than 3.5 mu m in length) with dominant ND
   parallel to<001> orientations were prone to intergranular HIC crack
   propagation. The grain boundaries identified between two grains with a
   mismatch in Taylor factor were more susceptible to intergranular
   fracture while transgranular fracture occurred in fragmented grains with
   high and similar Taylor factor that were less likely to yield. HIC
   cracking occurred in a wide range of orientations such as ND parallel
   to<123>, ND parallel to<100>, ND parallel to<112>, ND parallel to<110>
   and even ND parallel to<111>; however, role of high angle grain
   boundaries and type of fracture would be of great importance in crack
   propagation. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{Water is an inevitable byproduct in proton exchange membrane fuel cells
   that can lead to complex two-phase flow throughout the cell's
   components, including the flow field channels utilized for gas delivery.
   A modified Lockhart-Martinelli (LM) approach based on unique water
   introduction through the gas diffusion layer is used here to predict the
   gas-liquid pressure drop in these channels by modifying the Chisholm
   parameter C. This paper exclusively uses experimental data of two-phase
   flow multipliers from four sources in the literature, all of which are
   obtained from active fuel cell operation. C does not appear to change
   strongly as a function of temperature, relative humidity, or air
   stoichiometry, but does vary significantly with the current density.
   This is especially true at low current densities (<500 mA cm(-2)). To
   capture this behavior, C is defined as a flow regime dependent parameter
   based on a flow regime map from the active fuel cell data. In addition
   to the traditionally used slug, film, and single-phase regimes, an
   `accumulating' flow regime is proposed to capture the behavior of C and
   two-phase flow multipliers at low current densities. The proposed
   accumulating flow regime is consistent with visual observation reported
   in the literature. In addition, the developed LM approach can be
   employed to optimize fuel cell flow field design and operation.

   Microstructural investigations confirmed heterogeneous deformation

   the formation of athermal epsilon martensite and alpha-martensite within
   the shear bands. The thermally induced epsilon martensite follows
   Shoji-Nishiyama crystal-lographic orientation relationship with parent
   austenite phase, while alpha-martensite shows Burgers relationship with
   epsilon martensite. The plastic deformation within the austenite phase
   is characterized by slip and mechanical twinning alongside with
   martensite formation in regions away from shear bands. The austenite
   texture outside shear band regions showed characteristic near ID
   parallel to < 110 > orientation (ID: impact direction), whereas the
   regions inside shear band exhibit both near ID parallel to < 100 > and

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Development of smart bioactive scaffolds is of importance in tissue
   engineering, where cell proliferation, differentiation and migration
   within scaffolds can be regulated by the interactions between cells and
   scaffold through the use of growth factors (GFs) and extra cellular
   matrix peptides. One challenge in this area is to spatiotemporally
   control the dose, sequence and profile of release of GFs so as to
   regulate cellular fates during tissue regeneration. This challenge would
   be addressed by rate-programming of nano-particulate delivery systems,
   where the release of GFs via polymeric nanoparticles is controlled by
   means of the methods of, such as externallycontrolled and
   physicochemically/architecturally-modulated so as to mimic the profile
   of physiological GFs. Identifying and understanding such factors as the
   desired release profiles, mechanisms of release, physicochemical
   characteristics of polymeric nanoparticles, and externally-triggering
   stimuli are essential for designing and optimizing such delivery
   systems. This review surveys the recent studies on the desired release
   profiles of GFs in various tissue engineering applications, elucidates
   the major release mechanisms and critical factors affecting release
   profiles, and overviews the role played by the mathematical models for
   optimizing nanoparticulate delivery systems. Potentials of stimuli
   responsive nanoparticles for spatiotemporal control of GF release are
   also presented, along with the recent advances in strategies for
   spatiotemporal control of GF delivery within tissue engineered
   scaffolds. The recommendation for the future studies to overcome
   challenges for developing sophisticated particulate delivery systems in
   tissue engineering is discussed prior to the presentation of conclusions
   drawn from this paper.}},

Abstract = {{The knowledge of the structures that can exist in compounds containing

   searching method. We find a thermodynamically stable structure that can
   be characterized by interactions comparable in strength to that of
   conventional hydrogen bonds. An orthorhombic structure with space group
   Ibam is identified that has progressively lower enthalpy with increasing
   pressure above 296 GPa than a mixture of He and H2O. This mechanically
   and dynamically stable structure is found at pressures that are now

Abstract = {{In the present study, API X60 and X6OSS pipeline steels were
   cathodically charged by hydrogen for 8 h using 0.2 M sulfuric acid and 3
   g/I ammonium thiocyanate. After charging, SEM observations showed that
   the hydrogen induced cracking CHIC) appeared at the center of cross
   section in the X60 specimen. However, HIC did not appear in the X6OSS
   steel. Therefore, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique was
   used to analyze the center of cross section of as-received X6OSS, X60
   and HIC tested X60 specimens. The results showed that the HIC crack not
   only can propagate through (100>vertical bar vertical bar ND oriented
   grains but also its growth may happen in various orientations. In HIC
   tested X60 specimen, an accumulation of low angle grain boundaries
   around the crack path documented that full recrystallization was not
   achieved during hot rolling. Kernel Average Misorientaion (KAM)
   histogram illustrated that the deformation is more concentrated in
   as-received and HIC tested X60 specimens rather than in as received
   X6OSS specimen. Moreover, the concentration of coincidence site lattice
   (CSL) boundary in HIC tested X60 specimen was very low compared with
   other samples. The recrystallization area fraction in X6OSS steel was
   very high. This high amount of recrystallization fraction with no stored
   energy is one of the main reasons for high HIC resistance of this steel
   to HIC. The orientation distribution function (ODF) of the
   recrystallized, substructured and deformed fractions in as-received
   X6OSS and X60 steel showed relative close orientations in both
   as-received specimens. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lignocellulosic biomasses are potential feedstocks for biofuel
   production. However, the structural interface between cellulose,
   hemicellulose, and lignin in biomass is least understood. The current
   study investigates the effects of delignification and hydrothermal
   pre-treatment on forestry biomass (pinewood) to remove lignin and
   increase cellulose accessibility. The feedstocks were physico-chemically
   characterized through CHNS analysis, TGA, XRD, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy,
   SEM, and AFM. As a new concept, in-situ distribution of lignin in
   biomass was studied through Raman mapping. Delignification caused about
   95\% removal of lignin in pinewood. The cellulose content increased to
   82\% in delignified pinewood from 50.7\% in untreated pinewood. The
   lignin level decreased from 24.2\% in untreated pinewood to 1.2\% in
   delignified pinewood. Microscopic studies revealed interwoven cellulose
   fibres on delignified pinewood surfaces, suggesting their enhanced
   accessibility to cellulolytic enzymes. Delignification caused remarkable
   removal of lignin with partial exclusion of hemicellulose, thus
   increasing cellulose availability.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a design of distributed spacetime coding (DSTC) for
   the multiple access (MA) phase of a two-way relaying communication
   system. Bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) is used by the two
   terminal nodes and decoding based on the quaternary code representation
   is adopted at the relay. Based on an upper bound of the error
   probability, the impact of DSTC on the error performance is analyzed by
   considering three error types in the MA phase. Specifically, it is shown
   that type-3 errors need to be carefully taken into account in the design
   of a DSTC scheme. By developing a performance metric related to type-3
   errors, a single parameter can be searched and its optimal value is
   obtained. To corroborate the analysis and optimization, simulation
   results are provided to show the advantage of the proposed DSTC scheme
   over other schemes under both Rayleigh and Rician fading channels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the on-line supply chain scheduling problem for
   single machine with multiple customers under the constraint of the
   unlimited number of vehicles but limited vehicle capacity. The customers
   place their orders on-line, which means that no information of future

   then delivered to the customers by vehicles. Every vehicle can only
   contain the jobs of the same customer and every batch has the same fixed
   cost. The objective of the scheduling is to minimize the total makespan
   and the total delivery cost. Such a problem is called on-line problem.
   An on-line algorithm for the problem is designed, which is proved to be
   2 + 1/2-competitive. The paper also presents a case study for

Abstract = {{Electrostatic charges generated during powder handling often adversely
   influence process performance. In cases where significant charges are
   present, accidental discharge of the accumulated charges may cause
   sparks, fires, even explosions, affecting process performance and
   causing significant safety concerns. Electrostatic charging is a
   complicated phenomenon, especially when handling powder mixtures of
   poly-disperse particles because of bi-polar charging, with small
   particles being charged opposite to their larger counterparts. Bipolar
   charging can lead to agglomeration, segregation and severe adhesion to
   walls or contact surfaces. Therefore, in order to characterize
   electrostatic properties of powders, it is desirable to measure not only
   the net charges on a powder, but also its polarity. In this work, a
   simple method is developed to investigate charge generation due to
   particle-particle collisions and particle-wall contact during powder
   handling. The experimental set-up consisted of two parallel copper
   plates connected to a high voltage power supply and a vibrating charging
   device with adjustable contacting surfaces. When subjected to a static
   electrical field, negatively charged particles moved to the positive
   side of the parallel plates, whereas positively charged particles
   migrated to the negative side. The separation of charged particles under
   investigation indicated bi-polar charging in a polydisperse powder
   system, with smaller particles carrying charges of polarity opposite to
   their larger counterparts. However, smaller particles were also found to
   carry two different charges from a set of fine particle-only experiments
   in binary powder mixtures. This was due to two different charging
   mechanisms: charge transfer and charge separation. In a further study
   with the addition of fine particles to mono-sized powders, the results
   indicated that the addition of fine particles helped reduce the net
   charges of the mixtures, with fine particles tending to carry positive
   charges after powder separation. When a typical antistatic agent
   (Larostat 519) was added to the mono-sized powders, the net charges of
   the mixtures decreased. Particle separation experiments revealed that
   this antistatic agent considerably altered the charging behavior of the
   host powders. This finding implies that the role of Larostat 519 in
   neutralizing charges differs from that of simple addition of other fine
   particles. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The classical equal area criterion in the power-angle domain, which is
   typically used for power systems planning/stability studies, is modified
   to the time domain for out-of-step protection. Wide-area measurements
   are necessary to obtain the power-angle information if the traditional
   equal area criterion is applied for out-of-step detection. However, its
   time-domain modification requires only the information local to the
   out-of-step relay. The proposed method evaluates the transient energy,
   which is the area under the power-time curve, and by comparing the
   areas, differentiation between stable and out-of-step swings is made.
   The proposed method can be directly applied to multimachine power
   systems without network reduction, unlike the conventional equal area
   criterion in which the equivalent two area of the multimachine system
   needs to be obtained. The proposed out-of-step detection method has been
   tested on a Single Machine Infinite Bus System and a 17-Bus Multimachine

Abstract = {{Background: Integrating multiple data sources is indispensable in
   improving disease gene identification. It is not only due to the fact
   that disease genes associated with similar genetic diseases tend to lie
   close with each other in various biological networks, but also due to
   the fact that gene-disease associations are complex. Although various
   algorithms have been proposed to identify disease genes, their
   prediction performances and the computational time still should be
   further improved.
   Results: In this study, we propose a fast and high performance multiple
   data integration algorithm for identifying human disease genes. A
   posterior probability of each candidate gene associated with individual
   diseases is calculated by using a Bayesian analysis method and a binary
   logistic regression model. Two prior probability estimation strategies
   and two feature vector construction methods are developed to test the
   performance of the proposed algorithm.
   Conclusions: The proposed algorithm is not only generated predictions
   with high AUC scores, but also runs very fast. When only a single PPI
   network is employed, the AUC score is 0.769 by using F-2 as feature
   vectors. The average running time for each leave-one-out experiment is
   only around 1.5 seconds. When three biological networks are integrated,
   the AUC score using F-3 as feature vectors increases to 0.830, and the
   average running time for each leave-one-out experiment takes only about
   12.54 seconds. It is better than many existing algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{For some lung diseases, assessment of alveolar dimension could add
   critical information to inform patient care and disease progression.
   However, current clinical imaging techniques, such as computed
   tomography, lack the resolution required to measure these small
   structures in patients. While the gold standard imaging modality for
   measuring alveoli is micro-CT, this technique is not possible in
   clinical use due to the size of the patients and the radiation dose. An
   alternative imaging modality is phase-based contrast imaging, which
   would deliver a lower dose to patients and increase the size limit.
   Phase contrast X-ray imaging has previously been combined with particle
   image velocimetry (PIV) to measure lung motion, another indicator of
   lung disease. Thus it was hypothesized that average alveolar size could
   also be measured indirectly using PIV. In the work reported here, we
   show that average alveolar size shows a high correlation to the
   mathematical divergence of the velocity vector field that results from
   the speckle pattern produced by phase imaging of mouse lungs. This
   correlation is linear with p<0.006. If this correlation holds in human
   lungs, it could potentially be calibrated to indirectly measure average
   alveolar size in human patients using some of the grating-based
   phase-contrast imaging methods that are showing great promise in
   clinical use.}},

Abstract = {{The drive to improve and expand the amount of information extracted from
   various imaging modalities has led to the use of multiple (usually two)
   x-ray photon energies in computed tomography clinical systems. With the
   use of a single photon energy, the ability to differentiate soft from
   hard tissues is a problem which multiple energy imaging can solve. The
   continuous spectrum available from synchrotron light facilities provides
   a nearly an ideal source for multiple energy imaging. For living
   biological subjects a multiple energy system that can extract multiple
   endogenous or induced contrast materials as well as water and bone
   images would be ideal. A novel bent Laue single crystal monochromator
   that has a wide angularly dispersed energy range (polychromator) has
   been developed to explore the use of multiple energies simultaneously
   for biomedical imaging at the Biomedical Imaging and Therapy beamline at
   the Canadian Light Source. Using the 311 reflection from a 511 silicon
   crystal wafer bent to a radius of 95 cm, the system prepares a 0.5 mm
   wide focused polychromatic x-ray beam with a spectral range of 27 keV to
   43 keV, covering both the iodine and barium K-edges of 33.17 keV and
   37.44 keV, respectively. As an example use, test objects with iodine and
   barium (common contrast agents used in clinical imaging) along with
   water and bone were imaged and successfully extracted independent
   quantifiable images of these four materials. The biomedical imaging
   system is presented with emphasis on the polychromator used to prepare
   the imaging beam.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to analyze six limiting factors that may be
   responsible for target tissue necrosis (TTN) generation during the
   procedure of radiofrequency ablation (RFA). A comprehensive finite
   element (FE) model was built to collect the data of TTN generated in a
   liver tissue by using a commercial available RFA system. The model was
   validated by comparison of results with in vitro experiment in a
   literature. Six limiting factors were analyzed using a statistical
   method. Sixteen RFA experiments were performed, in which the TTN volume
   was considered as a response variable along with the six control
   factors. The TTN volumes obtained from the 16 simulations were quite
   different, ranging from 7.749 to 8433.931 mm(3). The applied voltage
   (V), the frequency (f), the length (L) of the RF electrode, the chilled
   fluid temperature (T), the large blood vessel (d) in the proximity to
   target tissue and the ablation duration (t) account for approximately
   78.21\%, 9.93\%, 2.91\%, 0.01\%, 4.64\%, and 0.08\%, respectively, of
   the effect on the TTN volume. The findings from the present study
   suggest that the applied voltage (V) and the frequency (f), followed by
   the large blood vessel (d) in proximity to target tissue, have the
   highest effect on the TTN volume.}},

   recover their original function after partial damage of the system. This
   is achieved by making changes on the partially damaged robot. The
   general resilient robot, which makes sense by including active joints,

   proposed in order to explore its resilience. The axiomatic design theory
   (ADT) is applied to develop the resilient robot. First, a general
   architecture of robots was proposed, which is characterized as
   under-actuated robot. Second, a docking system was developed, which is
   the key part of incorporating the proposed architecture in the design of
   the mechanical system of the resilient robot, and this thus enables the

Abstract = {{In developing the human-machine technology, it is essentially important
   to infer human mind state. A machine learning approach is promising to
   this need. However, the machine-learning approach essentially requires
   training data, ideally supervised training data, which may not be
   readily available. An idea is to overcome this shortcoming is to take
   the so-called subjective rate measure. Take the problem of inferring the
   cognitive fatigue state as an example. This means that we need to ask
   human subjects to rate their fatigue state while they are performing a
   task under a particular environment. This is notoriously known
   problematic as it is intrusive to task performing. In this paper, we
   propose a notion called ``number-based information{''} as opposed to
   ``word-based information{''} in terms of applications. We then apply
   this notion to the problem of mind state inference, leading to a novel
   inference approach by a combination of physiological signals and task
   performance. We illustrate this method by using the example of cognitive
   fatigue inference in the context of rehabilitation for post-stroke
   patients. Another contribution of this paper is the study of
   individual-based and group-based strategies to acquire training data to
   infer the human mind state. In particular, we show a significant
   improvement in the accuracy of inference with the individual-based
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new type of interface called redundant interface.
   The redundant interface has two benefits: (1) improved resilience that
   is the interface system may still work when subject to some partial
   damage and (2) improved understanding comprehensiveness. The second
   contribution of the paper is the development of a systematic approach to
   designing interfaces including the redundant interface. The general
   philosophy behind the new approach is that an interface is viewed as a
   product instead of a part of the machine system or real world
   application system. By product, it further implies that the interface is
   not just a dimensionless system but a product or machine or robot. In
   the case that the interface by itself is a robot, the motion and posture
   of the robot may also be utilized in human-robot communication with an
   increased redundancy. With such a view, the design theory and
   methodology in general product development can be adapted to interface
   design. These theories and methodologies are further integrated with a
   theory called perceptual compatibility principle (PCP) known in the HCI
   community, resulting in a complete interface design methodology. An
   example of the subway station guiding system is used to illustrate the
   proposed idea and methodology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the principle of a non-contact method to detect area
   of pulsations (AP) on a patient's neck via a video camera system for
   medical applications such as jugular venous pulsations (JVP). The color
   frames in the video clips are used to pinpoint the areas of pulsations
   after the frames going through principal processing such as denoising,
   motion tracking, and light enhancing. The capturing system comprises a
   video camera and a computer with a custom built program installed to
   capture and process the frames. Experiments were performed to detect the
   area of the right jugular venous pulsation. The results are comparable
   to the observation of the doctors who are experts in jugular venous
   pressure. Recognizing the area of pulsations is significant in
   determining the cardiopulmonary status, especially with the highest
   oscillation point of the right internal JVP (IJVP) to calculate the
   jugular venous pressure. This preliminary work has not yet distinguished
   different types of pulsation on the neck such as jugular venous
   pulsations, external jugular venous pulsations, or carotid artery
   pulsations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to count the number of breaths per minute
   (RR) using the PrimeSense camera, in particular, the depth camera. Based
   on the reflection of a pattern of the infrared (IR) dots on depth frames
   created by the IR camera, the oscillation of the certain region on human
   body is detected and recorded at different time points. The data are
   used to build a depth map whose data are converted into the distance in
   millimeter between the camera and the measured subject. The respiration
   rate measuring algorithm is designed to appropriately find the breathing
   rate (BR). The algorithm and method are verified in the experiments. The
   measured results are compared to the practical counting. The current
   method is now only used in off-line processing on the recorded videos,

Abstract = {{With the increasing use of Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLSs) to sense
   various environments it becomes increasingly necessary to develop
   automated processing techniques to deal with the large amount of data
   generated. To aid in the automatic processing, researchers have recently
   been turning to the use of ``intensity{''} data returned by TLSs as an
   additional source of information. Ideally a value that is independent of
   distance and incidence angle, and that instead is related to the surface
   properties being scanned is desired. For diffuse surfaces this value is
   termed the reflectance.
   A method for modelling the reflectance of a diffuse surface using
   returned intensity, angle of incidence and range obtained from TLSs is
   presented. The model is applied to two different TLS instruments, a Faro
   Focus3D and Riegl VZ-400. A model is parametrized for each instrument
   using data obtained in an underground potash mine. For the Riegl
   instrument the model is verified using a data set obtained above ground,
   in a grass playing field. The standard deviation of error is 0.064 or
   6.4\%. For the Faro instrument the model is obtained using only a subset
   of the acquired data set and verified with the remainder. The standard
   deviation for the Faro model is 0.061 or 6.1\%.}},

   the total transmit power constraint, an improved power allocation scheme

   are divided into groups, the issue of power allocation can be separated
   into two tasks: power allocation within each sensor group and power
   allocation among sensor groups. In this paper, both tasks are studied
   and solutions are provided. Simulation results show that the improved

   generated by the heart, as measured using accelerometer sensors, and has
   been found to be an important biomarker for cardiac diseases. This paper
   explores the biometric potential of the SCG. To this end, an
   SCG-biometric verification system is designed, focusing mainly on the
   feature extraction and dimensionality reduction methods: the former is
   based on autocorrelation, while the latter is based on principal
   component analysis (PCA). To improve the system accuracy and robustness,
   a data fusion approach is also implemented, by combining the tri-axial
   SCG signals. The obtained results indicate that the SCG is a promising
   physiological signal for biometric applications.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of cell counting is of tremendous importance in many
   clinical laboratory and pathology testing procedures, where an accurate
   cell count is vital for various diagnostic objectives, such as
   classifying disease developments and assessing drug effectiveness.
   Unfortunately, even today, this task remains mostly a manual endeavor,
   and depends on time-consuming human labor. Automated cell counting is
   clearly a desirable alternative, but has yet to fully emerge due to
   outstanding challenges and limitations in equipment cost and processing
   methods. To this end, a framework for counting lymphocytes from
   microscopic images is proposed in this paper. The framework requires
   modest equipment investment, consisting mostly of a standard microscope
   and a digital camera, while offering promising performance results. This
   is possible due to a robust image processing pipeline involved, with
   strategically designed color space, filtering and edge detection
   operations. The framework is validated on the publicly available ALL-IDB
   dataset, which is noted for its challenging nature due to various
   obstacles for image processing operations. Specifically, this work
   tackles the automated counting of lymphocytes from this dataset.
   Currently, the proposed framework is already capable of delivering
   accuracies of over 90\%, with low computational complexity and execution
   time. Therefore, with further performance improvements, it should be
   expected to offer a compelling alternative for clinical testing
   procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Blood pressure measurement is vital in healthcare and many methods have
   been developed for this purpose of which the oscillometric technique is
   the most popular. However, accurate estimation of BP using an
   oscillometric waveform remains a challenge, particularly when the
   waveform is distorted by noise and artifacts, such as due to involuntary
   motion. In response, this paper proposes a band pass filtering (BPF)
   method to deliver a filtered oscillometric signal that is suitable for
   blood pressure estimation using envelope detection. To validate the
   utility of the proposed method, two algorithms are implemented to
   estimate the systolic and diastolic BPs for various operating
   conditions. The obtained results indicate that a properly designed BPF
   exhibits significant improvement in delivering accurate BP measurement.
   It is envisioned that the proposed method is suitable for implementation
   in emergency medical devices, such as for blood pressure monitoring in
   an ambulance under significant motion artifacts.}},

Abstract = {{The planning of radiotherapy is increasingly based on multi-modal
   imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET)-computed
   tomography (CT), since PET/CT provides not only anatomical but also
   functional assessment of the tumor. In this work, we propose a novel
   co-segmentation method, utilizing both the PET and CT images, to
   localize the tumor. The method constructs the segmentation problem as
   minimization of a Markov random field model, which encapsulates features
   from both imaging modalities. The minimization problem can then be
   solved by the maximum flow algorithm, based on graph cuts theory. The
   proposed tumor delineation algorithm was validated in both a phantom,
   with a high-radiation area, and in patient data. The obtained results
   show significant improvement compared to existing segmentation methods,
   with respect to various qualitative and quantitative metrics.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of cancer-related genes is important towards the
   understanding of complex genetic diseases. Although many machine
   learning algorithms are proposed to identify disease-related genes, they
   often either have poor performance to identify locus heterogeneity
   cancer-related genes or are not applicable to predict
   individual-disease-related genes due to the lack of positive instances
   (imbalanced classification). To overcome these two issues, a two-step
   logistic regression (LR) based algorithm is proposed in this study for
   identifying individual-cancer-related genes. A set of high potential
   cancer-class-related genes is first generated in step 1, followed by a
   second round of LR-based algorithm conducted on this smaller dataset for
   identifying individual-cancer-related genes. Numerical experiments show
   that the proposed two-step LR-based algorithm not only works well for
   locus heterogeneity data, but also has good performance to handle the
   imbalanced classification problem. The individual-cancer-related gene
   identification experiments achieve AUC values of around 0.85 when the
   threshold of posterior probability is chosen between 0.3 and 0.6. All
   evaluations are conducted by using the leave-one-out cross validation
   method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a more systematic and rational approach to design of
   compliant flexure-hinge amplification mechanisms is presented. The
   existing approach has only considered the amplification ratio but not
   the orientation difference between the input and output. This has caused
   the inadequate classification of flexure-hinge amplification mechanisms
   and difficulty in designing of them. In the proposed approach,
   amplification ratio and difference in orientation between input and
   output are treated separately and considered as two different function
   requirements. Based on this idea, the working principle for
   flexure-hinge amplification mechanism is modified to reflect the
   separation of the two requirements. The paper provides an example to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Human-Machine Cooperative Product (HMCP) is ubiquitous in our daily
   life. The examples of HMCP are cell phones, cars, etc. The basic feature
   with this kind of product is that human operation is essential. The
   existing design theory and methodology seems to be mostly for functional
   products such as engine. There is a rich set of knowledge for ergonomics
   design but it is mostly about how easy for the human operator to operate
   directly or monitor the product. For HMCPs, there is not only the issue
   of how easy to operate or monitor but also the issue of how the human
   operates. This paper presents a study to extend the existing design
   theory called Axiomatic Design Theory (ADT) to guide the design of HMCP.

Abstract = {{Relevant works on the design of spherical parallel robots (SPRs) are
   mostly for conceptual design. The conceptual design of a SPR considers
   kinematic parameters and variables to describe the motion transformation
   between joints and the end-effector. For example, the Denavit-Hartenberg
   (D-H) notation with four kinematic parameters is used to represent the
   spatial relations of two motion axes with no consideration of the
   physical embodiment between the two axes. We call the design parameters
   involved in the conceptual design phase as conceptual design parameters
   (CDPs). In contrast, embodiment design concerns the specifications of
   links and kinematic pairs in terms of their geometrics, volumes, spatial
   arrangements and dynamic behaviors. Accordingly, we call the design
   parameters in the embodiment design phase as embodiment design
   parameters (EDPs). As far as a robotic design is concerned, a critical
   challenge of embodiment design is to sustain the workspace obtained in
   conceptual design based on CDPs. Actual geometries of objects might
   cause the interferences among physical objects in an embodied robot. In
   this paper, the conceptual design of a SPR is assumed to be known, the
   embodiment design of a SPR is focused to minimize the workspace loss
   caused by EDPs. We propose three principles to guide the embodiment
   design of the SPR, and we apply the general algorithm (GA) for
   interference check based on the proposed principles. A case study of the
   embodiment design of a SPR is provide to illustrate how the principles
   are used to maximize the robot workspace at the stage of embodiment
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Human cognitive and perception processes have a great tolerance for
   imprecision or uncertainty. For this reason, the notions of perception
   and cognition have great importance in solving many decision making
   problems in engineering, medicine, science, and social science as there
   are innumerable uncertainties in real-world phenomena. These
   uncertainties can be broadly classified as either type one uncertainty
   arising from the random behavior of physical processes or type two
   uncertainty arising from human perception and cognition processes.
   Statistical theory can be used to model the former, but lacks the
   sophistication to process the latter. The theory of fuzzy logic has
   proven to be very effective in processing type two uncertainty. New
   computing methods based on fuzzy logic can lead to greater adaptability,
   tractability, robustness, a lower cost solution, and better rapport with
   reality in the development of intelligent systems. Fuzzy logic is needed
   to properly pose and answer queries about quantitatively defining
   imprecise linguistic terms like middle class, poor, low inflation,
   medium inflation, and high inflation. Imprecise terms like these in
   natural languages should be considered to have qualitative definitions,
   quantitative definitions, crisp quantitative definitions, fuzzy
   quantitative definitions, type-one fuzzy quantitative definitions, and
   interval type-two fuzzy quantitative definitions. There can be crisp
   queries, crisp answers, type-one fuzzy queries, type-one fuzzy answers,
   interval type-two fuzzy queries, and interval type-two fuzzy answers.}},

Abstract = {{The water balance in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells still
   remains a topic of much investigation in order to maintain satisfactory
   cell performance. One specific water management issue relates to the
   gas-liquid flows that occur when water enters the reactant flow field
   channels, which are typically microchannels or minichannels. Due to its
   unique water introduction, the Lockhart-Martinelli (LM) approach has
   been revised for its applicability in predicting the two-phase pressure
   drop in these channels where water emerges from a gas diffusion layer
   perpendicular to the direction of gas flow. In the revised LM approach,
   the Chisholm parameter C is found not to vary strongly as a function of
   key fuel cell operating variables (relative humidity, temperature,
   materials, gas stoichiometry), whereas it does vary as a function of
   flow regime and current density. A new flow regime map was proposed
   based on all pressure drop data collected from active fuel cells, where
   an accumulating flow regime is presented in addition to single-phase,
   film/droplet, and slug flow. The proposed accumulating regime is linked
   to water droplet dynamics, namely, water droplet emergence, growth, and
   detachment. A force balance approach shows when detachment will occur,
   which clarifies the bounds of the accumulating regime in terms of
   superficial gas velocity (gas stoichiometry ratio) and liquid velocity
   (current density). The balance considers different wetting scenarios in
   the channels and a range of superficial velocities of importance to PEM
   fuel cells.}},

   effectively employ it in an electrically dense array. The antenna is
   composed of 2-layer electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) cells and is a thin
   version of the formerly introduced thick self-excited EBG resonator
   antenna. The effect of mutual coupling on the input impedance of the
   adjacent elements in a sample array is demonstrated, and a technique to
   suppress this effect, using a high impedance (HI) surface, is applied.
   Simulation results show that the application of proposed
   high-performance elements and the HI surface maintains the balance in
   the feed network and the symmetry in the broadside pattern, even at the
   presence of high-dielectric substrates.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a highly efficient and miniature planar
   electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) antenna with circularly polarized (CP)
   radiation. The antenna building blocks are the high aspect ratio (HAR)
   EBG cells recently introduced in literature, nine (3x3) of which are
   deployed in both lateral dimensions. As the top metal layer of this EBG
   surface is symmetrical, it simultaneously accommodates two orthogonal
   E-field components, excited by two microstriplines attached to the
   corners. A compact simplified shifter/power divider provides quadrature
   phase difference and equal power at feed points, enabling the structure
   to generate a broadside CP radiation pattern. Thanks to the natural
   capability of EBG cells, the low loss nature of HAR metal traces, and
   high capacitive coupling of gaps, this work features a planar CP antenna
   with dimensions as small as 0.26 lambda x0.29 lambda x lambda/23 and
   efficiency as high as 94.3\%.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless capsule endoscopy is used to capture images from inside body
   which are used for diagnosis of various diseases. Diagnosis of disease
   and detail analysis of endoscopic images is based on the quality of
   image which is heavily dependent on the image size, frame rate and
   illumination system. The design of illumination system involves choice
   and placement of proper light source. Light emitting diodes (LED) are
   widely used as light source for illumination. The brightness in a
   captured image depends on the distance of the object from the light
   source and surrounding environment. In this paper, we propose a new
   algorithm that uses the captured image for determining the proper
   illumination condition for future frames. Based on it, the brightness of
   the LEDs is controlled individually in real-time to give proper
   illumination for clear image acquisition.}},

Abstract = {{Aperture arrays are widely used in beamforming applications where
   element signals are steered to a particular direction of interest and a
   single beam is formed. Multi-beamforming is an extension of single
   beamforming which is desired in the fields where sources located in
   multiple directions are of interest. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is
   usually used in these scenarios to segregate the received signals based
   on their direction of arrivals. In this work, instead of DFT, the
   Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is used and an efficient implementation
   technique using Decomposed Algebraic Integer Quantization (DAIQ) is
   proposed for error-free and multiplier-less implementation of the DCT.
   Its performance for beamforming application is also studied.}},

   that of traditional 6T cell and 16\% larger than that of the Quatro
   cell. The area of 11T cell with LEAP technique (LEAP-11T) is 15\% larger

   Simulation results show that the error cross section of regular 11T is
   17X lower and 2.8X lower than that of traditional 6T at LET = 10 and 30
   MeV-cm(2)/mg respectively in normal strikes; and it is 2.2X lower than

Abstract = {{The wake of a surface-mounted finite-height square prism of sub-critical
   aspect ratio AR = 3 was studied experimentally in a low-speed wind
   tunnel at a Reynolds number of Re = 3.7x10(4). The ratio of the boundary
   layer thickness on the ground plane, to the width of the prism, was
   delta/D = 1.5. The incidence angle of the prism was varied from alpha =
   0 degrees to 45 degrees. Wake mean velocity measurements were made in
   vertical planes normal to and parallel to the main flow direction using
   a seven-hole pressure probe. As the prism is rotated from alpha = 0
   degrees to 45 degrees, the mean wake progressively widens and the
   maximum streamwise extent of the mean recirculation zone increases. The
   mean streamwise tip vortex pair is symmetric at 0 degrees and 45
   degrees, but becomes strongly asymmetric at intermediate alpha, where
   the tip vortex is found higher above the ground plane on the wider side
   of the wake. The wake and tip vortex asymmetry is most pronounced near
   the critical incidence angle.}},

Abstract = {{Given the public safety risk posed by high-risk drivers, most traffic
   safety agencies consider this group a key target for strategic planning
   purposes. The aim of this research was to develop a framework that could
   be used to efficiently and effectively target high-risk drivers. The
   specific objectives were to establish whether high-risk drivers were
   homogeneous and if not, to determine the optimal set of primary and
   secondary clusters for efficient and effective targeting with minimal
   resources. The study area was Saskatchewan, Canada. Multiple databases
   (including traffic collisions, insurance claims, and conviction data)
   formed the basis for the research. In this study, high-risk drivers were
   defined as all drivers who were enrolled both in the Driver Improvement
   Program of Saskatchewan Government Insurance and in the negative or
   penalty zone of Saskatchewan Government Insurance's safety driver rating
   scale as a result of accumulated demerit points. Geodemographic modeling
   with the neighborhood as the unit of analysis, a large number of
   variables, and a set of probabilistic clustering techniques were used in
   the analysis. The results indicated that the high-risk driver group was
   heterogeneous; it fell into subclusters with varying collision and
   traffic behavior profiles. The study found that Saskatchewan high-risk
   drivers were mainly in the major cities (56\%) but also in rural
   municipalities (18\%) and towns (15\%). The optimal primary high-risk
   segments for efficient targeting were those major cities and towns where
   both the risk of collision involvement and the concentration of
   high-risk drivers were higher than the driver population. Drivers in the
   primary target area for messaging showed higher levels of distracted,
   impaired, and aggressive driving behaviors; driver inexperience; extreme
   fatigue; falling asleep behind the wheel; and inattention.}},

Abstract = {{Much of the prairie region in North America is characterized by
   relatively flat terrain with many depressions on the landscape. The
   hydrological response (runoff) is a combination of the conventional
   runoff from the contributing areas and the occasional overflow from the
   non-contributing areas (depressions). In this study, we promote the use
   of a hybrid modelling structure to predict runoff generation from
   prairie landscapes. More specifically, the Soil and Water Assessment
   Tool (SWAT) is fused with artificial neural networks (ANNs), so that
   SWAT and the ANN module deal with the contributing and non-contributing
   areas, respectively. A detailed experimental study is performed to
   select the best set of inputs, training algorithms and hidden neurons.
   The results obtained in this study suggest that the fusion of
   process-based and data-driven models can provide improved modelling
   capabilities for representing the highly nonlinear nature of the
   hydrological processes in prairie landscapes.}},

Title = {{Determining the stable isotope composition of pore water from saturated
   and unsaturated zone core: improvements to the direct vapour
   equilibration laser spectrometry method}},

Abstract = {{A method to measure the delta H-2 and delta O-18 composition of pore
   waters in saturated and unsaturated geologic core samples using direct
   vapour equilibration and laser spectrometry (DVE-LS) was first described
   in 2008, and has since been rapidly adopted. Here, we describe a number
   of important methodological improvements and limitations encountered in
   routine application of DVE-LS over several years. Generally, good
   comparative agreement, as well as accuracy, is obtained between core
   pore water isotopic data obtained using DVE-LS and that measured on
   water squeezed from the same core. In complex hydrogeologic settings,
   high-resolution DVE-LS depth profiles provide greater spatial resolution
   of isotopic profiles compared to long-screened or nested piezometers.
   When fluid is used during drilling and coring (e.g. water rotary or wet
   sonic drill methods), spiking the drill fluid with H-2 can be conducted
   to identify core contamination. DVE-LS analyses yield accurate
   formational isotopic data for fine-textured core (e.g. clay, shale)
   samples, but are less effective for cores obtained from saturated
   permeable (e.g. sand, gravels) geologic media or on chip samples that
   are easily contaminated by wet rotary drilling fluid. Data obtained from
   DVE-LS analyses of core samples collected using wet (contamination by
   drill water) and dry sonic (water loss by heating) methods were also
   problematic. Accurate DVE-LS results can be obtained on core samples
   with gravimetric water contents >5\% by increasing the sample size
   tested. Inexpensive Ziploc T gassampling bags were determined to be as
   good as, if not better than, other, more expensive specialty bags.
   Sample storage in sample bags provides acceptable results for up to 10
   days of storage; however, measurable water loss, as well as evaporitic
   isotopic enrichment, occurs for samples stored for up to 6 months. With
   appropriate care taken during sample collection and storage, the DVE-LS
   approach for obtaining high-resolution pore water isotopic data is a
   promising alternative to study the hydrogeology of saturated and
   unsaturated sediments. Eliminating analytical interferences from
   volatile organics remains a challenge.}},

Title = {{Axiomatic design theory: further notes and its guideline to applications}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS \& PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{359-374}},
Abstract = {{Axiomatic design theory (ADT) is a theory primarily based on two axioms
   and they are supposed to guide into a design that is sound. The ADT was
   developed around the 80s and 90s at MIT led by Num P. Suh. Since then,
   there have been many developments with ADT in literature, including
   guidelines for applying ADT to practical design or decision-making
   problems. Along with the ADT and its exciting developments, there has
   also been some confusion presented in the ADT literature, which hinders
   the effective application of ADT. This paper attempts to clarify ADT
   with an aim to remove the confusion, which is conducive to a further
   development of ADT. The contribution of this paper also lies in the
   provision of guidelines to apply ADT to practical design or
   decision-making problems. Finally, the paper generalises the first axiom
   to a more general one, suitable to general problem solving in the field
   of decision science.}},

Abstract = {{CMAM30 is a 30-year data set extending from 1979 to 2010 that is
   generated using a version of the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM)
   in which the winds and temperatures are relaxed to the Interim
   Reanalysis product from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
   Forecasts (ERA-Interim). The data set has dynamical fields that are very
   close to the reanalysis below 1 hPa and chemical tracers that are
   self-consistent with respect to the model winds and temperature. The
   chemical tracers are expected to be close to actual observations. The
   data set is here compared to two satellite records - the Atmospheric
   Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer and the Odin Optical
   Spectrograph and Infrared Imaging System - for the purpose of validating
   the temperature, ozone, water vapour and methane fields. Data from the
   Aura microwave limb sounder are also used for validation of the chemical
   processing in the polar vortex. It is found that the CMAM30 temperature
   is warmer by up to 5K in the stratosphere, with a low bias in the
   mesosphere of similar to 5-15 K. Ozone is reasonable (+/- 15 \%), except
   near the tropopause globally and in the Southern Hemisphere winter polar
   vortex. Water vapour is consistently low by 10-20 \%, with corresponding
   high methane of 10-20 \%, except in the Southern Hemisphere polar
   vortex. Discrepancies in this region are shown to stem from the
   treatment of polar stratospheric cloud formation in the model.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate annotation of protein functions plays a significant role in
   understanding life at the molecular level. With accumulation of
   sequenced genomes, the gap between available sequence data and their
   functional annotations has been widening. Many computational methods
   have been proposed to predict protein function from protein-protein
   interaction (PPI) networks. However, the precision of function
   prediction still needs to be improved. Taking into account the dynamic
   nature of PPIs, we construct a dynamic protein interactome network by
   integrating PPI network and gene expression data. To reduce the negative
   effect of false positive and false negative on the protein function
   prediction, we predict and generate some new protein interactions
   combing with proteins' domain information and protein complex
   information and weight all interactions. Based on the weighted dynamic
   network, we propose a method for predicting protein functions, named
   PDN. After traversing all the different dynamic networks, a set of
   candidate neighbors is formed. Then functions derived from the set of
   candidates are scored and sorted, according to the weighted degree of
   candidate proteins. Experimental results on four different yeast PPI
   networks indicate that the accuracy of PDN is 18\% higher than other
   competing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced thermoelectric and electrical transport properties of
   Mg2Si-based thermoelectric materials have been achieved by multi-doping
   with Sb, Al and Zn. Results on the investigation of the electrical
   transport and thermoelectric properties of multi-doped samples prepared
   using the spark plasma sintering technique are reported. Synchrotron
   radiation powder X-ray diffraction was used to characterize the
   structures of the doped samples. The electrical transport properties
   were determined from mid-infrared reflectivities, Hall effect and
   conventional quasi-four probe conductivity measurements. Using the
   electron concentrations (N) determined from the Hall coefficients, the
   effective masses (m{*}) were calculated from the frequency of the plasma
   edge (omega(P)) of the infrared reflectivities. The thermoelectric
   performance and thermoelectric figure of merits (ZT) in the temperature
   range of 300 K to 900 K of the doped Mg2Si compounds were calculated
   from the measured temperature dependent electrical conductivity (s),
   Seebeck coefficient (S), and thermal conductivity (k). A maximum ZT of
   0.964 was found for Sb0.5\% Zn0.5\% doped Mg2Si at 880 K. This value is
   comparable to those of PbTe based thermoelectric materials.}},

Journal = {{PROTEIN AND PEPTIDE LETTERS}},

Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{983-991}},
Abstract = {{Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has emerged as a major technology for
   peptide sequencing. Typically, there are three kinds of methods for the
   peptide sequencing: database searching, peptide tagging, and de novo
   sequencing. De novo sequencing has drawn increasing attention because of
   its independence from existing protein databases and potential for
   identifying new proteins, proteins resulting from mutations, proteins
   with unexpected modifications and so on. Recently, with the improvements
   in the accuracy of MS/MS and development of alternative fragmentation
   modes of MS/MS, many new de novo sequencing methods have been
   formulated. This paper reviews these recently developed sequencing
   methods including those for alternative MS/MS spectra. The paper first
   introduces background knowledge on peptide sequencing and mass
   spectrometry, and then reviews de novo peptide sequencing methods for
   traditional CID spectra. After that, it focuses on the recent
   development of de novo methods for alternative MS/MS spectra. In
   addition, methods using multiple spectra from the same peptide are
   surveyed. Finally, conclusions and some directions of future work are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature regarding
   the modeling and control of piezoelectric inertia-friction actuators
   (PIFAs). Examples of PIFAs are impact drive mechanisms (IDMs) and
   friction-driving actuators (FDAs). In this paper, the critical
   challenges are first identified in modeling and control of PIFAs.
   Second, a general architecture of PIFAs is proposed to facilitate the
   analysis and classification of the literature regarding modeling and
   control of PIFAs. This general architecture covers all types of PIFAs
   (e.g., FDAs, IDMs) and thus serves as a general conceptual model of
   PIFAs. There is an additional benefit with this general architecture of
   PIFAs, namely that it is conducive to innovation in PIFAs, as new
   specific PIFAs may be designed in order to tailor to a specific
   application (for example, both FDAs and IDMs are viewed as specific
   PIFAs). Finally, the paper presents future directions in modeling and
   control for further improvement of the performance of PIFAs.}},

Title = {{Indirect Estimations of Lentil Leaf and Plant N by SPAD Chlorophyll
   Meter}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{A Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) chlorophyll meter can be used
   to screen for leaf nitrogen (N) concentration in breeding programs.
   Lentil (Lens culinaris L.) cultivars were grown under varied N regimes,
   SPAD chlorophyll meter readings (SCMR) were recorded from the cultivars
   leaves, and leaf N concentration was measured by combustion. Linear
   regression and the nonlinear Radial Basis Functions (RBF) neural
   networks models were employed to estimate leaf N concentration (LNC)
   based on the SCMR values. The closest estimates of LNC were obtained
   from the multivariate models in which the combination of plant age, leaf
   thickness, and SCMR was employed as the independent variable. In
   comparison, SCMR as the single independent variable in both models
   estimated less than 50\% of LNC variations. The results showed
   significant effects of soil moisture and plant age on the association of
   LNC-SCMR as well as the relationship of LNC with plant N, grain yield,
   and days to maturity. However, the effect of cultivar on the measured
   variables was negligible. Although lentil N can be diagnosed by
   comparing SCMR values of the crop with those from a well-fertilized (N
   fixing) plot, the results did not support using SPAD chlorophyll meter
   for screening lentil LNC.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1076-1090}},
Abstract = {{This study assesses the hypothesis of incomplete similarity for a plane
   turbulent wall jet on smooth and transitionally rough surfaces.
   Typically, a wall jet is considered to consist of two regions: an inner
   layer and an outer layer. The degree to which these two regions reach
   equilibrium with each other and interact to produce the property of
   self-similarity remains an open question. In this study, the analysis of
   the outer and inner regions indicates that each region is characterised
   by a half-width which exhibits its own distinct dependence on the
   streamwise distance x from the slot, and a single self-similar structure
   for both regions does not exist. More specifically, the inner and outer
   layers of the wall jet exhibit different scaling laws, which results in
   two self-similar mean velocity profiles, both of which retain a
   dependence on the slot height H. As such, incomplete similarity of the
   wall jet on smooth and transitionally rough surfaces is confirmed by
   this study. In addition, comparison of the experimental results for the
   transitionally rough surface with the smooth wall case indicates that
   the surface roughness modifies the development of the mean velocity
   profile in both the inner and outer regions, although the effect on the
   outer region is relatively small and close to the experimental
   uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{According to Karl Popper assumptions are statements used to construct
   theories. During the construction of a theory whether the assumptions
   are either true or false turn out to be irrelevant in view of the fact
   that, actually, they gain their scientific value when the deductions
   derived from them suffice to explain observations. Science is enriched
   with assumptions of all kinds and physics is not exempted. Beyond doubt,
   some assumptions have been greatly beneficial for physics. They are
   usually embraced based on the kind of problems expected to be solved in
   a given moment of a science. Some have been quite useful and some others
   are discarded in a given moment and reconsidered in a later one. An
   illustrative example of this is the conception of light; first,
   according to Newton, as particle; then, according to Huygens, as wave;
   and then, again, according to Einstein, as particle. Likewise, once,
   according to Newton, a preferred system of reference (PSR) was assumed;
   then, according to Einstein, rejected; and then, here the assumption is
   reconsidered. It is claimed that the assumption that there is no PSR can
   be fundamentally wrong.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery that the Universe is accelerating in its expansion has
   brought the basic concept of cosmic expansion into question. An analysis
   of the evolution of this concept suggests that the paradigm that was
   finally settled into prior to that discovery was not the best option, as
   the observed acceleration lends empirical support to an alternative
   which could incidentally explain expansion in general. I suggest, then,
   that incomplete reasoning regarding the nature of cosmic time in the
   derivation of the standard model is the reason why the theory cannot
   coincide with this alternative concept. Therefore, through an
   investigation of the theoretical and empirical facts surrounding the
   nature of cosmic time, I argue that an enduring three-dimensional cosmic
   present must necessarily be assumed in relativistic cosmology-and in a
   stricter sense than it has been. Finally, I point to a related result
   which could offer a better explanation of the empirically constrained
   expansion rate.}},

   SYSTEMS}},
Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},

Volume = {{58}},

Pages = {{947-958}},
Abstract = {{Due to the energy-intensive nature of sprinkler irrigation and limited
   availability of conventional energy resources, viable alternative energy
   sources are becoming increasingly important. The use of solar
   photovoltaic (PV) technology in irrigated agriculture is particularly
   appealing because of the mutual dependence of crop evapotranspiration
   and potential energy production on incoming solar radiation. However,
   successful implementation of a PV irrigation system depends on
   appropriately sizing the PV system components (solar panel array,
   battery capacity, etc.) under highly variable and site-specific
   influencing factors, which include the inter-annual variability of the
   local climate, the crop water requirement, the soil water holding
   capacity of the field, the irrigation management practice, and the
   capacity of the irrigation system itself. The objective of this research
   was to develop a model for assessing the reliability of a PV-powered
   center-pivot irrigation system. A numerical simulation tool was
   developed by combining sub-models of the solar power production, battery
   storage, and irrigation system power requirement, which can be used to
   evaluate the system performance under variable operating and
   meteorological conditions. Given the required input variables, the model
   determines the reliability of the PV system by analyzing the time of
   irrigation for which the power both produced by the PV array and stored
   in the batteries is sufficient to fulfill the load demands. The model
   was validated by comparing the simulated results to field measurements
   of a small (1.4 ha) solar-powered center-pivot irrigation system
   installed near Outlook, Saskatchewan, Canada. The utility of the model
   was demonstrated by simulating the system performance over five years.
   It was shown that a PV system that has a reliability of greater than
   90\% is required to avoid moisture stress during dry years for the
   selected irrigation management strategy. It was further demonstrated how
   the model may be used to explore different combinations of PV sizing for
   achieving the desired reliability. This modeling approach is presented
   as an effective tool to ensure the technical feasibility of a PV
   irrigation system before the system is built.}},

Abstract = {{Over glaciers in the outer tropics, during the dry winter season,
   turbulent fluxes are an important sink of melt energy due to high
   sublimation rates, but measurements in stable surface layers in remote
   and complex terrains remain challenging. Eddy-covariance (EC) and
   bulk-aerodynamic (BA) methods were used to estimate surface turbulent
   heat fluxes of sensible (H) and latent heat (LE) in the ablation zone of
   the tropical Zongo Glacier, Bolivia (16 degrees S, 5080ma:s.l.), from 22
   July to 1 September 2007. We studied the turbulent fluxes and their
   associated random and systematic measurement errors under the three most
   frequent wind regimes. For nightly, density-driven katabatic flows, and
   for strong downslope flows related to large-scale forcing, H generally
   heats the surface (i.e. is positive), while LE cools it down (i.e. is
   negative). On average, both fluxes exhibit similar magnitudes and cancel
   each other out. Most energy losses through turbulence occur for daytime
   upslope flows, when H is weak due to small temperature gradients and LE
   is strongly negative due to very dry air. Mean random errors of the BA
   method (6\% on net H + LE fluxes) originated mainly from large
   uncertainties in roughness lengths. For EC fluxes, mean random errors
   were due mainly to poor statistical sampling of large-scale outer-layer
   eddies (12 \%). The BA method is highly sensitive to the method used to
   derive surface temperature from longwave radiation measurements and
   underestimates fluxes due to vertical flux divergence at low heights and
   nonstationarity of turbulent flow. The EC method also probably
   underestimates the fluxes, albeit to a lesser extent, due to
   underestimation of vertical wind speed and to vertical flux divergence.
   For both methods, when H and L E compensate each other in downslope
   fluxes, biases tend to cancel each other out or remain small. When the
   net turbulent fluxes (H + LE) are the largest in upslope flows,
   nonstationarity effects and underestimations of the vertical wind speed
   do not compensate, and surface temperature errors are important, so that
   large biases on H + LE are expected when using both the EC and the BA
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by the convoluted solutions for two intersecting M2 branes in
   eleven-dimensional supergravity, in which one brane in the system is
   completely localized along the overall and relative transverse
   coordinates while the other brane in the system is localized only along
   the overall transverse coordinates, we construct two classes of exact
   solutions to Einstein-Maxwell theory in six and higher dimensions. We
   show that the membrane configuration preserves four supersymmetries and
   upon dimensional reduction, the solutions provide intersecting
   configurations of three D-branes in type IIA supergravity. Moreover, we
   show that the metric functions in six and higher dimensions can be
   written as convolution-like integrals of two special functions. The
   solutions are regular everywhere and show a bolt structure on a single
   point in any dimensionality. Also, we find the exact nonstationary
   solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell theory with positive cosmological
   constant. We show that the cosmological solutions are expanding patches
   in asymptotically de Sitter spacetime.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of multi wall carbon nanotubes (CNT) on the thermoelectric
   properties of Mg2Si0.877Ge0.1Bi0.023 was examined. While introducing
   CNTs increases the electrical conductivity from around 450 Omega(-1)
   cm(-1) to 500 Omega(-1) cm(-1) at 323 K, the increase is neutralized at
   higher temperature, with the conductivity resulting to be 440
   Omega(-1)cm(-1)-470 Omega(-1)cm(-1) at 773 K. The Seebeck coefficient of
   all nanocomposites is enhanced at 773 K due to energy filtering that
   stems from the introduction of CNTs-Mg2Si0.877Ge0.1Bi0.023 interfaces.
   The combined effect of CNTs on Seebeck coefficient and electrical
   conductivity leads to an approximately 20\% power factor improvement,
   with the best sample reaching a maximum value of 19 RW cm(-1) K-2 at 773
   K. The lattice thermal conductivity of the nanocomposites is reduced due
   to the phonon scattering by nanodomains and grain boundaries,
   particularly at medium temperatures, resulting in a slight reduction in
   total thermal conductivity. According to high resolution transmission
   electron microscopy studies, bismuth is homogenously distributed within

Abstract = {{This paper lays the groundwork for the noninvasive acquisition of
   jugular venous pulse (JVP) waveforms, using accelerometer sensors to
   measure the vibrations of the jugular vein and the carotid artery. In
   the cardiac system, the vibrational signals quantify the pressure
   buildup in the blood vessels due to various hemodynamic events in the
   cardiac cycle. Accordingly, the accelerometer outputs are suitably
   amplified, filtered and digitized, so that an appropriate
   post-processing scheme can be applied to derive the corresponding JVP
   waveforms. The experimental results show that, even in a preliminary
   implementation, the JVP waveforms obtained using our proposed system
   exhibit promising consistency and accuracy, suitable for basic timing
   analyses of various cardiac parameters. It is anticipated that, with
   further development and optimization, our proposed system should offer a
   compelling alternative for clinical diagnoses and applications based on
   the JVP waveforms, potentially supplanting more complicated methods
   traditionally used to measure the JVP.}},

Abstract = {{Dedifferentiation and proliferation of endogenous cardiomyocytes in situ
   can effectively improve cardiac repair following myocardial infarction
   (MI). 6-Bromoindirubin-3- oxime (BIO) and insulin-like growth factor 1
   (IGF-1) are two potent factors that promote cardiomyocyte survival and
   proliferation. However, their delivery for sustained release in
   MI-affected areas has proved to be challenging. In the current research,
   we present a study on the sustained co-delivery of BIO and IGF-1 in a
   hybrid hydrogel system to simulate endogenous cardiac repair in an MI
   rat model. Both BIO and IGF-1 were efficiently encapsulated in gelatin
   nanoparticles, which were later cross-linked with the oxidized alginate
   to form a novel hybrid hydrogel system. The in vivo results indicated
   that the hybrid system could enhance the proliferation of cardiomyocytes
   in situ and could promote revascularization around the MI sites,
   allowing improved cardiac function. Taken together, we concluded that
   the hybrid hydrogel system can co-deliver BIO and IGF-1 to areas of MI
   and thus improve cardiac function by promoting the proliferation of
   cardiomyocytes and revascularization.}},

Abstract = {{It is now known that the structure and properties of a material can be
   significantly altered under extreme compression. In this work, a
   structural search was performed to investigate the phase stabilities and
   structures of SrH2n (n = 1-5) in the pressure range of 50-300 GPa. The
   high-pressure polymorphs reveal a variety of hydrogen structural units
   ranging from monatomic hydride to linear and bent H-3 and spiral polymer
   chains. A novel graphene like H-layer structure was found to exist in
   SrH10 at 300 GPa. The structural diversity in the predicted high
   pressure structures provides an opportunity for an in-depth analysis of
   the chemical bonding in the high pressure polyhydrides. It is shown from
   theoretical calculations that the electronegativity of molecular
   hydrogen is similar to that of group 13 and 14 elements. This resulted
   in electrons being transferred from Sr to the hydrogen molecules. Thus,
   a consideration of the number of valence electrons available from Sr
   that can be shared among the H-2 serves as a useful guide to rationalize
   the structures of the H-moieties. An alternative description of the high
   pressure structures differing from a previous study is presented here.}},

Abstract = {{Organic materials display promise in numerous electronic applications,
   complimentary to traditional semi-conducting materials.
   Cyclolinopeptides show promise in light-emitting applications as an
   organic semiconductor. Photoluminescence measurements indicate charge
   transfer between the peptide and the metal, resulting in an increase in
   intensity of the emission from around the metal in the Cyclolinopeptide
   complex. Complementary X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES)
   shows a change in occupation of energy states in the peptide when
   complexed with the metal, indicating charge transfer, but peak positions
   show the peptide is not chemically changed by the metal. Combining X-ray
   emission and XANES provides element specific partial density of states,
   to estimate the element specific energy gap which is the proposed
   emission range for the peptide material. Organic light emitting diode
   devices have been fabricated, although no measurable emission has been
   seen as of yet. The devices have diode like current-voltage
   characteristics showing the peptide is semi-conducting with a threshold
   voltage of approximately 2.5 V.}},

   The ZnO and CaF2 show independent emission. The ZnO bandgap emission at

Abstract = {{The search for new candidate semiconductors with direct band gaps of
   similar to 1.4 eV has attracted significant attention, especially among
   the two-dimensional (2D) materials, which have become potential
   candidates for next-generation optoelectronics. Herein, we
   systematically studied 2D Bx/2Nx/2C1-x (0 < x < 1) compounds in
   particular focus on the four stoichiometric Bx/2Nx/2C1-x (x = 2/3, 1/2,
   2/5 and 1/3) using a recently developed global optimization method
   (CALYPSO) in conjunction with density functional theory. Furthermore, we
   examine more stoichiometries by the cluster expansion technique based on
   a hexagonal lattice. The results reveal that all monolayer Bx/2Nx/2C1-x
   stoichiometries adopt a planar honeycomb character and are dynamically
   stable. Remarkably, electronic structural calculations show that most of
   Bx/2Nx/2C1-x phases possess direct band gaps within the optical range,
   thereby they can potentially be used in high-efficiency conversion of
   solar energy to electric power, as well as in p-n junction photovoltaic
   modules. The present results also show that the band gaps of
   Bx/2Nx/2C1-x can be widely tuned within the optical range by changing
   the concentration of carbon, thus allowing the fast development of band
   gap engineered materials in optoelectronics. These new findings may
   enable new approaches to the design of microelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, an experimental work reported a very high T-c of similar to
   190 K in hydrogen sulphide (H2S) at 200 GPa. The search for new
   superconductors with high superconducting critical temperatures in
   hydrogen-dominated materials has attracted significant attention. Here
   we predict a candidate phase of MgH6 with a sodalite-like framework in
   conjunction with first-principles electronic structure calculations. The
   calculated formation enthalpy suggests that it is thermodynamically
   stable above 263 GPa relative to MgH2 and solid hydrogen (H-2).
   Moreover, the absence of imaginary frequency in phonon calculations
   implies that this MgH6 structure is dynamically stable. Furthermore, our
   electron-phonon coupling calculation based on BCS theory indicates that
   this MgH6 phase is a conventional superconductor with a high
   superconducting critical temperature of similar to 260 K under high
   pressure, which is even higher than that of the recently reported
   compressed H2S. The present results offer insight in understanding and
   designing new high-temperature superconductors.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{901-924}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, large eddy simulation (LES) of a three-dimensional
   turbulent lid-driven cavity (LDC) flow at Re = 10,000 has been performed
   using the multiple relaxation time lattice Boltzmann method. A
   Smagorinsky eddy viscosity model was used to represent the sub-grid
   scale stresses with appropriate wall damping. The prediction for the
   flow field was first validated by comparing the velocity profiles with
   previous experimental and LES studies, and then subsequently used to
   investigate the largescale three-dimensional vortical structures in the
   LDC flow. The instantaneous three-dimensional coherent structures inside
   the cavity were visualised using the second invariant (Q), Delta
   criterion, lambda(2) criterion, swirling strength (lambda(ci)) and
   streamwise vorticity. The vortex structures obtained using the different
   criteria in general agree well with each other. However, a cleaner
   visualisation of the large vortex structures was achieved with the
   lambda(ci) criterion and also when the visualisation is based on the
   vortex identification criteria expressed in terms of the swirling
   strength parameters. A major objective of the study was to perform a
   three-dimensional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) on the
   fluctuating velocity fields. The higher energy POD modes efficiently
   extracted the large-scale vortical structures within the flow which were
   then visualised with the swirling strength criterion. Reconstruction of
   the instantaneous fluctuating velocity field using a finite number of
   POD modes indicated that the large-scale vortex structures did
   effectively approximate the large-scale motion. However, such a reduced
   order reconstruction of the flow based on the large-scale vortical
   structures was clearly not as effective in predicting the small-scale
   details of the fluctuating velocity field which relate to the turbulent
   transport.}},

Title = {{?Color Enhancement in Endoscopic Images Using Adaptive Sigmoid Function
   and Space Variant Color Reproduction}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Modern endoscopes play an important role in diagnosing various
   gastrointestinal (GI) tract related diseases. The improved visual
   quality of endoscopic images can provide better diagnosis. This paper
   presents an efficient color image enhancement method for endoscopic
   images. It is achieved in two stages: image enhancement at gray level
   followed by space variant chrominance mapping color reproduction. Image
   enhancement is achieved by performing adaptive sigmoid function and
   uniform distribution of sigmoid pixels. Secondly, a space variant
   chrominance mapping color reproduction is used to generate new
   chrominance components. The proposed method is used on low contrast
   color white light images (WLI) to enhance and highlight the vascular and
   mucosa structures of the GI tract. The method is also used to colorize
   grayscale narrow band images (NBI) and video frames. The focus value and
   color enhancement factor show that the enhancement level in the
   processed image is greatly increased compared to the original endoscopic
   image. The overall contrast level of the processed image is higher than
   the original image. The color similarity test has proved that the
   proposed method does not add any additional color which is not present
   in the original image. The algorithm has low complexity with an
   execution speed faster than other related methods.}},

   and phonon calculations affirm the thermodynamic stability of the
   high-pressure polymorphs. Significantly, both high pressure phases (C2/m
   and Pmmn) were found to be superconducting with a maximum critical
   temperature close to 30 K at 150 GPa. The present results provide a

Abstract = {{High speed rolling is recognized as the process that can produce sheets
   of magnesium alloys having RD-split basal texture without or with
   minimum preheating. However, the mechanism of the texture formation
   during high speed rolling has not been fully clarified yet. In this
   study, conventional AZ31 and a rare earth - yttrium added alloy, WE43
   were rolled with high rolling speed. The specimens having different
   textures were prepared by changing the cutting geometry to initially
   textured sheets. It is seen that the crack, microstructure and texture
   formations are strongly influenced by the initial textures in AZ31.
   These features are strongly related to the extension twinning,
   \{10-12\}<-1011>. In the case of WE43, cracks are formed more often than
   in AZ31, despite of the weak initial textures. It is proposed that the
   activities of the contraction and double twinning systems give more
   chance of stress concentration, resulting in the narrow shear banding
   and subsequent cracking. In addition to the experimental analysis,
   results of the numerical simulation using VPSC model are also used to
   discuss the texture formation mechanism.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA MINING AND BIOINFORMATICS}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{24-43}},
Abstract = {{Most computational methods for identifying essential proteins focus on
   the topological centrality of protein-protein interaction (PPI)
   networks. However, these methods have limitations, such as the
   difficulty for identifying essential proteins with low centrality values
   and the poor performance for incomplete PPI network. In this paper,
   protein complex is proven to be an important factor for determining
   protein essentiality and a new centrality measure, complex centrality,
   is proposed. The weighted average of complex centrality and subgraph
   centrality, called harmonic centrality (HC), is proposed to predict
   essential proteins. It combines PPI network topology and protein complex
   information and has better performance than methods based on PPI
   network. The improvement is higher when the PPI network is incomplete.
   Furthermore, a weighted PPI network is generated by integrating cellular
   localisation and biological process to a PPI network. The performance of
   HC measure is improved 5\% in this weighted PPI network.}},

Abstract = {{Compaction and pelletization processes increase the bulk density and
   energy density of biomass, making it easy to handle, transport, and
   utilize. Abundant amounts of wheat straw biomass are produced every
   year. This article presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) study to
   compare five different pretreatment methods during wheat straw
   pelletization. The system boundary was defined from a wheat straw bale
   (from field production) to transporting pellets to the customer. Steam
   explosion (SE), microwave alkaline (MA), binder addition (BD), radio
   frequency alkaline (RF), and torrefaction (TF) as well as no
   pretreatment (base case) are potential pretreatment methods prior to
   pelletization. SimaPro software incorporating the Ecoinvent database and
   literature data were used to conduct this LCA study. The environmental
   impact of each pretreatment method was evaluated in terms of global
   warming potential, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, marine
   aquatic ecotoxicity, ozone layer depletion, abiotic depletion,
   freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation, terrestrial
   ecotoxicity, and non-renewable energy use. The results revealed that TF
   and BD, especially involving the addition of wood residue, had lower
   environmental impacts compared to the other pretreatment methods
   including the base case. The SE and RF pretreatment methods had more
   negative environmental impacts compared to the other pretreatment
   methods including the base case. All pretreatment options except SE can
   reduce the global warming potential and human toxicity. A densification
   system involving BD, TF, and MA can conserve non-renewable energy
   resources compared to the other pretreatment options.}},

   Using Weighted Centroid Algorithm}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Video Capsule Endoscope (VCE) sends images of abnormalities in the
   gastrointestinal (GI) tract. While the physicians receive these images,
   they have little idea of their exact location which is needed for proper
   treatment. The proposed localization system consists of a 3D antenna
   array (with 8 receiver sensors) and one transmitter embedded inside the
   electronic capsule. We propose an adaptive linearized method of
   localization using Weighted Centroid Localization (WCL) where the
   position is calculated by averaging the weighted sum of the reference
   positions. In our proposed system, first we identify the path loss
   attenuation exponents using linear least square regression of the
   collected data (RSSI versus distance). Then the path loss model is
   linearized to minimize the path loss deviation which is mainly caused
   due to the nonhomogeneous environment of radio propagation. Then the
   instantaneous path loss (PL) measured by the sensors is attenuated to
   the above linearized model and considered as the weight of the sensors
   to find the location of the capsule using WCL. Finally a calibration
   process is applied using linear least square regression. To assess the
   performance, we model the path loss and implement the algorithm in
   Matlab for 2,530 possible positions with a resolution of 1 mm. The
   results show that the algorithm achieves high localization accuracy
   compared with other related methods when simulated using a 3D small
   intestine model.}},

Title = {{Ion temperature anisotropy effects on the dispersion relation and

   ion-acoustic instability with applications to the collisional
   high-latitude F-region}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Plasma instabilities play a important role in producing small-scale
   irregularities in the ionosphere. In particular, current-driven
   electrostatic ion-acoustic (CDEIA) instabilities contribute to
   high-latitude F-region electrodynamics. Ion temperature anisotropies
   with enhanced perpendicular temperature often exist in the high-latitude
   F-region. In addition to temperature anisotropies, ion velocity shears
   are observed near auroral arc edges, sometimes coexisting with thermal
   ion upflow processes and field-aligned currents (FAC). We investigated
   whether ion temperature anisotropy lowers the threshold conditions
   required for the onset of sheared CDEIA instabilities. We generalised a
   dispersion relation to include ion thermal anisotropy, finite Larmor
   radius corrections and collisions. We derived new fluid-like analytical
   expressions for the threshold conditions required for instability that
   depend explicitly on ion temperature anisotropy. We studied how the
   instability threshold conditions vary as a function of the wave vector
   direction in both fluid and kinetic regimes. We found that, despite the
   dampening effect of collisions on ion-acoustic waves, ion temperature
   anisotropy lowers in some cases the threshold drift requirements for a
   large range of oblique wave vector angles. More importantly, realistic
   ion temperature anisotropies contribute to reducing the instability
   threshold velocity shears that are associated with small drift
   thresholds, for modes propagating almost perpendicularly to the
   geomagnetic field. Small shear thresholds that seem to be sustainable in
   the ionospheric F-region are obtained for low-frequency waves. Such
   instabilities could play a role in the direct generation of
   field-aligned irregularities in the collisional F-region that could be
   observed with the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) array of
   high-frequency radars. These modes would be very sensitive to the radar
   probing direction since they are restricted to very narrow angular
   intervals. The ion temperature anisotropy is an important parameter that
   needs to be considered in the studies of sheared and collisional CDEIA
   waves and instabilities in the high-latitude F-region.}},

Title = {{COMPARISON OF GREENHOUSE DEHUMIDIFICATION STRATEGIES IN COLD REGIONS}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{133-142}},
Abstract = {{Two dehumidification methods, including air-to-air heat exchangers and
   mechanical refrigeration dehumidifiers, were compared with
   dehumidification using a conventional exhaust ventilation system. The
   comparisons included capital cost, operating cost, durability, ease of
   installation and maintenance, and effectiveness for different seasons of
   the year. The heat exchangers were more effective for moisture control
   during cold and mild seasons than during humid and warm periods, while
   the dehumidifiers were effective in controlling the indoor moisture
   year-round due to their independence from outside air conditions. While
   the dehumidifiers consumed the highest amount of electrical energy thus
   resulting in the highest cost, they consumed the lowest amount of total
   energy, defined as the sum of the electrical energy consumption and the
   resultant heat loss from the greenhouse due to dehumidification.
   Although the heat exchanger method consumed approximately 81\% of the
   total energy consumed by the exhaust fan dehumidification system due to
   the sensible heat recovered from the exhaust air, the total costs of the
   two methods were similar due to the lower electrical energy consumption
   by the latter. Considering a 10-year payback period, dehumidification by
   the exhaust fan system was the most cost-effective method with the
   lowest capital and maintenance cost. However, it is only effective
   during cold and mild seasons, and not during warm weather conditions.
   Mechanical refrigeration is recommended for summer dehumidification, and
   both methods could be used during different seasons to achieve good
   moisture control year-round. After the application of dehumidification,
   the crop loss rate was reduced by 1.6\% to 2.5\%, which led to an annual
   revenue increase of \$3,000 per year. Although the average
   dehumidification cost was approximately 10\% of the annual heating cost
   of the greenhouse, when considering the reduced crop loss and yield
   increase, dehumidification is strongly recommended.}},

   deals with the esterification of DHA-rich fatty acids with glycerol. The
   reaction has been carried out in biphasic solvent system using
   immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL-B) to synthesize glyceride
   mixture enriched with DHA. The most suitable reaction conditions for
   esterification of DHA-rich fatty acids with glycerol using immobilized
   CAL-B were found to be 0.49 g fatty acid mixture with 46mg glycerol, 3mL
   solvent, 26 mu L buffer, 200mg molecular sieves, 7.0 pH, 50 degrees C
   temperature, 300 rpm agitation speed, and 50 mg enzyme amount. In 120 h,
   esterification of 75.4\% was obtained with 30\% triglyceride, 16.1\%
   diglyceride, and 29.3\% monoglyceride in the glyceride mixture. DHA

Journal = {{MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},

Pages = {{15-28}},
Abstract = {{The micro stick-slip motion systems, such as piezoelectric stick-slip
   actuators (PE-SSAs), can provide high resolution motions yet with a long
   motion range. In these systems, friction force plays an active role.
   Although numerous friction models have been developed for the control of
   micro motion systems, behaviors of these models in micro stick-slip
   motion systems are not well understood. This study (1) gives a survey of
   the basic friction models and (2) tests and compares 5 friction models
   in the literature, including Coulomb friction model, Stribeck friction
   model, Dahl model, LuGre model, and the elastoplastic friction model on
   the same test-bed (i.e. the PE-SSA system). The experiments and
   simulations were done and the reasons for the difference in the
   performance of these models were investigated. The study concluded that
   for the micro stick-slip motion system, (1) Stribeck model, Dahl model
   and LuGre model all work, but LuGre model has the best accuracy and (2)
   Coulomb friction model and the elastoplastic model does not work. The
   study provides contributions to motion control systems with friction,

Abstract = {{The DCT and the DWT are used in a number of emerging DSP applications,
   such as, HD video compression, biomedical imaging, and smart antenna
   beamformers for wireless communications and radar. Of late, there has
   been much interest on fast algorithms for the computation of the above
   transforms using multiplier-free approximations because they result in
   low power and low complexity systems. Approximate methods rely on the
   trade-off of accuracy for lower power and/or circuit
   complexity/chip-area. This paper provides a detailed review of VLSI
   architectures and CAS implementations for both DC T/DWTs, which can be
   designed either for higher-accuracy or for low-power consumption. This
   article covers both recent theoretical advancements on discrete
   transforms in addition to an overview of existing VLSI architectures.
   The paper also discusses error free VLSI architectures that provides
   high accuracy systems and approximate architectures that offer high
   computational gain making them highly attractive for real-world
   applications that are subject to constraints in both chip-area as well
   as power. The methods discussed in the paper can be used in the design
   of emerging low-power digital systems having lowest complexity at the
   cost of a loss in accuracy-the optimal trade-off of computational
   accuracy for lowest possible complexity and power. A complete synopsis
   of available techniques, algorithms and FPGA/VLSI realizations are
   discussed in the paper.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{202}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics of microbial inhibitors
   generated by the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of hemicellulose were
   investigated using activated carbon as the adsorbent. Parameters of
   temperature (25-65 degrees C) and pH (1.0-10.0) were employed to study
   the adsorption isotherms of phenol, acetic acid, and furfural. The
   results based on the Langmuir model indicated that a higher efficiency
   of adsorption could be achieved at a lower pH and lower temperature for
   phenol and acetic acid. Furfural removal from the aqueous solution was
   only dependent on temperature, with a higher performance at 25 degrees
   C. Negative values obtained for the heat of adsorption (Delta H),
   entropy (Delta S), and free energy (Delta G) indicated that the
   adsorption of all three components is exothermic (physisorption) in
   nature, with a mechanism based on the affinity of the solute toward the
   adsorbent and non-spontaneous. The adsorptive removal of the main
   inhibitors (8.7 g/L phenols and 4.2 g/L acetic acid) from the
   concentrated hydrolysate of oat hull hemicellulose was dependent on the
   activated carbon dosage, temperature, and pH. Under operational
   conditions of pH 1.0 and 25 degrees C with an incremental carbon dosage
   of 1.25- 5\% in the hydrolysate, the removal of phenols was 64-95.4\%
   and that of acetic acid was 6-13.2\%, respectively. The xylitol
   fermentation process indicated that oat hull hemicellulosic hydrolysate
   is low in toxicity to Candida guilliermondii. Meanwhile, a mild
   adsorptive detoxification using activated carbon resulted in over 10\%
   increase in xylitol yield (approximate to 0.8 g/g) and productivity (0.5
   g/L/h).}},

Abstract = {{Graphene can be p-type or n-type doped by introduction of specific

Abstract = {{For the purpose of designing an automatic repeated batch ethanol
   fermentation process, a self-settlement feature of flocculating yeast
   was used along with the development of a relevant kinetic model to
   describe such an operation. The frequency of repeated batch operation
   was controlled by the measured fermentation redox potential. As the
   redox potential profile changed its slope from zero or from negative to
   positive, repeated operation was triggered. The ethanol productivity
   varied between 3.261 +/- 0.22 and 6.72 +/- 0.24 g/L h for similar to 200
   g glucose/L case, and between 3.88 +/- 0.37 and 4.68 +/- 0.15 g/Lh for
   similar to 240 g glucose/L cases during the course of repeated batch
   fermentation. Although the biomass built up as fermentation proceeded,
   the yeast viability decreased, consequently limiting the number of batch
   operation that could be repeated. The number of repeated fermentation
   depended on the initial glucose concentration used. The proposed model
   predicted that the maximum repeatable batch operation when flocculating
   yeast was used was 14 and 8 for similar to 200 and similar to 240
   gglucose/L case, respectively. Although the biomass increased
   significantly comparing with single batch, the cell viability decreased
   along with the batch number. To overcome this problem, a partial removal
   of yeast during the repeated batch fermentation would extend the
   operation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To explore new stable polymeric nitrogen phases in alkali metal azides,
   the crystalline structures of potassium azide KN3, are systematically
   investigated up to 400 GPa by using unbiased structure searching methods
   combined with first principles density functional calculations. Two
   high-pressure phases of KN3, insulator C2/m phase with N3- anions and
   metallic P6/mmm phase with ``N-6{''} rings were uncovered above 20 GPa
   and 41 GPa, respectively, which are consistent with recent theoretical
   works. Above 274 GPa, a stable C2/m-N phase featuring polymerized N is
   identified for the first time and it is energetically much superior to
   the previously proposed C2/m-II structure. This C2/m-N structure
   consists of zig-zag N polymer nets which can be naturally viewed as the
   polymerization of ``N-6{''} molecules rings in the low-pressure P6/mmm
   phase under increasing pressure. Furthermore, the structure evolutions
   and accompanied chemical bonding behavior of KN3 under pressure are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A copper-based metal organic framework (MOF-199) was synthesized by a
   hydrothermal method and was used to remove hydrogen sulfide, ethyl
   mercaptan, and dimethyl sulfide. Characterizations of the samples before
   and after desulfurization were carried out by Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS). The adsorption performance of the prepared sample
   MOF-199 was evaluated by breakthrough experiments in a fixed-bed
   reactor. Heat treatment was carried out in nitrogen flow to activate the
   prepared MOFs. The optimum activation temperature was found to be 180
   degrees C. Evaluation results showed that the breakthrough capacity of
   MOF-199 for hydrogen sulfide removal increased with the working
   temperature, whereas the capacity for ethyl mercaptan and dimethyl
   sulfide removal decreased with the temperature. MOF-199 had the highest
   breakthrough sulfur capacity for dimethyl sulfide removal (8.48 g of
   sulfur/100 g of MOF-199). The color of the MOF changed during sulfur
   capture in all cases, indicating a change in the chemical environment of
   the copper metal site. Interactions between the unsaturated copper sites
   in MOFs and the sulfur compounds differed because of the steric effect.
   A strong interaction was apparent during adsorption of ethyl mercaptan
   and hydrogen sulfide, which resulted in the formation of various amounts
   of CuS and serious damage to the MOF structure. The relatively weak
   interaction with dimethyl sulfide originated from electrostatic force
   and a weak coordination effect, which led to easy recycling and recovery
   of MOF-199 by thermal regeneration at 180 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Realisation of Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB) for residential use cannot
   succeed without: minimising leakages, increasing thermal insulation and
   using reliable and energy efficient system solutions. However, very
   airtight houses may have a negative impact on thermal comfort and indoor
   air quality. Focussing on ventilation systems then becomes a
   requirement.
   In cold climates, temperature differences between indoor and outdoor air
   often exceed 40 C during winter. State-of-the-art heat recovery systems
   may not be able to handle these differences while providing proper air
   quality and preventing excessively dry indoor air.
   The present study of energy recovery systems focuses on apartment
   buildings located in cold climates countries using central air handling
   units. Heat exchangers recovering sensible heat are compared with energy
   exchangers with recovery of both sensible and latent heat. For the
   latter, both adjacent and nonadjacent solutions are considered.
   A specific net energy savings factor is developed taking into account
   the energy recovered, but also the pressure drops and the variation on
   the effectiveness of the fan given the installation of the heat/energy
   recovery.
   Heat exchangers are efficient and reliable.Recuperative heat exchangers
   normally imply no air quality problems, but have severe freezing
   problems. Regenerative heat exchangers encounter small freezing
   problems, but do not prevent transfer of odours from extract air to
   supply air. Regenerative energy exchangers provide an efficient heat and
   moisture exchange between exhaust and supply air flows, diminishing ice
   formation and the humidification requirement for indoor air. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In this work, hydroxyapatite (HA) was first dispersed into cyclic acetal
   unit based monomers (EHD), and then EHD/HA composites were obtained by
   in-situ photopolymerization. FTIR and XRD analyses were used to
   successfully confirm the chemical composition of this composite.
   Real-time FTIR revealed that there was no significant effect on the
   photopolymerization process until the HA content was up to 30\%. Several
   samples of such a composite with different loading amounts of HA were
   prepared to study effects of HA concentrations on the EHD/HA composite
   in particular in terms of SEM, TG, DMA, water contact angel and in-vitro
   biocompatibility. The results appeared that the loading of HA could
   significantly improve the thermal stability, mechanical properties and
   in vitro biocompatibility of the EHD/HA composite compared with EHD
   networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WIRELESS NETWORKS}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop and evaluate an adaptive self-configurable
   routing framework that can deal with dynamic nature of mobile ad hoc
   networks and provides quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for efficient
   video streaming. Proposed framework mainly consists of two major
   components. Firstly, it is a reactive bandwidth-aware node-disjoint
   multipath routing protocol which determines routes based on the
   specified bandwidth requirements of the requesting application. The
   second component of the framework is a session admission control (SAC)
   process that permits or denies a session to enter into the network based
   on the current availability of network bandwidth. We also propose
   methods to handle QoS violations caused by network mobility and
   congestion by keeping backup routes, performing local route recovery,
   avoiding routing through short-lived low quality links and periodic
   monitoring of the active transmission routes. To verify our proposed
   algorithms, the network with H.264/SVC encoded video traces which are
   generated from real-time video traffic is used for modeling the
   behaviour of the source nodes. It has been observed that reactively
   discovered and maintained routes on the basis of the most recent
   information about network topology and available resources can
   significantly improve the admission decision accuracy of SAC process, in
   turn improving the quality of received video traffic significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Background and scope: Nowadays, centrality analysis has become a
   principal method for identifying essential proteins in biological
   networks. Here we present CytoNCA, a Cytoscape plugin integrating
   calculation, evaluation and visualization analysis for multiple
   centrality measures.
   Implementation and performance: (i) CytoNCA supports eight different
   centrality measures and each can be applied to both weighted and
   unweighted biological networks. (ii) It allows users to upload
   biological information of both nodes and edges in the network, to
   integrate biological data with topological data to detect specific
   nodes. (iii) CytoNCA offers multiple potent visualization analysis
   modules, which generate various forms of output such as graph, table,
   and chart, and analyze associations among all measures. (iv) It can be
   utilized to quantitatively assess the calculation results, and evaluate
   the accuracy by statistical measures. (v) Besides current eight
   centrality measures, the biological characters from other sources could
   also be analyzed and assessed by CytoNCA. This makes CytoNCA an
   excellent tool for calculating centrality, evaluating and visualizing
   biological networks. Availability:

Abstract = {{This study focuses on pelletization of waste canola meal biomass to
   increase the bulk density, thereby reducing the transportation and
   storage costs, thus provide better material feeding in gasification
   reactors with less dust formation. The effects of feed constituents of
   canola meal such as protein, fiber, fat, lignin and feed moisture
   content as well as added binder, lubricant and densification process
   parameters on the strength and durability of the densified product are
   investigated. The increased durability (99\%) of canola meal pellets was
   a result of added binder (5 wt\%) and the inherent protein (40 wt\%) and
   lignin (12 wt\%) content in the feed. From the compression data at
   different temperature and pressure, Kawakita and Ludde model (1971) was
   developed to classify the feed material into groups. The R-2 value >=
   0.999 showed good model fit. It was found that at temperature >70
   degrees C, the particle undergoes rearrangement followed by
   fragmentation and particle plastic deformation during the compression
   process. The effects of coating agent on pellet durability, hardness and
   moisture uptake were studied to produce moisture. resistant pellets.
   Finally, the pellets were gasified in a fixed bed reactor using
   different gasifying agents such as steam, oxygen (O-2) and carbon
   dioxide (CO2) and their effects were assessed. Carbon dioxide was found
   to give maximum carbon efficiency (CE) up to 82.7\% and 50.7 MJ/m(3) LHV
   of gas at a temperature of 750 degrees C and equivalence ratio (ER) of
   0.4., whereas O-2 gave 66.5\% of CE with 44.7 MJ/m(3) LHV of gas at 650
   degrees C and 0.4 ER and steam produced gas with LHV 40.8 MJ/m(3) with
   CE 27.4\% at 650 degrees C and 0.2 ER. Thus, by producing
   moisture-resistant canola meal pellets with reasonable fuel
   characteristics, pelletization of canola meal provides a promising
   alternative for the utilization of canola meal waste as an alternative
   source of renewable energy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The reclamation of mature fine tailings (MFT) is a critical challenge
   for the oil sands industry in western Canada, and a nonradioactive,
   automated, and inexpensive method to monitor the MFT solidification is
   needed. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of a
   dual-probe heat pulse (DPHP) method to measure MFT solid percentage.
   Dual-probe heat pulse measurements were performed on three MFT samples,
   each at various solid percentages. A linear relationship (y = 0.9495x +
   0.0558) was established between the DPHP-measured solid percentage (y)
   and that of oven-dry method (x). Six additional MFT samples were
   collected and measured to validate the DPHP method. The specific heats
   of the six MFT solids were measured independently using a modulated
   differential scanning calorimetry method, and the sensitivity of
   DPHP-measured MFT solid percentage to the specific heat of MFT solids
   was evaluated. The result shows that the DPHP method can be used to
   accurately measure MFT solid percentages, and the accuracy can be
   further improved if the specific heat of the MFT solids is measured
   independently.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{221}},
Pages = {{77-87}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents a modular and programmable design of a next
   generation wireless capsule endoscopic system (WCES). The system is
   developed on a single, low-power, 65-nm field programmable gate arrays
   (FPGA) chip that interfaces directly with Android based smart-devices
   (smartphone or tablet) and consumes 12.42 mW of power. As a result,
   image data from an endoscopic capsule can be saved (or viewed) directly
   on smart-device, tablet, laptop, workstation or secured server connected
   to a hospital's or residential Wi-Fi network. This eliminates the need
   to carry a bulky data logger and enables medical doctors to analyze data
   and perform diagnosis in real time from a remote place. The system
   supports full-duplex data communication between the endoscopic capsule
   and smart-device which further allows doctors to control many features
   of the capsule in real-time. Due to the flexible and reprogrammable
   nature of the system, various image processing and compression
   algorithms can be employed without any change in hardware. The system
   supports multi-spectral imaging including white light imaging (WLI) and
   narrow band imaging (NBI). A variable-length, low-complexity image
   compression algorithm is used that is based on a novel color-space
   followed by an optimized Golomb-rice coding. The entire system is
   prototyped using circular PCBs with a size of 16 mm x 36 mm. An Android
   mobile app is designed with many features to control the operation of
   the capsule as well as display the captured images. Both in vivo and ex
   vivo trials using live pig have been conducted to validate the advantage
   of the proposed system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The mesoporous alumina materials having different textural properties
   were synthesized by modifying the procedures mentioned in literature.
   Pluronic P-123 was used as structure directing agent (SDA) and aluminum
   isopropoxide was used as precursor for aluminum. The materials were
   characterized using N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (BET), X-ray
   diffraction, FTIR and high resolution-TEM (HRTEM). BET, XRD and HRTEM
   analyses had confirmed the synthesis of mesoporous aluminas with
   different textural characteristics. The synthesized mesoporous aluminas
   were utilized as a support material for NiMo catalyst for hydrotreating
   of oil sands bitumen derived heavy gas oil, in a fixed bed reactor at
   industrial conditions. The catalytic activity was measured in terms of
   hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN). The catalysts
   were characterized by BET, XRD, FUR, Raman, CO-chemisorption, HRTEM, TPD
   and TPR. The activity study for conventional NiMo/gamma-Al2O3 was also
   performed for comparison. Six types of mesoporous aluminas and
   corresponding catalysts were synthesized based on HNO3/H2O ratio varying
   from 0 to 2. It was observed that with increase in water content the
   surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of mesoporous aluminas
   increase. Moreover, the structure changes form ordered hexagonal to
   wormlike/sponge-like and fibular and then to corrugated platelets/rod
   like structures with increase in water content. However, the morphology
   of structure was changed after loading of active metals and the
   catalytic active follows the order
   NiMo/Meso-Al-0.6>NiMo/Meso-Al-0.4>NiMo/Meso-Al-2 approximate to
   NiMo/Meso-Al-0.2 > NiMo/Meso-Al-0> NiMo/gamma-Al2O3 > NiMo/Meso-Al-1.25.
   The highest activity shown by catalyst NiMo/Meso-Al-0.6 could be
   assigned to (i) its higher pore volume and surface area, (ii) highest
   metal dispersion, (iii) more number of weak acidic sites and (iv) lower
   Mo reduction temperatures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{C haracterization of the host-guest complex of a curcumin analog with

   of its anticancer activity}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{503-515}},
Abstract = {{Background: Curcumin analogs, including the novel compound NC 2067, are
   potent cytotoxic agents that suffer from poor solubility, and hence, low
   bioavailability. Cyclodextrin-based carriers can be used to encapsulate
   such agents. In order to understand the interaction between the two
   molecules, the physicochemical properties of the host-guest complexes of
   NC 2067 with beta-cyclodextrin (CD) or beta-cyclodextrin-gemini
   surfactant (CDgemini surfactant) were investigated for the first time.
   Moreover, possible supramolecular structures were examined in order to
   aid the development of new drug delivery systems. Furthermore, the in
   vitro anticancer activity of the complex of NC 2067 with CDgemini
   surfactant nanoparticles was demonstrated in the A375 melanoma cell
   line.
   Methods: Physicochemical properties of the complexes formed of NC 2067
   with CD or CDgemini surfactant were investigated by synchrotron-based
   powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and
   thermogravimetric analysis. Synchrotron-based small- and wide-angle
   X-ray scattering and size measurements were employed to assess the
   supramolecular morphology of the complex formed by NC 2067 with CDgemini
   surfactant. Lastly, the in vitro cell toxicity of the formulations
   toward A375 melanoma cells at various drug-to-carrier mole ratios were
   measured by cell viability assay.
   Results: Physical mixtures of NC 2067 and CD or CDgemini surfactant
   showed characteristics of the individual components, whereas the complex
   of NC 2067 and CD or CDgemini surfactant presented new structural
   features, supporting the formation of the host-guest complexes.
   Complexes of NC 2067 with CDgemini surfactants formed nanoparticles
   having sizes of 100-200 nm. NC 2067 retained its anticancer activity in
   the complex with CDgemini surfactant for different drug-to-carrier mole
   ratios, with an IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) value
   comparable to that for NC 2067 without the carrier.
   Conclusion: The formation of host-guest complexes of NC 2067 with CD or
   CDgemini surfactant has been confirmed and hence the CDgemini surfactant
   shows good potential to be used as a delivery system for anticancer
   agents.}},

Abstract = {{High-surface area activated carbons (HAC) were prepared from analogous
   sulfur-containing precursors by using KOH chemical activation. The
   relationship between pyrite (FeS2) in the precursor and the pore

   K2SO4, K2S2O3, K2S, thioether (R-S-R'), and Fe3O4, which reduce the
   actual amount of KOH used to develop the porosity. As a result, the
   existence of the by-product Fe3O4 further clarifies that FeS2 in the
   precursor can consume some amount of KOH, which leads to the decrease in
   the specific surface area and pore volume of HAC. Interestingly, part of
   the inorganic sulfur from FeS2 in the precursor can be transformed into
   organic sulfide R-S-R'.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental concerns caused by burning fossil fuel and the safety
   concerns associated with nuclear power plants have led to increased
   interest and investment in wind power. Wind penetration in power systems
   has been rapidly increasing worldwide and has resulted in increased
   variability and uncertainty in power generation. Proper modeling of the
   wind resource has, therefore, become increasingly important in modern
   wind-integrated power systems. The correlation between wind speeds at
   multiple wind farms considerably affects the overall variability of wind
   power generation. Many power utilities are considering expansion to
   multiple wind farms. Analysis of wind power at different sites requires
   sufficient time-synchronized wind data in order to incorporate their
   cross-correlations in the evaluation model. Such data are usually not
   available or very limited formany prospective wind sites that may be
   considered in energy planning or policy making. This paper proposes a
   simple analytical method to develop approximate wind models when
   time-synchronized wind data for two wind sites are not available and
   further extends the method to incorporate more than two wind sites.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have been conducted using simulation models to predict
   the epidemiological spread of H1N1 and understand intervention
   trade-offs. However, existing models are generally not very accurate in
   H1N1 model predictions. In this report, we examine the impact of using
   particle filtering in a compartmental SEIRV (susceptible, exposed,
   infected, recovered and vaccinated) model which considers the impact of
   vaccination on the outbreak in the province of Manitoba. For the purpose
   of evaluating the performance of the particle filtering method, this
   work further compares the ability of particle filtering and traditional
   calibration to anticipate the evolution of the outbreak. Preliminary
   simulated results indicate that the particle filtering approach
   outperforms the calibration method in terms of the discrepancy between
   empirical data and model data.}},

Abstract = {{Piezo-electric actuators (PEAs) have been widely used in nanopositioning
   applications due to their high stiffness, fast responses, and large
   actuating forces. However, the existence of nonlinearities such as
   hysteresis can greatly deteriorate their performance and, as such,
   modeling and control of PEAs for improved performance has drawn
   considerable attention in the literature. This paper presents a brief
   survey of recent achievements in modeling and control of PEAs as well as
   the relevant issues that remain to be resolved. Specifically, various
   methods for modeling hysteresis, creep, and vibration dynamics in PEAs
   are examined, followed by a discussion of the issues leading to modeling
   errors. Recently reported PEA control schemes are surveyed along with
   their advantages and disadvantages. The challenges associated with
   control problems are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical structure prediction calculations have revealed that the
   conformation of ammonia borane (NH3BH3) in the crystalline state can be
   modified by pressure, changing from the staggered configuration at low
   pressure to an eclipsed geometry at high pressure. At low pressure, the
   crystalline structure is stabilized by the charge transfer NH
   delta+delta-HB dihydrogen interactions. In the high pressure polymorphs,
   the NH3BH3 is predicted to form a layered structure. The NH
   delta+delta-HB bonding is still predominant within the layer. The
   stacking of the layers, however, is determined by the occurrence of
   additional homopolar BH delta-delta-HB interaction unprecedented in
   NH3BH3 and facilitated by the eclipsed conformation. This bonding is
   shown to be the result of secondary interactions between BH3 groups from
   molecules of adjacent layers. Topological analysis of the charge density
   and perturbation calculations on the molecule fragments show
   unambiguously that the BH delta-delta-HB interaction is covalent in
   nature with the bond strength comparable to a conventional hydrogen
   bond.}},

Pages = {{21167-21177}},

Abstract = {{A series of novel zinc oxide-silica composites with three-dimensionally
   ordered macropores (3DOM) structure were synthesized via colloidal
   crystal template method and used as sorbents for hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
   removal at room temperature for the first time. The performances of the
   prepared sorbents were evaluated by dynamic breakthrough testing. The
   materials were characterized before and after adsorption using scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was
   found that the composite with 3DOM structure exhibited remarkable
   desulfurization performance at room temperature and the enhancement of
   reactive adsorption of hydrogen sulfide was attributed to the unique
   structure features of 3DOM composites; high surface areas,
   nanocrystalline ZnO and the well-ordered interconnected macroporous with
   abundant mesopores. The introduction of silica could be conducive to
   support the 3DOM structure and the high dispersion of zinc oxide.
   Moisture in the H2S stream plays a crucial role in the removal process.
   The effects of Zn/Si ratio and the calcination temperature of 3DOM
   composites on H2S removal were studied. It demonstrated that the highest
   content of ZnO could reach up to 73 wt \% and the optimum calcination
   temperature was 500 degrees C. The multiple adsorption/regeneration
   cycles showed that the 3DOM ZnO-SiO2 sorbent is stable and the sulfur
   capacity can still reach 67.4\% of that of the fresh sorbent at the
   fifth cycle. These results indicate that 3DOM ZnO-SiO2 composites will
   be a promising sorbent for H2S removal at room temperature.}},

   significantly decreased with increase in the ND//< 1 1 0 > orientation.
   Significant differences in the corrosion rate with increased degree of

Abstract = {{Solid acid catalysts are an important class of catalysts because of
   their applications in various organic reactions. A 12-tungstophosphoric
   acid (TPA) is a member of heteropoly acid (HPA) compounds, which grabbed
   attention because of its low volatility, low corrosivity, higher
   activity, and acidity compared to sulfuric acid. However, the major
   problems of using TPA are its solubility in polar media, and its lower
   surface area. Therefore, various techniques are applied to use it as
   heterogeneous catalysts. Biodiesel is a diesel substitute renewable
   fuel, which is produced from various renewable feedstocks through
   transesterification or esterification reactions. Acid catalysts can
   catalyze both transesterification and esterification reactions. For this
   reason, research has been conducted to study the catalytic activity of
   various TPA precursory solid acid catalysts for biodiesel production. In
   this Review, a data mining technique has been applied to extract
   valuable information from the previously published literature. For this
   purpose, an artificial neural network (ANN) model has been developed
   based on the published research data to capture the general trends or to
   make predictions. Both catalyst properties and reaction conditions are
   trended and predicted using the network model.}},

Abstract = {{In the present investigation, a heterogeneous sulfated-SnO2 catalyst was
   synthesized and used for the epoxidation of unsaturation present in the
   canola oil. The physicochemical properties were studied to measure the
   surface and bulk properties of prepared SnO2 and sulfated-SnO2 samples.
   Process optimization studies were performed for parameters such as
   catalyst loading, ethylenic unsaturation in canola oil to hydrogen
   peroxide molar ratio, ethylenic unsaturation in canola oil to acetic
   acid molar ratio, and temperature. Sulfated-SnO2 demonstrated promising
   catalytic activity with 100\% conversion of unsaturation in canola oil
   to epoxy canola oil in 6 h at optimum process conditions. Based on the
   experimental results and kinetic data, a
   LangmuirHinshelwood-Hougen-Watson type mechanism was proposed, and the
   reaction followed pseudo first order. Calculated energy of activation
   was 17.75 kcal/mol. The tribological properties of epoxy canola oil such
   as lubricity property in terms of wear scar length, kinematic
   viscosities, viscosity index, oxidative induction time, cloud point, and
   pour point were measured.}},

Title = {{Hydrotreating of Heavy Gas Oil on Mesoporous Mixed Metal Oxides
   (M-Al2O3, M = TiO2, ZrO2, SnO2) Supported NiMo Catalysts: Influence of
   Surface Acidity}},

Abstract = {{Mesoporous mixed metal oxides, TiO2Al2O3, ZrO2Al2O3, and SnO2Al2O3, were
   synthesized using a novel method and were used as a support material for
   the NiMo hydrotreating catalyst. The catalyst was prepared via the
   incipient wetness sequential impregnation method. All catalysts were
   characterized using N-2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms (BET), X-ray
   diffraction, FTIR, pyridine-FTIR, acridine-FTIR, CO-chemisorption,
   ICP-MS, TPD, and TPR. The HDS and HDN activities of the catalysts were
   determined using Athabasca bitumen derived heavy gas oil at industrial
   reaction conditions. The catalytic activity of synthesized
   NiMo/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst was also determined for comparative studies.
   Low angle XRD and BET analysis has confirmed that the method developed
   for synthesis is suitable for the preparation of a mesoporous mixed
   oxide based NiMo hydrotreating catalyst. H-2-TPR analysis has confirmed
   that the introduction of metal oxides such as ZrO2, TiO2, and SnO2 in
   alumina increases the active metal (Mo) and support (alumina)
   interactions. The highest reduction temperature is observed in the SnO2
   containing catalyst. NH3-TPD has confirmed the increase in acidic
   strength of catalysts after introduction of metal oxides, and it follows
   the order NiMo/SnO2Al2O3 > NiMo/ZrO2Al2O3 > NiMo/TiO2Al2O3. It was
   observed from acridine-FTIR analysis that the catalysts having strong
   acidic strength hold acridine strongly at high temperatures. This
   implies that catalysts with higher acidity are prone to inhibition by
   nitrogen containing compounds present in feed, and it will affect the
   catalytic activity. The HDS and HDN activities follow the order
   NiMo/TiO2Al2O3 > NiMo/mesoAl(2)O(3)(mesoporous) > NiMo/ZrO2Al2O3 >
   NiMo/gamma-Al2O3 > NiMo/SnO2Al2O3. The higher activity of the
   NiMo/TiO2Al2O3 catalyst is due to higher metal dispersion as observed
   from CO-chemisorption and a moderate increase in acidic strength.
   Therefore, increasing the acidity of alumina support to much higher
   levels by incorporating metal oxides having strong Lewis acidity would
   not help in enhancing HDN and HDS activity for nitrogen rich feeds, such
   as Athabasca bitumen derived heavy gas oil due to inhibition effects.}},

Abstract = {{To more accurately describe the noncontact transport behavior of
   traveling acoustic waves, a nonlinear model is presented in this paper
   for the squeeze gas film with consideration of gas inertia in the case
   of a large amplitude motion and low viscosity of the gas. A closed form
   solution is derived for the vertical and horizontal forces of the film
   from this model. Our results have shown that the gas inertia has a
   significant influence on the pressure distribution in the squeeze film,
   and the inertial force is higher than the viscous force. The predicted
   levitation and horizontal driving forces are found to be in good
   agreement with our experimental measurements. Our inertia model provides
   a powerful tool for the force estimation and its potential benefits
   could be far reaching. The accurate prediction of these forces is useful
   to design the system for levitating and transporting planar objects,

Abstract = {{Observing cavitation bubbles deep within tissue is very difficult. The
   development of a method for probing cavitation, irrespective of its
   location in tissues, would improve the efficiency and application of
   ultrasound in the clinic. A synchrotron x-ray imaging technique, which
   is capable of detecting cavitation bubbles induced in water by a
   sonochemistry system, is reported here; this could possibly be extended
   to the study of therapeutic ultrasound in tissues. The two different
   x-ray imaging techniques of Analyzer Based Imaging (ABI) and phase
   contrast imaging (PCI) were examined in order to detect ultrasound
   induced cavitation bubbles. Cavitation was not observed by PCI, however
   it was detectable with ABI. Acoustic cavitation was imaged at six
   different acoustic power levels and six different locations through the
   acoustic beam in water at a fixed power level. The results indicate the
   potential utility of this technique for cavitation studies in tissues,
   but it is time consuming. This may be improved by optimizing the imaging
   method.}},

Abstract = {{In this research work, the magnetic properties of laser welded
   Fe-Co-7.15 wt\%V foils were investigated and a statistical analysis of
   Nd:YAG laser beam welding of these foils was done using response surface
   methodology (RSM). The results indicated that the welded samples
   experience a significant decrease in their magnetic properties. The
   input process parameters such as lamping current (130-160 A), pulse
   duration (1.5-3 ms), travel speed (50-200 mm/min) and focused position
   (-2 to -0.5 mm) were selected suitably in order to obtain the desired
   output, i.e., the magnetic properties of the welded samples. This paper
   highlighted the use of RSM by designing a four-factor five-level central
   composite rotatable design matrix with the full replication for
   planning, conduction, execution and development of mathematical models.
   The main effect of each factor and the interaction effect with other
   factors were determined quantitatively and presented graphically.
   Analysis of variance and other adequacy measures were employed to check
   the adequacy of the developed model. A laser beam with lamping current,
   pulse duration, welding speed and focused position of 145 A, 1.5 ms, 125
   mm/min and -0.5 mm respectively were identified as the optimal set of
   laser welding parameters to obtain a welded area with desirable magnetic

Abstract = {{In recent years, several studies have been focused on friction stir
   welding of aluminum alloys, and some researchers have also been reported
   on welding of aluminum-based composites. In the present research,
   ultrafine grained sheets of aluminum matrix composite (Al-Al2O3) were

   composite sheets were then joined by friction stir welding. The present
   work describes the effect of the FSW process on the microstructure and
   crystallographic textures in the base metal and weld nugget. Electron
   backscattered diffraction (EBSD) results demonstrated the existence of
   different grain orientations within the weld nugget as compared to the
   base metal. Al composite plates have a Rotated Cube texture component.
   Moreover, in the nugget, grain structure with Rotated Cube and shear
   texture developed. Friction stir welding coarsened the grain size in the

Abstract = {{As genes with similar functions are closely related, cluster analysis
   becomes an important tool to understand and predicts gene functions
   (patterns) from gene expression profiles. In many situations, each gene
   expression profile only contains a few data points. Directly applying
   traditional clustering algorithms to such short gene expression profiles
   cannot obtain biological meaningful patterns. In this paper, we propose
   a novel method to discover biologically meaningful patterns by
   clustering short time-series gene expression profiles with integrating
   protein-protein interaction (PPI) data. Numerical experiments are
   conducted on two sets of Arabidopsis thaliana short time-series gene
   expression profiles, with treatments of cold stress and drought stress,
   respectively. The proposed method can effectively assign genes belonging
   to target functional clusters (patterns), in terms of having small
   p-value of GO term `response to cold' (GO:0009409) in dataset one, and
   small p-value of GO term `response to water deprivation' (GO:0009414) in
   dataset two than those from an existing clustering algorithm (namely
   STEM) for short time-series gene expression profiles. Additionally, our
   proposed method is able to identify higher percentage of stress-related
   genes and un-annotated genes in resultant cluster than STEM for both
   datasets; which does not only improve gene clustering effectiveness, but
   also contribute to functional prediction of un-annotated genes. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Herein we systematically study a range of dopants (Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, and
   an MnCo alloy) in ZnO and TiO2 using several X-ray spectroscopic
   techniques. We identify the dopants local environment and interaction
   with the host lattice by employing crystal field multiplet calculations
   and hence clarify their potential applicability for spintronic
   technologies. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict a
   decreasing probability of direct cation (Zn/Ti) substitution by dopant
   atoms as atomic number increases, as well as a much greater likelihood
   of metallic clustering in TiO2. Our spectroscopic measurements confirm

Abstract = {{Neural stem cells (NSCs) hold great promise for central nervous system
   injury repair. However, controlling their differentiation to functional
   neuron is challenging. In present study, we developed a novel injectable
   hydrogel encapsulated with TWS119 to guide the differentiation of NSCs
   into neurons. Specifically, we used alginate hydrogel as a 3-dimensional
   substrate for the attachment, proliferation, and differentiation of
   neural stem cell in the presence of TWS119. The alginate hydrogel
   exhibited a porous 3-dimensional network, thus allowing for culture
   medium to penetrate. With its suitable biocompatibility, the alginate
   hydrogel substrate is able to promote the attachment and proliferation
   of NSCs. Our results illustrate that on alginate hydrogel with the
   presence of TWS119, NSCs exhibited higher expression of beta tubulin III
   (a neural marker) and lower glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) than
   those without TWS119. Also, our results show that NSCs on an alginate
   hydrogel in the presence of TWS119 can inhibit glial cell
   differentiation while promoting neuronal differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the coupling of fermionic fields with mass dimension one to
   the O'Raifeartaigh model to study supersymmetry breaking for these
   fermions. We find that the coupled model has two distinct solutions. The
   first solution represents a local minimum of the superpotential which
   spontaneously breaks supersymmetry in perfect analogy to the
   O'Raifeartaigh model. The second solution is more intriguing as it
   corresponds to a global minimum of the superpotential. In this case, the
   coupling to the fermionic sector restores supersymmetry. However, this
   is achieved at the cost of breaking Lorentz invariance. Finally, the
   mass matrices for the multiplets of the coupled model are presented. It
   turns out that it contains two bosonic triplets and one fermionic
   doublet which are mass multiplets. In addition, it contains a massless
   fermionic doublet as well as one fermionic triplet which is not a mass
   multiplet but rather an interaction multiplet that contains component
   fields of different mass dimension.
   The results also imply that the presented model for fermionic fields
   with mass dimension one is an interesting candidate for supersymmetric
   dark matter (DM).}},

   plasmas}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The magnetosphere undergoes a transition from a dipole-like to taillike
   structure in the antisunward direction. In this region, Alfven
   ballooning instability has been considered as a leading candidate to be
   responsible for the onset and expansion phase of observed impulsive
   substorms. We apply the generalized Ohm's law in isotropic Hall-MHD
   equations and study the effect of heat flux on the ballooning modes
   under substorm circumstances. The set of partial differential equations
   is obtained for a general ballooning dispersion relation from which all
   classical Alfven waves and fundamental ballooning modes are recovered,
   e.g., the decoupled shear Alfven and magnetosonic modes, the classical
   ballooning instability in incompressible plasmas. In the absence of the
   heat flux, the ballooning mode is featured by the coupling of the two
   modes by the superposition of the independent Hall effect and the
   independent plasma inhomogeneity effect. By contrast, heat flux exerts
   its influence on the ballooning mode by updating the coefficients of the
   terms in the dispersion relation. The results expose that the growth
   rate (gamma(BM)) has two branches. If k(p) is beta free, one branch
   shifts versus beta, while the other branch is damped substantially by
   the heat flux, leading to a more stable ballooning mode; if k(c) is beta
   free, one branch shifts little versus beta, but the other one has higher
   gamma(BM) driven by the heat flux, leading to a more unstable ballooning
   mode.}},

Abstract = {{Two improvements for liquid desiccant air conditioning (LDAC) systems
   are recently gaining much attention. First, one heat pump is used to
   simultaneously cover the solution heating and cooling loads, instead of
   using separate cooling and heating equipment. Second, liquid-to-air
   membrane energy exchangers (LAMEEs) are being investigated for use as
   the dehumidifier and regenerator to eliminate the carryover of desiccant
   droplets by the air streams. These two improvements are combined in the
   current work in a heat-pump membrane LDAC (H-M-LDAC) system. The focus
   of this paper is on matching the capacities of the heat pump evaporator
   and condenser to meet the solution cooling and heating needs. A
   comprehensive review is presented and a novel capacity matching index
   (CMI) is proposed. A parametric study and sensitivity analysis are
   performed to quantify the influences of six key design and operating
   parameters on the CMI and coefficient of performance (COP) of the
   H-M-LDAC system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.}},

   rotated Copper and rotated Cube were the main textures of martensite

Title = {{Optimization of wheat debranning using laboratory equipment for ethanol

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Ethanol production from starchy cereal grains is increasing rapidly due
   to increasing demand for alternative fuels. In Canada, wheat is the
   primary feedstock in ethanol plants. To improve the productivity of the
   ethanol plants in terms of product quality and yield, debranning of
   wheat grains may be employed. Debranning is advantageous in two ways.
   Firstly, bran removal increases the starch content of the feedstock,
   improving the fermentation efficiency of the ethanol plants. Secondly,
   bran, a valuable co-product can be used as an animal feed ingredient. In
   this study, experiments to optimize the debranning process were carried
   out using two kinds of abrasive equipment, the Satake and the TADD
   (tangential abrasive ehulling device) mills. Wheat samples (30 and 200
   g) were debranned in the Satake mill at 1 215, 1 412, and 1 515 r/min
   rotational speeds, 30, 36, and 40 grit sizes, and 30, 60, and 90 s
   retention times, and in the TADD mill at 900 r/min rotational speed, 30,
   36, 50, and 80 grit sizes, and 120, 180, 240, and 300s retention times.
   In addition to debranning efficiency, the starch separation efficiencies
   of the two mills were calculated in different debranning conditions. In
   the Satake mill, the 30 g and 200 g sample size, 1 412 r/min and 1 515
   r/min rotational speeds, all it sizes, and 60 s of retention time
   demonstrated the highest debranning efficiency. Correspondingly, optimal
   results in the TADD mill were obtained with 200 g sample size, 900

Abstract = {{Densification is required for efficiently handling and transporting
   biomass as feedstock for biofuel production. Binders can enhance straw
   pellet strength and improve the pellet performance. The present
   investigation aimed to optimize binders and compression load for wheat
   straw pelletization using a single pelleting unit. Response surface
   methodology was employed by using a four-factor, five-level central
   composite design with wood residue (\%, w/w), bentonite (\%, w/w), crude
   glycerol (\%, w/w), and compression load (N) as process parameters. The
   pellet tensile strength, specific energy consumption of pelleting, and
   pellet density were the response variables. The higher heating value,
   ash content of the pellet product and the cost of the feedstock were
   also considered in optimizing binder addition. The developed model
   fitted the data and was adequate for binder analysis and optimization.
   Wheat straw pellet, with the addition of 30\% wood residue, 0.80\%
   bentonite, and 3.42\% crude glycerol, in addition to 4 000 N of
   compressive load, was identified as optimal with good performance of
   pellet tensile strength (1.14 MPa), specific energy consumption (32.6
   kJ/kg), and pellet density (1 094 kg/m(3)) as well as low ash content
   (6.13\%) and high heating value (18.64 MJ/kg). Confirmation tests
   indicated high accuracy of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic logic families are commonly used in high speed applications, but
   they are susceptible to single event errors. This paper presents and
   evaluates three techniques of hardening dynamic logic-layout
   manipulation using charge sharing, addition of a feedback capacitor
   across the static inverter, and dual-rail domino logic with differential
   keepers. The layout-based design has better single event tolerance by
   sharing charge between NFET devices of the dynamic and static inverters;
   the design with a feedback capacitor makes the keeper more effective in
   recovering the hit node because of the increased propagation delay; the
   differential-keeper structure shows superior SET performance because the
   hit node could recover through the restoring path in the case of charge
   loss. These proposed designs along with the reference traditional
   keeper-based design were fabricated in a 130 nm technology node as shift
   register chains and then irradiated by heavy ion particles. Experimental
   results verified the mechanisms and effectiveness of these proposed
   designs.}},

Abstract = {{The use of numerical simulations to model physical processes occurring
   within subvolumes of rock samples that have been characterized using
   advanced 3D imaging techniques is becoming increasingly common. Not only
   do these simulations allow for the determination of macroscopic
   properties like hydraulic permeability and electrical formation factor,
   but they also allow the user to visualize processes taking place at the
   pore scale and they allow for multiple different processes to be
   simulated on the same geometry. Most efforts to date have used
   specialized research software for the purpose of simulations. In this
   contribution, we outline the steps taken to use commercial software
   Avizo to transform a 3D synchrotron X-ray-derived tomographic image of a
   rock core sample to an STL (STereoLithography) file which can be
   imported into the commercial multiphysics modeling package COMSOL We
   demonstrate that the use of COMSOL to perform fluid and electrical
   current flow simulations through the pore spaces. The permeability and
   electrical formation factor of the sample are calculated and compared
   with laboratory-derived values and benchmark calculations. Although the
   simulation domains that we were able to model on a desk top computer
   were significantly smaller than representative elementary volumes, and
   we were able to establish Kozeny-Carman and Archie's Law trends on which
   laboratory measurements and previous benchmark solutions fall. The rock
   core samples include a Fountainebleau sandstone used for benchmarking
   and a marly dolostone sampled from a well in the Weyburn oil field of
   southeastern Saskatchewan, Canada. Such carbonates are known to have
   complicated pore structures compared with sandstones, yet we are able to
   calculate reasonable macroscopic properties. We discuss the computing
   resources required. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many computational methods have been proposed to identify essential
   proteins by using the topological features of interactome networks.
   However, the precision of essential protein discovery still needs to be
   improved. Researches show that majority of hubs (essential proteins) in
   the yeast interactome network are essential due to their involvement in
   essential complex biological modules and hubs can be classified into two
   categories: date hubs and party hubs. In this study, combining with gene
   expression profiles, we propose a new method to predict essential
   proteins based on overlapping essential modules, named POEM. In POEM,
   the original protein interactome network is partitioned into many
   overlapping essential modules. The frequencies and weighted degrees of
   proteins in these modules are employed to decide which categories does a
   protein belong to? The comparative results show that POEM outperforms
   the classical centrality measures: Degree Centrality (DC), Information
   Centrality (IC), Eigenvector Centrality (EC), Subgraph Centrality (SC),
   Betweenness Centrality (BC), Closeness Centrality (CC), Edge Clustering
   Coefficient Centrality (NC), and two newly proposed essential proteins
   prediction methods: PeC and CoEWC. Experimental results indicate that
   the precision of predicting essential proteins can be improved by
   considering the modularity of proteins and integrating gene expression
   profiles with network topological features.}},

Title = {{Study of the relationship between the target tissue necrosis volume and

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship
   between the target tissue necrosis volume and the target tissue size
   during the radiofrequency ablation (RFA) procedure.
   Materials and methods: The target tissues with four different sizes
   (d(xy) = 20, 25, 30 and 35 mm) were modelled using a two-compartment
   radiofrequency ablation model. Different voltages were applied to seek
   the maximum target tissue necrosis volume for each target tissue size.
   The first roll-off occurrence or the standard ablation time (12 min) was
   taken as the sign for the termination of the RFA procedure.
   Results: Four different maximum voltages without the roll-off occurrence
   were found for the four different sizes of target tissues (d(xy) = 20,
   25, 30 and 35 mm), and they were 36.6, 35.4, 33.9 and 32.5 V,
   respectively. The target tissues with diameters of 20, 25mm can be
   cleanly ablated at their own maximum voltages applied (MVA) but the same
   finding was not found for the 35-mm target tissue. For the target tissue
   with diameter of 30 mm, the 50 degrees C isothermal contour (IT50)
   result showed that the target tissue can be cleanly ablated, but the
   same result did not show in the Arrhenius damage model result.
   Furthermore, two optimal RFA protocols with a minimal thermal damage to
   the healthy tissues were found for the target tissues with diameters of
   20 and 25 mm, respectively.
   Conclusions: The study suggests that target tissues of different sizes
   should be treated with different RFA protocols. The maximum target
   tissue volume was achieved with the MVA without the roll-off occurrence
   for each target tissue size when a constant RF power supply was used.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the evolution of deformation texture in steel-based
   nanocomposite fabricated via accumulative roll bonding (ARB) process was
   investigated. Textural evolution during the ARB process was evaluated
   using x-ray diffraction. It was found that with increasing number of ARB
   cycles, first, intensity of alpha-fiber, gamma-fiber, and theta-fiber
   decreased and then increased, while zeta-fiber exhibited the opposite
   trend compared to these fibers. Also, there were texture transitions in
   epsilon-fiber and eta-fiber. It was realized that with increasing the
   number of ARB cycles, volume fraction of low-angle grain boundary
   decreased and the fraction of high-angle grain boundary increased. In
   addition, shear texture was predominant after first cycle, while for
   other samples, rolling texture was dominant. When recrystallization
   occurred, the intensity of zeta-fiber increased, the intensity of
   alpha-fiber and gamma-fiber decreased, and the intensity of \{011\}aOE
   (c) 100 > orientation in epsilon-fiber and eta-fiber remarkably
   increased. Indeed, the transition from rolling texture to shear texture
   was a sign of occurrence of discontinuous recrystallization after the
   first ARB cycle. Moreover, in the one-cycle sample, nucleation of
   discontinuous recrystallization had occurred. Finally, with increasing
   the number of cycles, the intensity of rolling texture increased and the
   intensity of shear texture decreased.}},

Abstract = {{Non-catalytic gasification of canola meal for the production of syngas
   was studied in lab-scale fixed bed gasifier and pilot-scale fluidized
   bed gasifier. Various experiments were undertaken in order to study the
   effects of different gasification parameters on gas composition, H-2/CO
   ratio, gas yield, syngas yield, lower heating value (LHV), and carbon
   efficiency (CE). Fixed-bed experiments were performed to study the
   effects of operating temperature in the range of 650-850 A degrees C and
   equivalence ratio in the range of 0.2-0.4. Steam, carbon dioxide (CO2),
   and oxygen (O-2) were used as gasifying agents. The experimental results
   show that steam gasification delivers a gaseous product with a high
   H-2/CO ratio (2.7) and LHV (193.0 MJ/m(3)). Oxygen gasification
   attributed to maximum CE (65.5 \%). CO2 gasification contributes to high
   gas yield (82.8 mol/kg biomass). During fluidized bed gasification
   study, it was found that using steam as gasifying agent leads to more
   H-2 production as compared to that for O-2 and CO2 gasifying agents.
   Thus, it leads to high H-2/CO ratio, syngas yield, and LHV of product
   gas. Regarding CE for O-2 gasification and gas yield for CO2,
   observations were similar to those for fixed bed system.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine the nucleation and growth behavior of a highly
   deformed Incoloy 800H/HT. We also investigate the effect of rolling path
   (i.e. unidirectional and cross rolling) on the recrystallization
   mechanism and subsequent annealing texture of Incoloy 800H/HT. We used
   micro- and macro-texture measurements to investigate the evolution of
   texture components in various nucleation and growth stages. We studied
   the recrystallization kinetics by means of isothermal transformation
   plots based on recrystallized and softened fractions drawn from
   orientation imaging microscopy and microhardness measurements.
   Results show that the recrystallization kinetic after cross rolling (CR)
   is slower than after the unidirectional rolling (UDR) deformation. Due
   to different nucleation and growth mechanisms, these samples showed
   different recrystallization textures. CR samples exhibited a strong
   brass recrystallization texture while UDR samples showed a combination
   of Goss, copper and recrystallized brass (326)(835) components. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of nano/sub-micron crystallization on the
   magnetic properties of Fe-Co-7.15V alloy was investigated. Hence,
   cold-rolled Fe-Co-7.15V alloy (with 90\% reduction) was annealed in
   different conditions. The magnetic properties of the annealed samples
   were measured by vibrating sample magnetometer. It was found that the
   best magnetic properties of the cold-rolled alloy were obtained after
   annealing at 550 degrees C for 2 h. The performed microstructural
   studies by field emission scanning electron microscope, showed that
   improvement of coercivity by annealing was related to the partial
   recrystallization and the formation of nano/sub-micron grains. Also, the
   magnetic studies showed that saturation induction was reduced by
   annealing at temperatures higher than 450 degrees C. The performed phase
   identification by X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that a decrease
   in saturation induction was related to the formation of residual
   non-magnetic gamma phase. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hydride-induced ductile-to-brittle transition is an important feature
   for the failure of hydride-forming materials. Although this problem has
   been studied for many years, its relation to microstructure remains
   unclear. The degree of hydride-induced embrittlement depends on the
   hydride network. In this study, the formation mechanism of the hydride
   network with a high degree of continuity and its influence on the
   ductile-to-brittle transition of zirconium alloys are investigated. A
   criterion is proposed to determine the critical hydrogen content for the
   formation of an interlinked hydride configuration by considering the
   local stress-induced changes in hydrogen concentration and terminal
   solid solubility in the vicinity of the hydride tip. The theoretical
   results are in good agreement with the experimental observations. The
   propagation path of the hydride network and its dependence on
   microstructure are analyzed using electron backscatter diffraction and
   thermodynamic modeling. The results show that the grain-boundary
   structure, the grain-boundary misorientation and the angle of hydride
   inclination toward the grain-boundary plane control the formation and
   the growth direction of the hydride network. Although this work focuses
   on zirconium alloys, the obtained results are also of significance for
   other hydride-foiming materials. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{BackgroundPositive-pressure ventilation during transport of intubated
   patients is generally delivered via a hand-pressurized device. Of these
   devices, self-inflating resuscitators (SIR) and flow-inflating
   resuscitators (FIR) constitute the two major types used. Selection of a
   particular device for transport, however, remains largely an
   institutional practice.
   ObjectiveTo evaluate the hypothesis that transport ventilation goals of
   intubated pediatric patients are better achieved using an FIR compared
   to an SIR.
   MethodsThis randomized crossover simulation study compared the
   performance of SIR and FIR among anesthesia providers in a pediatric
   transport scenario. Subjects hand-ventilated a test lung while
   simultaneously maneuvering a stretcher bed to simulate patient
   transport. Hand ventilation was carried out using a Jackson-Rees circuit
   (FIR) and a Laerdal pediatric silicone resuscitator (SIR). The primary
   outcome was the proportion of total breaths delivered within the
   predefined target PIP/PEEP range (30+/- 3, 10+/- 3cm H2O). Secondary
   outcomes included proportion of total breaths delivered with
   operationally defined unacceptable breath variables (PIP>35 cm H2O or
   PEEP<5 cm H2O).
   ResultsOverall, participants were four times more likely to deliver
   target breaths and one-third less likely to deliver unacceptable breaths
   using the FIR compared to the SIR. When comparing device performance, a
   44\% increase in the proportions of target breaths and a 40.4\% decrease
   in unacceptable breaths using the FIR were observed (P<0.0001 for both).
   ConclusionsHand ventilation during patient transport is superior using
   the FIR compared to the SIR to achieve target ventilatory goals and
   avoid unacceptable ventilatory cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Bioplotting is an emerging freeform scaffold fabrication technique
   useful for creating artificial tissue scaffolds containing living cells.
   Simultaneous maintenance of scaffold structural integrity and cell
   viability is a challenging task. In this article, we present strategies
   developed to bioplot alginate-based three-dimensional tissue scaffolds
   containing hyaluronic acid and living Schwann cells for potential use in
   peripheral nerve tissue engineering. The fabrication platform, upon
   which the scaffold is created, was coated with the polycation
   polyethylenimine to immobilize the first layer of the scaffold on the
   platform. Each layer was then dispensed into a bath containing calcium
   chloride to cross-link the alginate, polyvinyl alcohol, and low
   concentrations of polyethylenimine to improve the structural integrity
   of the resulting scaffolds while retaining biocompatibility. The present
   study illustrated that with these strategies, porous alginate/hyaluronic
   acid scaffolds can be fabricated with good structural integrity and
   long-term cell viability. Plotting method and speed were also important
   factors determining the printability of single-layered scaffolds. The
   methods developed and the results obtained from this study form the
   basis for a general bioplotting method by which more sophisticated
   alginate/hyaluronic acid scaffolds can be fabricated with the inclusion

Abstract = {{Myocardial infarction is a cardiovascular disorder that remains a
   critical health issue worldwide. Because of its intrinsic inability to
   regenerate, cardiac tissue fails to repair itself after myocardial
   infarction. Cardiovascular engineering is a promising approach to
   regenerating myocardium for myocardial infarction repair. Despite
   explosive growth in research and interest in this field, cardiovascular
   regenerative medicine faces many challenges, with the need for rapid
   vascularization being the most pressing. Due to the high metabolic
   demand of cardiac cells, myocytes transplanted or implanted via cardiac
   scaffolds in the infarcted region do not survive without the timely
   formation of a microvascular network in the infarcted area or within the
   scaffolds. To address this issue, various strategies have been developed
   based on angiogenesis stimulation, prevascularization, and inosculation
   to promote microvascular network formation within the cardiac scaffolds.
   This paper describes cardiac tissue engineering strategies, key
   challenges in cardiovascular regenerative medicine, and various
   vascularization strategies, with an aim to review recent advances and
   developments in engineering vascularization and inosculation approaches
   towards the rapid integration of cardiac scaffolds, once implanted, with
   the host tissue. Challenges in engineering angiogenesis and future
   directions to address the issue of rapid inosculation are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Brain tumor segmentation aims to separate the different tumor tissues
   such as active cells, necrotic core, and edema from normal brain tissues
   of White Matter (WM), Gray Matter (GM), and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF).
   MRI-based brain tumor segmentation studies are attracting more and more
   attention in recent years due to non-invasive imaging and good soft
   tissue contrast of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. With the
   development of almost two decades, the innovative approaches applying
   computer-aided techniques for segmenting brain tumor are becoming more
   and more mature and coming closer to routine clinical applications. The
   purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview for
   MRI-based brain tumor segmentation methods. Firstly, a brief
   introduction to brain tumors and imaging modalities of brain tumors is
   given. Then, the preprocessing operations and the state of the art
   methods of MRI-based brain tumor segmentation are introduced. Moreover,
   the evaluation and validation of the results of MRI-based brain tumor
   segmentation are discussed. Finally, an objective assessment is
   presented and future developments and trends are addressed for MRI-based
   brain tumor segmentation methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this manuscript a finite element (FE) investigation of soil-blade
   interaction is presented. The soil is considered as an elastic-plastic
   material with the non-associated Drucker-Prager constitutive law. A
   separation procedure to model the cutting of soil and a method of
   calculating the forces acting on the blade are proposed and discussed in
   detail. The procedure uses a separation criterion that becomes active at
   consecutive nodes on the predefined separation surfaces. In order to
   mimic soil-blade sliding and soil-soil cutting phenomena contact
   elements with different properties are applied. Only rectangular shape
   blades are used in the simulation in order to verify the methodology by
   comparing the FE results with available analytical predictions, and
   examine the model's convergence. It is believed that the approach
   presented can be used to investigate the soil-tool interactions of real
   and more complex blade geometries and soil conditions and ultimately for
   improving design of blades used in tillage operations. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Diamond-like carbon (DLC)-MoS2 composite thin films were synthesized
   using a biased target ion beam deposition (BTIBD) technique in which
   MoS2 was produced by sputtering a MoS2 target using Ar ion beams while
   DLC was deposited by ion beam deposition with CH4 gas as carbon source.
   The structure and properties of the synthesized films were characterized
   by X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES),
   Raman spectroscopy, nanoindentation, ball-on-disk testing, and corrosion
   testing. The effect of MoS2 target bias voltage, ranging from -200 to
   -800 V, on the structure and properties of the DLC-MoS2 films was
   further investigated. The results showed that the hardness decreases
   from 9.1 GPa to 7 GPa, the Young's modulus decreases from 100 GPa to 78
   GPa, the coefficient of friction (COF) increases from 0.02 to 0.17, and
   the specific wear rate coefficient (k) increases from 5 x 10(-7) to 5 x
   10(-6) mm(3) N-1 m(-1), with increasing the biasing voltage from 200 V
   to 800 V. Also, the corrosion resistance of the DLC-MoS2 films decreased
   with the raise of biasing voltage. Comparing with the pure DLC and pure
   MoS2 films, the DLC-MoS2 films deposited at low biasing voltages showed
   better tribological properties including lower COF and k in ambient air
   environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of microstructure and texture across the fusion boundaries
   of a cladding produced by gas tungsten arc welding process was examined
   by optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron backscatter
   diffraction, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The cladding
   comprised of high strength low alloy steel substrate, austenitic
   stainless steel buffer layer, and super duplex stainless steel top
   coating. Results indicated that the heat affected zone of the substrate
   mainly consisted of coarse polygonal ferrite grains. The transition
   zone, which was separated from the buffer layer by Type II boundaries,
   was comprised of a narrow austenitic-martensitic band. The
   microstructure of the buffer layer was characterized by vermicular
   ferrite which was replaced by lathy morphology adjacent the top coating.
   The buffer layer grains had < 001 > ND, i.e. normal direction,
   orientation near their interface with the substrate. The top coating was
   separated from the buffer layer by a distinct epitaxially grown
   austenitic layer. In none the cladding layers, the texture of the
   austenite was as strong as that of the ferrite. While in the buffer
   layer, the austenite grains had close Nishiyama-Wasserman orientation
   relationship with respect to the parent ferrite, Kurdjumov-Sachs
   relationship was observed across the top coating. Both the ferrite and
   austenite phases had significant fraction of low angle grain boundaries
   across the cladding, but the mount of austenite grain boundaries with
   high angle grain boundaries with low Sigma special character was higher.
   Moreover, the austenite showed higher levels of stored energy in both
   layers. The total fraction of low Sigma boundaries was also higher in
   the top coating compared to the buffer layer. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, a detailed study of the luminescent properties of Nd3+
   ions in sputtered ZnO thin films is reported for the first time.
   Experimental evidence is provided showing that Nd is inserted and
   optically active in the ZnO matrix. Despite the small amount (<2\%) of
   rare earth in these thin ZnO films, intense luminescence signals have
   been collected, indicating efficient infrared emission of Nd3+ in ZnO.
   Direct excitation of Nd3+ ions in the ZnO matrix was possible,
   suggesting that most of the Nd atoms are in the 3+ form at all
   deposition temperatures. Moreover, intense Nd3+ emission has been
   recorded also when the host was excited, indicating that an efficient
   energy transfer occurs from ZnO to Nd ions. Both the transfer efficiency
   and the Nd3+ concentration seem to depend on the deposition temperature.
   In particular, indirect excitation of the sample deposited at 400
   degrees C generates a richer emission pattern compared to lower
   temperatures. The careful analysis of the luminescence data indicated
   that the new pattern comes from Nd sites that cannot be efficiently
   directly excited, but that are characterized by intense emission under
   indirect excitation of the host. The possible transfer mechanisms
   leading to this behavior will be outlined.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Electrochemical conversion reactions of transition metal compounds
   create opportunities for large energy storage capabilities exceeding
   modern Li-ion batteries. However, for practical electrodes to be
   envisaged, a detailed understanding of their mechanisms is needed,
   especially vis-a-vis the voltage hysteresis observed between reduction
   and oxidation. Here, we present such insight at scales from local atomic
   arrangements to whole electrodes. NiO was chosen as a simple model
   system. The most important finding is that the voltage hysteresis has
   its origin in the differing chemical pathways during reduction and
   oxidation. This asymmetry is enabled by the presence of small metallic
   clusters and, thus, is likely to apply to other transition metal oxide
   systems. The presence of nanoparticles also influences the
   electrochemical activity of the electrolyte and its degradation products
   and can create differences in transport properties within an electrode,
   resulting in localized reactions around converted domains that lead to
   compositional inhomogeneities at the microscale.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium alloys components are potentially used under shock loading
   conditions. Considering the fact that deformation behavior is completely
   different under high strain rate conditions compared to quasi-static
   conditions, it is very important to evaluate the dynamic mechanical
   response and deformation mechanisms of magnesium alloys under impact
   loading. In this research, texture formation, microstructural changes
   and dynamic deformation behavior of rolled AZ31B in the tempered H24
   stress-relieved conditions, shock-loaded under compressive dynamic
   loading, were investigated. Texture measurements showed that the
   as-received AZ31B alloy had a strong (00.2) basal texture. Four groups
   of cylindrical samples were cut in the rolling direction (RD), in 45
   degrees to the RD, in the transverse direction (TD) and in the direction
   perpendicular to the RD-TD plane. Dynamic shock loading of the test
   samples were conducted using Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar at room
   temperature at strain rates ranging from 600 to 1100 s(-1), while
   loading direction was parallel to the longitudinal axis of the
   cylindrical samples. After high strain rate deformation, although the
   loading direction was different, a strong (00.2) basal texture was
   observed in all samples. It was inferred that increasing the strain rate
   led to an increase in strength and ductility, but to a decrease in
   twinning fraction, indicating the possible activation of non-basal < c+a
   > slip systems. Besides, a high degree of mechanical anisotropy was
   found for all strain rates used such that the lowest strength was
   registered for the samples cut along the direction parallel to the
   rolling direction. A viscoplastic self-consistent model with a tangent
   approach was used to corroborate the experimental textures and possible
   deformation mechanisms by simulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The present study deals with the synthesis of mesoporous sulfated
   Ti-SBA-15 (with Si/Ti ratio varying from 10 to 80) and these catalysts
   were used for preparation of biodiesel from unrefined canola oil. The
   physico-chemical properties of the catalyst were analyzed by FT-IR,
   pyridine FT-IR, N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, X-ray diffraction
   analysis (XRD), X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES),
   NH3-temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. It was
   observed that the sulfation of Ti-SBA-15 increases the extent of
   transesterification by fourfold. Taguchi methodology (L-9 orthogonal
   array) was used to optimize the reaction parameters such as temperature,
   methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst loading and reaction time towards
   methyl ester (biodiesel) formation through simultaneous esterification
   and transesterification reaction. Reaction time and temperature were
   found to be the most significant reaction parameters. In this study, 1
   wt\% catalyst yielded 91 wt\% ester in 4 h when 15:1 methanol to oil
   molar ratio was used at 200 degrees C. The catalyst was found to be
   reusable when studied upto 3 cycles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{CATALYSIS TODAY}},

Volume = {{237}},

Abstract = {{A catalyst of Pt nanoparticles was prepared by atomic layer deposition
   on SrTiO3 nanocuboids and tested for methanol decomposition and partial
   oxidation. The catalyst had uniform nanoparticle size of 1.58 +/- 0.37
   nm and a Pt (1 1 1) surface. In situ X-ray absorption near-edge
   spectroscopy (XANES) measured in a temperature-programmed reduction
   showed that the Pt particles were easily reduced. However, the
   as-received catalyst, a reduced catalyst, and an oxidized catalyst all
   had catalytic activity, differing slightly in methanol conversion and
   product selectivity. In situ XANES also revealed that CO adsorbed on the
   Pt sites was the only observed surface species during both methanol
   decomposition and partial oxidation. It seemed that the breakage of CH
   and OH bonds overwhelmingly occurred once methanol was adsorbed, forming
   H-2 and adsorbed CO. The latter was then released from the catalyst
   surface or was oxidized to CO2 when O-2 was present. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Multiscale renormalization group (RG) methods are reviewed and applied
   to the analysis of the effective potential for radiative symmetry
   breaking with multiple scalar fields, allowing an extension of the
   Gildener and Weinberg method beyond the weak coupling limit. A model
   containing two interacting real scalar fields is used to illustrate
   multiscale RG methods and the multiscale RG functions of this model are
   calculated to one-loop order for the beta function and two-loop order
   for the anomalous mass dimension. The introduction of an extra
   renormalization scale allows the mapping of the effective potential in
   this model onto a RG-equivalent form with an O(2) symmetric structure
   along a particular trajectory in the multiple renormalization-scale
   space, leading to a simplified form of the effective potential. It is
   demonstrated that the physical content of the effective potential in the
   original model, referenced to a single conventional renormalization
   scale, can be extracted from a particular RG trajectory that connects to
   this multiscale O(2)-symmetric form of the effective potential.
   Extensions of these multiscale methods for effective potentials in
   models containing multiple scalars with O(M) x O(N) symmetry are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Electrically conducting scaffolds have attracted tremendous attention in
   skeletal muscle tissue engineering. In this paper,
   poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs)
   composite fibrous scaffolds were fabricated using the electrospinning
   technique. The physical properties of the composite fibers were
   characterized and proliferation and differentiation of C2C12 cells on
   these scaffolds were examined. It was found that the addition of MWNTs
   modulated the physical properties of PLGA fibers including morphology,
   fiber diameter, degradation, tensile strength and electrical
   conductivity, depending on the amount of MWNTs. These fibrous scaffolds
   were cytocompatible and supported the proliferation of C2C12 cells.
   Importantly, C2C12 cells showed more mature myotube formation on
   PLGA/MWNTs composite fibrous scaffolds compared to PLGA scaffolds. These
   results indicate that PLGA/MWNTs composite electrospun fibers have great
   potential in skeletal muscle tissue engineering. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Al interlayer is precoated on pure iron or steel substrates for diamond
   film deposition. Microstructures and compositions around the interfacial
   region of diamond film/Al interlayer/substrates have been
   comprehensively analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
   Using only a simple Al thin layer is not sufficient, as the integrity of
   the Al interlayer is easily destroyed during scratching pretreatment.
   Consequently, the continuity of diamond film is damaged and local
   carburization corrosion occurs on the substrate. The carburization
   products primarily consist of voluminous graphite and a large number of
   fine particles of iron carbide are dispersed at the interfacial region,
   inducing deteriorated interfacial adhesion. To solve it an
   interdiffusion pretreatment of Al interlayer under annealing vacuum is
   required. The results show that a Fe-Al alloy facilitated the formation
   of a protective Al oxide layer and improved the diamond film deposition.
   However, the surface aluminizing process needs to be further optimized,
   as indicated by a comparison with the diamond deposition directly on
   Fe-Cr-Al bulk alloy substrate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We have systematically studied the structural, electronic and mechanical
   properties of a novel superhard sp(3) carbon allotrope (Amm2-carbon)
   based on the density functional theory (DFT). This carbon allotrope was
   identified using a developed methodology in the theoretical design of
   superhard materials based on the CALYPSO algorithm, and predicted to be
   more stable than graphite for pressures above 16.6GPa. It is found to be
   dynamically stable and a semiconductor with an insulator with a direct
   band gap of approximately 4.18 eV. Moreover, the calculated elastic
   constants for Amm2-carbon satisfy the stability condition. Calculations
   of bulk modulus and hardness indicate that this Amm2-carbon is an
   ultra-incompressible and superhard material. Furthermore, we extensively
   investigated the stress-strain relations of Amm2-carbon under various
   tensile and shear loading directions. The present results indicate
   Amm2-carbon is a superhard material. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2014}},

Abstract = {{In this research, direct numerical simulation has been performed to
   study the turbulent wake behind a wall-mounted square cylinder with
   aspect ratio 4 and Reynolds number 12 000 (based on the free-stream

   to the relatively high Reynolds number and high aspect ratio of the

   exhibits complex and energetic vortex motions. The lateral and tip
   vortex shedding patterns at different frequencies, coherent structures
   downstream of the obstacle, the production rate and distribution of
   turbulent kinetic energy, and the instantaneous pressure distribution in
   the wake region have been thoroughly investigated. In order to validate
   the numerical results, the first-and second-order flow statistics

Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{20779-20799}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new low complexity and lossless image compression
   system for capsule endoscopy (CE) is presented. The compressor consists
   of a low-cost YEF color space converter and variable-length predictive
   with a combination of Golomb-Rice and unary encoding. All these
   components have been heavily optimized for low-power and low-cost and
   lossless in nature. As a result, the entire compression system does not
   incur any loss of image information. Unlike transform based algorithms,
   the compressor can be interfaced with commercial image sensors which
   send pixel data in raster-scan fashion that eliminates the need of
   having large buffer memory. The compression algorithm is capable to work
   with white light imaging (WLI) and narrow band imaging (NBI) with
   average compression ratio of 78\% and 84\% respectively. Finally, a
   complete capsule endoscopy system is developed on a single, low-power,
   65-nm field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) chip. The prototype is
   developed using circular PCBs having a diameter of 16 mm. Several
   in-vivo and ex-vivo trials using pig's intestine have been conducted
   using the prototype to validate the performance of the proposed lossless
   compression algorithm. The results show that, compared with all other
   existing works, the proposed algorithm offers a solution to wireless
   capsule endoscopy with lossless and yet acceptable level of compression.}},

Abstract = {{Genes associated with similar diseases are often functionally related.
   This principle is largely supported by many biological data sources,
   such as disease phenotype similarities, protein complexes,
   protein-protein interactions, pathways and gene expression profiles.
   Integrating multiple types of biological data is an effective method to
   identify disease genes for many genetic diseases. To capture the
   gene-disease associations based on biological networks, a kernel-based
   Markov random field (MRF) method is proposed by combining graph kernels
   and the MRF method. In the proposed method, three kinds of kernels are
   employed to describe the overall relationships of vertices in five
   biological networks, respectively, and a novel weighted MRF method is
   developed to integrate those data. In addition, an improved Gibbs
   sampling procedure and a novel parameter estimation method are proposed
   to generate predictions from the kernel-based MRF method. Numerical
   experiments are carried out by integrating known gene-disease
   associations, protein complexes, protein-protein interactions, pathways
   and gene expression profiles. The proposed kernel-based MRF method is
   evaluated by the leave-one-out cross validation paradigm, achieving an
   AUC score of 0.771 when integrating all those biological data in our
   experiments, which indicates that our proposed method is very promising
   compared with many existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of disease-causing genes among a large number of
   candidates is a fundamental challenge in human disease studies. However,
   it is still time-consuming and laborious to determine the real
   disease-causing genes by biological experiments. With the advances of
   the high-throughput techniques, a large number of protein-protein
   interactions have been produced. Therefore, to address this issue,
   several methods based on protein interaction network have been proposed.
   In this paper, we propose a shortest path-based algorithm, named
   SPranker, to prioritize disease-causing genes in protein interaction
   networks. Considering the fact that diseases with similar phenotypes are
   generally caused by functionally related genes, we further propose an
   improved algorithm SPGOranker by integrating the semantic similarity of
   gene ontology (GO) annotations. SPGOranker not only considers the
   topological similarity between protein pairs in a protein interaction
   network but also takes their functional similarity into account. The
   proposed algorithms SPranker and SPGOranker were applied to 1598 known
   orphan disease-causing genes from 172 orphan diseases and compared with
   three state-of-the-art approaches, ICN, VS and RWR. The experimental
   results show that SPranker and SPGOranker outperform ICN, VS, and RWR
   for the prioritization of orphan disease-causing genes. Importantly, for
   the case study of severe combined immunodeficiency, SPranker and
   SPGOranker predict several novel causal genes.}},

   was observed that the new number density model depends on vortex size,
   local turbulent kinetic energy, and dissipation rate. Moreover, the new

   in-transit microclimate, and calf welfare. Transport factors evaluated
   included vehicle speed, space allowance, compartment within trailer, and
   transit duration. Calves were transported for 7 h 44 min +/- 4 h 15 min,
   with space allowances ranging from 0.56 to 1.17 m(2)/animal. Compartment
   within trailer, space allowance, and vehicle speed did not affect the
   difference between compartment ceiling-level and ambient temperatures
   during a 30-min period of steady-state microclimate. During the
   steady-state period, a 1 degrees C increase in ambient temperature above
   the mean of 5.6 degrees C was associated with a 0.62 degrees C decrease
   in the difference between ceiling-level and ambient temperature (P <
   0.01). Ceiling-level temperature and humidity during the first 400 min
   of transport could be predicted by ambient conditions and vehicle speed
   (pseudo-r(2) of 0.91 and 0.82 for temperature and humidity ratio; P <
   0.01). Events when animal-level temperature-humidity index (THI) was
   classified as above the ``danger{''} level lasted for 10.2 +/- 4.1
   consecutive minutes. Ambient and ceiling-level THI values were not
   classified as above ``danger{''} for 90.0 and 84.9\% of animal-level
   events. Ambient and ceiling-level THI were 5.0 +/- 2.1 and 4.7 +/- 2.0
   degrees Flower than animal-level THI during periods of disagreement,
   respectively. The majority of calves arrived in good condition and
   biochemical indicators of calf welfare were within reference ranges for
   healthy cattle. Within the study population, high pre-transport cortisol
   and hematocrit were associated with elevated post-transport values (P <
   0.01). A 1\% increase in shrink during the weaning to loading interval
   (24 or 48 h) decreased transportation shrink by 0.26 +/- 0.04\% when
   average animal-level temperature was greater than 5 degrees C and
   decreased transportation shrink by 0.11 +/- 0.04\% when average
   animal-level temperature was less than 5 degrees C (P < 0.01). We
   inferred that the study results support future investigation of the
   extension of in-transit microclimate as a risk factor for post-transport
   treatment for disease. The study also provided correction factors for
   estimating in-transit microclimate that could assist in evaluation of
   transportation management and decisions affecting profitability and calf
   welfare.}},

Abstract = {{Nineteen loads of commercial feeder cattle (BW 376 +/- 39 kg, mean +/-
   SD) transported for 18 +/- 4.5 h in summer and winter seasons were used
   to collect data on internal temperature and humidity conditions in the
   deck and belly compartment of pot-bellied trailers and their
   relationship with shrink, cortisol, and morbidity. Measurements of
   temperature or humidity at ceiling or animal level did not vary with
   transportation factors. Temperature and humidity ratio was greater at
   animal-level than ambient conditions during non-highway travel and
   stationary periods (P < 0.01). During the 3 time periods evaluated
   within journeys, there was a larger difference between animal-level and
   ambient conditions during the winter than during the summer (P < 0.01);
   however, this difference was not associated with other transport factors
   (P > 0.05). Evening loads (1700 and 2100 h) experienced more shrink in
   the summer than in the winter (11.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 9.0 +/- 0.5\% of BW; P =
   0.03). A 1 degrees C increase in difference between average animal-level
   temperature in transit and the mean ambient temperature during the 10 d
   before transport was associated with a 0.11 +/- 0.03\% of BW increase in
   shrink (P < 0.01) and 0.006 +/- 0.002 ng/mL increase in post-transport
   cortisol concentration (P = 0.05). Animal-level temperature-humidity
   index (THI) events (consecutive observations of THI greater than 78
   degrees F) were more likely to last for longer than 1 h when the trailer
   was stationary vs. traveling (mean = 1.8, confidence level 95\% = 1.33,
   2.52). During THI events at animal level, the disagreement with ambient
   temperature regarding THI classification was lower when the vehicle was
   traveling vs. stationary (95.5 +/- 0.01\% vs. 99.7 +/- 0.002\% of THI
   event in disagreement; P < 0.01) and was greatest in events less than 1
   h (99.8 +/- 0.0\% vs. 91.7 +/- 0.03\% of THI event in disagreement; P <
   0.01). The average magnitude of the difference during these events was
   11.4 +/- 7.6 degrees F and was not affected by transportation factors (P
   > 0.05). Despite association between indicators of calf welfare and
   microclimate, all cattle arrived in good condition and there was 0.96\%
   treatment rate within the first 30 d after arrival. Management and
   auditing decisions related to transportation of feeder cattle should
   consider the relationship between animal-level and ambient conditions
   and conditions before transportation. Under the commercial conditions of
   the current study, the transportation process did not appear to cause
   distress according to the dimensions of animal welfare that were
   assessed.}},

Abstract = {{Bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID) is a
   bandwidth-efficient technique for both additive white Gaussian noise and
   fading channels. The asymptotic performance of BICM-ID is strongly
   determined by how the coded bits are mapped to the symbols of the signal
   constellation. In this paper an explicit mapping method is presented for
   32-QAM using two criteria: (i) maximization of the minimum Euclidean
   distance between the symbols with Hamming distance one, and (ii)
   minimizing the number of symbols which have jointly the minimum Hamming
   distance and the minimum Euclidean distance from each other. Our method
   is much simpler than the previously-known methods. Compared to
   previously-known best mapping, the mapping obtained by our method
   performs significantly better in a BICM-ID system implemented with
   hard-decision feedback, while its asymptotic performance is almost the
   same in a BICM-ID system using soft-decision feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Buildings are responsible for a significant portion of the global energy
   consumption. In particular, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning
   (HVAC) systems in buildings consume significant amounts of energy.
   Liquid desiccant dehumidification and energy recovery are effective
   energy conservation technologies in HVAC systems. Direct-contact liquid
   desiccant air-conditioning systems have the risk of carry-over of
   aerosol droplets to the supply airstream, which may cause health
   problems for occupants and corrosion of the ducting system.
   Liquid-to-air membrane energy exchanger (LAMEE) is a novel
   semi-permeable membrane-based liquid desiccant energy exchanger, which
   transfer heat and moisture simultaneously but can eliminate the
   desiccant solution aerosol carry-over problem. Two LAMEEs can also be
   used to constitute a run-around membrane energy exchanger (RAMEE) system
   to recover heat and moisture from exhaust air in buildings. In the past
   decade, research and development of LAMEEs has been very active to show
   that high effectiveness is possible. This paper presents a comprehensive
   review of the design and performance of LAMEEs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Fe-Co-V alloys are of interest due to their excellent magnetic
   properties. These alloys are frequently used in the active parts of
   rotors of synchronous hysteresis motors. Welding of these alloys is
   however a great challenge because of various phase transitions occurring
   during solidification. These phase transitions change the
   microstructural, physical and mechanical properties of Fe-Co-V alloys.
   In this research work, the effect of electron beam welding on the
   magnetic properties of nanograin-sized Fe-Co-7.15wt\%V foils was
   studied. Microstructural observation and texture analysis were carried
   out in order to clarify the changes of magnetic properties in the welded
   area. It was found that the magnetic properties of the welded area
   experience significant decrease due to the formation of large grains
   that have unfavorable orientation in the fusion zone. Also, a
   statistical analysis of the electron beam welding of this alloy was done
   using response surface methodology. The analysis considered the effect
   of beam current (0.7-1.7 mA), beam voltage (40-50 kV), welding speed
   (150-500 mm/min) and focused position (-20 to 0 mm) on the energy
   product ((BH)(max)) of welded samples. The experimental design was based
   on four-factor, five-level central composite rotatable design using
   linear and quadratic polynomial equations for proposing the mathematical
   model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rectorite-TiO2-Fe3O4 (RTF) composites were assembled by orderly
   depositing anatase TiO2 and magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles on rectorite
   (REC) surfaces. Rectorite-TiO2 (RT) and RTF composites were
   characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). TiO2
   particles partially exfoliated the REC layers, while Fe3O4 particles
   completely exfoliated the REC sheets. Fe3O4 particles was absorbed by
   REC and consequently appeared on its surface instead of being on the
   TiO2 particles. RTF can be easily separated from aqueous solution by
   magnet. The adsorption and photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) by RT
   and RTF were also investigated. The kinetic adsorption fit the
   pseudo-second-order model and the isotherm data followed the Langmuir
   model. The maximum adsorption capacities for MB were 187.61 and 169.20
   mg/g for RT and RTF, respectively. RTF exhibited a good capability for
   removal of MB from aqueous solution, and about 95\% MB was removed after
   12 h UV-light irradiation, and about 75\% MB removal for RT. And RTF
   exhibited the similar photocatalytic activity with RT for the persistent
   organic pollutant 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) under UV irradiation. (C) 2014

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Gasification of glucose in supercritical water with and without
   catalysts (NaOH and Ni based) was investigated at 400 degrees C and 500
   degrees C with a residence time of 30 min. The products from glucose
   gasification without catalyst consist of similar to 8-17 wt.\% gas,
   21-24 wt.\% solid, 9-16 wt.\% acetone phase and 8-10 wt.\% water phase.
   As expected, all the gas product yields increased by an increase in
   process temperature and higher water to biomass ratio benefits the
   yields of gas phase and water phase. For the experimental runs with
   catalysts, NaOH had the best activity for improving H-2 formation, the
   H-2 yield increased by 135\% with NaOH compared to that for run without
   catalyst at 500 degrees C with water to biomass ratio of 3. At the same
   operating conditions, the presence of Ni/activated carbon (AC)
   contributed to 81\% increase in H-2 yield, followed by 62\% with Ni/MgO,
   60\% with Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 and 52\% with Ni/Al2O3. The net effect of Ni was
   studied by using activated carbon and Ni/AC at 500 degrees C with water
   to biomass ratio of 7 for 30 mm. The results showed that the hydrogen
   production was further increased by 6.9\% with activated carbon and
   36.9\% with Ni/AC. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the texture evolution, microstructure and
   mechanical behavior of WE43 magnesium sheet at high strain rates are
   investigated. Samples cut along the rolling direction (RD), 45 degrees
   from the RD, transverse direction (TD) and perpendicular to the RD-TD
   plane were tested at strain rates of 800, 1200 and 1400 s (1) using
   Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar. It is observed that after shock loading,
   the initial weak texture converts to a weak (00.2) basal texture in all
   samples. Besides, it is found that the strength and ductility increase
   and twinning fraction decreases with increase in strain rate. Moreover,
   another effect of increase in strain rate is found to be the higher
   activation of pyramidal < c + a > slip systems. In addition, degree of
   stress and strain anisotropy is low particularly at higher strain rates,
   which is mainly related to the weak initial texture of the samples. A
   viscoplastic self-consistent model with a tangent approach is used to
   analyze the deformation mechanism during shock loading. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We study the electronic properties of the FeSe(1-)xTe(x) system (x = 0,
   0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1) from the perspective of X-ray spectroscopy and
   density functional theory (DFT). The analysis performed on the density
   of states reveals marked differences in the distribution of the 5p
   states of Te for x > 0. We think that this finding can be associated
   with the fact that superconductivity is suppressed in FeTe. Moreover,
   using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, we estimate the spin state of
   our system which can be correlated to the magnetic order. We find that
   the spin state of the FeSe1xTex system fluctuates, as a function of x,
   between S = 0 and S = 2 with Fe in FeSe in the highest spin state.
   Finally, our DFT calculations nicely reproduce the X-ray emission
   spectra performed at the Fe L-edge (which probe the occupied states) and
   suggest that the FeSe1xTex system can be considered at most as a
   moderately correlated system.}},

Abstract = {{Due to increasing global energy concerns, alternative sustainable
   methods to create energy such as thermoelectric energy conversion have
   become increasingly important. Originally, research into thermoelectric
   materials was focused on tellurides of bismuth and lead because of the
   exemplary thermoelectric properties of Bi2Te3 and PbTe. These materials,
   however, contain toxic lead and tellurium, which is also scarce and thus
   expensive. A viable alternative material may exist in Mg2Si, which needs
   to be doped and alloyed in order to achieve reasonable thermoelectric
   efficiency. Doping is a major problem, as p-type doping has thus far not
   produced competitive efficiencies, and n-type doping is problematic
   because of the tow solubility of the typical dopants Sb and Bi. This
   investigation shows experimentally that these dopants can indeed replace
   Si in the crystal lattice, and excess Sb and Bi atoms are present in the
   grain boundaries in the form of Mg3Sb2 and Mg3Bi2. As a consequence, the
   carrier concentration is lower than the formal Sb/Bi concentration
   suggests, and the thermal conductivity is significantly reduced. DFT
   calculations are in good agreement with the experimental data, including
   the band gap and the Seebeck coefficient. Overall, this results in
   competitive efficiencies despite the low carrier concentration. While
   ball-milling was previously shown to enhance the solubility of the
   dopants and thus the carrier concentration, this did not lead to
   enhanced thermoelectric properties.}},

Title = {{Identifying disease genes by integrating multiple data sources}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Now multiple types of data are available for identifying
   disease genes. Those data include gene disease associations, disease
   phenotype similarities, protein-protein interactions, pathways, gene
   expression profiles, etc.. It is believed that integrating different
   kinds of biological data is an effective method to identify disease
   genes.
   Results: In this paper, we propose a multiple data integration method
   based on the theory of Markov random field (MRF) and the method of
   Bayesian analysis for identifying human disease genes. The proposed
   method is not only flexible in easily incorporating different kinds of
   data, but also reliable in predicting candidate disease genes.
   Conclusions: Numerical experiments are carried out by integrating known
   gene-disease associations, protein complexes, protein-protein
   interactions, pathways and gene expression profiles. Predictions are
   evaluated by the leave-one-out method. The proposed method achieves an
   AUC score of 0.743 when integrating all those biological data in our
   experiments.}},

Title = {{Prediction of disease-related genes based on weighted tissue-specific
   networks by using DNA methylation}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Predicting disease-related genes is one of the most
   important tasks in bioinformatics and systems biology. With the advances
   in high-throughput techniques, a large number of protein-protein
   interactions are available, which make it possible to identify
   disease-related genes at the network level. However, network-based
   identification of disease-related genes is still a challenge as the
   considerable false-positives are still existed in the current available
   protein interaction networks (PIN).
   Results: Considering the fact that the majority of genetic disorders
   tend to manifest only in a single or a few tissues, we constructed
   tissue-specific networks (TSN) by integrating PIN and tissue-specific
   data. We further weighed the constructed tissue-specific network (WTSN)
   by using DNA methylation as it plays an irreplaceable role in the
   development of complex diseases. A PageRank-based method was developed
   to identify disease-related genes from the constructed networks. To
   validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we constructed PIN,
   weighted PIN (WPIN), TSN, WTSN for colon cancer and leukemia,
   respectively. The experimental results on colon cancer and leukemia show
   that the combination of tissue-specific data and DNA methylation can
   help to identify disease-related genes more accurately. Moreover, the
   PageRank-based method was effective to predict disease-related genes on
   the case studies of colon cancer and leukemia.
   Conclusions: Tissue-specific data and DNA methylation are two important
   factors to the study of human diseases. The same method implemented on
   the WTSN can achieve better results compared to those being implemented
   on original PIN, WPIN, or TSN. The PageRank-based method outperforms
   degree centrality-based method for identifying disease-related genes
   from WTSN.}},

Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Tissue specificity is an important aspect of many genetic
   diseases in the context of genetic disorders as the disorder affects
   only few tissues. Therefore tissue specificity is important in
   identifying disease-gene associations. Hence this paper seeks to discuss
   the impact of using tissue specificity in predicting new disease-gene
   associations and how to use tissue specificity along with phenotype
   information for a particular disease.
   Methods: In order to find out the impact of using tissue specificity for
   predicting new disease-gene associations, this study proposes a novel
   method called tissue-specified genes to construct tissues-specific
   gene-gene networks for different tissue samples. Subsequently, these
   networks are used with phenotype details to predict disease genes by
   using Katz method. The proposed method was compared with three other
   tissue-specific network construction methods in order to check its
   effectiveness. Furthermore, to check the possibility of using
   tissue-specific gene-gene network instead of generic protein-protein
   network at all time, the results are compared with three other methods.
   Results: In terms of leave-one-out cross validation, calculation of the
   mean enrichment and ROC curves indicate that the proposed approach
   outperforms existing network construction methods. Furthermore
   tissues-specific gene-gene networks make a more positive impact on
   predicting disease-gene associations than generic protein-protein
   interaction networks.
   Conclusions: In conclusion by integrating tissue-specific data it
   enabled prediction of known and unknown disease-gene associations for a
   particular disease more effectively. Hence it is better to use
   tissue-specific gene-gene network whenever possible. In addition the
   proposed method is a better way of constructing tissue-specific
   gene-gene networks.}},

Abstract = {{Background: As an abstract mapping of the gene regulations in the cell,
   gene regulatory network is important to both biological research study
   and practical applications. The reverse engineering of gene regulatory
   networks from microarray gene expression data is a challenging research
   problem in systems biology. With the development of biological
   technologies, multiple time-course gene expression datasets might be
   collected for a specific gene network under different circumstances. The
   inference of a gene regulatory network can be improved by integrating
   these multiple datasets. It is also known that gene expression data may
   be contaminated with large errors or outliers, which may affect the
   inference results.
   Results: A novel method, Huber group LASSO, is proposed to infer the
   same underlying network topology from multiple time-course gene
   expression datasets as well as to take the robustness to large error or
   outliers into account. To solve the optimization problem involved in the
   proposed method, an efficient algorithm which combines the ideas of
   auxiliary function minimization and block descent is developed. A
   stability selection method is adapted to our method to find a network
   topology consisting of edges with scores. The proposed method is applied
   to both simulation datasets and real experimental datasets. It shows
   that Huber group LASSO outperforms the group LASSO in terms of both
   areas under receiver operating characteristic curves and areas under the
   precision-recall curves.
   Conclusions: The convergence analysis of the algorithm theoretically
   shows that the sequence generated from the algorithm converges to the
   optimal solution of the problem. The simulation and real data examples
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the Huber group LASSO in integrating
   multiple time-course gene expression datasets and improving the
   resistance to large errors or outliers.}},

Abstract = {{The subsurface urban heat island (SubUHI) is one part of the overall UHI
   specifying the relative warmth of urban ground temperatures against the
   rural background. To combat the challenge on measuring extensive
   underground temperatures with in situ instruments, we utilized
   satellite-based moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer data to
   reconstruct the subsurface thermal field over the Beijing metropolis
   through a three-time-scale model. The results show the SubUHI's high
   spatial heterogeneity. Within the depths shallower than 0.5 m, the
   SubUHI dominates along the depth profiles and analyses imply the moments
   for the SubUHI intensity reaching first and second extremes during a
   diurnal temperature cycle are delayed about 3.25 and 1.97 h per 0.1 m,
   respectively. At depths shallower than 0.05 m in particular, there is a
   subsurface urban cool island (UCI) in spring daytime, mainly owing to
   the surface UCI that occurs in this period. At depths between 0.5 and 10
   m, the time for the SubUHI intensity getting to its extremes during an
   annual temperature cycle is lagged 26.2 days per meter. Within these
   depths, the SubUHI prevails without exception, with an average intensity
   of 4.3 K, varying from 3.2 to 5.3 K.}},

Abstract = {{The mesospheric nightglow spectrum is replete with OH Meinel band
   emissions, from the midvisible to the midinfrared. These emissions
   provide a wealth of aeronomic information, giving a physical view of the
   chemistry and dynamics of the upper atmosphere. The Optical Spectrograph
   and Infrared Imaging System (OSIRIS) instrument, on the Odin satellite,
   is currently one of the few satellite instruments that simultaneously
   observes emissions from multiple and separate Meinel bands. This has
   allowed the derivation of near-global data sets of nighttime OH volume
   emission rate profiles for the Meinel (5-1), (8-3), and (9-4) bands. The
   2002-2013 climatologies consistently show that emission from bands in
   higher upper vibrational levels peaks at higher altitudes. The global
   average (5-1), (8-3), and (9-4) band emission peak heights are at
   altitudes of 86.0 km, 86.7 km, and 87.1 km, respectively. The 1 sigma
   variation in the (5-1), (8-3), and (9-4) band, peak heights are 1.8 km,
   1.9 km, and 1.9 km, respectively. The climatological (30 day, 10 degrees
   latitude) peak heights can vary significantly with both time and
   latitude; however, the (5-1) band climatological peak height is nearly
   always below that of the (8-3) band, which is nearly always below that
   of the (9-4) band. The temporal variation in the emission peak height
   can have a significant impact on measurements of OH rotational
   temperatures from ground-based observations of the OH layer. It was
   found that omitting the profile climatology can bias a ground-based
   temperature measurement by as much as +/- 4 K and can also make
   ground-based measurements susceptible to nonrealistic temperature
   variations.}},

Abstract = {{A novel iterative receiver is proposed for relay-assisted multiuser
   communications in which multiple users transmit to a destination with
   the help of a relay and using fast frequency-hopping modulation. Each
   user employs a channel encoder to protect its information and facilitate
   interference cancellation at the receiver. The signal received at the
   relay is either amplified, or partially decoded with a simple energy
   detector, before being forwarded to the destination. The proposed
   iterative receiver exploits the soft outputs of a channel decoder to
   successively extract the maximum-likelihood symbols of the users and
   perform interference cancellation. Under the same spectral efficiency,
   simulation results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed
   receiver when compared to the performance of an interference
   cancellation scheme that was previously proposed for multiuser
   communications and is extended to multiuser amplify-and-forward relaying
   considered in this study, as well as performance of the
   maximum-likelihood multiuser detection for uncoded transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Mineralization of benzotriazole (BTZ) by heterogeneous catalytic
   ozonation was studied in aqueous phase. Performance of three catalysts
   (Mn/Al2O3, Cu/Al2O3 and Mn-Cu/Al2O3) were compared at various pH levels
   and operating conditions. Compared to noncatalytic ozonation, a higher
   level of mineralization of BTZ was achieved over a wide range of pH
   values. Adsorption of BTZ on alumina support and catalysts was
   negligible. At neutral pH, Cu/Al2O3 was the most effective catalyst with
   close to 90\% mineralization in 15 min reaction time. At pH 2, Mn/Al2O3
   had the fastest ozone decomposition and the fastest reaction with 75\%
   mineralization of BTZ in 10 min. Under an alkaline pH environment, the
   mineralization of BTZ by using Cu/Al2O3 showed a weak catalytic activity
   (22\%) whereas mineralization with Mn-Cu/Al2O3 was 77\% complete in 30
   min of reaction. It was observed that the presence of molecular ozone is
   essential for catalytic oxidation of organic compounds and ozone
   decomposition has a direct relationship with catalyst activity. The
   results indicate that not only the pH of solution but also the type of
   buffer used can influence the catalytic activity. The chloride and
   sulfate ions in aqueous solutions act as hydroxyl radical scavengers.
   All the catalysts showed high stability and reusability. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{To study the microstructural and mechanical behavior of a new
   microalloyed transformation-twinning induced plasticity steel, the
   compression tests were conducted from 25 to 1000 degrees C. Five
   different categories of true stress-true strain curve, exhibiting
   distinctive strain hardening/strain softening and stress fluctuation,
   have been characterized in the range of deformation temperature. The
   experimental steel exhibits the strength of about 1.28 GPa after
   straining to 0.6 along with an outstanding strain hardening rate
   (similar to 2000 MPa) during compression at 25 degrees C. This excellent
   combination of mechanical properties is attributed to the occurrence of
   strain-induced martensite transformation. The martensitic transformation
   continues occurring up to temperatures as high as 150 degrees C, while
   mechanical twinning is considered as the chief deformation mechanism in
   the temperature range of 150-600 degrees C. Furthermore, a banded-like
   structure is observed in the temperature range of 600-1000 degrees C as
   a result of precipitate formation. This banded structure is mainly
   composed of planar slip as well as deformation twins with misorientation
   of about 59 degrees. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   coefficient. An appreciable enhancement in heat flux was observed for
   the 300 degrees C spray pyrolysed alumina coated sample, when compared
   to the bare Cu and 350 degrees C spray pyrolysed alumina coated sample.
   An enhancement of 28.3\% in the heat flux was observed for the 300

Abstract = {{We have performed high sensitivity magnetic measurements for tensile-
   deformed SUS304-type austenitic stainless steel to elucidate a
   relationship between morphology of martensite particles and
   structure-sensitive magnetic hysteresis properties. A monotonic increase
   of the volume fraction of martensite phase up to 14.3\% through strain
   induced martensitic transformation was observed, while coercivity
   exhibits a maximum at around 4.3\% fraction. Measurements of coercivity
   varying the magnetic-field direction against tensile direction revealed
   anisotropy in angular dependence of coercivity that becomes weaker with
   the progress of plastic deformation. These observations were explained
   as due to a change of the size and anisotropy in shape of martensite
   phase with deformation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers joint optimization of cooperative beamforming and
   relay assignment for multi-user multi-relay wireless networks to
   maximize the minimum of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise
   ratios (SINR). Separated continuous optimization of beamforming and
   binary optimization of relay assignment already pose very challenging
   programs. Certainly, their joint optimization, which involves nonconvex
   objectives and coupled constraints in continuous and binary variables,
   is among the most challenging optimization problems. Even the
   conventional relaxation of binary constraints by continuous box
   constraints is still computationally intractable because the relaxed
   program is still highly nonconvex. However, it is shown in this paper
   that the joint programs fit well in the d.c. (difference of two convex
   functions/sets) optimization framework. Efficient optimization
   algorithms are then developed for both cases of orthogonal and
   nonorthogonal transmission by multiple users. Simulation results show
   that the jointly optimized beamforming and relay assignment not only
   save transmission bandwidth but can also maintain well the network
   SINRs.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose was to assess whether precision of bone properties derived
   via the use of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed
   tomography (HR-pQCT) differs between postmenopausal women and young
   adults. Using HR-pQCT, we scanned the distal radius and tibia at 2 time
   points in 34 postmenopausal women (74 +/- 7 years) and 30 young adults
   (mean age +/- SD: 27 +/- 9 years). Standard protocols were used to
   acquire bone area, density, and microarchitectural properties. We
   calculated coefficients of variation (CV; percentage CV and percentage
   CV of the root mean square) and 95\% limits of agreement (95\% LOA) to
   assess precision errors. The 95\% LOA is the magnitude of individual
   change needed to be observed to ensure that a real change has occurred.
   Multiple Mann-Whitney U-tests (with the use of Bonferroni correction for
   multiple comparisons) were used to compare percentage CV between the 2
   groups. Significance was set to p < 0.004. All standard outcome
   variables were not significantly different between the groups. The 95\%
   LOA confirmed that the measurement bias between the groups did not
   differ. These results suggest that short-term precision errors in
   HR-pQCT-derived bone outcomes are similar between postmenopausal women

Abstract = {{Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has recently become a very
   popular unsupervised learning method because of its representational
   properties of factors and simple multiplicative update algorithms for
   solving the NMF. However, for the common NMF approach of minimizing the
   Euclidean distance between approximate and true values, the convergence
   of multiplicative update algorithms has not been well resolved. This
   paper first discusses the convergence of existing multiplicative update
   algorithms. We then propose a new multiplicative update algorithm for
   minimizing the Euclidean distance between approximate and true values.
   Based on the optimization principle and the auxiliary function method,
   we prove that our new algorithm not only converges to a stationary
   point, but also does faster than existing ones. To verify our
   theoretical results, the experiments on three data sets have been
   conducted by comparing our proposed algorithm with other existing
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{High single instruction multiple data (SIMD) efficiency and low power
   consumption have made graphic processing units (GPUs) an ideal platform
   for many complex computational applications. Thousands of threads can be
   created by programmers and grouped into fixed-size SIMD batches, known
   as warps. High throughput is then achieved by concurrently executing
   such warps with minimal control overhead. However, if a branch
   instruction occurs, which assigns different paths to different threads,
   one warp will be broken into multiple warps that have to be executed
   serially, consequently reducing the efficiency advantage of SIMD. In
   this paper, the contemporary fixed-size warp design is abandoned for a
   hybrid warp size (HWS) mechanism. Mixed-size warps are generated
   according to HWS and are scheduled and issued flexibly. The simulation
   results show that this mechanism yields an average speedup of 1.20 over
   the baseline architecture for a wide variety of general purpose GPU
   applications. The paper also integrates HWS with dynamic warp formation
   (DWF), which is a well-known branch handling mechanism used to improve
   SIMD utilization by forming new warps out of split warps in real time.
   The simulation results show that the combination of DWF and HWS
   generates an average speedup of 1.27 over the DWF-only platform with an
   estimated area increase of about 1\% of DWF. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We investigated thermo-mechanical properties of thoria up to a very high
   temperature (3300 K). We demonstrate that, using first-principles
   molecular dynamics, it is possible to predict thermal expansion of
   thoria in agreement with experiment. The new generalized gradient
   approximation functional within the density functional theory predicts,
   in agreement with experiment, not only the relative thermal expansion
   but also the absolute values of the lattice constant as a function of
   temperature. The molecular dynamics approach has an advantage over the
   previously used quasi-harmonic method, because it can be used even at
   temperatures (above 2700 K) where the longitudinal optical mode breaks
   in thoria. The calculated phonon dispersion agrees well with the
   experimental relation, measured using inelastic neutron scattering. The
   temperature, at which the negative frequency in the optical mode
   appears, coincides with the lambda-type pre-melting transition reported
   in thoria. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Respiration Quotient (RQ) is a substrate-dependent respiration
   indicator. The determination of RQ-values from soil gas data obtained
   during the bioremediation of contaminated soils provides useful
   information about whether or not microbial respiration activity is
   specific to the microbial degradation of contaminants. Less attention
   has been paid to the uses of RQ-values for petroleum
   hydrocarbon-contaminated cold-climate soils under a wide range of low
   temperature regimes including sub-zero temperatures. In this study,
   RQ-values were determined for biotreated petroleum
   hydrocarbon-contaminated soils shipped from two cold-region sites and
   were validated using pilot-scale aerobic bioremediation experiments with
   various soil treatments, low temperature regimes and soil types. The
   RQ-values (0.57 to 0.78), empirically determined from CO2 and O-2 in
   soil gas, were consistently close to the theoretical RQ-values for
   target hydrocarbon fractions (0.65-0.8) only when the decrease in
   hydrocarbon concentration was statistically significant in the
   biotreated soils. In addition to the RQ-values, a strong linearity was
   observed in the RQ plots for CO2 production and O-2 consumption, but
   only for the soils in which hydrocarbon biodegradation activity was
   significantly enhanced. Using confirmed hydrocarbon and microbial data
   for the occurrence of hydrocarbon biodegradation, the RQ plot
   characteristics (RQ-values and linearity) proved to be considerably
   relevant to hydrocarbon biodegradation. Due to the substrate-dependency
   of the RQ-values, conventional soil gas monitoring activities involved
   in the bioremediation and management of contaminated soils at remote
   cold sites can be more effective and meaningful by indicating enhanced
   microbial activity specific to petroleum hydrocarbon biodegradation. (C)

Abstract = {{Crude glycerol, bentonite, lignosulfonate, and softwood residue (wood

   pellets for thermochemical conversion to enhance pellet quality for
   transportation and storage. The mass fraction of water of the wheat
   straw and the wood residue used for pelleting were 0.0676 and 0.0949,
   respectively. Wheat straw with crude glycerol, bentonite,
   lignosulfonate, wood residue, and pretreated wood residue with crude
   glycerol were compressed in a single pelleting unit at a temperature of
   95 degrees C. The specific energy consumption, density, dimensional
   stability, tensile strength, calorific value, ash content, and chemical
   composition of the pellets made were determined. Results showed that the
   specific energy consumption for wheat straw pelletization significantly
   decreased with the addition of lignosulfonate, bentonite, wood residue,
   and pretreated wood residue with crude glycerol. With the addition of
   binders chosen in this study, the tensile strength of wheat straw
   pellets was improved with values ranging from 1.13 to 1.63 MPa. There
   was a significant increase in the higher heating value (17.98 MJ kg(-1)
   to 18.77 MJ kg(-1)) when crude glycerol, wood residue, and pretreated
   wood residue were used as binders. The addition of both pretreated and
   non-pretreated wood residue significantly decreased the ash content of

Abstract = {{Variable capacitors are a key component in Radio Frequency Micro
   Electro-Mechanical Systems (RF MEMS). They comprise fixed and flexible
   electrodes. Deformation, or actuation, of the flexible electrode changes
   the capacitance of the capacitor. This way, electrical properties of
   high frequency circuits can be modified. Traditionally, variable
   capacitors are based on a planar layout architecture, while a newer,
   vertical-wall, quasi three-dimensional approach theoretically enables
   increased device performance. Such devices depend on high aspect ratios,
   i.e. relatively high micro structures with very thin walls and gaps. A
   few vertical-wall variable capacitors made of nickel or gold have been
   fabricated to date, using deep X-ray lithography and subsequent
   electroplating (Achenbach et al. 2006; Klymyshyn et al. 2007, 2010) as
   the fabrication approach. They feature, amongst others, excellent
   quality factors of Q a parts per thousand currency sign 95 at 5.6 GHz
   with 50 Omega reactance, but suffer from a very limited tuning range of
   the capacitance value (tuning ratio of, e.g., 1.38:1). The devices
   presented here exploit the same architecture and materials selection,
   resulting in similar, excellent Q-factors, but feature a different
   electrode layout approach, referred to as leveraged-bending. This layout
   is based on pulling a flexible electrode sideways, towards a fixed
   electrode, increasing the capacitance when actuating the variable
   capacitor. The leveraged bending approach theoretically enables
   infinitely high tuning ratios for components with perfect structure
   accuracy. To date, a significantly increased tuning ratio of 1.9:1 has
   been demonstrated. Limiting factors are an electrically non-ideal layout
   geometry chosen as a compromise to increase the fabrication yield, and
   structure deviations of similar to 1.6 mu m from CAD layout to the
   electroplated component. Electrostatic actuation requires voltages
   between 0 and 72 V for capacitance values on the order of C = 0.3 pF at
   device dimensions of about 1.5 mm overall length, 5-10 mu m gap and wall
   widths, and 100 mu m metal height. Device performance measured with a
   vector network analyzer is in 97 \% agreement with simulation results
   based on two-dimensional electrostatic-structural coupling (ANSYS
   Multiphysics) and three-dimensional electromagnetic field simulations
   (Ansoft HFSS). These simulations also indicate that an optimized gap
   geometry will allow to reduce the actuation voltage required by up to 40
   \%.}},

Abstract = {{Biomedical imaging is crucial to the success of bone/cartilage tissue
   engineering (TE) by providing detailed three-dimensional information on
   tissue-engineered scaffolds and associated bone/cartilage growth during
   the healing process. Synchrotron radiation (SR)-based biomedical imaging
   is an emerging technique for this purpose that has been drawing
   considerable recent attention. Due to the unique properties of
   synchrotron light, SR biomedical imaging can provide information that
   conventional X-ray imaging is not able to capture. SR biomedical imaging
   techniques notably differ from conventional imaging in both physics and
   implementation, thus varying with regard to both capability and
   popularity for biomedical imaging applications. In the earlier decade,
   synchrotron-based imaging was used in bone/cartilage TE to characterize
   bone/cartilage scaffolds and tissues as well as the varying degrees of
   success in reconstruction. However, several key issues should be
   addressed through research before SR biomedical imaging can be advanced
   to a noninvasive method for application to live animals and eventually
   to human patients. This review briefly presents recent developments in
   this area, focusing on different synchrotron-based biomedical imaging
   techniques and their advantages and limitations, as well as reported
   applications to bone and cartilage TE. Key issues and challenges are
   also identified and discussed along with recommendations for future

Abstract = {{The evolution of crystallographic texture during pilgering of Zircaloy-4
   was studied experimentally and determined using crystal plasticity
   simulations. The pilgered samples showed a characteristic texture with
   0002 poles aligned away from the circumferential direction towards the
   axial as well as the radial direction. The texture remained similar but
   weakened on further annealing. The evolution of residual stresses was
   recorded at the macroscopic (type III) as well as microscopic (type II
   intergranular and type I intragranular) level. Crystal plasticity
   simulations indicated that the high stresses involved during pilgering
   enabled the activity of basal slip at room temperature in Zircaloy-4. It
   has been shown that high intergranular type II stresses are most
   deleterious for pilgering and limit the amount of strain achieved in a
   single step. It is therefore, proposed that reduction in type II
   stresses by process modification can help in reducing number of steps in
   processing of Zircaloy-4 tubes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The role of grain size and crystallographic orientation on the
   biocompatibility of commercially pure titanium was investigated.
   Samples, with significant differences in crystallographic texture and
   average grain size (from 0.4 to 40 mm) were produced by equal channel
   angular pressing (ECAP) and post deformation annealing. X-ray
   diffraction and electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) were used to
   evaluate differences in texture and microstructural characteristics. The
   titanium oxide film present on the surface of the samples was analyzed
   to determine the oxidation state of titanium and the chemical bonds
   between oxygen and titanium using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS). Biocompatibility experiments were conducted using MC3T3
   preosteoblast cells. Cell attachment was found to be texture-sensitive,
   where the number of attached cells was higher on the samples with higher
   number of (0002) planes exposed to the surface, regardless of the grain
   size. A relationship was also found between the titanium oxide species
   formed on the surface and the crystallographic texture underneath. The
   surface texture consisting of more densely packed basal planes promote
   the formation of Ti-OH on the surface, which in turn, enhances the
   cell-substrate interactions. These surface characteristics are deemed
   responsible for the observed difference in cell attachment behaviour of
   surfaces with different textures. Finally, it is inferred that texture,
   rather than the grain size, plays the major role in controlling the
   surface biocompatibility of biomedical devices fabricated from pure
   metallic titanium. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid-to air membrane energy exchangers (LAMEEs) are novel membrane
   based energy exchangers that allow simultaneous heat and moisture
   transfer between salt solutions and air streams. The similarity between
   a small-scale (2.5 L/s) LAMEE and a full-scale (100 L/s) LAMEE is
   investigated, both experimentally and numerically, in this paper.
   Dimensional analysis of the coupled heat and mass transfer equations in
   the air-side, solution side and membrane of the LAMEE shows that five
   important dimensionless parameters affect the performance of LAMEEs: (1)
   number of heat transfer units, NTU, (2) thermal capacity ratio, Cr{*},
   (3) number of mass transfer units, NTUm, (4) mass flow rate ratio, m{*},
   and (5) operating factor, H{*}. The differences in the small-scale and
   full-scale LAMEEs effectivenesses are numerically investigated for these
   five important dimensionless parameters. The results show that in most
   cases the differences between the small-scale and full-scale LAMEE
   effectivenesses are less than 2\%. The comparison between the
   experimental and numerical sensible, latent and total effectivenesses of
   the small-scale LAMEE and the full-scale LAMEE shows that there is a
   similarity between the small-scale and full-scale LAMEEs, and that the

Abstract = {{This study systematically investigated the high-pressure crystal
   structures of solid trifluoride (BF3) using first principle structure
   searches and several high-pressure phases were predicted. We found that
   the coordination of B atoms increased from 3 to 4 at 11 GPa, and to 6 at
   160 GPa, while all the F atoms were bridge bonding at a sufficiently
   high pressure, from terminal bonding. Further calculations of the
   electronic properties showed that solid BF3 remained insulating up to
   the highest pressure considered, i.e., 300 GPa. Phonon calculations
   indicated that all the predicted structures of BF3 are dynamically
   stable under high pressure. These results show that pressure plays an
   important role in the changing chemical environments of elements,
   thereby improving our understanding of the evolution of structure and
   bonding with compression in other molecular systems, particularly in
   other boron trihalides. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous co-biodegradation of a linear and three cyclic surrogate
   naphthenic acids namely octanoic acid, trans-4-methyl-1-cyclohexane
   carboxylic acid (trans-4MCHCA), and cis- and
   trans-4-methyl-1-cyclohexane-acetic acids (cis-4MCHAA and trans-4MCHAA)
   at concentrations of 100, 50, and 50 mg/L, respectively, was
   investigated in two circulating packed-bed bioreactors. Using different
   combinations of naphthenic acids in the bioreactor influent effects of
   loading rate on biodegradation of each compound was evaluated. In all
   tested mixtures biodegradation of octanoic acid proceeded with the
   fastest rate, followed by trans-4MCHCA, trans-4MCHAA, and cis-4MCHAA.
   Biodegradation of the linear compound (octanoic acid) was not influenced
   by the presence of any cyclic compound, even the most recalcitrant
   naphthenic acid with the highest removal rate of 372.8 mg/L-h observed
   at a loading rate of 666.7 mg/L-h. Presence of octanoic acid negatively
   impacted the biodegradation of trans-4MCHCA, with the removal rates of
   trans-4MCHCA in the presence and absence of octanoic acid being 74.6 and
   208.8 mg/L-h, respectively. With cis- and tran-4MCHAA, presence of
   octanoic acid improved the biodegradation of these compounds. In a
   mixture containing all three cyclic compounds, the maximum removal rates
   for cis- and trans-4MCHAA were 0.5 and 1.3 mg/L-h, respectively, which
   improved to 1.7 and 2.4 mg/L-h when octanoic acid was included in the

Abstract = {{When carbon steel is directly exposed in 99\%H-2-1\%CH4 gas mixture for

   The diamond coatings formed easily delaminate from the steel substrate.
   Hot dip aluminizing treatment of the carbon steel has markedly promoted
   diamond nucleation, growth and interfacial adhesion. The formation of
   graphite intermediate phase on the substrate surface is effectively
   inhibited and the substrate carburization is also suppressed. The
   possible mechanism of this transition is discussed based on a series of

Abstract = {{To thoroughly understand the relationship between heat treatments and
   characteristics of both microstructure and corrosion behavior of
   Ni-Fe-Cr alloy 028, a series of heat treatments were carried out. The
   area fraction of precipitates increases with increasing duration of
   aging treatment at 900 degrees C. The precipitation rate is higher at
   900 degrees C than at 850 and 950 degrees C. The precipitates are formed
   both in grains and at grain boundaries, this behavior enhances the
   hardness. The corrosion behavior was evaluated by potentiodynamic
   polarization test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement
   under sodium chloride solution. The results indicate that the variation
   of morphology, amount, and distribution of precipitates attributed to
   the heat treatment strongly influences the corrosion behavior of alloy
   028 in the sodium chloride solution. There is a galvanic effect of
   Cr-rich phase in the corrosion process. The increase of corrosion rate
   with the aging time is attributed to the acceleration of the
   microgalvanic corrosion.}},

Abstract = {{In this report, we characterize the deformation and annealing textures
   of Incoloy 800H/HT, following different rolling conditions that produced
   different textures in this material. Incoloy 800H/HT is an austenitic
   Fe-Ni super alloy and is considered to be a candidate material for Gen
   IV nuclear reactors. Fossil fuel plants have used this alloy for
   decades; however, as grain structure and texture parameters can strongly
   affect its physical and mechanical properties in-service, engineers
   should consider some structural modifications before using this alloy in
   nuclear reactors.
   In this study, we used Thermo-Mechanical Processing (TMP) to alter the
   texture of Incoloy 800H/HT. We applied various thickness reductions
   (10\%, 30\%, 50\%, 70\%, and 90\%) to this alloy using two different
   rolling paths, followed by annealing. Our detailed study of the
   deformation and annealing texture evolution shows that upon different
   rolling paths, the final deformation texture and the annealing texture
   were different. Brass texture was the dominant component for the
   uni-directional rolled (UDR) samples, while a combination of brass (B)
   and ND-rotated brass (B-T) were the dominant components in the
   cross-rolled (CR) samples. Annealing textures of UDR samples were mainly
   Goss, copper, S. recrystallized brass (\{236\}< 385 >) and minor copper
   twin \{552\}< 115 > components. At lower deformations (<50\%), the
   annealed CR samples showed tilted cube, S, recrystallized brass
   (\{236\}< 385 >) and minor Goss twin (113)<<(33)over bar>2 > However, at
   higher rolling reductions, the B+B-T deformation texture was retained
   for the CR samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A series of iron-exchanged heteropoly tungstate (TPA-Fe) supported on
   activated carbon produced from pinecone biomass, have been investigated
   as catalysts for the benzylation reaction. Catalysts were characterized
   by FT-IR, XRD, Laser Raman, BET surface area, and ammonia TPD analysis.
   FT-IR, XRD, and Raman data revealed retention of the Keggin ion on
   activated carbon-supported catalysts. The catalytic activity of these
   catalysts was evaluated for liquid phase benzylation of anisole with
   benzyl alcohol. The catalytic activity was significantly dependent on
   the dispersion of TPA-Fe on activated carbon. The effect of TPA-Fe
   loading on activated carbon was studied ranging from 40 to 80 wt\%. The
   catalyst with 70 wt\% loading of TPA-Fe showed higher benzylation
   activity, which is related to variation in acidity of the catalysts.
   Thermal stability and structural properties of the catalysts were
   studied by treating the catalyst at different calcination temperatures.
   The benzyl alcohol conversion and selectivity towards benzylated
   products were also dependent on the anisole to benzyl alcohol molar
   ratio, reaction temperature, and catalyst concentration/loading. To know
   the effect of the benzylating agent, the reaction was carried out using
   benzyl chloride, benzyl alcohol, and dibenzylether. The preferential
   order for conversion of the benzylating agent was observed as benzyl
   chloride > benzyl alcohol > dibenzylether. This study indicated that
   biomass derived activated carbon is suitable support to disperse Keggin
   type heteropoly acid for the benzylation reaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{H-Y is one of the most typical and commercially available zeolites. In
   this research work, the effect of TPA impregnation in H-Y zeolite has
   been analyzed. The impregnated catalysts have been characterized in
   details using TGA, BET, ICP-MS, FTIR, XRD, XPS, NH3-TPD and EXAFS. The
   change in catalyst structural properties and catalytic activity with the
   TPA impregnation have been correlated with the help of artificial neural
   network (ANN). The catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts has been
   tested in esterification of pure oleic acids and free fatty acids (FFA)
   present in the green seed canola (GSC) oil. A 10.2\% actual TPA loading
   in H-Y zeolite showed optimum catalytic activity in esterification of
   oleic acid. The reaction conversion of 99.3\% (for oleic acid) and
   97.2\% (for FFA) were achieved, when 13.3 wt\% catalyst containing
   10.2\% TPA and 20:1 methanol to FFA molar ratio were used at 120 degrees
   C and reaction time of 7.5 h. The catalyst is proved to be reusable.
   Kinetics study shows that the activation energy of the esterification
   reaction is 66.3 kJ/mol. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report, for the first time, the use of single poly
   (methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer-based nanopores to not only detect
   the translocating biomolecules of dsDNA and BSA in individual
   populations, but also distinguish between them in a mixed population,
   based on the obtained depths ((i)Block) and durations (t(D)) of the
   ionic current blockade events. Quantitative analyzes of current blockade
   events induced by separate populations of dsDNA and BSA molecules
   translocating through single PMMA-based nanopores revealed a mean iBlock
   value of 22.4 +/- 0.69 pA with a t(D) of 0.202 +/- 0.009 ms, and a mean
   iBlock value of 60.14 +/- 0.19 pA with a t(D) of 0.59 +/- 0.08 ms for
   dsDNA and BSA molecules, respectively. Evaluation of translocation
   events by dsDNA and BSA molecules in a mixed population through single
   nanopores indicated two distinct groups of current blockade events,
   extrapolation of which could perfectly correlate the group demonstrating
   iBlock values of 13-38 pA to the dsDNA molecules, whereas the group
   demonstrating (i)Block values of 52-73 pA to the BSA protein molecules
   transporting through the nanopores. Analysis of the data suggests that
   the majority of dsDNA or BSA protein molecules translocating through the
   nanopores are in their partially folded conformation. This paper is an
   important milestone in the development of polymer-based solid-state
   nanopore devices for fast and accurate biomolecule detection,
   differentiation/discrimination, and future structural characterization.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To assess the linearity and sex-specificity of damping
   coefficients used in a single-damper-model (SDM) when predicting impact
   forces during the worst-case falling scenario from fall heights up to 25
   cm. Methods: Using 3-dimensional motion tracking and an integrated force
   plate, impact forces and impact velocities were assessed from 10 young
   adults (5 males; 5 females), falling from planted knees onto
   outstretched arms, from a random order of drop heights: 3, 5, 7, 10, 15,
   20, and 25 cm. We assessed the linearity and sex-specificity between
   impact forces and impact velocities across all fall heights using
   analysis of variance linearity test and linear regression, respectively.
   Significance was accepted at P<0.05. Results: Association between impact
   forces and impact velocities up to 25 cm was linear (P=0.02). Damping
   coefficients appeared sex-specific (males: 627 Ns/m, R-2=0.70; females:
   421 Ns/m; R-2=0.81; sex combined: 532 Ns/m, R-2=0.61). Conclusions: A
   linear damping coefficient used in the SDM proved valid for predicting
   impact forces from fall heights up to 25 cm. Results suggested the use
   of sex-specific damping coefficients when estimating impact force using
   the SDM and calculating the factor-of-risk for wrist fractures.}},

Abstract = {{With the shift in interest towards renewable energy, hydrogen as an
   alternative gaseous fuel seems to attract much attention. Waste biomass
   is an ideal option for the synthesis of biofuels due to its abundance
   and no net CO2 emissions. Hydrogen can be produced through supercritical
   water gasification of waste biomass. Hydrogen is an attractive energy
   carrier which can be used as a direct fuel or in fuel cells to generate
   electricity and in other energy-producing processes. Gasification of
   biomass in supercritical water can be performed for hydrogen generation
   in both batch and continuous modes with/without the application of
   catalysts. In spite of the progress made in various gasification
   technologies, diamond anvil cells and fluidized beds as the
   new-generation batch and continuous reactors, respectively, are not
   fully recognized. The current review is focused on understanding the
   design, application and limitations of these two new reactor
   configurations to help motivate their wide-scale utilization. The review
   also discusses the potential of diamond anvil cells in studying the
   involved chemical reactions, thermodynamics, and phase behavior of
   biomass components during gasification. Nonetheless, the caliber of
   fluidized beds in continuously gasifying biomass for hydrogen production
   in supercritical water is also documented. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical

Abstract = {{The generic non-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes are holographically
   dual to hidden conformal field theories in two different pictures. The
   two pictures can be merged together to the dual conformal field theories
   (CFTs) in general picture that are generated by SL(2, Z) modular group.
   We find some extensions of the conformal symmetry generators that yield
   an extended local family of SL(2, R)(L) x SL(2, R)(R) hidden conformal
   symmetries for the Kerr-Newman black holes, parameterized by one
   deformation parameter. The family of deformed hidden conformal symmetry
   for Kerr-Newman black holes also provides a set of deformed hidden
   conformal symmetry for the charged Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. The
   set of deformed hidden conformal generators reduce to the hidden SL(2,
   R) conformal generators for the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole for
   specific value of deformation parameter. We also find agreements between
   the macroscopic and microscopic entropy and absorption cross-section of

Abstract = {{Control of the capillary driven underfill flow process is a very
   important problem in flip chip technology in electronics packaging. The
   challenge here is to uniformly distribute fluids in the gap, which is
   composed of the chip and substrate and solder bumps. In this paper, we
   first present a conceptual model of the flow behavior of underfill
   materials, which has four stages, leading to the finding that the
   contact line jump phenomenon occurs at both entry and exit of the solder
   bumps. We then propose a more accurate model for describing the flow
   front based on the principles of mass conservation and force
   equilibrium. Another contribution of the present paper is the proposal
   of a computational model for describing the average capillary pressure
   difference with respect to the area of flow. The verification of these
   models is presented by comparing the result calculated with our model
   with the experimental result reported in the literature, which shows the
   superiority of the models proposed in this paper.}},

   the animal level, there is a need to identify appropriate proxy
   locations. The objective was to evaluate 8 distributions of
   ceiling-level loggers in the deck and belly compartments of pot-belly
   trailers for assessing animal-level temperature and humidity during 5 to
   18 h commercial transportation of feeder cattle. Ambient conditions
   during transportation ranged from 3.6 to 45.2 degrees C (20.3 +/- 7.61
   degrees C, mean +/- SD). When considering the entire journey, average
   differences between ceiling and animal-level temperatures were similar
   among logger layouts (P > 0.05). The uncertainty in the difference in
   temperature and humidity between locations was high relative to the
   magnitude of the difference between animal-and ceiling-level conditions.
   Single-logger layouts required larger adjustments to predict
   animal-level conditions within either compartment, during either the
   entire journey or when the trailer was stationary (P < 0.05). Within
   certain logger layouts, there were small but significant differences in
   the ability of regression equations to predict animal-level conditions
   that were associated with cattle weight and available space relative to
   body size. Furthermore, evaluation of logger layouts based solely on the
   entire journey without consideration of stationary periods did not
   adequately capture variability in layout performance. In conclusion, to
   adequately monitor animal-level temperature and humidity, 10 loggers
   distributed throughout the compartment was recommended over
   single-logger layouts within both the deck and belly compartments of
   pot-belly trailers transporting feeder cattle in warm weather.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a unified definition of the service system is proposed.
   The motivation of this research effort is based on our observation that
   there are diverse definitions or descriptions of the service system in
   the literature and they have not provided an identity of the service
   system. Our goal to define the service system is thus to establish its
   identity. The most salient feature in our definition is the introduction
   of three subsystems in a service system: infrastructure, substance, and
   management. The substance flows over the infrastructure under the
   constraints of management. A service is established at the moment when
   the substance interacts with the human to cause a change in the human's
   status or state under a protocol, which further meets the human's
   request and need. With this new definition, a service system can be
   distinguished from other systems, such as manufacturing system,
   agricultural system, and product system. The new definition will be
   useful to classification of various service systems and various theories
   for service systems, which is the key to knowledge management for
   service systems and to optimization of design and management of service
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Canadian pine cones (pine cone type I and pine cone type II) and deoiled
   canola meal were utilized as precursors for preparation of powdered
   activated carbons (PACs) using thermo-chemical process. Physicochemical
   properties of the biomass and obtained adsorbents were evaluated.
   Prepared PACs were investigated for the adsorptive removal of acyclovir
   (ACV) from aqueous solutions. Pine cone type I PAC was found to have
   well developed pores and surface area. It was found to be suitable for
   removal of ACV from aqueous solution. Response surface methodology was
   used for the optimization of ACV adsorption on PAC prepared from pine
   cone type I and the development of predictive model. A second-order
   polynomial equation fitted data well which indicated that the process
   variables such as temperature, pH and especially adsorbent dose had
   large impact on the ACV adsorption process. The optimum conditions for
   ACV removal were found to be 39 degrees C, pH 8 and 2 g/L of pine cone

Abstract = {{Mid-term electricity market clearing price (MCP) forecasting has become
   essential for resources reallocation, maintenance scheduling, bilateral
   contracting, budgeting and planning purposes. Currently, there are many
   techniques available for short-term electricity MCP forecasting, but
   very little has been done in the area of mid-term electricity MCP
   forecasting. A multiple least squares support vector machine (LSSVM)
   based mid-term electricity MCP forecasting model is proposed in this
   study. Data classification and price forecasting modules are designed to
   first pre-process the input data into corresponding price zones, and
   then forecast the electricity price. The proposed model showed improved
   forecasting accuracy on both peak prices and overall system compared to
   the forecasting model using a single LSSVM. PJM interconnection data are
   used to test the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an investigation into the role of
   peat fibers in the development of anisotropic stiffness and strength
   within peat samples taken from below three Canadian National Railway
   embankments across Canada. These sites include two from northern Alberta
   on the Edson and Lac-La-Biche subdivisions and one from the Levis
   subdivision in southern Quebec. The peat samples were collected in
   Shelby tubes and were subjected to a program of consolidated undrained
   triaxial testing. These samples represented a wide variation in fiber
   content and degree of humification. The measured pore-pressure response
   during undrained loading indicated that the peat samples were undergoing
   an anisotropic elastic response to loading. This pore-pressure response
   was similar in the peat from all three sites, with an anisotropic
   pore-pressure parameter, a, of approximately 0.3. The stiffness and
   strength of the different peats were also similar, with an elastic
   modulus of approximately 1.7-2.2 MPa and an effective shear strength of
   38 degrees. The yielding behavior of the laboratory specimens suggested
   that plastic yielding occurs without the development of distinct failure
   planes and is accompanied by strain hardening. The combined effect of
   the effective strength parameters and the anisotropic pore-pressure
   response on the reinforcement provided by the peat fibers is also
   presented. This analysis showed that the net effect is dependent on the
   initial stress state of the peat. Under elevated mean effective stresses
   and low deviatoric stresses, the fibers may have a detrimental effect on
   strength. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The fundamentals of electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) digital
   microfluidics are very strong: advantageous capability in the
   manipulation of fluids, small test volumes, precise dynamic control and
   detection, and microscale systems. These advantages are very important
   for future biochip developments, but the development of EWOD
   microfluidics has been hindered by the absence of: integrated detector
   technology, standard commercial components, on-chip sample preparation,
   standard manufacturing technology and end-to-end system integration. A
   field-programmable lab-on-a-chip (FPLOC) system based on microelectrode
   dot array (MEDA) architecture is presented in this research. The MEDA
   architecture proposes a standard EWOD microfluidic component called
   `microelectrode cell', which can be dynamically configured into
   microfluidic components to perform microfluidic operations of the
   biochip. A proof-of-concept prototype FPLOC, containing a 30 x 30 MEDA,
   was developed by using generic integrated circuits computer aided design
   tools, and it was manufactured with standard low-voltage complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, which allows smooth on-chip
   integration of microfluidics and microelectronics. By integrating 900
   droplet detection circuits into microelectrode cells, the FPLOC has
   achieved large-scale integration of microfluidics and microelectronics.
   Compared to the full-custom and bottom-up design methods, the FPLOC
   provides hierarchical top-down design approach, field-programmability
   and dynamic manipulations of droplets for advanced microfluidic
   operations.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that the presence of entrained air bubbles in hydraulic
   oil can significantly reduce the effective bulk modulus of hydraulic
   oil. The effective bulk modulus of a mixture of oil and air as pressure
   changes is considerably different than when the oil and air are not
   mixed. Theoretical models have been proposed in the literature to
   simulate the pressure sensitivity of the effective bulk modulus of this
   mixture. However, limited amounts of experimental data are available to
   prove the validity of the models under various operating conditions. The
   major factors that affect pressure sensitivity of the effective bulk
   modulus of the mixture are the amount of air bubbles, their size and the
   distribution, and rate of compression of the mixture. An experimental
   apparatus was designed to investigate the effect of these variables on
   the effective bulk modulus of the mixture. The experimental results were
   compared with existing theoretical models, and it was found that the
   theoretical models only matched the experimental data under specific
   conditions. The purpose of this paper is to specify the conditions in
   which the current theoretical models can be used to represent the real
   behavior of the pressure sensitivity of the effective bulk modulus of
   the mixture. Additionally, a new theoretical model is proposed for
   situations where the current models fail to truly represent the
   experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{A robust optimization model is considered for nonzero-sum discounted
   stochastic games with incomplete information in order to formally
   formulate and analyze the intrusion detection problem in wireless sensor
   networks (WSNs). Security requirements of WSNs are taken into account to
   characterize the game parameters and model the player objectives. To
   generalize the problem, the game data are assumed not to be fully known
   to the players, who take a robust optimization approach to address this
   data uncertainty. For assessing the validity and effectiveness of the
   framework, illustrative instances of the developed game model are
   generated. Equilibrium analysis reveals how the conflicting objectives
   of the intruder and intrusion detection system compel them to adopt
   different conservative stances toward data uncertainty. It is also
   shown, by numerical results, that the robust approach in the presence of
   uncertainty reduces the sensitivity of the solution with respect to data
   perturbations, and thus improves design stability.}},

Abstract = {{Contamination of water and sediment with arsenic (As) in a highly
   industrialized area of Pohang City, Korea was investigated, with
   emphasis on in situ bioaccumulation of arsenicals by various aquatic
   organisms. Species- and tissue-specific concentrations of arsenicals
   were determined by use of HPLC-ICP/MS and is-X-ray absorption near-edge
   structure (mu-XANES). Concentrations of arsenic in aquatic organisms
   were strongly associated with corresponding water concentrations, which
   indicates point sources associated with land use and activities.
   Arsenobetaine was the most dominant form of arsenic found in fishes,
   bivalves, crabs, and shrimps, while As-III was predominant in freshwater
   snails. The mu-XANES analysis provided additional information about the
   unidentified arsenicals such as As-thiol. Arsenicals were mainly
   localized in intestine of mullet and marsh clam. Distribution and
   bioaccumulation of arsenic were strongly correlated with salinity, which
   indicates that natural processes controlling biogeochemistry of arsenic
   would be important in estuarine lotic system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},

Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{26-34}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this study, texture and compressive mechanical behavior of three cast
   magnesium alloys, including AZ31, AZ61 and AZ91, were examined over a
   range of strain rates between 1000 and 1400 s(-1) using Split Hopkinson
   Pressure Bar. Texture measurements showed that after shock loading,
   initial weak texture of the cast samples transformed to a relatively
   strong (00.2) basal texture that can be ascribed to deformation by
   twinning. Furthermore, increasing the aluminum content in the alloys
   resulted in increase in the volume fraction of beta-Mg17Al12 and Al4Mn
   phases, strength and strain hardening but ductility decreased at all
   strain rates. Besides, it was found for each alloy that the tensile
   strength and total ductility increased with strain rate. By increasing
   the strain rate, the maximum value of strain hardening rate occurred at
   higher strains. Also, it is suggested that a combination of twinning and
   second phase formation would affect the hardening behavior of the cast
   AZ magnesium alloys studied in this research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Evaluation of New Control Structures for Regulating the Great Lakes
   System: Multiscenario, Multireservoir Optimization Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Water levels in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence system located in
   northeastern North America are critically important to the Canadian and
   U. S. economies. Water managers are concerned that this system, which is
   currently managed by control structures at the outlets of Lakes Superior
   and Ontario, is not able to cope with the highly uncertain impacts of
   climate change. In particular, the frequency of extreme water levels
   throughout the system might be substantially increased. This study
   provides an exploratory conceptual analysis to determine the extent that
   new control structures at the outlet of Lake Huron or Erie (or both) and
   corresponding excavation along the St. Clair or Niagara River (or both)
   might mitigate the risks posed by future extreme water supply scenarios.
   Multilake parametric rule curves were developed to regulate systems
   enabled with these new control structures as a whole. Multiple
   stochastic water supply sequences were adopted that represented
   different future extreme climate scenarios. A multiscenario,
   multireservoir (multilake), biobjective simulation-optimization
   methodology was developed to optimize the rule curve parameters in such
   a way that the risk of experiencing extreme water levels is robustly
   minimized and fairly distributed across the system. The biobjective
   setting was designed to embed the secondary objective function so that
   the cost of the new control structures and excavation generates
   trade-offs between the costs and the associated achievable risk
   reductions. The recently developed Pareto Archived Dynamically
   Dimensioned Search (PA-DDS) multiobjective optimization algorithm was
   enabled with the efficiency-increasing ``deterministic model
   preemption{''} strategy and utilized to solve the optimization problem.
   Results demonstrate that although systemwide regulation with the new
   control structures could substantially reduce the risk (i.e., by 86\%
   compared to the current or base level of regulation), it could not
   eliminate such events entirely and would cause adverse effects on the
   lower St. Lawrence River. Numerical results also suggest that
   implementing a single new control point at the outlet of Lake Huron
   would not be effective despite its high cost; however, a single new
   control point at the outlet of Lake Erie would be very effective, with
   considerably less associated cost. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Selection combining (SC) at the destination for differential
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying is attractive as it does not require
   channel state information as compared to the semi
   maximum-ratio-combining (semi-MRC) while delivering close performance.
   Performance analysis of the SC scheme was recently reported but only for
   the case of slow-fading channels. This paper provides an exact average
   bit-error-rate (BER) of the SC scheme over a general case of
   time-varying Rayleigh fading channels and when the DBPSK modulation is
   used together with the non-coherent detection at the destination. The
   presented analysis is thoroughly verified with simulation results in
   various fading scenarios. It is shown that the performance of the system
   is related to the auto-correlation values of the channels. It is also
   shown that the performance of the SC method is very close to that of the
   semi-MRC method and the existence of an error floor at high
   signal-to-noise ratio region is inevitable in both methods. The obtained
   BER analysis for the SC method can also be used to approximate the BER
   performance of the MRC method, whose exact analytical evaluation in
   time-varying channels appears to be difficult.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a generic asynchronous First In First Out (FIFO) based

   asynchronous FIFOs namely binary, Gray, one-hot and Johnson are designed
   and analyzed. It is found that Gray-code asynchronous FIFO is the best
   to handle the asynchronous clock domain issues in NI. The control
   signals of the WISHBONE bus wrappers from/to asynchronous FIFOs and
   packing/unpacking modules are asserted concurrently at the same rising
   edge of the respective router and IP clocks to reduce the latency. The
   same NI has been utilized for transferring data between synchronous as
   well as asynchronous clock domains irrespective of clock frequency and
   phase differences. The proposed NI ensures the seamless high data
   throughput between the routers and IP cores with minimal latency, higher
   throughput, higher speed and utilized lesser area compared to the

Abstract = {{Underfill flow control is an important step in flip-chip technology and
   it can be generalized to fluid flow control in a porous medium, so
   solving this problem is of generalized implication to many other
   applications. The size of pores (i.e., clearance between the two solder
   bumps) in the flip-chip medium is less than 100 micrometers. In this
   paper, a new analytical model for permeability of the porous medium or
   solder bump flip-chip package is presented for two configurations of
   pores or solder of bumps (i.e., quadrilateral and equilateral triangular
   configurations). The model is shown to be more accurate than the
   existing model in the literature for the same purpose. Besides, the
   proposed model explicitly relates permeability with the structural
   parameters that describe the underfill space in flip-chip technology,
   namely, diameter of solder bumps, pitch of solder bumps, and gap height.
   In fact, there are two models, one for Newtonian fluids and the other
   for non-Newtonian fluids. These models allow us to optimize the
   structure of flip-chip packages in flip-chip technology or pores mediums
   in other applications. The models also provide a foundation for more
   precise control of the underfill flow process in flip-chip packages and
   the fluid filling process in pores mediums.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid dispensing is a process of delivering fluid materials in a
   controllable manner and has found extensive applications in electronics
   packaging manufacturing. Among various dispensing approaches, the
   rotary-screw-driven dispensing method has high versatility for
   dispensing a wide range of fluid materials. Given the fact that the flow
   rate of material dispensed has significant effects on the quality of
   electronics packaging, knowledge of the flow rate in rotary screw
   dispensing systems through mathematical models is desired. This paper
   presents the development of an integrated dynamic flow-rate model for
   rotary-screw-driven dispensing systems. The model is composed of two
   interconnected submodels, one model for the dynamics of the
   screw-driving system and the other for the flow-rate dynamics in the
   screw channel. Without loss of generality, a phenomenological model in
   the form of a linear state space model is adopted for the dynamics of
   the screw-driving system, and by considering the fluid compressibility,
   the flow-rate dynamics in the screw channel is represented. Dispensing
   experiments were performed for model parameter estimation and then for
   model verification. The results illustrate that the model developed can
   be used to predict the flow rate in the rotary-screw-driven dispensing
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Limited prospective evidence exists regarding bone microarchitectural
   deterioration. We report annual changes in trabecular and cortical bone
   microarchitecture at the distal radius and tibia in postmenopausal
   women. Lost trabeculae with corresponding increase in trabecular
   thickness at the radius and thinning tibial cortex indicated
   trabecularization of the cortex at both sites.
   Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and the deterioration of
   bone microarchitecture. However, limited prospective evidence exists
   regarding bone microarchitectural changes in postmenopausal women: a
   population prone to sustaining osteoporotic fractures. Our primary
   objective was to characterize the annual change in bone area, density,
   and microarchitecture at the distal radius and distal tibia in
   postmenopausal women.
   Distal radius and tibia were measured using high-resolution peripheral
   quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) at baseline and 1 year later
   in 51 women (mean age +/- SD, 77 +/- 7 years) randomly sampled from the
   Saskatoon cohort of the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos).
   We used repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni
   adjustment for multiple comparisons to characterize the mean annual
   change in total density, cortical perimeter, trabecular and cortical
   bone area, density, content, and microarchitecture. Significant changes
   were accepted at P < 0.05.
   At the distal radius in women without bone-altering drugs, total density
   (-1.7 \%) and trabecular number (-6.4 \%) decreased, while trabecular
   thickness (+6.0 \%), separation (+8.6 \%), and heterogeneity (+12.1 \%)
   increased. At their distal tibia, cortical area (-4.5 \%), density (-1.9
   \%), content (-6.3 \%), and thickness (-4.4 \%) decreased, while
   trabecular area (+0.4 \%) increased.
   The observed loss of trabeculae with concomitant increase in trabecular
   size at the distal radius and the declined cortical thickness, density,
   and content at the distal tibia indicated a site-specific
   trabecularization of the cortical bone in postmenopausal women.}},

Abstract = {{Using a system dynamics approach, an integrated water resources system
   model is developed for scenario analysis of the Saskatchewan portion of
   the transboundary Saskatchewan River Basin in western Canada. The water
   resources component is constructed by emulating an existing Water
   Resources Management Model. Enhancements include an irrigation sub-model
   to estimate dynamic irrigation demand, including alternative potential
   evapotranspiration estimates, and an economic sub-model to estimate the
   value of water use for various sectors of the economy. Results reveal
   that the water resources system in Saskatchewan becomes increasingly
   sensitive to the selection of evapotranspiration algorithm as the

Abstract = {{Lignocellulosic feedstock has tremendous potential to sustain the
   renewable production of biofuels such as ethanol and butanol. Although
   lignocellulosic biomass is a storehouse of energy in the form of
   cellulose and hemicellulose, yet lignin acts as a barrier against their
   hydrolysis. A dilute acid pretreatment disintegrates the biomass complex
   and allows cellulolytic enzymes to hydrolyze cellulose and
   hemicelluloses in releasing fermentable sugars. The current study
   investigates the effect of different H2SO4 doses (0-2.5\%) on the three
   lignocellulosic feedstock material, especially pinewood, timothy grass,
   and wheat straw at 121 degrees C for 1 h. Furthermore, the pretreated
   feedstock was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis using cellulase,
   beta-glucosidase, and xylanase at 45 degrees C for 72 h. The biomass
   hydrolysates containing monomeric sugars (glucose and xylose) were
   fermented using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Clostridium beijerinckii
   for ethanol and butanol production, respectively. A comparative
   evaluation for the concentrations of ethanol and butanol, residual
   sugars as well as byproducts such as acetone, acetate, and butyrate from
   biomass hydrolysates was performed. Pinewood hydrolysate revealed high
   ethanol (24.1 g/L) and butanol (11.6 g/L) concentrations due to greater
   sugar content. In contrast to ethanol fermentation by S. cerevisiae,
   butanol fermentation by C. beijerinckii demonstrated low butanol levels
   in the hydrolysates due to butanol toxicity toward clostridia.}},

Title = {{An Experimental Investigation of Aspect Ratio and Incidence Angle
   Effects for the Flow Around Surface-Mounted Finite-Height Square Prisms}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The flow around a surface-mounted finite-height square prism was
   investigated using a low-speed wind tunnel. The experiments were
   conducted at a Reynolds number of Re - 7.3 x 10(4) for prism aspect
   ratios of AR - 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 and incidence angles from a 0 deg to
   45 deg. The thickness of the boundary layer on the ground plane relative
   to the side length was delta/D = 1.5. Measurements of the vortex
   shedding frequency were made with a single-component hot-wire probe, and
   measurements of the mean drag and lift forces were obtained with a force
   balance. For all aspect ratios and incidence angles, the mean drag
   coefficient and Strouhal number were lower than those of an infinite
   prism, while the mean lift coefficient was of nearly similar magnitude.
   As the aspect ratio was increased from AR = 3 to 11, the force
   coefficients and Strouhal number slowly approached the
   infinite-square-prism data. The mean drag coefficient and Strouhal
   number for the finite prism were less sensitive to changes in incidence
   angle compared to the infinite square prism. The critical incidence
   angle, corresponding to minimum mean drag coefficient, minimum (most
   negative) mean lift coefficient, and maximum Strouhal number, shifted to
   a higher incidence angle compared to the infinite square prism, with
   values ranging from alpha(critical) = 15 deg to 18 deg; this shift was
   greatest for the prisms of higher aspect ratio. The behavior of the
   force coefficients and Strouhal number for the prism of AR - 3 was
   distinct from the other prisms (with lower values of mean drag
   coefficient and mean lift coefficient magnitude, and a different
   Strouhal number trend), suggesting the critical aspect ratio was between
   AR = 5 and AR = 3 in these experiments. In the wall-normal direction,
   the power spectra for AR - 11 and 9 tended to have weaker and/or more
   broad-banded vortex shedding peaks near the ground plane and near the
   free end at alpha = 0 deg and 15 deg. For AR = 7 to 3, well-defined
   vortex shedding peaks were detected along the entire height of the
   prisms. For AR - 11 and 9, at alpha - 30 deg and 45 deg, vortex shedding
   peaks were absent in the power spectra in the upper part of the wake.}},

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{366-371}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The method with which one creates a sample of graphene oxide paper has a
   strong impact on its electronic structure. Using X-ray emission
   spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy to indirectly measure the
   band gap, we have found that intercalation with hexylamine increases the
   band gap, while replacing water with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) decreases
   the band gap. Reduction with hexylamine sharply decreases the band gap
   as expected, but we have also found that heating the sample reduces the
   band gap to the same degree. This band gap reduction is due to
   defunctionalization of graphene oxide via reaction with water that
   produces CO2. Direct current four-probe conductivity measurements show
   that the decrease in band gap width leads to a lower-than-expected
   increase in conductivity, likely because the heat-induced
   defunctionalization process destroys the graphene sheet and reduces
   overall carrier mobility. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Due to its ability to reject disturbance, sliding mode control (SMC) has
   been widely employed in various control applications with the presence
   of uncertainty and/or disturbance. However, chattering, caused by the
   switching function used in SMC, can greatly deteriorate its performance,
   and thus, limit its applications. In addition to chattering, the
   application of SMC to a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system becomes
   more challenging due to the coupling effects between the control
   variables. This paper presents the development of an
   output-tracking-based discrete proportional-integral-derivative
   SMC(PID-SMC) for MIMO systems, in which the problem of output tracking
   is defined to the one of state tracking by using the model reference
   approach. The developed control scheme allows for both achieving the
   zero steady-state error and eliminating the chattering problem. For
   validation, experiments were performed on a commercially available three
   degrees-of-freedom nanopositioning stage with the developed control
   scheme, as compared to a traditional PID controller. Experimental
   results illustrate that with the developed control scheme, the
   positioning performance of the stage can be significantly improved,
   including the zero steady-state error and eliminated chattering.}},

Abstract = {{The cross sections for the photodisintegration of Li-6 have been
   measured for all the available reaction channels that have neutrons in
   the final state, except the Li-6(gamma, p(0))He-5(g.s.) channel. The
   cross sections were measured at the photon energies, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
   13, 15, and 15.6 MeV using linearly polarized photons, and 20, 25, 30,
   and 35 MeV using circularly polarized photons. Associated Legendre
   function coefficients are extracted for the Li-6(gamma, n(0))Li-5(g.s.)
   and Li-6(gamma, n(1))Li-5(1.49) channels. For all observed reaction
   channels Legendre function parametrizations are used to determine total
   cross sections. Comparisons with recent theoretical calculations of the
   total photodisintegration cross section using various nucleon-nucleon
   interactions are inconclusive because of the large uncertainty in the
   cross sections for reactions channels that are not measured. We hope
   that the precision of our results for specific reaction channels will

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{We study the crystalline and electronic properties of the Fe1-x Co-x Se
   system (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0) using x-ray diffraction, x-ray
   spectroscopy, and density functional theory. We show that the
   introduction of Co 3d states in FeSe relaxes the bond strengths and
   induces a structural transition from tetragonal to hexagonal whose
   crossover takes place at x approximate to 0.38. This structural
   transition in turn modifies the magnetic order, which can be related to
   the spin state. Using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we estimate
   the spin state of the system; FeSe is found to be in a high-spin state
   (S = 2), but Fe is reduced to a low-spin state upon Co substitution of x
   <= 0.25, well below the structural transition. Finally, we show evidence
   that FeSe is a moderately correlated system but the introduction of Co
   into the host lattice weakens the correlation strength for x >= 0.25.
   These novel findings are important to unravel the mechanisms responsible

Abstract = {{Elemental silicon has a large impact on the economy of the modem world
   and is of fundamental importance in the technological field,
   particularly in solar cell industry. The great demand of society for new
   clean energy and the shortcomings of the current silicon solar cells are
   calling for new materials that can make full use of the solar power. In
   this paper, six metastable allotropes of silicon with direct or
   quasidirect band gaps of 0.39-1.25 eV are predicted by ab initio
   calculations at ambient pressure. Five of them possess band gaps within
   the optimal range for high converting efficiency from solar energy to
   electric power and also have better optical properties than the Si-I
   phase. These Si structures with different band gaps could be applied to
   multiple p-n junction photovoltaic modules.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{30-38}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Large pore, high surface area mesoporous zirconia was synthesized using
   P123 as structure directing agent and was used as support material for
   hydrotreating of heavy gas oil. The mesoporous zirconia supported NiMo
   hydrotreating catalyst was prepared with and without EDTA via incipient
   wetness impregnation method. The structural characteristics of catalysts
   were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR, RAMAN, TPD (Temperature
   Programmed Desorption), TPR (Temperature Programmed Reduction), HRTEM,
   XANES and N-2-adsorption desorption isotherms (BET). The hydrotreating
   activities of the catalysts were measured using Athabasca bitumen
   derived heavy gas oil at industrial reaction conditions. Catalytic
   activity of NiMo/gamma-Al2O3 and NiMo SBA-15 catalysts was also
   determined for comparative studies. Low angle XRD and BET results
   support the formation of ordered mesoporous structure in the catalyst.
   Wide angle XRD, FT-IR and RAMAN analyses confirm the presence of mixture
   of monoclinic and tetragonal phase of zirconia in the catalyst. Surface
   acidity and type of acidic sites present were measured using NH3-TPD and
   Pyridine-FTIR. The extent of active metal dispersion in NiMo/Meso-Zr,
   Ni(NO3)(2)-Mo/Meso-Zr and NiMo/Meso-Zr(EDTA) catalyst is shown by CO
   chemisorption and HRTEM analysis. It has been confirmed from
   physio-chemical characterization that addition of EDTA increases the
   catalytic activity by (i) increasing the active metal dispersion as
   indicated by HRTEM and CO chemisorption, (ii) increase in Ni sulfidation
   temperatures and (iii) decreasing the metal support interaction as shown
   by XANES analysis. XANES analysis revealed that molybdenum oxide is
   present predominantly in tetrahedral form in NiMo/Meso-Zr catalyst
   whereas its present predominantly in octahedral form in NiMo/Meso-Zr
   (EDTA) catalyst. The catalytic activity was investigated and corelated
   systematically with the textural and structural properties of the
   catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{During chemical vapour deposition of diamond coatings on transition
   metal (Fe, Co, Ni) substrates, porous graphitic carbon preferentially
   forms on the substrate surfaces and it induces a spontaneous spallation
   of the diamond films. In this study, an Al surface barrier film of 80nm
   thick has been used on a Kovar alloy substrate to enhance the
   interfacial adhesion of diamond films. Characterisation of the top
   deposit, interlayer and the underlying substrate was performed by Raman
   spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, scanning electron
   microscopy, synchrotron NEXAFS, and X-ray diffraction. The Al interlayer
   has effectively inhibited the formation of intermediate graphitic carbon
   and markedly enhanced the adhesion of diamond films. Continuous and
   adherent diamond films were achieved on the alloy substrate. This
   investigation also indicates the importance of the continuity of the Al
   interlayer in maintaining an integrity of the adherent diamond films.}},

Title = {{Thermal stability of diamond-like carbon-MoS2 thin films in different
   environments}},
Journal = {{THIN SOLID FILMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{562}},
Pages = {{244-249}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Diamond-like carbon (DLC) based coatings are ideal for low friction and
   wear resistant applications. For those tribological applications, the
   coatings may expose to high temperature environments. Therefore, the
   thermal stability of the coating is very important for its long-term
   performance. In this work, DLC-MoS2 composite thin films were
   synthesized using biased target ion beam deposition technique in which
   MoS2 was produced by sputtering a MoS2 target using Ar ion beams while
   DLC was deposited by an ion source with CH4 gas as carbon source. DLC
   films without MoS2 deposited under similar conditions were used as
   reference samples. After the deposition, DLC and DLC-MoS2 thin films
   were heat-treated in ambient air and low pressure environments at
   different temperatures ranging from 100 to 600 degrees C for 2 h. The
   effect of annealing on the structure, mechanical and tribological
   properties of the resulting films were studied by means of Raman
   spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure, scanning electron
   microscopy, nanoindentation, and ball-on-disk testing. The results
   showed that the structure, hardness, Young's modulus, friction
   coefficient and wear coefficient of the DLC films were stable up to 200
   degrees C annealing in air and 300 degrees C in low pressure. At higher
   temperature, the annealing led to the transformation of sp(3) to sp(2),
   which degraded the mechanical and tribological properties of the thin
   films. Comparing with the DLC films, the DLC-MoS2 thin films showed a
   slower rate of graphitization and higher structure stability throughout
   the range of annealing temperatures, indicating a relatively higher
   thermal stability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The growing interest in various applications of polyunsaturated fatty
   acids daily dietary requirements and demand has directed much attention
   on the industrial production of bio-oil from plant, animal, fungi, or
   algae sources. This work signifies that the extraction of
   polyunsaturated fatty acids from fungal biomass of Mortierella sp. 1458
   using supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) with subsequent fractionation of
   various fatty acids present in biomass using co-solvents was
   investigated. The use of co-solvent in supercritical fluid extraction
   has provided the green system as a substitute for classical solvent
   extraction at industrial scale. The optimized extraction temperature
   (62.3 degrees C), pressure (298.5 bar), and time (88.6 min) on SC-CO2
   extraction conditions gave maximum recovery up to 66.35\% of bio-oil
   from dried biomass. Further co-solvent addition to SC-CO2 has improved
   \% recovery up to 97.88\%. The bio-oil obtained by this method was
   examined for use by characterization with value added chemicals such as
   omega-3, omega-6, and omega-9 fatty acids. Peleg's equation was used to
   study the bio-oil extraction kinetics. The equilibrium yield as well as
   the time required to reach half of equilibrium yield were also
   calculated. It showed that for an effective extraction process with high
   yield, CO2 density larger than 700 kg/m(3) is needed. (C) 2014 Curtin

Abstract = {{A new integrated low-power, low-complexity ultra wideband (UWB)
   transceiver front-end in standard 130 nm complementary metal oxide
   semiconductor technology which can be used in UWB radar biomedical
   sensing applications is proposed in this study. The transceiver
   comprises of a full UWB band transmitter, an on-chip diplexer and a full
   UWB band receiver front-end. The transmitter generates
   Gaussian-pulse-modulated and rectangular-pulse-modulated signals at
   different carrier frequencies within the designated UWB by using a
   digitally controlled oscillator. The transmitter consumes an average
   power of 8 mW at a 10 MHz pulse rate. The on-chip diplexer has a 1 dB
   insertion loss and an isolation of -30 dB. Its switch is co-designed
   with the receiver's input matching network to optimise the power
   matching while achieving good noise performance. The receiver low noise
   amplifier has a 3-10 GHz input matching bandwidth with a power gain of
   16 dB. The overall receiver front-end consumes an average power of 12
   mW. The core area of the transceiver circuit is 500 mu m by 1100 mu m.
   The experiments show that the proposed radar transceiver can
   successfully detect a human respiration pattern within 50 cm. This novel
   design using a DCO-type UWB transceiver integrated with an on-chip
   diplexer demonstrates the use of the low power UWB radar detection in
   biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Electron transport in vacuum-deposited a-Se films with thicknesses
   varying from 13 to 501 mu m has been investigated by conventional
   time-of-flight (TOF) and interrupted field TOF experiments. To separate
   the influences of electric field and the thickness, all TOF experiments
   were performed at a constant electric field. It has been found that the
   electron mobility is relatively constant in thick films (L > 50 mu m)
   and increases in thinner films (L < 50 mu m) with decreasing thickness.
   On the other hand, the electron lifetime is relatively thickness
   independent in films with thickness L > 50 mu m, but drops sharply in
   thin films when L < 50 mu m. These observations can be explained based
   on the density of states model that includes three types of traps
   forming Gaussian-like distributions within the mobility gap as reported
   in Koughia et al.}},

Abstract = {{Using time-of-flight (TOF) and interrupted-field TOF we have measured
   the electron and hole drift mobilities, mu(e) and mu(h), lifetimes,
   tau(e) and tau(h), and hence carrier ranges, mu(e)tau(e) and
   mu(h)tau(h), in stabilized a-Se as a function of temperature from -25 to
   45 degrees C. Above room temperature, mu(e)tau(e) and mu(h)tau(h) show a
   slight increase with temperature and peak around 31 and 35 degrees C,
   respectively. The mu(e)tau(e) at 35 degrees C and mu(h)tau(h) at 40
   degrees C are approximately the same as room temperature values. Below
   room temperature, down to -25 degrees C, both mu(e) and mu(h) decrease
   with decreasing temperature with activation energies E-mu e and E-mu h
   that are 0.38 and 0.21 eV. The electron and hole lifetimes, tau(e) and
   tau(h), are also thermally activated but they increase with decreasing
   temperature with activation energies E-tau e and E-tau h that are 0.31
   and 0.18 eV. These are quite close to corresponding activation energies
   for the drift mobilities within experimental errors. The electron and
   hole ranges, mu(e)tau(e) and mu(h)tau(h), therefore exhibit only a weak
   temperature dependence, both increase slightly with temperature. These
   observations are consistent with shallow trap controlled transport in
   the presence of a set of deep traps. The X-ray sensitivity of a
   photoconductor, among other factors, depends on the charge collection
   efficiency, which depends on electron and hole ranges, mu(e)tau(e) and
   mu(h)tau(h). Because these carrier ranges do not show any significant
   temperature dependence, one can conclude that the X-ray sensitivity of
   stabilized a-Se over the temperature range from -25 to 40 degrees C
   should not be affected by changes in the collection efficiency.}},

Title = {{Freeze drying for microencapsulation of alpha-linolenic acid rich oil: A
   functional ingredient from Lepidium sativum seeds}},

Abstract = {{Lipids rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are of great
   importance to the food industry. However, due to unsaturation they are
   highly prone to rancidity, thereby presenting an enormous technological
   challenge. Emulsification and subsequent microencapsulation of oil forms
   a protective microenvironment for these bioactives. Further, freeze
   drying of emulsified lipids is used to enhance shelf-life of the dietary
   targets. In the current study, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) rich oil from
   Lepidium sativum seed was stabilized through microencapsulation by
   freeze drying. O/W emulsion was prepared using a combination of gum
   ghatti, gum arabic, and soy protein isolate. Thereafter induced
   coacervates were lyophilized by the batch method in a tray dryer. The
   encapsulation procedure was optimized by the central composite design,
   through variation of parameters such as the ratio between gum and soy
   protein isolate (SPI), wall and core and the speed of homogenization.
   The response was measured in terms of microencapsulation efficiency
   (MEE) with the maxima of 81.11\% for the parameter values of Gum: SPI at
   0.32, Wall: Core at 2 and homogenization speed of 10 000 rpm. The
   prepared emulsion was characterized through zeta-potential, viscosity,
   and droplet size measurements while the encapsulated product was
   deliberated through Raman spectroscopy and a(w) evaluations.
   Practical applications: Dietary requirement of polyunsaturated fatty
   acids (PUFA) is seldom met by a vegetarian diet and therefore for the
   benefit of the vegetarian population, novel food products incorporating
   vegetarian PUFA need to be developed. However, rancidity is a major
   problem encountered while working on unsaturated molecules. Thus to gain
   maximum benefit from these functional lipids one needs to design stable
   bioavailable ingredients. With this in mind, the focus of the current
   study was formulation and process optimization to obtain encapsulated
   oil. Freeze drying process for microencapsulation leads to superior
   quality capsules due to the low temperature conditions. In this way L.
   sativum seed oil was explored for the first time to develop
   alpha-linolenic acid rich bioactive ingredient.}},

Title = {{Measuring partial fluorescence yield using filtered detectors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYNCHROTRON RADIATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{716-721}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Typically, X-ray absorption near-edge structure measurements aim to
   probe the linear attenuation coefficient. These measurements are often
   carried out using partial fluorescence yield techniques that rely on
   detectors having photon energy discrimination improving the sensitivity
   and the signal-to-background ratio of the measured spectra. However,
   measuring the partial fluorescence yield in the soft X-ray regime with
   reasonable efficiency requires solid-state detectors, which have
   limitations due to the inherent dead-time while measuring.
   Alternatively, many of the available detectors that are not energy
   dispersive do not suffer from photon count rate limitations. A filter
   placed in front of one of these detectors will make the energy-dependent
   efficiency non-linear, thereby changing the responsivity of the
   detector. It is shown that using an array of filtered X-ray detectors is
   a viable method for measuring soft X-ray partial fluorescence yield
   spectra without dead-time. The feasibility of this technique is further
   demonstrated using alpha-Fe2O3 as an example and it is shown that this
   detector technology could vastly improve the photon collection
   efficiency at synchrotrons and that these detectors will allow
   experiments to be completed with a much lower photon flux reducing
   X-ray-induced damage.}},

Abstract = {{There is a special need to develop a dosimetry technique with a
   large-dynamic range and high-spatial resolution to characterize the
   microstructured X-ray beams used in microbeam radiation therapy (MRT)
   for cancer. We report the synthesis and characterization of oxyfluoride
   glass-ceramic (SiO2-Al2O3-CaF2-CaO-SmF3) plates, which contain
   trivalent-samarium-doped calcium fluoride (CaF2:Sm3+) nanocrystals, for
   use as a dosimetric detector material, particularly for MRT
   applications. Our approach utilizes the extent of Sm3+ -> Sm2+ valence
   reduction caused by X-ray irradiation as a probe of the X-ray dose
   delivered; and confocal fluorescent microscopy is used to read out the
   distribution of valence reduction through the photoluminescence (PL)
   signal. Our study showed that the Sm3+ -> Sm2+ valence reduction takes
   place in CaF2 nanocrystals, but not in the glass matrix. The Sm2+ shows
   PL emission predominantly due to the fast 4f(5)5d(1) -> F-7(0)
   transition, which allows us to read out the detector plate at a high
   scanning speed. Further, our experiments showed that the detection dose
   range reaches several thousands of grays, and X-ray dose distribution is
   detected at a micrometer scale. In addition, the Sm2+ signal can be
   erased either by heating the irradiated sample at a suitable high
   temperature or by exposing it to UV light; and the erased glass-ceramic
   plate is reusable. The new Sm-doped oxyfluoride glass-ceramic with CaF2
   nanocrystals reported in this work shows potential for practical use in
   high-dose and high-resolution dosimetry for MRT.}},

Abstract = {{Canola meal has been previously demonstrated to be an attractive
   biomaterial for dehydrating wet ethanol vapours in bioethanol
   manufacture. Extrusion spheronisation was employed to prepare reasonably
   spherical pellets of canola meal for use in dehydration units. Canola
   meal pastes were prepared at water volume fractions of 57-70\% and
   extruded through single and multi-holed dies with diameters 2, 3.5 and
   4.5 mm. The pressure required to extrude the pastes, size and shape
   distribution of pellets and strength of dried pellets were measured.
   Formulations with a water volume fraction of 70\% gave low extrusion
   pressures and highest pellet strength. Die land diameters of 2 mm gave
   the best combination of specific surface area, size and shape
   distribution, packing density and ethanol adsorption. Dehydration
   testing confirmed that the canola meal pellets could dehydrate
   water/ethanol vapour from an ethanol mass fraction of 92.5\% (below the
   azeotrope at 1 bara) to 99\%. The equilibrium water loading of 47.3 mg
   water per g adsorbent is larger than other biomass-based adsorbents
   reported for this application. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Agricultural residues represent an abundant, readily available, and
   inexpensive source of renewable lignocellulosic biomass. However,
   biomass has complex structural formation that binds cellulose and
   hemicellulose. This necessitates the initial breakdown of the
   lignocellulosic matrix. Steam explosion pretreatment was performed on
   barley straw grind to assist in the deconstruction and disaggregation of
   the matrix, so as to have access to the cellulose and hemicellulose. The
   following process and material variables were used: temperature (140-180
   degrees C), corresponding saturated pressure (500-1100 kPa), retention
   time (5-10 min), and mass fraction of water 8-50\%. The effect of the
   pretreatment was assessed through chemical composition analysis. The
   severity factor R-o, which combines the temperature and time of the
   hydrolytic process into a single reaction ordinate was determined. To
   further provide detailed chemical composition of the steam exploded and
   non-treated biomass, ultimate analysis was performed to quantify the
   elemental components. Data show that steam explosion resulted in the
   breakdown of biomass matrix with increase in acid soluble lignin.
   However, there was a considerable thermal degradation of cellulose and
   hemicellulose with increase in acid insoluble lignin content. The high
   degradation of the hemicellulose can be accounted for by its amorphous
   nature which is easily disrupted by external influences unlike the
   well-arranged crystalline cellulose. The carbon content of the solid
   steam exploded product increased at higher temperature and longer
   residence time, while the hydrogen and oxygen content decreased, and the
   higher heating value (HHV) increased. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, the influence of SIC nanoparticles on deformation texture
   of steel-based nanocomposite fabricated by accumulative roll bonding
   process was investigated. It was found that there was a texture
   transition from the rolling texture to the shear texture for both pure
   interstitial free steel and steel-based nanocomposite. However, the
   texture transition occurred in different cycles for the pure steel (the
   third cycle) and steel-based nanocomposite (the first cycle). It was
   realized that the fraction of low misorientation angle grain boundaries
   was decreased and the fraction of high misorientation angle grain
   boundaries was increased by the number of cycles. Also,
   recrystallization occurred in the pure steel and steel-based
   nanocomposite samples after the third and first cycles, respectively. In
   addition, the occurrence of recrystallization in steel-based
   nanocomposite was sooner than that of pure steel. At the early stage of
   dynamic recrystallization in processed steels, the \{011\}< 100
   >-oriented grains were evolved and the fraction of grains with a-fiber
   and,gamma-fiber orientations was slightly decreased. The formation of
   the rolling texture in the steel-based nanocomposite samples was
   different from the typical rolling texture for the pure steel samples,
   due to the presence of the SiC nanoparticles in the nanocomposite. The
   weak rolling texture was attributed to the high stored energy of
   deformation, which was, in turn, due to low deformation temperature. (C)

Title = {{Supplemental shielding of BMIT SOE-1 at the Canadian Light Source}},
Journal = {{RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{8-12}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{High field superconducting wiggler beamlines present shielding
   challenges due to the high critical energy of the synchrotron spectrum.
   An unexpected, but predictable, weakness in the secondary optical
   enclosure (SOE-1) was discovered on the BioMedical Imaging and Therapy
   (BMIT) insertion device (ID) beamline 05ID-2 at the Canadian Light
   Source (CLS). SOE-1 is a monochromatic beam hutch; the beam in it is
   supplied by three monochromators housed in an upstream primary optical
   enclosure (POE-3). The initial shielding of SOE-1 was based on a
   shielding calculation against target scattered and direct monochromatic
   (fundamental and harmonics) beams from the monochromators in POE-3.
   During a radiation survey of the hutch, radiation above the expected
   level was measured at the downstream end of SUE-I. This increment in
   radiation level is attributed to scattered white beam into SOE-1 by a
   K-Edge subtraction (KES) monochromator's crystal (a single crystal
   monochromator) in POE-3. Though this is peculiar to the BMIT beamline
   05ID-2, it may not be uncommon for other beamlines that use single
   crystal monochromators.
   Calculations of the level of expected leakage radiation due to the
   scattered white beam arriving on the downstream wall of the SOE-1 are
   presented, as well as the supplemental shielding that will reduce the
   leakage to less than 1 mu Sv/h as required at the CLS. Also presented
   are the installed supplemental shielding, and a comparison of the
   calculations and measurements of the dose rates on the back wall of
   SOE-1 End Wall, before and after installation of the supplemental
   shielding. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Determination of CO2 mixing ratio columns from space using Laser
   Absorption Spectroscopy (LAS) requires simultaneous measurements of CO2
   number density columns and knowledge of the dry atmospheric surface
   pressure. One approach to determining the surface pressure is to make an
   LAS column measurement of O-2 number density in the 7857.3-7921.7 cm(-1)
   (1.27 mu m) region of the O-2((1)Delta) state. A complicating factor in
   the LAS O-2 measurement is the presence of a permanent but spatially
   variable natural source of airglow from the O-2((1)Delta) state. In
   addition, the laser radiation can induce stimulated emission from the
   ambient O-2((1)Delta) state and also cause stimulated absorption and
   emission from the ground state O-2 molecules as the laser beam passes
   through the atmosphere. Finally, the upwelling surface-reflected solar
   radiation is an additional source of background radiation. The effects
   of these additional radiation sources on the LAS measurement of O-2 are
   examined. The surface-reflected solar radiation produces the largest
   background at 3 orders of magnitude more intense than the laser
   backscatter signal, while the airglow is of the same order of magnitude
   as the laser backscatter. The stimulated emission from ambient
   O-2(a(1)Delta(g)) is found to be about the same order of magnitude as
   the laser radiation. These effects are evaluated under noon, twilight,
   and midnight conditions at midlatitudes, the equator, and the pole. The
   stimulated emission is in the same direction and in phase with the laser
   signal, its contamination of the LAS O-2 measurement prevents a full
   sunlight determination of surface pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Embedding luminescent rare earth ions into transparent oxides such as
   ZnO is a well-known approach to functionalize the material by adding
   photon-management properties. In this paper we present a detailed study
   of the luminescence properties and energy level structure of Pr3+ and
   Yb3+ ions embedded in ZnO thin films deposited by magnetron reactive
   sputtering. Careful study of the photoluminescence and excitation
   spectra allowed identifying and locating almost all excited levels of
   Pr3+ and Yb3+ ions. Thus, an almost complete electronic energy level
   diagram of these ions in the ZnO crystal lattice can be drawn for the
   first time. In particular, we show that the crystal field of ZnO
   strongly modifies the energy level structure of the Pr3+ and Yb3+ ions
   creating energy mismatches between the transitions useful for
   cooperative down conversion. Finally, we demonstrate that light emission
   from Pr3+ ions can be induced both by direct excitation of the ions and
   indirectly by energy transfer from the ZnO matrix.}},

   transition from rolling texture to shear one for pure IF steel,
   steel-based composite, and steel-based nanocomposite. However, the
   texture transition occurred in different cycles for these samples. It
   was realized that recrystallization occurred in pure IF steel,
   steel-based composite, and steel-based nanocomposite after the third,
   second, and first ARB cycles, respectively. In addition, occurrence of
   recrystallization in the steel-based composite and nanocomposite was
   sooner than in pure IF steel. Finally, it was found that with increasing
   the number of cycles, the fraction of low misorientation angle grain
   boundaries decreased and the fraction of high misorientation angle grain
   boundaries increased. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Analogue sulfur-containing precursors (ASCPs) were employed to prepare
   activated carbon (AC). Samples were characterized and analyzed by X-ray
   adsorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning
   electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ion
   chromatography, and N-2 physical sorption means. The results show that
   FeS2 in the precursor can react with the activation agent KOH to produce
   sulfur compounds such as K2SO4, K2S2O3, K2S, and thioether (R-S-R'), and
   reduce the actual KOH amount used for porosity development, hence
   decreasing specific surface area and pore volume of AC. This imposes an
   obviously negative effect on the capacitance and rate capability of the
   AC electrode as well as producing the byproduct Fe3O4. Consequently,
   FeS2 content in minerals as supercapacitor AC precursors should be
   limited to as low as possible in practical application. Furthermore, it
   is interesting to note that some of the inorganic FeS2 in the precursor
   can be converted into organic sulfide as a basic part of the resultant
   AC by undergoing a complex KOH activation process.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first comprehensive intercomparison of currently
   available satellite ozone climatologies in the upper troposphere/lower
   stratosphere (UTLS) (300-70hPa) as part of the Stratosphere-troposphere
   Processes and their Role in Climate (SPARC) Data Initiative. The
   Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) instrument is the only
   nadir-viewing instrument in this initiative, as well as the only
   instrument with a focus on tropospheric composition. We apply the TES
   observational operator to ozone climatologies from the more highly
   vertically resolved limb-viewing instruments. This minimizes the impact
   of differences in vertical resolution among the instruments and allows
   identification of systematic differences in the large-scale structure
   and variability of UTLS ozone. We find that the climatologies from most
   of the limb-viewing instruments show positive differences (ranging from
   5 to 75\%) with respect to TES in the tropical UTLS, and comparison to a
   zonal mean ozonesonde climatology indicates that these differences
   likely represent a positive bias for p100hPa. In the extratropics, there
   is good agreement among the climatologies regarding the timing and
   magnitude of the ozone seasonal cycle (differences in the peak-to-peak
   amplitude of <15\%) when the TES observational operator is applied, as
   well as very consistent midlatitude interannual variability. The
   discrepancies in ozone temporal variability are larger in the tropics,
   with differences between the data sets of up to 55\% in the seasonal
   cycle amplitude. However, the differences among the climatologies are
   everywhere much smaller than the range produced by current
   chemistry-climate models, indicating that the multiple-instrument
   ensemble is useful for quantitatively evaluating these models.}},

Abstract = {{The miniature specimen test technique has been extensively studied for
   quantifying the properties of bulk materials with greatly reduced volume
   recently. In this paper small punch test (SPT) is used to evaluate
   effects of specimen thickness, grain size and thickness-to-grain size
   ratio (TGR) on mechanical properties of 25 samples of type 316L
   austenitic stainless steel with nearly the same crystallographic
   texture. Effective SPT yield and maximum loads were measured and
   correlated with yield and ultimate strengths of conventional tensile
   test. The results show that SPT is sensitive not only to grain size, but
   also to thickness and TGR. Size effects exist between SPT and
   standard-sized samples. The present work gives a size effect criterion
   of SPT for engineering application. In addition, the underlying
   mechanisms of these size effects are provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Systematic first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with

   different supercell sizes of 96, 288, 576, and 768 atoms established

   an intrinsic property and independent of the simulation cell sizes. The
   present study highlights an often overlook issue in first-principles
   calculations that long time MD is essential to achieve ergodicity, which
   is mandatory for a proper description of dynamics of a system. It is
   inappropriate to make arguments on the analysis of MD results, which are
   far from ergodic. Furthermore, we have simulated the vibrational density
   of states of phase IV based on our proton diffuse model at a pressure
   range of 225-300 GPa, which is qualitatively in agreement with

Abstract = {{The fluorinated oxobenzo-bridged bisdithiazolyl radical FBBO was
   recently observed to undergo a pressure-induced Mott insulator-to-metal
   transition, suggesting a novel organic system for studying Mott physics.
   This report describes the electronic structure of this material in
   relation to the observed magnetic response at low pressures. Through
   analysis of antiferromagnetic resonance measurements, we identify a
   layered antiferromagnetic ordered phase below T-N = 13 K at ambient
   pressure, which requires strong ferromagnetic coupling between nearest
   neighbours. The origin of such coupling is elucidated from both
   molecular and solid-state electronic-structure calculations, which
   suggest a minimal two-orbital model with strong Hund's-rule coupling.
   This layered phase is partially frustrated by a second-nearest-neighbor
   antiferromagnetic coupling, which drives a magnetic phase transition at
   elevated pressure. On the basis of the two-orbital model, we suggest the
   pressure-induced Mott transition to proceed via rehybridization of the
   frontier molecular orbitals, resulting in a half-filled insulator to
   quarter-filled metal crossover.}},

Title = {{Heat, Pressure and Light-Induced Interconversion of Bisdithiazolyl
   Radicals and Dimers}},

Abstract = {{The heterocyclic bisdithiazolyl radical 1b (R-1 = Me, R-2 = F)
   crystallizes in two phases. The alpha-phase, space group P2(1)/n,
   contains two radicals in the asymmetric unit, both of which adopt
   slipped pi-stack structures. The beta-phase, space group P2(1)/c,
   consists of cross-braced pi-stacked arrays of dimers in which the
   radicals are linked laterally by hypervalent 4-center 6-electron S
   center dot center dot center dot S-S center dot center dot center dot S
   sigma-bonds. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements
   on alpha-1b indicate Curie-Weiss behavior (with Theta = -14.9 K), while
   the dimer phase beta-1b is diamagnetic, showing no indication of thermal
   dissociation below 400 K. High-pressure crystallographic measurements
   indicate that the cross-braced pi-stacked arrays of dimers undergo a
   wine-rack compression, but the dimer remains intact up to 8 GPa (at
   ambient temperature). The resistance of beta-1b to dissociate under
   pressure, also observed in its conductivity versus pressure profile, is
   in marked contrast to the behavior of the related dimer beta-1a (R-1 =
   Et, R-2 = F), which readily dissociates into a pair of radicals at 0.8
   GPa. The different response of the two dimers to pressure has been
   rationalized in terms of differences in their linear compressibilities
   occasioned by changes in the degree of cross-bracing of the pi-stacks.
   Dissociation of both dimers can be effected by irradiation with visible
   (lambda = 650 nm) light; the transformation has been monitored by
   optical spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and single
   crystal X-ray diffraction. The photoinduced radical pairs persist up to
   temperatures of 150 K (beta-1b) and 242 K (beta-1a) before reverting to
   the dimer state. Variable-temperature optical measurements on beta-1b
   and beta-1a have afforded Arrhenius activation energies of 8.3 and 19.6
   kcal mol(-1,) respectively, for the radical-to-dimer reconversion. DFT
   and CAS-SCF calculations have been used to probe the ground and excited
   electronic state structures of the dimer and radical pair. The results
   support the interpretation that the ground-state interconversion of the
   dimer and radical forms of beta-1a and beta-1b is symmetry forbidden,
   while the photochemical transformation is symmetry allowed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient lifting-based algorithm for the
   computation of Daubechies-4 (D4) and Daubechies-6 (D6) wavelet
   transforms using an algebraic integer quantization (AIQ) technique. The
   transform filter coefficients are first mapped by algebraic integers,
   and then quantized using a subband coding algorithm. The performance of
   the algorithm is assessed by using several benchmark images and the
   results are compared in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and bit
   rate. The architecture of both D4 and D6 is implemented on field
   programmable gate array (FPGA). The results show that the proposed
   AIQ-based implementations perform better and consume fewer resources
   than similar other lifting-based techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The excitation of negative energy, ion sound type modes driven by the E

   interface is analyzed for conditions typical in a Hall thruster. Such
   sheath impedance modes are sensitive to the dielectric properties of the
   thruster wall material, which therefore may have direct influence (other
