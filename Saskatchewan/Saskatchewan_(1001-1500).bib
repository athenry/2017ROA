Abstract = {{Pelletization, a form of densification, increases bulk density and
   improves the convenience and accessibility of biomass feedstock due to
   the uniform shape and size. Pretreatment of biomass enhances the
   breakdown and accessibility of the cross-linking lignin, which acts as a
   binding agent. In this study, pelletization of radio frequency-alkaline
   and steam explosion pretreated barley straw was performed. Three levels
   of temperature (70 degrees C, 80 degrees C, and 90 degrees C), five
   levels of the mass ratio of biomass to NaOH solution (1:4, 1:5, 1:6,
   1:7, and 1:8), one hour equilibration time, biomass screen size of 1.6
   mm, 1\% NaOH concentration, and 20 min residence time in the radio
   frequency chamber were used for the radio frequency-alkaline
   pretreatment. Three levels of steam temperature (140 degrees C, 160
   degrees C, and 180 degrees C), three levels of moisture content of 8\%,
   30\%, and 50\% (mass fraction of total mass), and 5 min and 10 min
   exposure to steam were tested for the steam explosion pretreatment. The
   effects of both pretreatment methods were evaluated by pelletizing the
   pretreated and non-pretreated barley straw samples in a single pelleting
   unit. The pellet density, tensile strength, durability, dimensional
   stability, and color of the pellets were determined. Radio
   frequency-alkaline pretreatment with the use of 1\% NaOH solution and a
   ratio of biomass: NaOH solution of 1:8 has significant effect (P<0.05)
   on the breakdown of the lignified matrix, resulting in pellets with
   superior physical characteristics. The steam exploded samples pretreated
   at higher temperatures (180 degrees C) and retention time of 10 min
   resulted into pellets with good physical qualities.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-based plasmonic devices have recently drawn great attention.
   However, practical limitations in fabrication and device architectures
   prevent studies from being carried out on the intrinsic properties of
   graphene and their change by plasmonic structures. The influence of a
   quasi-infinite object (i.e., the substrate) on graphene, being a single
   sheet of carbon atoms, and the plasmonic device is overwhelming. To
   address this and put the intrinsic properties of the graphene-plasmonic
   nanostructures in focus, we fabricate large-area, freestanding,
   single-layer graphene-gold (LEG-Au) sandwich structures and Au
   nanoparticle decorated graphene (formed via thermal treatment) hybrid
   plasmonic nanostructures. We observed two distinct plasmonic enhancement
   routes of graphene unique to each structure via surface-enhanced Raman
   spectroscopy. The localized electronic structure variation in the LEG
   due to graphene-Au interaction at the nanoscale is mapped using scanning
   transmission X-ray microscopy. The measurements show an optical density
   of similar to 0.007, which is the smallest experimentally determined for
   single-layer graphene thus far. Our results on freestanding graphene Au
   plasmonic structures provide great insight for the rational design and
   future fabrication of graphene plasmonic hybrid nanostructures.}},

   System}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The state-of-the-art capsule endoscopy (CE) technology offers painless
   examination for the patients and the ability to examine the interior of
   the gastrointestinal tract by a noninvasive procedure for the
   gastroenterologists. In this work, a modular and flexible CE development
   system platform consisting of a miniature field programmable gate array
   (FPGA) based electronic capsule, a microcontroller based portable data
   recorder unit and computer software is designed and developed. Due to
   the flexible and reprogrammable nature of the system, various image
   processing and compression algorithms can be tested in the design
   without requiring any hardware change. The designed capsule prototype
   supports various imaging modes including white light imaging (WLI) and
   narrow band imaging (NBI), and communicates with the data recorder in
   full duplex fashion, which enables configuring the image size and
   imaging mode in real time during examination. A low complexity image
   compressor based on a novel color-space is implemented inside the
   capsule to reduce the amount of RF transmission data. The data recorder
   contains graphical LCD for real time image viewing and SD cards for
   storing image data. Data can be uploaded to a computer or Smartphone by
   SD card, USB interface or by wireless Bluetooth link. Computer software
   is developed that decompresses and reconstructs images. The fabricated
   capsule PCBs have a diameter of 16 mm. An ex-vivo animal testing has
   also been conducted to validate the results.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied the effect of samarium doping concentration and thermal
   annealing on X-ray induced defect centers, including phosphorus-oxygen
   hole and electron centers (POHC and POEC), in Sm3+-doped fluorophosphate
   glasses towards developing a potential high-dose, high-resolution
   detector for microbeam radiation therapy. ESR measurements show that
   defect center formation is suppressed by increasing the Sm-dopant
   concentration with POECs more strongly influenced than POHCs. This can
   be explained by a model based on the competition between defect center
   formations and Sm3+ reversible arrow Sm2+ interconversion. Thermal
   annealing at increasing moderate temperatures (T-A = 100-300 degrees C)
   reduces the POHC related ESR and induced absorbance bands while those of
   POEC continue to survive. ESR measurements over a wider range show the
   trace of a very broad ESR signal in samples containing Sm2+ ions
   including those annealed at temperatures between 350 C and glass
   transition temperature (T-g approximate to 460 degrees C). Finally,
   thermal annealing at 550 degrees C (> T-g) totally erases all the ESR
   signals and restores the sample to its original unirradiated state.

Abstract = {{In recent years, de novo peptide sequencing from mass spectrometry data
   has developed as one of the major peptide identification methods with
   the emergence of new instruments and advanced computational methods.
   However, there are still limitations to this method; for example, the
   typically used spectrum graph model cannot represent all the information
   and relationships inherent in tandem mass spectra (MS/MS spectra). Here,
   we present a new method named NovoHCD which applies a spectrum graph
   model with multiple types of edges (called a multi-edge graph), and
   integrates into it amino acid combination (AAC) information and peptide
   tags. In addition, information on immonium ions observed particularly in
   higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) spectra is incorporated.
   Comparisons between NovoHCD and another successful de novo peptide
   sequencing method for HCD spectra, pNovo, were performed. Experiments
   were conducted on five HCD spectral datasets. Results show that NovoHCD
   outperforms pNovo in terms of full length peptide identification
   accuracy; specifically, the accuracy increases 13\%-21\% over the five
   datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Food products incorporating oil rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids are
   known to become easily rancid. In order to delay the process of
   oxidation there is a need to develop analytical methods that accurately

   Nigella sativa seed oil as a source of natural antioxidants. Further,
   the effect of blending the two oils on the oxidative stability of the
   unsaturated L. sativum oil was also studied. Electro-paramagnetic
   resonance (EPR) spectroscopy showed 100 \% 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
   (DPPH) radical quenching by both the oils at a concentration of 5 \% w/v
   oil in benzene thereby establishing the anti-oxidant potential of both
   the oils. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies showed
   addition of N. sativa oil to L. sativum oil enhanced its oxidation onset
   temperature, a relevant indicator of oil stability, thereby making N.
   sativa a source of natural antioxidants. Consequently, the DSC and EPR
   spectroscopy techniques so developed can find application in shelf life

   fermentable sugars, glucose and xylose respectively. Hemicellulose also
   includes small fermentable fractions of arabinose, galactose and
   mannose. The main issue in converting lignocellulosic biomass to fuel
   ethanol is the accessibility of the polysaccharides for enzymatic
   breakdown into monosaccharides. This study focused on the use of steam
   explosion as the pretreatment method for canola straw as lignocellulosic
   biomass.
   RESULTSResult showed that steam explosion treatment of biomass increased
   cellulose accessibility and it hydrolysis by enzyme hydrolysis.
   Following 72 h of enzyme hydrolysis, a maximum cellulose conversion to
   glucose yield of 29.40\% was obtained for the steam-exploded sample
   while the control showed 11.60\% glucose yields. Steam explosion
   pretreatment increased glucose production and glucose yield by 200\% and
   153.22\%, respectively, compared to the control sample. The crystalline
   index increased from 57.48\% in untreated canola straw to 64.72\% in
   steam-exploded samples.
   CONCLUSIONSteam explosion pretreatment of biomass increased cellulose
   accessibility, and enzymatic hydrolysis increased glucose production and
   glucose yield of canola straw. (c) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Dwarf galaxies and globular clusters may contain intermediate-mass black
   holes (10(3)-10(5)M(circle dot)) in their cores. Estimates of similar to
   10(3) neutron stars in the central parsec of the Galaxy and similar
   numbers in small elliptical galaxies and globular clusters along with an
   estimated high probability of millisecond (ms)-pulsar formation in those
   environments have led many workers to propose the use of ms-pulsar
   timing to measure the mass and spin of intermediate-mass black holes.
   Models of pulsarmotion around a rotating black hole generally assume
   geodesic motion of a `test' particle in the Kerr metric. These
   approaches account for well-known effects like de Sitter precession and
   the Lense-Thirring effect but they do not account for the non-linear
   effect of the pulsar's stress-energy tensor on the space-time metric.
   Here we model the motion of a pulsar near a black hole with the
   Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations. Numerical integration of the
   MPD equations for black holes of masses 2 x 10(6), 10(5) and 10(3)
   M-circle dot shows that the pulsar will not remain in an orbital plane
   with motion vertical to the plane being largest relative to the orbit's
   radial dimensions for the lower mass black holes. The pulsar's
   out-ofplane motion will lead to timing variations that are up to similar
   to 10 mu s different from those predicted by planar orbit models. Such
   variations might be detectable in long-term observations of ms pulsars.
   If pulsar signals are used to measure the mass and spin of
   intermediate-mass black holes on the basis of dynamical models of the
   received pulsar signal, then the out-of-plane motion of the pulsar
   should be part of that model.}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Organic contaminants have become one of the most serious environmental
   problems, and the removal of organic contaminants (e.g., dyes,
   pesticides, and pharmaceuticals/drugs) and common industrial organic
   wastes (e.g., phenols and aromatic amines) from aqueous solutions is of
   special concern because they are recalcitrant and persistent in the
   environment. In recent years, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been
   gradually applied to the removal of organic contaminants from wastewater
   through adsorption processes. This paper reviews recent progress (145
   studies published from 2010 to 2013) in the application of CNTs and
   their composites for the removal of toxic organic pollutants from
   contaminated water. The paper discusses removal efficiencies and
   adsorption mechanisms as well as thermodynamics and reaction kinetics.
   CNTs are predicted to have considerable prospects for wider application
   to wastewater treatment in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Nitric acid functionalized steam activated carbon (NAFSAC) was prepared
   from waste fluid petroleum coke (FPC) and used as a support material for
   the synthesis of a NiMo catalyst (2.5 wt-\% Ni and 13 wt-\% Mo). The
   catalyst was then used for the hydrotreatment of light gas oil. The
   support and catalysts were characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)
   gas adsorption method, X-ray diffraction, H-2-temperature programmed
   reduction, NH3-temperature programmed desorption, CO-chemisorption, mass
   spetrography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Boehm titration, and
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The SEM results showed
   that the carbon material retained a needle like structure after
   functionalization with HNO3. The Boehm titration, FTIR, and BET results
   confirmed that the HNO3 functionalized material had moderate acidity,
   surface functional groups, and mesoporosity respectively. The produced
   NAFSAC had an inert nature, exhibited the sink effect and few metal
   support interactions, and contained functional groups. All of which make
   it a suitable support material for the preparation of a NiMo
   hydrotreating catalyst. Hydrotreating activity studies of the
   NiMo/NAFSAC catalyst were carried out under industrial operating
   conditions in a laboratory trickle bed reactor using coker light gas oil
   as the feedstock. A parallel study was performed on the hydrotreating
   activity of NiMo/gamma-Al2O3 as a reference catalyst. The
   hydrodesulfurization and hydrodenitrogenation activities of the
   NiMo/NAFSAC catalyst were 62\% and 30\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{To compensate for the nonlinear effects of nanopositioning stages and
   their model uncertainties, several control methods have been developed
   and reported in the literature. One promising method for compensation is
   the use of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-based sliding-mode
   control (SMC), in which the nonlinear effects are treated as an unknown
   disturbance to the system. If the nonlinearity and the model
   uncertainties can be completely or partially estimated, integration of
   their estimations into the control schemes may lead to improved
   performance. On this basis, this paper presents the development of a
   disturbance-observer-based (DOB) SMC, in which the nonlinearity of the
   nanopositioning stage is partially predicted through the use of an
   observer and then compensated by the PID-based SMC. Experiments were
   performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes,
   and the results showed that the performance of the nanopositioning stage
   by employing the DOB-SMC was greatly improved, as compared to the
   PID-based SMC.}},

Abstract = {{In a deregulated electric market, offering the appropriate amount of
   electricity at the right time with the right bidding price is of
   paramount importance for utility companies maximizing their profits.
   Mid-term electricity market clearing price (MCP) forecasting has become
   essential for resources reallocation, maintenance scheduling, bilateral
   contracting, budgeting and planning. Although there are many techniques
   available for short-term electricity MCP forecasting, very little has
   been done in the area of mid-term electricity MCP forecasting. A
   multiple support vector machine (SVM) based mid-term electricity MCP
   forecasting model is proposed in this paper. Data classification and
   price forecasting modules are designed to first pre-process the input
   data into corresponding price zones, and then forecast the electricity
   price. The proposed model showed improved forecasting accuracy on both
   peak prices and overall system compared with the forecasting model using
   a single SVM. PJM interconnection data are used to test the proposed
   model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{125}},
Pages = {{90-100}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Bio-chars are produced by means of a mobile pyrolysis unit from fast
   pyrolysis of different types of Canadian waste biomass including
   agricultural waste (wheat straw and flax straw), forest residue
   (sawdust) and animal manure (poultry litter). They were analyzed for
   their physicochemical changes with pyrolysis temperature (400-550
   degrees C). To study the chemical nature of bio-char samples, analyses
   such as XRD, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, SEM, ICP, TGA and electrical
   conductivity measurements were performed. ICP-MS analysis showed that
   poultry litter-derived bio-char had the largest concentration of
   inorganic elements (similar to 200,000 ppm) followed by wheat straw,
   flax straw and sawdust derived bio-chars. In addition, the alkaline
   elements were 4-14 times that of essential elements (Fe and P) and 18-57
   times that of heavy elements. Electrical conductivity of bio-chars, a
   measure of their salinity, was maximum for all samples prepared at 400
   degrees C. SEM showed that sawdust derived bio-chars retained relatively
   less dissociated surfaces compared with other bio-chars. XRD confirmed
   the presence of sylvite, dolomite and quartz in the bio-chars. The
   deconvoluted XPS spectra indicated that for all precursors except
   poultry litter, aromatic/aliphatic carbon portion increased in the
   corresponding bio-char with the pyrolysis temperature. For all
   precursors, O/C mass ratio decreased with an increase in the pyrolysis
   temperature due to the development of compact aromatic structure in
   bio-char. This result was confirmed by a drastic increase in I-D/I-G
   (defect to graphitic carbon) ratio of bio-char samples produced at 550
   degrees C from the deconvolution results of Raman spectroscopy.
   Thermogravimetric analysis showed that biomass decomposition started at
   lower temperatures for the following order: poultry litter, wheat straw,
   flax straw and sawdust. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   reflectance modeling. Absorption spectra of anthocyanins, betacyanins,
   betaxanthins, chlorophyll a and b, and carotenoids were obtained between
   300 and 800 nm at 1-nm intervals. These pigments were extracted from
   plant material and separated using column and thin layer chromatography.
   The two methods showed consistent results for all pigments except the
   chlorophylls which could not be fully separated using simple column
   chromatography. The anthocyanin and betacyanin spectra were very similar
   but anthocyanin displayed greater absorption in the UV range. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Microwave irradiation was used in this study for the torrefaction of
   wheat and barley straw. The torrefaction effect was studied by varying
   the microwave power level (200-300 W), reaction time (10-20 min) and
   moisture content of biomass (5-15\%). Mass yield and energy yield of the
   torrefied biomass was determined. Fuel properties like H/C and O/C ratio
   were assessed from elemental composition. Grinding characteristics and
   hydrophobicity of the torrefied sample were studied and compared with
   the raw biomass. Barley straw tended to carbonize more under microwave
   irradiation with 29.1\% increase in the C content against 16.2\% in the
   case of wheat straw when torrefied at 300 W for 20 min. Both H/C and O/C
   ratio decreased with increase in power and reaction time. The energy
   density increased by 14-15\% in wheat straw and 21-23\% in barley straw
   under suitable reaction condition. Mass and energy yields were
   64.0-97.8\% and 73.8-98.4\%, respectively for wheat straw. In barley
   straw, mass and energy yields were 42.7-97.4\% and 52.5-97.3\%,
   respectively. Moisture content of the biomass did not affect the
   reaction as much as other parameters and the mass yields were comparable
   between different moisture contents. Grindability of the biomass
   improved significantly after torrefaction. The particle size ratio
   between torrefied and untreated straw after grinding was 0.66 and 0.61
   for wheat and barley, respectively. The torrefied biomass was more
   hydrophobic and the moisture uptake was reduced by 61-68\% under
   suitable torrefaction condition. Microwave irradiation can be used
   effectively for torrefaction of the two biomass investigated at moderate
   power and short process time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a prototype molecular system and a sister
   molecule of water (H2O). The phase diagram of solid H2S at high
   pressures remains largely unexplored arising from the challenges in
   dealing with the pressure-induced weakening of S-H bond and larger
   atomic core difference between H and S. Metallization is yet achieved
   for H2O, but it was observed for H2S above 96 GPa. However, the metallic
   structure of H2S remains elusive, greatly impeding the understanding of
   its metallicity and the potential superconductivity. We have performed
   an extensive structural study on solid H2S at pressure ranges of 10-200
   GPa through an unbiased structure prediction method based on particle
   swarm optimization algorithm. Besides the findings of candidate
   structures for nonmetallic phases IV and V, we are able to establish
   stable metallic structures violating an earlier proposal of elemental
   decomposition into sulfur and hydrogen {[}R. Rousseau, M. Boero, M.
   Bernasconi, M. Parrinello, and K. Terakura, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1254
   (2000)]. Our study unravels a superconductive potential of metallic H2S
   with an estimated maximal transition temperature of similar to 80 K at
   160 GPa, higher than those predicted for most archetypal
   hydrogen-containing compounds (e.g., SiH4, GeH4, etc.). (C) 2014 AIP

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{17}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{A recent experimental study reported the successful synthesis of an
   orthorhombic FeB4 with a high hardness of 62(5) GPa {[}H. Gou et al.,
   Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 157002 (2013)], which has reignited extensive
   interests on whether transition-metal borides compounds will become
   superhard materials. However, it is contradicted with some theoretical
   studies suggesting transition-metal boron compounds are unlikely to
   become superhard materials. Here, we examined structural and electronic
   properties of FeB4 using density functional theory. The electronic
   calculations show the good metallicity and covalent Fe-B bonding.
   Meanwhile, we extensively investigated stress-strain relations of FeB4
   under various tensile and shear loading directions. The calculated
   weakest tensile and shear stresses are 40 GPa and 25 GPa, respectively.
   Further simulations (e. g., electron localization function and bond
   length along the weakest loading direction) on FeB4 show the weak Fe-B
   bonding is responsible for this low hardness. Moreover, these results
   are consistent with the value of Vickers hardness (11.7-32.3 GPa) by
   employing different empirical hardness models and below the
   super-hardness threshold of 40 GPa. Our current results suggest FeB4 is
   a hard material and unlikely to become superhard (>40 GPa). (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Transesterification of vegetable oil with lower alcohols leads to
   biodiesel formation which is accompanied by similar to 10 wt\% glycerol
   as the co-product. Since biodiesel production is going on massive scale
   across the world, huge quantity of surplus glycerol will be available.
   Bioglycerol ought to be converted into valuable chemicals and fuels to
   enable biodiesel to be cost competitive with reference to petro-diesel.
   Depending on reaction conditions and catalysts, the
   hydrogenolysis/hydrogenation of glycerol can produce 1,2-propylene
   glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol, and ethylene glycol; all of which can be
   further converted into valuable chemicals. The objective of the current
   work was to convert ethylene glycol to value added etherified products
   by reaction with 1-octene to 2-(octan-2-yloxy) ethanol (C8 ether) and
   1,2-bis(octan2-yloxy) ethane (C16 ether). Several heterogeneous solid
   acid catalysts were used such as 20\% (w/w) dodecatungstophosphoric acid
   (DTP) supported on K10 clay (DTP/K10), 20\% (w/w) Cs-2.5
   H-0.5,PW12O40/K10 (Cs-DTP/K10), 20\% (w/w) DTP/ZrO2, and Amberlyst-35.
   Among them 20\% (w/w) DTP/K10 was found to be the most efficient
   catalyst with 72\% conversion of ethylene glycol and 80\% of selectivity
   toward 2-(octan-2-yloxy) ethanol (C8 ether). The optimum reaction
   conditions were as follows: ethylene glycol to 1-octene mole ratio 1:3,
   catalyst loading 0.03 g/cm(3), temperature 140 degrees C, pressure 1.5
   MPa, reaction time 5 h. The effects of different process parameters such
   as speed of agitation, catalyst loading, mole ratio, temperature, and
   reusability of the catalyst were studied to examine the efficacy of 20\%
   (w/w) DTP/K10. The process is solvent less, green and clean. Other
   substrates were also used to enhance the scope of this work. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Hydrogeneolysis of glycerol to propylene glycol has high interest due to
   cost and ease of availability of glycerol. In this study, Cu:Zn:Cr:Zr
   based catalyst was used for selective hydrogeneolysis of glycerol to
   propylene glycol. It was observed that incorporation of zinc and
   zirconium in Cu:Cr catalyst matrix improved glycerol conversion and
   propylene glycol selectivity. This improvement is due to increases in
   acidity which is confirmed by NH3-TPD and Cu dispersion in the catalyst
   matrix which is measured by CO-chemisorption. XRD results confirmed the
   presence of active metallic Cu in the reduced catalyst. The liquid phase
   reaction was carried out with 80 wt\% of glycerol solution at 240
   degrees C, with 4 MPa of hydrogen pressure and 3 wt\% catalyst loading.
   The novel catalyst Cu:Zn:Cr:Zr with the elemental molar ratio of 3:2:1:3
   gave 100\% of pure glycerol conversion and 97\% of propylene glycol
   selectivity. The effects of temperature, hydrogen pressure, glycerol
   concentration and speed of agitation were studied for reaction
   optimization. A hydrogenolysis of crude glycerol obtained from biodiesel
   process, was also carried out under similar reaction condition to yield
   90\% of propylene glycol. Kinetic study was delineated and reaction
   followed the pseudo first order with respect to glycerol. The apparent
   activation energy was found to be 31.7 kcal/mol. The catalyst has good
   reusability up to four runs. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by

Abstract = {{Advanced biological technologies are producing large-scale
   protein-protein interaction (PPI) data at an ever increasing pace, which
   enable us to identify protein complexes from PPI networks. Pair-wise
   protein interactions can be modeled as a graph, where vertices represent
   proteins and edges represent PPIs. However most of current algorithms
   detect protein complexes based on deterministic graphs, whose edges are
   either present or absent. Neighboring information is neglected in these
   methods. Based on the uncertain graph model, we propose the concept of
   expected density to assess the density degree of a subgraph, the concept
   of relative degree to describe the relationship between a protein and a
   subgraph in a PPI network. We develop an algorithm called DCU (detecting
   complex based on uncertain graph model) to detect complexes from PPI
   networks. In our method, the expected density combined with the relative
   degree is used to determine whether a subgraph represents a complex with
   high cohesion and low coupling. We apply our method and the existing
   competing algorithms to two yeast PPI networks. Experimental results
   indicate that our method performs significantly better than the
   state-of-the-art methods and the proposed model can provide more
   insights for future study in PPI networks.}},

Abstract = {{We present a spectroscopic study of the iron M-2/3-edge for several
   minerals and compounds to reveal information about the oxidation state
   and the local coordination of iron. We describe a novel approach to
   probe the iron M-2/3-edge bulk sensitively using X-ray Raman scattering.
   Significant changes in the onset and shape of the Fe M-2/3-edge were
   observed on ferrous and ferric model compounds with Fe in octahedral and
   tetrahedral coordination. Simulation of the spectra is possible using an
   atomic multiplet code, which potentially allows determination of, e. g.,
   crystal-field parameters in a quantitative manner. A protocol is
   discussed for determination of the Fe oxidation state in compounds by
   linear combination of spectra of ferric and ferrous end members. The
   presented results demonstrate the capabilities of Fe M-2/3-edge
   spectroscopy by X-ray Raman scattering to extract information on the
   ratio of trivalent to total iron Fe3+/Sigma Fe and local coordination.
   As X-ray Raman scattering is performed with hard X-rays, this approach
   is suitable for in situ experiments at high pressure and temperature. It
   thus may provide indispensable information on oxidation state,
   electronic structure and local structure of materials that are important
   for physical and chemical processes of the deep Earth.}},

   substrate}},
Journal = {{DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{1-6}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We report on the enhanced interfacial adhesion of diamond coating on
   copper substrate modified by a small fraction of Al. For pure copper
   substrate, the diamond coating formed tends to crack and delaminate,
   primarily caused by a slight accumulation of detrimental graphite
   intermediate layer and thermal stress induced by mismatch of the
   coefficients of thermal expansion. Additions of 1 and 3 at.\% Al to the
   copper substrate gradually decrease the intermediate graphitic phase. At
   the higher Al concentration, an aluminium oxide forms at the
   coating-substrate interface, and graphitic/amorphous carbon is
   completely inhibited, leading to significantly enhanced interfacial
   adhesion of diamond coating. The electron structure of copper is not
   observed to significantly alter on this Cu-Al dilute alloy. The alumina
   barrier layer preferentially formed on copper surface is believed to
   play a key role in preventing graphitization and adhesion enhancement.

Abstract = {{Contemporary information modeling of enterprise systems only focuses on
   the technical aspect of the systems, though it is known that they are
   social-technical (socio-tech) systems in essence. In fact, there are
   many lessons that can be learned from failures in the management of
   enterprise systems, which range from a small one (e. g., failure to
   install a printer driver) to a large one (e. g., nuclear power plant
   post-accident management). This paper, therefore, proposes that the
   enterprise system should be viewed as a socio-tech system. The paper
   presents a novel integrated approach to information modeling of
   socio-tech enterprise systems. In particular, the approach integrates
   object-orientation, systems-dynamics (as a means to represent high-level
   dynamics), and aspect-programming. The paper discusses an example to
   illustrate how the proposed approach works.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo compare bursting strength, construction time, and
   anastomotic dimensions of 4 jejunoileal anastomotic techniques.
   Study DesignExperimental ex vivo study.
   AnimalsAdult horses (n=12).
   MethodsJejunoileal anastomoses were constructed from harvested ileal and
   distal jejunal segments using a single-layer Lembert technique (1HS),
   double-layer simple continuous/Cushing technique (2HS), stapled
   side-to-side technique (SS), or stapled functional end-to-end technique
   (FEE). Anastomotic construction time was recorded. Bursting pressures
   (BP), bursting wall tension (BWT), percentage of mean anastomotic
   luminal diameter reduction, percentage of luminal diameter reduction
   relative to adjacent ileal and jejunal diameters and stomal length, were
   calculated.
   ResultsFEE had the shortest construction time. BP of 1HS and 2HS was
   significantly higher than FEE and SS (P<.001), which were not different
   from each other (P=.67). There were no significant differences in BP
   (P=.25) and BWT (P=.21) between 1HS and 2HS. Mean luminal diameter
   reduction was less for 1HS (25.1\%) than for 2HS (34.8\%), however, not
   statistically different (P=.12). Luminal diameter reduction relative to
   ileal diameter was significantly less for 1HS (15.2\%) than for 2HS
   (28.47\%; P=.012). Luminal diameter reduction relative to jejunal
   diameter was less for 1HS (32.4\%) than 2HS (44.6\%) but not
   statistically different; P=.07). Stomal length was significantly larger
   for SS (9.93cm) than FEE (7.32cm; P=.0002).
   Conclusion1HS and 2HS jejunoileal anastomosis are equal in strength;
   however, 1HS results in less relative luminal diameter reduction. SS and
   FEE have comparable strength but fail at significantly lower BPs than
   hand-sewn jejunoileal anastomoses.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanism of corrosion in aluminum particles by hot water treatment for
   hydrogen generation is evaluated. The aluminum powder was activated by
   ball milling for different durations, which modified size and
   microstructure of the particles. Open circuit potential test was carried
   out to elucidate different stages of the reaction. Tafel test was used
   to explain the effect of ball milling and growth of hydroxide layer on
   corrosion of the particles. Surface, cross section and thickness of the
   grown hydroxide on the aluminum particles were studied in a scanning
   electron microscope. The corrosion potential of the aluminum powders
   depends on microstructure of the aluminum particles, growth of the
   hydroxide layer and a change in pH because of cathodic reactions. The
   hydrogen production test showed that a deformed microstructure and
   smaller particle size accelerates the corrosion rate of aluminum by hot
   water, the effect of the deformed microstructure being more significant
   at the beginning of the reaction. Effect of growth of the hydroxide
   layer on corrosion mechanism is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Quantile-Based Downscaling of Precipitation Using Genetic Programming:
   Application to IDF Curves in Saskatoon}},

Abstract = {{Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves are commonly used in
   engineering planning and design. Considering the possible effects of
   climate change on extreme precipitation, it is crucial to analyze
   potential variations in IDF curves. This paper presents a quantile-based
   downscaling framework to update IDF curves using the projections of
   future precipitation obtained from general circulation models (GCMs).
   Genetic programming is applied to extract duration-variant and
   duration-invariant mathematical equations to map from daily extreme
   rainfall quantiles at the GCM scale to corresponding daily and subdaily
   extreme rainfall quantiles at the local scale. The proposed approach is
   applied to extract downscaling relationships and to investigate possible
   changes in the IDF curves for the City of Saskatoon, Canada. The results
   show that genetic programming is a promising tool for extracting
   mathematical mappings between extreme rainfall quantiles at the GCM and
   local scales. The duration-variant mappings were found to be more
   accurate than the duration-invariant relationships. Using the extracted
   relationships, future changes in IDF curves in the City of Saskatoon are
   estimated using projections obtained from the CGCM3.1 based on A1B, A2,
   and B1 emission scenarios. The results show that future IDF curves in
   the City of Saskatoon are subject to change, but the sign, magnitude,
   and uncertainty in the estimates of possible changes depend on the
   emission scenario, storm duration, return period, and mapping equations.
   Regardless of the emission scenario and/or the mapping relationships,
   the results of this study show increases in short-duration extreme
   rainfall with short return periods in Saskatoon. This study shows that
   the downscaling of extreme precipitation quantiles directly from the
   corresponding large-scale estimates can be an efficient approach when
   estimating the design precipitation values under climate change are
   sought.}},

Abstract = {{At the Canadian Light Source (CLS), the plans for the construction of
   three beamlines under the Brockhouse Project are underway. The
   beamlines, to be classified under the CLS Phase III beamlines, will
   comprise of a wiggler and an undulator, and will be dedicated to x-ray
   diffraction and scattering experiments. The energy range of these
   beamlines will be 7-22 keV (low energy wiggler beamline), 20-94 key
   (high energy wiggler beamline), and 5-21 keV (undulator beamline). The
   beamlines will have a total of five hutches. Presented is the shielding
   design against target scattered white and monochromatic synchrotron
   radiations for these beamlines. The shielding design is based on:
   scatter target material-water, dose object-anthropomorphic phantom of
   the adult human (anteroposterior-AP geometry), and shielding thicknesses
   of steel and lead that will drop the radiation leakage from the hutches
   to below 0.5 mu Sv/h. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FIRE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{693-719}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Two models that can be used to predict full-scale heat release rates of
   polyurethane foam slabs were evaluated in this study. Predictions were
   compared with results of furniture calorimeter tests of 10 cm thick
   polyurethane foam specimens which were ignited in the centre or on the
   edge. Furniture calorimeter results indicated that peak heat release
   rates and fire growth rates were higher during centre ignition tests
   than edge ignition tests. For both situations, the growth phase of the
   heat release rate curves measured in the full-scale tests was
   successfully predicted using t (2) design fires; the choice of a
   specific t (2) fire depended on the surface area of the specimen and
   ignition location. A model originally developed during the European
   Combustion Behaviour of Upholstered Furniture (CBUF) project was also
   evaluated using heat release rate data from cone calorimeter tests and
   flame area burning rates measured using infrared video records of the
   furniture calorimeter tests. This model was able to successfully predict
   the initial growth phase of the fires and predictions of peak heat
   release rates were within 17\% of measured values. The model had less
   success in predicting heat release rates later in the growth phase and
   during the decay phase of the fires, and did not appear to capture all
   of the physics of the full-scale tests, in particular foam melting and
   subsequent liquid pool burning. As the model did show promise, future
   work is planned to address these shortcomings and to develop improved
   flame spread models for polyurethane foam.}},

Abstract = {{A new process has been developed to grow silicon (Si) nanowires (NWs),

   inert atmosphere, reacts with thermally grown SiO2 on Si at 1100 A
   degrees C enhancing the growth of SiNWs directly on Si wafers.
   High-resolution transmission electron microscopy studies show that the
   NWs consists of a crystalline core of 25 nm in diameter and an amorphous
   oxide shell of 2 nm in thickness, which was also supported by selected
   area electron diffraction patterns. The NWs synthesized exhibit a high
   aspect ratio of 167 and room temperature phonon confinement effect. This
   simple and economical process to synthesize crystalline SiNWs opens up a
   new way for large scale applications.}},

Title = {{Viable Dark Matter via Radiative Symmetry Breaking in a Scalar Singlet
   Higgs Portal Extension of the Standard Model}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{We consider the generation of dark matter mass via radiative electroweak
   symmetry breaking in an extension of the conformal standard model
   containing a singlet scalar field with a Higgs portal interaction.
   Generating the mass from a sequential process of radiative electroweak
   symmetry breaking followed by a conventional Higgs mechanism can account
   for less than 35\% of the cosmological dark matter abundance for dark
   matter mass M-s > 80 GeV. However, in a dynamical approach where both
   Higgs and scalar singlet masses are generated via radiative electroweak
   symmetry breaking, we obtain much higher levels of dark matter
   abundance. At one-loop level we find abundances of 10\%-100\% with 106
   GeV < M-s < 120 GeV. However, when the higher-order effects needed for
   consistency with a 125 GeV Higgs mass are estimated, the abundance
   becomes 10\%-80\% for 80 GeV < M-s < 96 GeV, representing a significant
   decrease in the dark matter mass. The dynamical approach also predicts a
   small scalar-singlet self-coupling, providing a natural explanation for
   the astrophysical observations that place upper bounds on dark matter
   self-interaction. The predictions in all three approaches are within the
   M-s > 80 GeV detection region of the next generation XENON experiment.}},

Abstract = {{We have often observed unexpected state transitions of complex systems.
   We are thus interested in how to steer a complex system from an
   unexpected state to a desired state. Here we introduce the concept of
   transittability of complex networks, and derive a new sufficient and
   necessary condition for state transittability which can be efficiently
   verified. We define the steering kernel as a minimal set of steering
   nodes to which control signals must directly be applied for transition
   between two specific states of a network, and propose a graph-theoretic
   algorithm to identify the steering kernel of a network for transition
   between two specific states. We applied our algorithm to 27 real complex
   networks, finding that sizes of steering kernels required for
   transittability are much less than those for complete controllability.
   Furthermore, applications to regulatory biomolecular networks not only
   validated our method but also identified the steering kernel for their
   phenotype transitions.}},

Volume = {{148}},

Month = {{APR 27}},
Abstract = {{This work addresses characterization of Mn2O3 materials by EXAFS
   technique and the mechanism of toluene oxidation by ozone over
   MnOx/gamma-alumina (10\%) catalyst. Bond Valence Model was used to model
   EXAFS signal of bulk and nano-particles of Mn2O3. The Bond Valence Model
   relates formal oxidation state of Mn atoms to the coordination number of
   oxygen atoms at the first Mn shell, adding restraints to the EXAFS
   theoretical models. Use of the Bond Valence Model resulted in
   distinguishing closely located oxygen atoms around each Mn site without
   any simplifying assumption on the structure of Mn2O3. Kinetic study of
   catalytic oxidation of toluene by ozone using MnOxty-alumina (10\%) was
   performed at constant toluene or ozone partial pressures by varying the
   reactor space time in the range of 0-1212 kg(cat.) mol(to)l. (-1).
   Differential method of analysis was used to estimate the initial
   reaction rates. Apparent activation energy of the reaction was
   determined to be 31 kJ mol(-1), obtained by a power law model. The power
   law model also determined the reaction orders with respect to toluene
   and ozone as -1 and 2, respectively. To explain the initial reaction
   rates, two Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanisms based on different toluene
   activation steps were examined. The first mechanism was based on
   activation of adsorbed toluene molecule by atomic oxygen while the
   second model was based on activation of toluene molecule via abstraction
   of hydrogen from the methyl group. The second Langmuir-Hinshelwood
   mechanism led to the same rate equation as the power law model,
   explaining the effect of toluene and ozone partial pressures on toluene
   oxidation rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen from waste biomass is considered to be a clean gaseous fuel and
   efficient for heat and power generation due to its high energy content.
   Supercritical water gasification is found promising in hydrogen
   production by avoiding biomass drying and allowing maximum conversion.
   Waste biomass contains cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin; hence it is
   essential to understand their degradation mechanisms to engineer
   hydrogen production in high-pressure systems. Process conditions higher
   than 374 degrees C and 22.1 MPa are required for biomass conversion to
   gases. Reaction temperature, pressure, feed concentration, residence
   time and catalyst have prominent roles in gasification. This review
   focuses on the degradation routes of biomass model compounds such as
   cellulose and lignin at near and supercritical conditions. Some
   homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts leading to water-gas shift,
   methanation and other sub-reactions during supercritical water
   gasification are highlighted. The parametric impacts along with some
   reactor configurations for maximum hydrogen production and technical
   challenges encountered during hydrothermal gasification processes are
   also discussed. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{RATIONALE
   This study aimed at evaluating the collision-induced dissociation tandem
   mass spectrometric (CID-MS/MS) fragmentation patterns of novel
   beta-cyclodextrin-substituted- and bis-pyridinium gemini surfactants
   currently being explored as nanomaterial drug delivery agents. In the
   beta-cyclodextrin-substituted gemini surfactants, a beta-cyclodextrin
   ring is grafted onto an
   N,N-bis(dimethylalkyl)-alpha,omega-aminoalkane-diammonium moiety using
   variable succinyl linkers. In contrast, the bis-pyridinium gemini
   surfactants are based on a
   1,1'-(1,1'-(ethane-1,2-diylbis(sulfanediyl))bis(alkane-2,1-diyl))dipyrid
   inium template, defined by two symmetrical N-alkylpyridinium parts
   connected through a fixed ethane dithiol spacer.
   METHODS
   Detection of the precursor ion {[}M](2+) species of the synthesized
   compounds and the determination of mass accuracies were conducted using
   a QqTOF-MS instrument. A multi-stage tandem MS analysis of the detected
   {[}M](2+) species was conducted using the QqQ-LIT-MS instrument. Both
   instruments were equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source.
   RESULTS
   Abundant precursor ion {[}M](2+) species were detected for all compounds
   at sub-1 ppm mass accuracies. The beta-cyclodextrin-substituted
   compounds, fragmented via two main pathways: Pathway 1: the loss of one
   head-tail region produces a {[}M-(N(Me)(2)-R)](2+) ion, from which sugar
   moieties (Glc) are sequentially cleaved; Pathway 2: both head-tail
   regions are lost to give {[}M-2(N(Me)(2)-R)](+), followed by consecutive
   loss of Glc units. Alternatively, the cleavage of the Glc units could
   also have occurred simultaneously. Nevertheless, the fragmentation
   evolved around the quaternary ammonium cations, with characteristic
   cleavage of Glc moieties. For the bis-pyridinium gemini compounds, they
   either lost neutral pyridine(s) to give doubly charged ions (Pathway A)
   or formed complementary pyridinium alongside other singly charged ions
   (Pathway B). Similar to beta-cyclodextrin-substituted compounds, the
   fragmentation was centered on the pyridinium functional groups.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The MSn analyses of these novel gemini surfactants, reported here for
   the first time, revealed diagnostic ions for each compound, with a
   universal fragmentation pattern for each compound series. The diagnostic
   ions will be employed within liquid chromatography (LC)/MS/MS methods
   for screening, identification, and quantification of these compounds
   within biological samples. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Astaxanthin (AX) is a high valued ketocarotenoid having numerous
   applications in the food and pharmaceutical industry. The present study
   is a combined approach of using ultrasound extraction with three phase

   were: 100\% amplitude for 20 s (wet biomass) and 60 s (dried biomass)
   using solid to solvent ratio (1:2) at a distance of 15 mm between the
   base of the extraction vessel and the tip of the probe. Pretreatment of
   the dried biomass (particle size 0.8 mu m) with 70\% acetone (70 degrees
   C, 25 min) resulted in maximum ultrasonic extraction of 1035 mu g/g of
   dried biomass. The astaxanthin content (mu g/g) extracted using dried
   biomass, dried using different drying methods showed hot air oven drying
   at 35 degrees C (946 +/- 23) to be comparable to freeze drying (950 +/-
   19) and vacuum oven drying (945 +/- 22). Astaxanthin from the disrupted

Title = {{An improved peptide-spectral matching algorithm through distributed
   search over multiple cores and multiple CPUs}},
Journal = {{PROTEOME SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: A real-time peptide-spectrum matching (RT-PSM) algorithm is
   a database search method to interpret tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) with
   strict time constraints. Restricted by the hardware and architecture of
   individual workstation, previous RT-PSM algorithms either are not fast
   enough to satisfy all real-time system requirements or need to sacrifice
   the level of inference accuracy to provide the required processing
   speed.
   Results: We develop two parallelized algorithms for MS/MS data analysis:
   a multi-core RT-PSM (MC RT-PSM) algorithm which works on individual
   workstations and a distributed computing RT-PSM (DC RT-PSM) algorithm
   which works on a computer cluster. Two data sets are employed to
   evaulate the performance of our proposed algorithms. The simulation
   results show that our proposed algorithms can reach approximately
   216.9-fold speedup on a sub-task process (similarity scoring module) and
   84.78-fold speedup on the overall process compared with a single-thread
   process of the RT-PSM algorithm when 240 logical cores are employed.
   Conclusions: The improved RT-PSM algorithms can achieve the processing
   speed requirement without sacrificing the level of inference accuracy.
   With some configuration adjustments, the proposed algorithm can support
   many peptide identification programs, such as X!Tandem, CUDA version
   RT-PSM, etc.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure of API X70 pipeline steel was modified by applying
   different heat treatments including water-quenched, water-sprayed, and
   water-quenched and tempered. Hydrogen induced cracking behavior was
   investigated on the X70 steel at these heat treatments. Two test
   methods, Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) and vacuum thermal
   desorption, were used to release hydrogen from reversible and
   irreversible traps. The experimental results showed that the highest
   amount of discharged hydrogen in reversible and irreversible traps was
   related to the water-sprayed and as-received steels. The hydrogen
   discharged content from reversible traps reached to a saturation level
   after 8 h of charging, and it decreased considerably when the steels
   were charged for 15 h and 24 h. Hydrogen discharge tests proved that a
   higher amount of hydrogen inside steel is not a reliable measure for HIC
   evaluation. HIC test results also document that the water-quenched steel
   with agglomerated martensite particles had the highest susceptibility to
   HIC. Texture study results show that a low fraction of important texture
   components, such as \{023\}, \{321\} and \{334\} cannot be reliably used
   to evaluate HIC. As a result, a novel method of manufacturing of
   pipeline steels with an optimized texture is required to increase safety
   and reliability of transportation of sour gas and oil. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{An investigation was conducted to determine the effect of addition of
   different levels of AK2, a fuel additive that reduces ash fusion for
   agricultural biomass, on the physico-chemical properties of biomass
   pellets. Three different biomass straws, barley, oat, and wheat were
   ground at two hammer mill screen sizes of 0.8 mm and 1 6 mm. Each ground
   biomass sample was mixed with three levels of AK2, 0.05\%, 0.10\%, and
   0.15\% by mass and also a blank (no AK2) was set aside for comparison.
   Pellets were made using single-pelleting unit at a pre-set load of 4 400
   N corresponding to a pressure of 138.9 MPa. Physical quality of pellets
   were determined by measuring pellet density, relaxed density,
   durability, and the specific energy required to make a pellet. Pellets
   having higher durability values (74\%-88\%) were obtained from ground
   straw at hammer screen size of 0.8 mm and AK2 level of 0.15\% compared
   to other treatments. Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur content of
   blank pellets and those with 0.15\% AK2 at hammer screen size of 0.8 mm
   were determined. Pellets made with 0.15\% AK2 at hammer screen size of
   0.8 mm, manufactured by pilot-scale pellet mill, were gasified and the
   tar content was determined. The tar content of pellets with 0.15\% AK2
   was significantly lower than blank pellets.}},

Abstract = {{This article evaluates current radiofrequency ablation systems using
   axiomatic design theory. Due to its minimally invasive procedure,
   short-time hospital stay, low cost, and tumour metastasis treatment, the
   radiofrequency ablation technique has been playing an important role in
   tumour treatment in recent decades. Although the radiofrequency ablation
   technique has many advantages, some issues still need to be addressed.
   Among these issues, the two most important are as follows: (1) the size
   of tumours to be removed (has to be larger than 3 cm in diameter) and
   (2) cleanness of the removal. Many device solutions have been proposed
   to address the two issues. However, there is a lack of knowledge
   regarding the systematic evaluation of these solutions. This article
   evaluates these systems in terms of their solution principles (or simply
   called conceptual design in general product design theory) using a
   design theory called axiomatic design theory. In addition, with the
   axiomatic design theory, a better conceptual design in terms of its
   feasibility to cope with incomplete target tissue necrosis from the
   large size of tumours has been found. The detailed analysis and
   simulation of the new conceptual design are conducted using finite
   element approach. The results in this article are proved by the
   information of animal experiments and clinical practices obtained from
   the literature. This study thus contributes to the current knowledge to
   further developments in radiofrequency ablation systems and procedure
   guidelines for physicians to perform the radiofrequency ablation
   operation more effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Alfven ballooning modes provide an important mechanism to explain
   explosive phenomena in regions where field lines transit from
   dipole-like to taillike shapes. However, commonly used analytical
   results were unable to recover Alfven modes in uniform plasmas and basic
   ballooning mode in inhomogeneous plasmas. We rigidly revisited previous
   work on isotropic, ideal magnetospheric plasmas and found where the
   problems occurred. This paper shows accurate expressions of the
   ballooning modes. Under the dimagnetic condition (an infinite k(y)), the
   modes have two groups depending on the relations of the three
   equilibrium parameters: plasma , pressure gradient k(p), and magnetic
   curvature k(c) (magnetic gradient k(B) is no more than a tenth of k(c)
   and thus neglected in magnetotail plasma). If the constraint is relaxed
   (a finite k(y)), the dispersion relation includes the following: (1) the
   fast compressional Alfven branch; (2) two groups of ballooning
   instabilities: Group 1 appears when k(p) is independent of , and Group 2
   emerges when k(c) is independent of ; and (3) in Group 1, a critical
   exists above which the wave mode becomes unstable, while the
   perpendicular wave number (k) affects the instability by modulating the
   critical values; by contrast, in Group 2, there is no critical , and the
   wave keeps its original stable or unstable mode, while k has a critical
   value above which the wave mode becomes unstable.}},

   especially the critical heat flux (CHF). The effect of wettability of
   the surface on flow boiling heat transfer was also studied. A remarkable
   increase in the critical heat flux was observed on CNT-coated surface

Abstract = {{Biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays were conducted on byproducts
   from dry-grind wheat-based ethanol plants amended with feedlot manure at

   byproduct:feedlot manure in bench-scale batch reactors. The addition of
   manure increased both the rate and consistency of methane production in

   and cattle manure at 1:1 and 2:1 stillage:manure produced 125\% and
   119\% expected methane based on the biomethane potential of each
   substrate digested individually. Bacterial community analysis using
   universal target amplification and pyrosequencing indicated there was a
   numerically dominant core of 42 bacteria that was universally present in

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A solar membrane liquid desiccant air conditioning (S-M-LDAC) system is
   proposed and investigated in this study. Liquid-to-air membrane energy
   exchangers (LAMEEs) are used for humid air dehumidification and dilute
   desiccant solution regeneration in the S-M-LDAC system. This eliminates
   the problem of desiccant droplets carry over in supply and exhaust air
   streams, which limits the wide use of conventional direct-contact liquid
   desiccant air conditioning systems in commercial/residential
   applications. Eight systems configurations, which mainly differ in the
   heating and air systems, are simulated using the TRNSYS building energy
   simulation software. Four heating systems are investigated as follows:
   (i) natural gas boiler, (ii) electrical heat pump, (iii) solar thermal
   system (STS) with natural gas boiler backup, and (iv) STS with
   electrical heat pump backup. Two air systems are studied one with and
   one without an energy recovery ventilator. Parametric studies are
   performed to study the influences of the collector area and storage
   volume of hot water tank relative to collector area on the annual solar
   fraction, annual collector efficiency and life cycle cost. The size of
   the STS is optimized to give the lowest life cycle cost, and then the
   economic and environmental performances are evaluated for the systems
   studied by calculating the initial cost, annual operating cost, life
   cycle cost, payback period and annual CO2 emissions. Results show that
   using a STS to cover the thermal energy required to regenerate the
   dilute desiccant solution significantly improves the economic and
   environmental performances of the systems studied, with more significant
   reductions when a natural gas boiler is used as the backup heating
   system and there is no energy recovery ventilator. (c) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new architecture is proposed to reduce the area cost
   and power consumption of the decimal fixed-point multiplier. In the
   proposed sequential architecture, the partial product generation and
   selection cycles are reduced to one. Moreover, the elaborately selected
   easy multiples reduce the hardware requirement of the partial products
   selector. Subsequently, two partial products are accumulated with the
   iteration result in a redundant decimal format by a multi-operand
   redundant adder. The lower-significant half digits of the final product
   are iteratively converted in every cycle. On the other hand, the
   higher-significant half digits are converted by a carry-propagation
   adder in two extra cycles. After all, the area of the whole architecture
   is reduced significantly by not only the simpler partial product
   generation and accumulation architecture, but also the less registers.
   The synthesized result shows that the proposed sequential multiplier has
   a lower area cost and reasonable computation latency.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, alkalinized MWCNT supported MoS2 catalysts have been
   doubly-promoted with Co and Rh. Catalysts were prepared by the
   conventional co-impregnation method and stabilized under argon
   atmosphere. Characterization of the oxidic samples by BET revealed that
   the mesoporosity of the pristine MWCNT support was not compromised after
   loading a combined total of 30 wt\% metals (9 wt\% K, 4.5 wt\% Co, 1.5
   wt\% Rh, and 15 wt\% Mo) on the support; however, a significant decrease
   in specific surface area was observed. Broad angle XRD analysis
   confirmed the homogenous dispersion of catalyst metals on the support.
   Two catalyst grain sizes were first investigated to elucidate the effect
   of particle size: a finely ground powder (88 mu m) and a pelletized form
   (1,780 mu m). Despite the total alcohol yield of 0.261 g/(g(cat) h)
   observed by conducting higher alcohol synthesis reaction at T = 330 A
   degrees C, P = 8.3 MPa, H-2/CO = 1.25, and GHSV = 3.6 m (STP) (3)
   /(kg(cat) h) for the fine powdered sample, the relatively higher
   pressure drop could be minimized by using the pelletized form of the
   catalyst. Finally, a systematic study of variety of selected binders was
   conducted to gain insight of catalyst's applicability for industrial
   purposes. Three selected binders namely: bentonite clay, coal tar, and
   humic acid were thus investigated; taking into consideration significant
   factors such as melting point and binder requirement per catalyst
   support. The CO conversions evaluated for the two binder-free catalysts
   (88 and 1,700 mu m) showed that the catalyst with fine particle sizes
   (88 mu m) performed better than that in the pelletized form
   (binder-free, 1,700 mu m); yielding a maximum ethanol selectivity of
   38.5 \% at steady-state reaction conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Improvement in the functionality of carbon nanohorns (CNHs), a novel
   carbon nanomaterial, for hydrotreating applications is investigated in
   the present work. The current work was carried out by using pristine
   CNHs synthesized by the submerged arc in liquid nitrogen and their
   corresponding physicochemical properties were investigated. The surface
   area, pore diameter and pore volume of the pristine CNHs are 129 m(2)/g,
   23.1 nm, and 0.64 cm(3)/g respectively. Functionalizing the CNHs with 30
   wt\% HNO3 under reflux for 15 min to 4 h at 110 A degrees C modified the
   physical and chemical properties. 30 min functionalization duration was
   found to be the best and a co-impregnation method was used to load Ni
   (2.5 wt\%) and Mo (13 wt\%) onto the support. Techniques used to
   thoroughly characterize the properties of pristine CNHs, functionalized
   CNHs and NiMo/CNHs catalyst include: Brauner-Emmett-Teller (BET),
   Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Raman Spectroscopy. Type II
   isotherm and mesoporous pore diameter was observed for CNHs in it's
   pristine, functionalized or catalyst form. An increase in surface area
   of over 500 m(2)/g was also attained under optimum functionalized
   conditions. The pore volume of acid treated CNH samples for
   hydrotreating increased by similar to 10 \% as compared to the pore
   volume of the pristine CNHs. FTIR results revealed the presence of
   carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups on the functionalized CNHs and I (D)/I
   (G) ratios from Raman spectroscopy was used to assess the increase in
   defects (nanowindow) on functionalized CNHs. The enhanced properties of
   functionalized and catalyst-supported CNHs offers prospect for
   hydrotreating gas oils.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic properties of beta-Si3N4 and beta-sialons (beta-Si6-z Al
   (z) O (z) N8-z ) solid solutions were characterized using a combination
   of X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy
   (XAS), and density functional theory (DFT). The electronic structure
   measurements reveal a single bonding environment for both the Si and Al
   atoms, which corresponds to a specific nonrandom structural arrangement
   of the Al-O solute atoms into nanotube-like clusters or channels,
   running parallel to the c-axis of the beta-Si3N4 host structure.
   Compared to an arrangement of alternating Si-N and Al-O slabs
   ({''}Dupree model{''}), lower total energy and overall better agreement
   to the experimentally observed electronic features confirm this ``Al-O
   nanotube{''} model for beta-sialon originally proposed by Okatov to be
   closer to the true chemical topology of the beta-Si6-z Al (z) O (z) N8-z
   solid solution series. The beta-sialons are shown to be wide band gap
   semiconductors with the band gap reduction arising from the O p-states
   moving toward the Fermi level. This band gap reduction provides the
   ability for direct band gap transitions, which is very important for
   practical applications. In contrast to the previous observations, both
   measurement and theory indicate a linear dependence of band gap energy
   with composition z. The experimental (theoretical) electronic band gaps
   of beta-Si6-z Al (z) O (z) N8-z with z = 0.0, 2.0, and 4.0 as determined
   by XAS/XES (DFT) are 7.2 +/- A 0.2 (5.88), 6.2 +/- A 0.2 (3.45), and 5.0
   +/- A 0.2 (2.39) eV, respectively. The considerable discrepancy between
   experimental and theoretical values is attributable to the shortcomings
   of DFT, which often underestimates the electronic band gap energy.}},

   the spectral densities, we perform QCD sum rule analysis and extract the
   masses of these open-flavor tetraquark states. Our results indicate that
   the masses of both the scalar and axial vector tetraquark states are
   about 7.1-7.2 GeV for the bc (q) over bar(q) over bar system and 7.2-7.3
   GeV for the bc (s) over bar(s) over bar system. For the qc (q) over
   bar(b) over bar tetraquark states with J(P) = 0(+) and 1(+), their
   masses are extracted to be around 7.1 GeV. The masses for the scalar and
   axial vector sc (s) over bar(b) over bar states are 7.1 and 6.9-7.1 GeV,
   respectively. The tetraquark states qc (q) over bar(b) over bar and sc
   (s) over bar(b) over bar lie below the thresholds of (DB({*}))-B-({*})
   and (DsBs({*}))-B-({*}) respectively, but they can decay into B-c plus a
   light meson. However, the tetraquark states bc (q) over bar(q) over bar
   and bc (s) over bar(s) over bar lie below the D-({*})(B) over bar
   (({*})) and D-s(({*}))(B) over bar (({*}))(s) thresholds, suggesting

Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Pressure-induced metallization and potential superconductivity of BeH2
   has been a topic of interest. In the present study, we extensively
   explored the crystal structures of BeH2 in a wide pressure range of
   0-300 GPa using an unbiased structure searching method coupled with
   first-principles density functional calculations. A series of
   pressure-induced structural transformations are predicted for BeH2, as
   Ibam (alpha phase) -> P-3m1 (phase II) -> R-3m (phase III) -> Cmcm
   (phase IV). Calculated pressures of phase transition are 25, 140, and
   202 GPa, respectively. The phase II is isostructural to the well-known
   1T structure of transition metal dichalcogenides, which is composed of
   covalent bonded BeH2 slabs stacked along the perpendicular direction by
   van der Waals forces. The phase III is constructed by the same BeH2
   slabs, but differs from the phase II in the stacking sequence. The alpha
   phase, phase II, and phase III all have insulating electronic states
   while their band gaps decrease as pressure increases. We predicted that
   BeH2 reaches a metallic state by a III -> IV phase transition, instead
   of a direct band gap closure in phase III. The phase IV has a
   three-dimensional extended Be-H network formed by edge-sharing BeH8
   polyhedrons with delocalized electrons. Electron-phonon coupling
   calculations implemented using linear response theory on the metallic
   BeH2 predict a large electron-phonon coupling parameter of 0.63, leading
   to an estimation of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of
   similar to 38 K at 250 GPa. (c) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Improving protein function prediction using domain and protein complexes
   in PPI networks}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Characterization of unknown proteins through computational
   approaches is one of the most challenging problems in silico biology,
   which has attracted world-wide interests and great efforts. There have
   been some computational methods proposed to address this problem, which
   are either based on homology mapping or in the context of protein
   interaction networks.
   Results: In this paper, two algorithms are proposed by integrating the
   protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, proteins' domain information
   and protein complexes. The one is domain combination similarity (DCS),
   which combines the domain compositions of both proteins and their
   neighbors. The other is domain combination similarity in context of
   protein complexes (DSCP), which extends the protein functional
   similarity definition of DCS by combining the domain compositions of
   both proteins and the complexes including them. The new algorithms are
   tested on networks of the model species of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to
   predict functions of unknown proteins using cross validations. Comparing
   with other several existing algorithms, the results have demonstrated
   the effectiveness of our proposed methods in protein function
   prediction. Furthermore, the algorithm DSCP using experimental
   determined complex data is robust when a large percentage of the
   proteins in the network is unknown, and it outperforms DCS and other
   several existing algorithms.
   Conclusions: The accuracy of predicting protein function can be improved
   by integrating the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, proteins'
   domain information and protein complexes.}},

Abstract = {{Glucose-responsive systems are significant for self-regulated insulin
   delivery. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of
   genipin-crosslinked concanavalin A/GEA-chitosan microgels as a
   glucose-responsive insulin delivery system. A chitosan derivative
   (GEA-chitosan) was designed in this study as the polymer ligand of
   concanavalin A (Con A), which not only exhibits a strong affinity to Con
   A, but also could be directly crosslinked with Con A by genipin, thus
   avoiding the modification of Con A during an immobilization process.
   Glucose responsive microgels were fabricated by the reversed-phase
   emulsion crosslinking method. The in vitro release of insulin indicated
   that the insulin release was influenced by glucose concentrations, and a
   desired pulsatile release behavior was detected in response to step-wise
   glucose challenges for more than eight cycles. The release data were
   fitted well to an exponential model, without any significant influence
   of the surface effect. The released insulin was proved to remain active
   without destruction of the tertiary structure. The analysis of L929
   cells viability suggested that these microgels possessed no in vitro
   cytotoxicity. The obtained genipin crosslinked Con A/GEA-chitosan
   microgels might be a potential candidate for self-regulated insulin
   delivery. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Biodegradation of a surrogate naphthenic acid under denitrifying
   conditions}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{11-24}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Extraction of bitumen from the shallow oil sands generates extremely
   large volumes of waters contaminated by naphthenic acid which pose
   severe environmental and ecological risks. Aerobic biodegradation of NA
   in properly designed bioreactors has been investigated in our earlier
   works. In the present work, anoxic biodegradation of
   trans-4-methy1-1-cyclohexane carboxylic acid (trans-4MCHCA) coupled to
   denitrification was investigated as a potential ex situ approach for the
   treatment of oil sand process waters in bioreactors whereby excessive
   aeration cost could be eliminated, or as an in situ alternative for the
   treatment of these waters in anoxic stabilization ponds amended with
   nitrate. Using batch and continuous reactors (CSTR and biofilm), effects
   of NA concentration (100-750 mg NA loading rate (up to 2607.9 mg L-1
   h(-1)) and temperature (10-35 degrees C) on biodegradation and
   denitrification processes were evaluated. In the batch system
   biodegradation of trans-4MCHCA coupled to denitrification occurred even
   at the highest concentration of 750 mg L-1. Consistent with the patterns
   reported for aerobic biodegradation, increase in initial concentration
   of NA led to higher biodegradation and denitrification rates and the
   optimum temperature was determined as 23-24 degrees C. In the CSTR, NA
   removal and nitrate reduction rates passed through a maximum due to
   increases in NA loading rate. NA loading rate of 157.8 mg L-1 h(-1) at
   which maximum anoxic NA and nitrate removal rates (105.3 mg L-1 h(-1)
   and 144.5 mg L-1 h(-1), respectively) occurred was much higher than
   those reported for the aerobic alternative (NA loading and removal
   rates: 14.2 and 9.6 mg L-1 h(-1), respectively). In the anoxic biofilm
   reactor removal rates of NA and nitrate were dependent on NA loading
   rate in a linear fashion for the entire range of applied loading rates.
   The highest loading and removal rates for NA were 2607.9 and 2028.1
   mgL(-1) h(-1), respectively which were at least twofold higher than the
   values reported for the aerobic biofilm reactor. The highest nitrate
   removal rate coincided with maximum removal rate of NA and was 3164.7 mg
   L-1 h(-1) (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cobalt and manganese ions are implanted into SiO2 over a wide range of
   concentrations. For low concentrations, the Co atoms occupy interstitial
   locations, coordinated with oxygen, while metallic Co clusters form at
   higher implantation concentrations. For all concentrations studied here,
   Mn ions remain in interstitial locations and do not cluster. Using
   resonant x-ray emission spectroscopy and Anderson impurity model
   calculations, we determine the strength of the covalent interaction
   between the interstitial ions and the SiO2 valence band, finding it
   comparable to Mn and Co monoxides. Further, we find an increasing
   reduction in the SiO2 electronic band gap for increasing implantation
   concentration, due primarily to the introduction of Mn- and Co-derived
   conduction band states. We also observe a strong increase in a band of
   x-ray stimulated luminescence at 2.75 eV after implantation, attributed
   to oxygen deficient centers formed during implantation. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{By studying Fe-doped ZnO pellets and thin films with various X-ray
   spectroscopic techniques, and complementing this with density functional
   theory calculations, we find that Fe-doping in bulk ZnO induces
   isovalent (and isostructural) cation substitution (Fe2+ -> Zn2+). In
   contrast to this, Fe-doping near the surface produces both isovalent and
   heterovalent substitution (Fe3+ -> Zn2+). The calculations performed
   herein suggest that the most likely defect structure is the single or
   double substitution of Zn with Fe, although, if additional oxygen is
   available, then Fe substitution with interstitial oxygen is even more
   energetically favorable. Furthermore, it is found that ferromagnetic
   states are energetically unfavorable, and ferromagnetic ordering is
   likely to be realized only through the formation of a secondary phase
   (i.e., ZnFe2O4), or codoping with Cu.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:To determine the in vivo precision of MRI-based measures of
   bone and muscle traits at the hip. Methods:Left proximal femoral neck
   and shaft of 14 participants (5M:9F; age:21-68) were scanned 3 times
   using a 1.5T MRI. Commercial and custom image processing methods were
   used to derive bone geometry and strength traits at the proximal femoral
   neck and shaft along with muscle area of various muscle groups at the
   shaft site. For precision, root mean square coefficients of variation
   (CV\%(rms)) and standard deviations (SDrms) were calculated. Results:At
   the femoral neck, CV\%(rms) for area-based bone measures ranged between
   1.7-5.0\%; CV\%(rms) for cortical thickness varied from 4.7 to 5.6\%;
   and CV\%(rms) for bending, torsional and buckling-based strength indices
   ranged between 4.6-7.1\%. At the femoral shaft, CV\%(rms) for bone area
   ranged between 1.2-3.0\%; CV\%(rms) for cortical thickness varied from
   1.7 to 2.0\%; and CV\%(rms) for bending and buckling-based strength
   indices ranged between 1.4-3.1\%. For muscle area, CV\%(rms) ranged
   between 1.3-4.5\%. Conclusions:MRI-based measures of bone and muscle
   traits at the proximal femoral neck and shaft demonstrated in vivo
   precision errors <7.1\%. MRI is a promising 3D technique for monitoring
   changes in bone and muscle at the clinically important hip.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:To determine the effect of a novel movement strategy
   incorporated within a soccer warm-up on biomechanical risk factors for
   anterior cruciate ligament injury during 3 sport-specific movement
   tasks.Design:Single-blind, randomized controlled clinical
   trial.Setting:Laboratory setting.Participants:Twenty top-tier female
   teenage soccer players.Interventions:Subjects were randomized to the
   Core Position and Control movement strategy (Core-PAC) warm-up or
   standard warm-up, which took place before their regular soccer practice
   over a 6-week period. The Core-PAC focuses on getting the centre of mass
   closer to the plant foot or base of support.Main Outcome Measures:Peak
   knee flexion angle and abduction moments during a side-hop (SH),
   side-cut, and unanticipated side-cut task after the 6 weeks with
   (intervention group only) and without a reminder to use the Core-PAC
   strategy.Results:The Core-PAC group increased peak flexion angles during
   the SH task {[}mean difference = 6.2 degrees; 95\% confidence interval
   (CI), 1.9-10.5 degrees; effect size = 1.01; P = 0.034] after the 6-week
   warm-up program without a reminder. In addition, the Core-PAC group
   demonstrated increased knee flexion angles for the side-cut (mean
   difference = 8.5 degrees; 95\% CI, 4.8-12.2 degrees; ES = 2.02; P =
   0.001) and SH (mean difference = 10.0 degrees; 95\% CI, 5.7-14.3
   degrees; ES = 1.66; P = 0.001) task after a reminder. No changes in
   abduction moments were found.Conclusions:The results of this study
   suggest that the Core-PAC may be one method of modifying high-risk
   soccer-specific movements and can be implemented within a practical,
   team-based soccer warm-up. The results should be interpreted with
   caution because of the small sample size.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of fermentation redox potential control (no control, -100 mV and
   -150 mV) on the improvement of ethanol productivity during
   very-high-gravity (VHG) fermentation from sweet sorghum juice (300 g/l
   of total sugar) were investigated. Results showed that redox potential
   controlled at -150 my gave the highest ethanol production efficiencies
   (ethanol concentration or P value, 134.35 +/- 1.67 g ethanol 1/l and
   ethanol productivity or Q. value, 2.80 +/- 0.03 g ethanol 1/l h) at the
   fermentation time of 48 h. Under the same condition without the redox
   potential control, the P and Q(p) values were 115.34 +/- 2.01 g/l and
   2.14 +/- 0.05 g/l h, respectively at the fermentation time of 54 h. To
   complete sugar utilization under redox potential controlled at -150 mV,
   16 mM urea was supplemented into the VHG medium. Results showed that the
   P and Q(p), values were 140.23 +/- 1.88 g/l and 2.92 +/- 0.01 g/l h,
   respectively corresponding to sugar utilization of 96\%. When the
   initial total sugar in the juice was reduced to 250 g/l, no urea
   addition was required in order to complete sugar utilization, and the P
   and Q(p) values were 121.54 +/- 2.23 g/l and 3.38 +/- 0.04 g/l h,
   respectively at the fermentation time of 36 h. These results clearly
   indicated that redox potential control coupling with supplementation of
   assimilable nitrogen levels significantly improved the ethanol
   production efficiency from the sweet sorghum juice under the VHG

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{345-360}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the design of a low power and hardware
   efficient image compressor integrated circuit for wireless capsule
   endoscopy application. The proposed compression algorithm supports
   dual-band imaging, that is, works on both white-band imaging (WBI) and
   narrow-band imaging (NBI). The scheme uses a novel color-space and
   simple predictive coding for optimized performance. Based on the nature
   of the narrow- and white-band endoscopic images and video sequences,
   several sub-sampling schemes are introduced. The proposed dual-band
   compressor is designed in such as way that it can easily be interfaced
   with any commercial low power image sensor that outputs RGB image pixels
   in a raster scan fashion, eliminating the need of large buffer memory
   and temporary storage. Both NB! and WBI reconstructed images have been
   verified by medical doctors for acceptability. Compared to other designs
   targeted to video capsule endoscopy, the proposed algorithm performs
   strongly with a compression ratio of 80.4\% (for WBI) and 79.2\% (for
   NBI), and a high reconstruction peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (over 43.7 dB
   for both bands). The results of the fabricated chip are also presented.

Abstract = {{Cellular processes are typically carried out by protein complexes and

   attempt to reveal principles of cellular organizations and functions. In
   this article, we review computational algorithms for identifying protein

   (PPI) networks. We first describe issues and pitfalls when interpreting
   PPI networks. Then based on types of data used and main ideas involved,
   we briefly describe protein complex and/or functional module
   identification algorithms in four categories: (i) those based on
   topological structures of unweighted PPI networks; (ii) those based on
   characters of weighted PPI networks; (iii) those based on multiple data
   integrations; and (iv) those based on dynamic PPI networks. The PPI
   networks are modelled increasingly precise when integrating more types
   of data, and the study of protein complexes would benefit by shifting

Abstract = {{Twenty-five lap splice specimens were reinforced with plain round or

   their equivalent round diameter. Top cast factors of 0.3 and 0.6 for
   round and square bars, respectively, reasonably capture the reductions
   in bond resistance. Maximum load predictions based on the CEB-FIP draft
   Model Code 2010 provisions for bond are overly conservative for all
   combinations of bar shape and casting position, whereas CEB-FIP Model
   Code 1990 provisions for bond reasonably and conservatively capture the

Abstract = {{Biodiesel is gaining acceptance in the market as fuel and lubricant. It
   is expected that biodiesel industries will rapidly grow worldwide in the
   coming years and information on biodiesel feedstock, production, and
   characteristics will be crucial than ever especially for those using
   vegetable oils as feedstock as these are currently the major sources for
   making biodiesel. In the present paper, a comprehensive review is
   reported on feedstock, production technologies, and characteristics of
   biodiesel. More specifically, selected available vegetable oils are
   explored as feedstock for biodiesel production. Production technologies
   including latest catalyst developments are discussed. Finally, biodiesel
   characteristics and parameters influencing the corresponding properties
   are revealed. Since this paper covers a wide range in biodiesel area, it
   serves as a general public education medium as well as a research
   reference for biodiesel production from vegetable oils. (C) 2013

Journal = {{BIOENERGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{174-191}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Lignocellulosic feedstocks are utilized for the production of fuel
   ethanol and butanol through dilute acid/enzymatic hydrolysis and
   fermentation. Hydrolysis residue, a major by-product of biomass
   hydrolysis, is rich in recalcitrant carbon as majority of cellulosic and
   hemicellulosic components are released during pretreatment. With the
   intention of their effective utilization, hydrolysis residues from
   forestry (pinewood), energy crop system (timothy grass), and agriculture
   (wheat straw) were pyrolysed in a fixed-bed reactor at 600 A degrees C
   with slow heating rate of 5 A degrees C/min for 4 h. In order to
   understand the product (biochar, bio-oil, and gases) properties and
   advocate their energy and environmental values, chemical
   characterizations such as carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur analysis,
   inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, pH, electrical
   conductivity, scanning electron microscopy, porosity analysis,
   thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were employed. The
   yield of biochar, bio-oil and gases was 38.9-41.7, 18.6-22.3, and
   24.9-28.8 wt\%, respectively. The high pH and electrical conductivity of
   biochars with substantial amounts of Na, Mg, K, and Ca indicated their
   alkaline and saline nature, which would necessitate proper agronomical
   soil applications. Variable intensities of C-C, C-H, C-O, O-H, and C-N
   functional groups were detected in the FTIR spectra of residues,
   biochars, and bio-oils. Raman spectroscopy showed the development of
   graphite (1,580-1,610 cm(-1)) and defect (1,325-1,380 cm(-1)) carbon
   structures in biochars. H-1 NMR of bio-oils indicated aromatics,
   olefinics, and aliphatics, whereas C-13 NMR indicated carbonyls,
   aromatics, carbohydrates, alkyls, methoxy, and hydroxy carbon. GC
   studies of pyrolysis gases identified chiefly H-2 and CO with traces of
   CH4, CO2, and C-2+ components.}},

Abstract = {{With more dynamic information available, researchers' attention has
   recently shifted from static properties to dynamic properties of
   protein-protein interaction networks. To compensate the limited ability
   of technologies of detecting dynamic protein-protein interactions,
   dynamic protein interaction networks (DPINs) can be constructed by
   involving proteomic, genomic, and transcriptome analyses. Two groups of
   DPIN construction methods are classified based on the different focuses
   on dynamic information extracted from gene expression data. The dynamics
   of one kind of DPINs is reflected by the changes in protein presence
   varying with time, while that of the other kind of DPINs is reflected by
   the differences of coexpression under different conditions. In this
   review, the applications on DPINs will be discussed, including protein
   complexes/functional modules and network organization analysis,
   biomarkers detection in the progression or prognosis of the disease, and
   network medicine. We also point out the challenges in DPINs construction
   and future directions in the research of DPINs at the end of this

Abstract = {{In this study, a membrane liquid desiccant air conditioning (M-LDAC)
   system is modeled using the TRN-SYS building energy simulation software.
   Liquid-to-air membrane energy exchangers (LAMEEs) are used as a
   dehumidifier and regenerator in the proposed M-LDAC system to eliminate
   the carryover of desiccant droplets in supply and exhaust air streams,
   which may occur when direct-contact conditioners are used. A sensitivity
   study on the sensible, latent and total effectivenesses of the LAMEEs is
   performed under 36 operating and design conditions. The technical,
   environmental and economic performances of the proposed M-LDAC system
   are evaluated, and compared to those of a conventional air conditioning
   (CAC) system. The influences of installing an energy recovery ventilator
   (ERV) under balanced and unbalanced airflow rates conditions are
   investigated. Results show that the annual primary energy consumption
   and the life cycle cost (LCC) of the proposed M-LDAC system are 19\% and
   12\% lower than that of the CAC system, and they reach 32\% and 21\%
   when an ERV, which operates under balanced airflow rates, is installed
   in the M-LDAC system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Computed tomography-based depth-specific image processing is able to
   precisely identify regional differences between healthy patellae and
   patellae with osteoarthritis.
   This study aims to assess the precision errors and potential differences
   in regional, depth-specific subchondral bone mineral density (BMD) in
   normal and osteoarthritic (OA) human patellae in vivo using CT-based
   density analyses.
   Fourteen participants (2 men and 12 women; mean age, 51.4; SD, 11.8
   years) were scanned using clinical quantitative CT (QCT) three times
   over 2 days. Participants were categorized as either normal (n = 7) or
   exhibiting radiographic OA (n = 7). Average subchondral BMD was assessed
   at three depths relative to the subchondral surface. Regional BMD
   analysis included: total lateral facet BMD, total medial facet BMD, and
   superior/middle/inferior BMD of lateral and medial facets at normalized
   depths of 0-2.5, 2.5-5, and 5-7.5 mm from the subchondral surface. We
   assessed precision using root mean square coefficients of variation
   (CV\%). We evaluated differences between OA and normal BMD by (1)
   calculating percentage differences between the groups (in relation to
   normal BMD) (2) relating percentage differences to respective CV\%
   errors and (3) determining effect sizes using Cohen's d.
   Root mean square CV\% precision errors ranged from 1.1 to 5.9 \%.
   Percentage differences between OA and normal BMD varied from -1.6 to
   -30.1 \% (BMD lower in OA patellae). In relation to precision errors,
   percentage differences were, on average, 5.5x greater than CV\% errors.
   Cohen's d effect sizes ranged from -1.7 to -0.1. Largest differences
   were noted at depths of 2.5-5 and 5-7.5 mm from the subchondral surface.
   Patellar subchondral BMD measures were precise (average CV\%, a parts
   per thousand currency sign3 \%). This region- and depth-specific
   CT-based imaging tool characterized regional standardized BMD
   differences between normal and OA patellae in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, semi permeable membranes that transfer heat and
   water vapor have been investigated and applied in air-to-air or
   liquid-to-air energy exchangers. The water vapor diffusion resistance
   and modulus of elasticity are two of the most important properties of
   membranes. These properties play significant roles on the design and
   performance of the membrane based energy exchangers. In this study,
   measurement test methods for membrane properties are presented and
   important factors impacting the test results are evaluated using the
   test data. It is found that operating conditions and crystals or
   deposits in membranes influence the vapor diffusion resistances. The
   elastic modulus can be determined from the elastic deflection of a
   simply supported membrane subject to a normal pressure difference.
   Deflections of membranes are known to cause mai-distribution of flows in
   energy exchangers and this degrades their performance. Some effective
   methods to reduce deflections of membranes are presented. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The shape of the Ba 4d-4f giant dipole resonance is studied for Ba atoms
   embedded inside complex Si networks covering structures consisting of Si
   nanocages and nanotubes, i.e. the clathrate Ba8Si46, the complex
   compound BaSi6, and the semiconducting BaSi2. Here, non-resonant x-ray
   Raman scattering is used to investigate confinement effects on the shape
   of the giant resonance in the vicinity of the Ba N-IV, V-edge. The
   distinct momentum transfer dependence of the spectra is analyzed and
   discussed. The measurements are compared to calculations of the giant
   resonance within time-dependent local density approximation in the
   dipole limit. No modulation of the giant resonance's shape for Ba atoms
   confined in different local environments was observed, in contrast to
   the calculations. The absence of such shape modulation for complex Ba/Si
   compounds is discussed providing important implications for further
   studies of giant resonance phenomena utilizing both theory and
   experiment.}},

Title = {{Measuring the dead component of mixed grassland with Landsat imagery}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{33-43}},
Month = {{FEB 25}},
Abstract = {{Detecting non-photosynthetic materials challenges multispectral remote
   sensing of vegetation. Dead component of grasslands, including litter
   and standing dead material as the accumulated phytomass of grassland
   productivity from previous years, is a primary connection in nutrient
   cycles in grasslands, and also conserves soil moisture and redistributes
   the grassland surface temperature. However, unlike green vegetation, it
   is hard to estimate the dead component with remote sensing approaches
   because the spectral signal of dead materials is similar to that of bare
   soil or soil crust (moss and lichen), with the only difference in the
   shortwave infrared region near 2000 nm. In the literature, the Cellulose
   Absorption Index (CAI), an index based on hyperspectral imagery, is the
   most popular index for assessing dead cover or dead biomass. However,
   hyperspectral imagery is still not available for most grasslands
   worldwide. Therefore, a method to assess dead component using
   multispectral band imagery (e.g. Landsat imagery in this study) is
   needed. Grasslands National Park (GNP) in the southern part of
   Saskatchewan, Canada, has a large amount of accumulated dead vegetation
   because of long term conservation actions, which makes it a good study
   area for this project. This study aims to explore the relation between
   NDVI and dead cover, to investigate how different amounts of dead
   material change the relation of total biomass and NDVI, and also to test
   the potential to estimate dead cover using multispectral images. The
   results show that NDVI and dead cover have positive relationship when
   dead cover is less than 20\%, no correlation when dead cover is between
   20 and 80\%, and significant negative relation when dead cover is more
   than 80\%; further, the relation of total biomass and NDVI also changes
   with the same thresholds. The results also indicate that the dead
   component can be estimated with multispectral images using Normalized
   Burn Ratio (NBR) or Normalized Difference water index (NDWI), but the
   relationships are highly influenced by bare soil and soil crust. (C)

Title = {{Optically erasable samarium-doped fluorophosphate glasses for high-dose
   measurements in microbeam radiation therapy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Previous work has demonstrated that fluorophosphate (FP) glasses doped
   with trivalent samarium (Sm3+) can be used as a dosimetric detector in
   microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) to measure high radiation doses and
   large dose variations with a resolution in the micrometer range. The
   present work addresses the use of intense optical radiation at 405nm to
   erase the recorded dose information in Sm3+-doped FP glass plates and
   examines the underlying physics. We have evaluated both the conversion
   and optical erasure of Sm3+-doped FP glasses using synchrotron-generated
   high-dose x-rays at the Canadian Light Source. The Sm-ion valency
   conversion is accompanied by the appearance of x-ray induced optical
   absorbance due to the trapping of holes and electrons into
   phosphorus-oxygen hole (POHC) and electron (POEC) capture centers.
   Nearly complete Sm2+ to Sm3+ reconversion (erasure) may be achieved by
   intense optical illumination. Combined analysis of absorbance and
   electron spin resonance measurements indicates that the optical
   illumination causes partial disappearance of the POHC and the appearance
   of new POEC. The suggested model for the observed phenomena is based on
   the release of electrons during the Sm2+ to Sm3+ reconversion process,
   the capture of these electrons by POHC (and hence their disappearance),
   or by PO groups, with the appearance of new and/or additional POEC.
   Optical erasure may be used as a practical means to erase the recorded
   data and permits the reuse of these Sm-doped FP glasses in monitoring
   dose in MRT. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   Activity of SBA-15 Supported NiMo Catalyst for Hydrotreating of Heavy
   Gas Oil}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL \& ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{M-SBA-15 (M = Ti, Al, and Zr) materials with a Si/M ratio of 20 were
   synthesized using a direct synthesis method. M-SBA-15 supported NiMo
   hydrotreating catalysts with and without EDTA was prepared by an
   incipient wetness impregnation method. A EDTA/Ni molar ratio of 2 was
   used for catalysts with EDTA. The hydrotreating activities of these
   catalysts were measured using Athabasca bitumen derived heavy gas oil,
   and comparison was done with the performance of NiMo/SBA-15 and
   NiMo/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts. All catalysts were thoroughly characterized
   by BET, TPR, TPD, CO-chemisorption, XRD, XANES, HRTEM, ICP-MS, and C-13
   NMR. Incorporation of Ti, Al, and Zr in SBA-15 framework results in an
   increase in the surface acidity and metal support interactions in
   otherwise neutral SBA-15 material. This increases the dispersion, and
   HDS, HDN and HDA activity of a NiMo/SBA-15 catalyst increases by 12\%,
   70\%, and 22\%, respectively, as in the case of a NiMo/Ti-SBA-15 (Cat-TO
   catalyst. EDTA addition helps in better redispersion of molybdenum
   during sulfidation/activation as indicated by HRTEM and CO chemisorption
   studies. A XANES Mo LIII-edge study for the oxide state of catalysts
   reveals that EDTA helps in the formation of a greater number of
   molybdenum in octahedral structures which are easily reducible during
   sulfidation as compared to molybdenum in tetrahedral structures. A power
   law based kinetic study indicates that addition of EDTA lowers the
   activation energy, which could be due to formation of a more favorable
   Type II NiMoS active site. The activity studies show that using EDTA
   increases the HDS, HDN, and HDA activity of a NiMo/M-SBA-15 catalyst by
   18\%, 36\%, and 22\%, respectively, as in the case of a
   NiMo/Ti-SBA-15/2EDTA (Cat-TiE) catalyst. Based on the results from
   different characterization techniques, the schematic is presented
   related to the effect of EDTA-Mo-support interactions on dispersion of
   active metals in catalysts. The results from characterization techniques
   are in parallel with catalytic activity which follows the order Cat-TiE
   > Cat-AlE > Cat-ZrE > Cat- Ti. However, the catalytic activity of
   Cat-TiE is almost comparable to that of a NiMo/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst and
   has the potential for superior hydrotreating catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{A series of hafnium salts of heteropoly tungstate (Hf(x)TPA) catalysts
   were prepared by exchanging the counter cations (hydrogen) of heteropoly
   tungstate with hafnium ions. The prepared catalysts were characterized
   by FT-IR, Laser Raman, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia,
   scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy.
   FT-IR and Raman characterization results suggested retention of the
   Keggin ion structure of heteropoly acid. Pyridine adsorbed FT-IR spectra
   of the catalysts showed that generation of Lewis acidic sites was due to
   the presence of hafnium ions in the catalyst. Activity of these
   catalysts was investigated for liquid phase benzylation of anisole with
   dibenzylether. In the partial exchanged catalyst (Hf(0.5)TPA), higher
   conversion was due to high mobility of residual protons. The catalytic
   activity of Hf(x)TPA depended on the exchangeable hafnium ions in the
   secondary structure of heteropoly tungstate that, in turn, relates to
   variation in acidity of the catalyst. Thermal stability and structural
   properties of the Hf(0.5)TPA catalyst were studied by treating it at
   different temperatures. Dibenzylether conversion and selectivity towards
   benzylated products were found to depend on the anisole to dibenzylether
   ratio, reaction temperature, and catalyst loading. (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and resonant x-ray emission
   spectroscopy measurements of pellet and thin film forms of TiO2 with
   implanted Fe ions are presented and discussed. The findings indicate
   that Fe-implantation in a TiO2 pellet sample induces heterovalent cation
   substitution (Fe2+ -> Ti4+) beneath the surface region. But in thin film
   samples, the clustering of Fe atoms is primarily detected. In addition
   to this, significant amounts of secondary phases of Fe3+ are detected on
   the surface of all doped samples due to oxygen exposure. These
   experimental findings are compared with density functional theory
   calculations of formation energies for different configurations of
   structural defects in the implanted TiO2:Fe system. According to our
   calculations, the clustering of Fe-atoms in TiO2:Fe thin films can be
   attributed to the formation of combined substitutional and interstitial
   defects. Further, the differences due to Fe doping in pellet and thin
   film samples can ultimately be attributed to different surface to volume
   ratios. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Saturation of magnetic islands at large values of the tearing mode
   stability parameter Delta ` is investigated numerically. In such
   regimes, the island dynamics exhibit a number of transient features such
   as coalescence instability, X-point collapse, and plasmoid generation.
   It is shown that while conditions for these transient instabilities to
   appear depend on the viscosity and resistivity, the final width of the
   saturated island is independent of such phenomena, as well as viscosity
   and resistivity values. It is found that the saturated island width is
   strongly influenced by global properties of the current profile and
   related to the equilibrium reconnected flux across the magnetic island.

Abstract = {{This paper considers joint linear processing at multi-antenna sources
   and one multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay station for both
   one-way and two-way relay-assisted wireless communications. The one-way
   relaying is applicable in the scenario of downlink transmission by a
   multi-antenna base station to multiple single-antenna users with the
   help of one MIMO relay. In such a scenario, the objective of join linear
   processing is to maximize the information throughput to users. The
   design problem is equivalently formulated as the maximization of the
   worst signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all users
   subject to various transmission power constraints. Such a program of
   nonconvex objective minimization under nonconvex constraints is
   transformed to a canonical d.c. (difference of convex functions/sets)
   program of d.c. function optimization under convex constraints through
   nonconvex duality with zero duality gap. An efficient iterative
   algorithm is then applied to solve this canonical d.c program. For the
   scenario of using one MIMO relay to assist two sources exchanging their
   information in two-way relying manner, the joint linear processing aims
   at either minimizing the maximum mean square error (MSE) or maximizing
   the total information throughput of the two sources. By applying
   tractable optimization for the linear minimum MSE estimator and d.c.
   programming, an iterative algorithm is developed to solve these two
   optimization problems. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the
   proposed methods substantially outperform previously-known joint
   optimization methods.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of the combined application of ferrihydrite-modified diatomite
   (FHMD) and gypsum on phosphorus control were investigated in a
   laboratory-scale artificial aquarium under anoxic and agitation
   conditions over 120 days. Daily oscillation of a metal grid to simulate
   agitating effects by wind did not yield the sediment resuspension in the
   120-day treatment aquarium (120-day aquarium) due to the gypsum
   stabilization, while significant sediment resuspension was observed in
   the control aquarium. The combined application of FHMD and gypsum did
   not affect the total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentrations in both the
   control aquarium and the 120-day aquarium. Under anoxic conditions and
   sediment resuspension conditions, a large increase in total phosphorus
   (TP) concentrations was observed in the control aquarium. However, the
   TP concentrations in the 120-day aquarium stayed relatively stable,
   within a range of 9.1-13.3 mu g/L. After the 120 days' incubation,
   translocation from mobile labile-P and organic-P to P adsorbed by FHMD
   occurred. The combined application of FHMD and gypsum effectively
   maintained TP levels within the oligotrophic range under anoxic and
   agitation conditions in the laboratory-scale artificial aquarium by
   removing phosphorus from lake water and reducing sedimentary phosphorus
   release via gypsum sediment stabilization and FHMD phosphorus
   immobilization.}},

Title = {{Contaminant transfer in run-around membrane energy exchangers}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{94-105}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The run-around membrane energy exchanger (RAMEE) is a novel
   membrane-based energy recovery system, which uses liquid desiccant to
   transfer heat and moisture between air streams. VOCs may transfer from
   the exhaust air to supply air due to (i) air leakage and (ii)
   dissolution of VOCs into liquid desiccant in the exhaust exchanger and
   subsequent evaporation into air stream in the supply exchanger.
   Experimental tests were conducted at different operating conditions
   using two RAMEE prototypes. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) was used as tracer
   gas to test air leakage, and toluene (C7H8) and formaldehyde (HCHO) were
   used to test VOC transfer fraction. Results show that the exhaust air
   transfer ratio (EATR) of SF6 was 0.0 +/- 3.6\% for both prototypes,
   which means the air leakage is negligible. The transfer of C7H8 was
   2.3-3.4 +/- 3.5\%, while the transfer of HCHO was 4.5-6.4 +/- 3.6\% in
   the prototypes. It implies that there is a negligible transfer of low
   water soluble VOCs (i.e. C7H8), but possibly a small detectable transfer
   of very water soluble VOCs (i.e. HCHO) between the exhaust and supply
   air streams in RAMEEs. Moreover, the EATR values for both prototypes
   were insensitive to changes in air flow rate, liquid desiccant flow
   rate, latent effectiveness and environmental conditions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Molecular-level understanding of soil Cu speciation and distribution
   assists in management of Cu contamination in mining sites. In this
   study, one soil sample, collected from a mining site contaminated since
   1950s, was characterized complementarily by multiple synchrotron-based
   bulk and spatially resolved techniques for the speciation and
   distribution of Cu as well as other related elements (Fe, Ca, Mn, K, Al,
   and Si). Bulk X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended
   X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy revealed that soil
   Cu was predominantly associated with Fe oxides instead of soil organic
   matter. This agreed with the closest association of Cu to Fe by
   microscopic X-ray fluorescence (U-XRF) and scanning transmission X-ray
   microscopy (STXM) nanoanalysis, along with the non-occurrence of
   photoreduction of soil Cu(II) by quick Cu L-3,L-2-edge XANES
   spectroscopy (Q-XANES) which often occurs when Cu organic complexes are
   present. Furthermore, bulk-EXAFS and STXM-coupled Fe L-3,L-2-edge
   nano-XANES analysis revealed soil Cu adsorbed primarily to Fe(III)
   oxides by inner-sphere complexation. Additionally, Cu K-edge mu-XANES,
   L-3,L-2-edge bulk-XANES, and successive Q-XANES results identified the
   presence of Cu2S rather than radiation-damage artifacts dominant in
   certain microsites of the mining soil. This study demonstrates the great
   benefits in use of multiple combined synchrotron-based techniques for
   comprehensive understanding of Cu speciation in heterogeneous soil
   matrix, which facilitates our prediction of Cu reactivity and
   environmental fate in the mining site.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen mass transfer was studied in conventional, bead mill and baffled
   roller bioreactors. Using central composite rotational design, impacts
   of size, rotation speed and working volume on the oxygen mass transfer
   were evaluated. Baffled roller bioreactor outperformed its conventional
   and bead mill counterparts, with the highest k (L) a obtained in these
   configurations being 0.58, 0.19, 0.41 min(-1), respectively.
   Performances of the bead mill and baffled roller bioreactor were only
   comparable when a high bead loading (40 \%) was applied. Regardless of
   configuration increase in rotation speed and decrease in working volume
   improved the oxygen mass transfer rate. Increase in size led to enhanced
   mass transfer and higher k (L) a in baffled roller bioreactor (0.49
   min(-1) for 2.2 L and 1.31 min(-1) for 55 L bioreactors). Finally, the
   experimentally determined k (L) a in the baffled roller bioreactors of
   different sizes fit reasonably well to an empirical correlation
   describing the k (L) a in terms of dimensionless numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Run-Around Membrane Energy Exchanger (RAMEE) is a novel heat and
   moisture recovery system that consists of two separate supply and
   exhaust exchangers coupled with an aqueous salt solution flow. The salt
   solution transfers energy (heat and moisture) in a closed loop between
   outdoor ventilation air and the exhaust air from buildings. The system
   performance is a function of the flow rate of the salt solution and
   ventilation air and the outdoor air conditions. The dependency of system
   performance on the solution flow rate and the outdoor conditions
   requires adjustment of the appropriate flow rate which gives the optimal
   system performance at any specific outdoor condition. In this paper, the
   RAMEE is simulated for a hospital building in four different climates
   using TRNSYS and MATLAB computer programs. The steady-state RAMEE can
   reduce the annual heating energy by 60\% in cold climates and annual
   cooling energy by 15-20\% in hot climates. The RAMEE has an immediate
   payback in cold climates and a 1 to 3-year payback in hot climates
   depending on the pressure drop across the exchangers. Finally, the RAMEE
   reduces greenhouse gas emission (CO2-equivalent) by 25\% and 10\% in
   cold climates and hot climates, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Water sprinkling market pigs in a stationary trailer. 1. Effects on pig
   behaviour, gastrointestinal tract temperature and trailer micro-climate}},
Journal = {{LIVESTOCK SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{113-123}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Pigs are often transported to slaughter under conditions outside their
   thermo-neutral zones, which can lead to reduced welfare and increased
   losses. Water sprinkling in barns is used to control microclimate
   resulting in pig body temperature reduction and improved welfare;
   however there is no clear evidence of these effects during transport.
   The aim of this study was to observe the effect of sprinkling pigs in
   trailers on behaviour and body temperature during transport and lairage,
   as well as to observe the effects on trailer microclimate. In each of 12
   weeks, 2 pot-belly trailers with 208 pigs each (n=4992) were transported
   from the same farm on the same day 2 h to slaughter. One trailer was
   equipped with sprinklers that ran for 5 min (similar to 125 L) before
   departure and before unloading, the other trailer served as the control.
   In each trailer, 4 compartments were outfitted with cameras, ammonia
   detectors and temperature/humidity data loggers. The gastrointestinal
   tract temperature (GTT; degrees C) of 4 randomly chosen pigs (n=384) in
   each test compartment was recorded using orally administered data
   loggers. Trailer and deck loading order were randomized. Behaviour
   during transport, unloading and lairage was recorded from video or live
   observations. Data were analysed through ANOVA with ambient temperature
   external to the trailer (AmbT) as a covariate. AmbT averaged 19.5
   degrees C +/- 3.8 degrees C (range: 13.6-25.8 degrees C). Sprinkled
   trailers showed lower (P=0.002) increases in internal compartment
   temperature from loading to unloading, smaller (P < 0.001) decreases in
   humidity and no difference in ammonia levels. At AmbT > 23 degrees C,
   there was no effect of sprinkling on behaviour on the trailer, but at
   AmbT < 23 degrees C, more pigs stood on sprinkled trailers (P < 0.05).
   Sprinkling did not affect slips or falls during unloading. In lairage,
   latency to rest was reduced as AmbT increased for all compartments (P <
   0.05); sprinkled pigs spent more time lying (P < 0.05) and had fewer
   drinking bouts than controls (P < 0.001) regardless of AmbT. GTT
   increased between loading and departure and decreased during transit for
   all pigs (P < 0.001); and sprinkling tended to further reduce GTT at
   arrival at AmbT > 24 degrees C (P=0.08). These data suggest that
   sprinkling pigs in a stationary vehicle when AmbT exceeds 23 degrees C
   has the potential to prevent increases in body temperature during short
   duration transport without detrimental effects on ammonia levels or
   behaviour during unloading. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tracking control of piezoelectric actuators (PEAs) has stimulated the
   development of various advanced control schemes that utilize the
   feedback of PEA system states for improved control performance. Among
   them, the one based on the concept of sliding mode has been shown
   promising due to its robustness to matched uncertainties, but leaving
   the required state estimation to be desired. Previous studies show that
   the PEA can be modeled as a linear dynamic system with matched
   uncertainties. On this basis, this paper presents the development of a
   novel observer based on the concept of
   proportional-integral-derivative-based (PID-based) sliding mode, in
   which the switching function is replaced by a PID regulator. The novel
   observer, referred to as the PID-based sliding mode observer (PIDSMO),
   relaxes the observer matching condition as required in the use of the
   unknown-input observers. The PIDSMO is then integrated with the
   PID-based sliding mode controller (PIDSMC) to form a novel integrated
   PID-based sliding mode observer-controller (PIDSMOC) for PEA tracking
   control. Experiments performed on a PEA showed that the PIDSMO can
   accurately estimate the PEA states and that the integrated PIDSMOC can
   achieve better tracking control performances as compared to the PIDSMC

Abstract = {{Long-term in vivo studies on animal models and advances from animal to
   human studies should rely on noninvasive monitoring methods. Synchrotron
   radiation (SR)-diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI) has shown great
   promise as a noninvasive method for visualizing native and/or engineered
   tissues and bio-microstructures with appreciable details in situ. The
   objective of this study was to investigate SR-DEI for in situ
   visualization and characterization of tissue-engineered scaffolds
   implanted in cartilage. A piglet stifle joint implanted with an
   engineered scaffold made from poly--caprolactone was imaged using SR
   computed tomography (CT)-DEI at an X-ray energy of 40keV. For
   comparison, in situ visualization was also conducted with commonly used
   SR CT-phase contrast imaging and clinical magnetic resonance imaging
   techniques. The reconstructed CT-DE images show the implanted scaffold
   with the structural properties much clearer than those in the CT-PC and
   MR images. Furthermore, CT-DEI was able to visualize microstructures
   within the cartilage as well as different soft tissues surrounding the
   joint. These microstructural details were not recognizable using other
   imaging techniques. Taken together, the results of this study suggest
   that CT-DEI can be used for noninvasive visualization and
   characterization of scaffolds in cartilage, representing an advance in
   tissue engineering to track the success of tissue scaffolds for
   cartilage repair.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term benefits of habitual physical activity during adolescence
   on adult bone structure and strength are poorly understood. We
   investigated whether physically active adolescents had greater bone
   size, density, content, and estimated bone strength in young adulthood
   when compared to their peers who were inactive during adolescence.
   Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) was used to measure
   the tibia and radius of 122 (73 females) participants (age mean +/- SD,
   29.3 +/- 2.3 years) of the Saskatchewan Pediatric Bone Mineral Accrual
   Study (PBMAS). Total bone area (ToA), cortical density (CoD), cortical
   area (CoA), cortical content (CoC), and estimated bone strength in
   torsion (SSIp) and muscle area (MuA) were measured at the diaphyses
   (66\% tibia and 65\% radius). Total density (ToD), trabecular density
   (TrD), trabecular content (TrC), and estimated bone strength in
   compression (BSIc) were measured at the distal ends (4\%). Participants
   were grouped by their adolescent physical activity (PA) levels
   (inactive, average, and active) based on mean PA Z-scores obtained from
   serial questionnaire assessments completed during adolescence. We
   compared adult bone outcomes across adolescent PA groups in each sex
   using analysis of covariance followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons
   with Bonferroni adjustments. When adjusted for adult height, MuA, and
   PA, adult males who were more physically active than their peers in
   adolescence had 13\% greater adjusted torsional bone strength (SSIp,
   p<0.05) and 10\% greater adjusted ToA (p<0.05) at the tibia diaphysis.
   Females who were more active in adolescence had 10\% larger adjusted CoA
   (p<0.05), 12\% greater adjusted CoC (p<0.05) at the tibia diaphysis, and
   3\% greater adjusted TrC (p<0.05) at the distal tibia when compared to
   their inactive peers. Benefits to tibia bone size, content, and strength
   in those who were more active during adolescence seemed to persist into
   young adulthood, with greater ToA and SSIp in males, and greater CoA,
   CoC, and TrC in females. (c) 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral

Pages = {{416-425}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this work, supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of cellulose and
   pinewood was studied at different operating conditions without and with
   catalysts. The effects of two parameters including gasification
   temperature (400, 470, and 550 degrees C) and water to biomass weight
   ratio (3:1 and 7:1) for different catalysts (Ni/CeO2/Al2O3, KOH,
   calcined dolomite and calcined olivine), were studied on SCWG of
   cellulose and pinewood. For non-catalytic runs, with an increase in
   water to biomass ratio from 3 to 7, H-2 yield of cellulose gasification
   increased by 44\%, 11\% and 22\% at 400, 470 and 550 degrees C,
   respectively. For catalytic gasification of cellulose using KOH, H-2
   yield increased by 194\% compared to that for non-catalytic run at 400
   degrees C and water to biomass ratio of 3. At the same operating
   conditions, the presence of Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 contributed to a 30.7\%
   increase in H-2 yield followed by a 28.3\% increase using dolomite
   compared to that for non-catalytic run. As a real biomass, pinewood was
   gasified in supercritical water at the optimum operating conditions (550
   degrees C and water to biomass ratio of 7) obtained from set of
   experiments performed for cellulose, using three kinds of catalysts:
   Ni/CeO2/Al2O3, dolomite and KOH. At the same operating conditions, H-2
   yield for pinewood gasification was smaller than that for cellulose
   gasification in the range of 20.0-41.4\% depending on the type of
   catalyst. The effects of catalyst on H-2 production from SCW in the
   absence of biomass were also studied. The results showed that a trace
   amount of H-2 was formed using Ni based catalyst or dolomite while small
   amount of CO2 was formed with Ni/AC. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Thermodynamic ground state of MgB6 predicted from first principles
   structure search methods}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Crystalline structures of magnesium hexaboride, MgB6, were investigated
   using unbiased structure searching methods combined with first
   principles density functional calculations. An orthorhombic Cmcm
   structure was predicted as the thermodynamic ground state of MgB6. The
   energy of the Cmcm structure is significantly lower than the theoretical
   MgB6 models previously considered based on a primitive cubic arrangement
   of boron octahedra. The Cmcm structure is stable against the
   decomposition to elemental magnesium and boron solids at atmospheric
   pressure and high pressures up to 18.3 GPa. A unique feature of the
   predicted Cmcm structure is that the boron atoms are clustered into two
   forms: localized B-6 octahedra and extended B-infinity ribbons. Within
   the boron ribbons, the electrons are delocalized and this leads to a
   metallic ground state with vanished electric dipoles. The present
   prediction is in contrast to the previous proposal that the crystalline
   MgB6 maintains a semiconducting state with permanent dipole moments.

Abstract = {{The crystal structure and charge transport properties of the prototypal
   oxobenzene-bridged 1,2,3-bisdithiazolyl radical conductor 3a are
   strongly dependent on pressure. Compression of the as-crystallized
   alpha-phase, space group Fdd2, to 3-4 GPa leads to its conversion into a
   second or beta-phase, in which F-centering is lost. The space group
   symmetry is lowered to Pbn2(1), and there is concomitant halving of the
   a and b axes. A third or gamma-phase, also space group Pbn2(1), is
   generated by further compression to 8 GPa. The changes in packing that
   accompany both phase transitions are associated with an ``ironing
   out{''} of the ruffled ribbon-like architecture of the alpha-phase, so
   that consecutive radicals along the ribbons are rendered more nearly
   coplanar. In the beta-phase the planar ribbons are propagated along the
   b-glides, while in the gamma-phase they follow the n-glides. At ambient
   pressure 3a is a Mott insulator, displaying high but activated
   conductivity, with sigma(300 K) = 6 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) and E-act = 0.16
   eV. With compression beyond 4 GPa, its conductivity is increased by 3
   orders of magnitude, and the thermal activation energy is reduced to
   zero, heralding the formation of a metallic state. High pressure
   infrared absorption and reflectivity measurements are consistent with
   closure of the Mott-Hubbard gap near 4-5 GPa. The results are discussed
   in the light of DFT calculations on the molecular and band electronic
   structure of 3a. The presence of a low-lying LUMO in 3a gives rise to
   high electron affinity which, in turn, creates an electronically much
   softer radical with a low onsite Coulomb potential U. In addition;
   considerable crystal orbital (SOMO/LUMO) mixing occurs upon
   pressurization, so that a metallic state is readily achieved at
   relatively low applied pressure.}},

Abstract = {{We elucidate the role of room-temperature-induced instantaneous
   structural distortions in the Li K-edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS)
   of crystalline LiF, Li2SO4, Li2O, Li3N, and Li2CO3 using high resolution
   X-ray Raman spectroscopy (XRS) measurements and first-principles density
   functional theory calculations within the eXcited electron and Core Hole
   approach. Based on thermodynamic sampling via ab initio molecular
   dynamics simulations, we find calculated XAS in much better agreement
   with experiment than those computed using the rigid crystal structure
   alone. We show that local instantaneous distortion of the atomic lattice
   perturbs the symmetry of the Li 1s core-excited-state electronic
   structure, broadening spectral line-shapes and, in some cases, producing
   additional spectral features. The excellent agreement with
   high-resolution XRS measurements validates the accuracy of our
   first-principles approach to simulating XAS, and provides both accurate
   benchmarks for model compounds and a predictive theoretical capability
   for identification and characterization of multi-component systems, such
   as lithium-ion batteries, under working conditions. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Solid acid catalysts are of interests for various organic reactions.
   Among the solid acids, heteropoly acids (HPA) show strong and Bronsted
   acidity. Especially, 12-tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) (H3PW12O40)
   Possesses super acidity (Bronsted acidity) and higher thermal stability
   compared to other HPAs. The major disadvantages of using this heteropoly
   acid are lower surface area (1-10 m(2)/g) and solubility in polar media.
   These problems can be avoided by supporting TPA on various carriers. In
   this work, tungsten oxide (WO3) and TPA was supported on H-Y, H-13 and
   H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. The catalysts were characterized extensively
   using BET, XRD, FTIR, Raman, XPS and NH3-TPD. Their catalytic activity
   was tested by esterification of the free fatty acid (FFA) present in the
   green seed canola (GSC) oil, and transesterification of the GSC oil,
   using a stirred tank reactor for biodiesel production. In this study,
   TPA impregnated H-Y zeolite showed higher catalytic activity for
   esterification, and TPA impregnated H-13 zeolite showed higher catalytic
   activity for the transesterification reaction compared to other
   catalysts. A 55\% TPA/Hp showed optimum catalytic activity for both
   esterification and transesterification. It yielded 99.3 wt\% ester, when
   3.3 wt\% catalyst (based on green seed canola oil) and 21.3:1 methanol
   to green seed canola oil molar ratio were used at 200 C, reaction
   pressure of 4.14 MPa and reaction time of 6.5 h. Glycerol is the major
   by-product during transesterification reaction of vegetable oils. This
   catalyst (55\% TPA/H-(3) was experimented for etherification of pure
   glycerol, and maximum conversion of glycerol (100\%) was achieved in 5 h
   at 120 C, 1 MPa, 1:5 molar ratio (glycerol:TBA), 2.5\% (w/v) catalyst
   loading. Later, these conditions were used to produce glycerol ether
   successfully from the glycerol derived after transesterification of
   green seed canola oil. A mixture of GSC derived biodiesel and glycerol
   ether was defined as biofuels. The properties of biofuels were evaluated
   and compared to those reported with ASTM standard for pure biodiesel.
   The reaction kinetics and reaction mechanism of the
   esterification-transesterification and etherification reactions were
   also analyzed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray diffraction experiments at 80 K show that when silicon is
   compressed under hydrostatic conditions the intermediate high-pressure
   phases are bypassed leading to a direct transformation to the simple
   hexagonal structure at 17 GPa. A maximum entropy analysis of the
   diffraction patterns reveals dramatic alterations in the valence
   electron distribution from tetrahedral covalent bonding to localization
   in the interstitial sites and along the one-dimensional silicon atom
   chain running along adjacent hexagonal layers. Changes in the orbital
   character of the unoccupied states are confirmed using X-ray Raman
   scattering spectroscopy and theoretical Bethe-Salpeter equation
   calculations. This is the first direct observation indicating that the
   silicon valence electrons in 3s and 3p orbitals are transferred to the
   3d orbitals at high density which proves that electrons of compressed
   elemental solids migrate from their native bonding configuration to
   interstitial regions.}},

Title = {{Preparation of CdTe thin film by electrodeposition in butyl methyl
   imidazolium bath at 80 degrees C}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{713}},
Pages = {{70-76}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{CdTe thin films have been prepared on FTO substrates by eletrochemical
   deposition in a butyl methyl imidazolium chloride bath at 80 degrees C
   potentiostatically at three different applied potentials. The
   electrodeposition process ensures the underpotential deposition of Cd on
   Te coated FTO substrate. CdTe thin film was grown at a relatively higher
   growth rate which resulted a typical thickness of 2.7 mu m for a
   deposition time of 1 h at an applied deposition potential of -1.45 V.
   The XRD pattern indicates the formation of cubic CdTe phase with
   zincblende structure. The Cd to Te ratio of the film can be nicely tuned
   in the range of 0.8-2.27 by the selection of deposition potential. The
   film deposited at a potential of perfect stoichiometry (-1.45 V) shows
   interconnected clusters with an average size in the range of 40-100 nm.
   The formation of CdTe cubic phase is also ascertained by the microdomain
   Raman analysis. Hot probe analysis indicates the P-type behavior of the
   CdTe film. The band gap energy of the CdTe film is found as 1.44 eV from
   the UV-Vis measurements. A photoelectrochemical cell with the
   configuration: CdTe (0.5 cm(2)) thin film vertical bar 0.1 M
   K2Sx(pH-9.2) vertical bar Pt (2 cm(2)) has been constructed with the
   electrochemically deposited CdTe thin film. The photocurrent measurement
   under chopped light illumination shows an onset potential of 1 V (w.r.t.
   satd. Calomel) for cathodic photocurrent. The onset potential for the
   cathodic photo current generation has been complemented by the flat band
   potential of 0.93 V (w.r.t. satd. Calomel) from the Mott Schottky
   measurement in the same electrolyte. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{82}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to evaluate the importance of aeration in free
   and immobilized cell systems in an aerated bioreactor for xylitol
   production from an oat hull hemicellulosic hydrolysate using an
   integrated process. The aeration rate (AR) or oxygen mass transfer
   coefficient (k(L)a) demonstrated a significant role in controlling cell
   (Candida guilliermondii FTI 20037) regeneration and bioconversion
   performance in free and immobilized cell systems. In the free cell
   system, an aeration rate of 1.25 vvm corresponding to k(L)a of 15.81/h
   resulted in maximum values of product yield (Y-p/s: 0.87 g/g),
   productivity (Q(p): 0.57 g/l/h), and final xylitol concentration (P-f:
   55 g/l) from the hydrolysate with a 74.5 g/l xylose concentration.
   However, in the aerated immobilized cell system, maximum and almost
   similar results (almost P-f: 54 g/l, Q(p): 0.57 g/l/h and Y-p/s: 0.84
   g/g) were obtained with aeration rates from 1.25 to 1.5 vvm using
   composites based on polypropylene (PP) and partially delignified fiber
   (PDF). Composites based on acid treated fiber (ATF) containing a high
   amount of lignin showed some inhibitory impact on xylose uptake and
   xylitol formation (P-f: 47 g/l and Q(p) <0.49 g/l/h) with the optimal
   aeration rate of 1.5 vvm in the initial cycle of the bioconversion; this
   inhibition impact could be resolved in the next consecutive cycles. The
   surface modifier polyethyleneimine (PEI) slightly enhanced cell
   retention in the immobilized form on the ATF-based cell support. This
   investigation helps fill in the knowledge gaps existing on the
   integrated processing of the lignocellulosic biomass for xylitol
   bioproduction and biorefinery industry; however, more scale-up studies
   are recommended for commercialization. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{It is well known that a TiC layer can be formed and should act as a

   reactive TiC layer adjacent to the substrate. This layer consists of
   numerous crystalline nanoparticles with grain sizes of 5-20 nm. Through
   electron nanodiffraction patterns combined with EDS and EELS analysis,
   these nanoparticles can be identified as a TiC1-xOx phase with a similar
   structure to cubic TiC. Besides, C atoms and O atoms in TiC1-xOx
   randomly occupy the vacancies of C in TiC. The thickness of this
   TiC1-xOx layer does not change significantly with increasing deposition
   time, and the diamond phase directly nucleates and grows on it. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We study the flux of small-scale magnetic helicity in simulations of
   driven statistically homogeneous magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in a
   periodic box with an imposed large-scale shear. The simulations show
   that in the regime of strong dynamo action the eddy-scale magnetic
   helicity flux has only two significant terms: advective motion driven by
   the large-scale velocity field and the Vishniac-Cho (VC) flux which
   moves helicity across the magnetic field lines. The contribution of all
   the other terms is negligible. The VC flux is highly correlated with the
   large-scale electromotive force and is responsible for large-scale
   dynamo action, while the advective term is not. The VC flux is driven by
   the anisotropy of the turbulence. We derive analytical expressions for
   it in terms of the small-scale velocity or magnetic field. These
   expressions are used to predict the existence and strength of dynamo
   action for different turbulent anisotropies and tested against the

   diazenide (CaN2), was recently synthesized by a controlled decomposition
   of calcium azide at high-pressure/high-temperature conditions (Schneider
   et al. Inorg. Chem. 2012, 51, 2366-2373). Isotypic to tetragonal calcium
   carbide, the synthesized CaN2 phase adopts a tI6 structure in which Ca2+
   cations and {[}N-2](2-) anions are arranged in a distorted rocksalt
   structure. Using an unbiased structure searching method, we investigate
   the energy landscape of CaN2 at the first principles level and suggest
   that the tI6 structure is a metastable form of CaN2. A new orthorhombic
   oP12 structure, formed by a distorted bcc lattice of Ca2+ cations
   interpenetrated by {[}N-2](2-) anions, is predicted to be the
   thermodynamic ground state of CaN2. The energy of the oP12 structure is
   considerably lower than that of the synthesized phase, by similar to 80
   meV/CaN2, while it is also lower than the energies of the candidate
   structures previously considered. The oP12 structure remains as the
   thermodynamic ground state of CaN2 at high pressures up to 2.9 GPa, at
   where it undergoes a first-order phase transition to a higher density
   oP12' structure. Above 2.9 GPa, the synthesized tI6 phase becomes the
   thermodynamic ground state of CaN2. The formation of the oP12 structure
   is predicted to be exothermic which suggests that this structure may be
   synthesized in future experiments with proper experimental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Hysteresis is a nonlinear effect that can result in the degraded
   performance of piezoelectric actuators (PEAs). To counteract the effect,
   several control methods have been developed and reported in the
   literature. One promising method for compensation is the use of a
   proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-based sliding mode control (SMC),
   in which the PEA hysteresis is treated as an unknown disturbance to the
   PEA input. If the hysteresis can be modelled or partially modelled, the
   integration of the hysteresis models into the control schemes may lead
   to further improved performance. On this philosophy, this paper presents
   the development of two modified discrete PID-based sliding mode
   controllers (PID-SMCs) for the PEAs, namely an inversion-based PID-SMC
   and a disturbance-observer (DOB)-based PID-SMC, in which the PEA
   hysteresis is predicted or partially predicted through the use of
   existing models for the PEA hysteresis. Experiments were performed to
   verify the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes. The results
   were compared to those of the nominal PID-SMC. By employing the
   inversion hysteresis and the DOB, the PEA performance was greatly
   improved.}},

Abstract = {{Underwater wireless communications are becoming increasingly relevant,
   and as such the need to better quantify the corresponding system
   performance is an important problem. One valuable metric determining the
   system performance is the channel, as characterized by the impulse
   response. To this end, this work proposes a non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
   underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) model to assess the
   channel behavior, which is based on Monte Carlo simulation and the
   Henyey-Greenstein model. Using the derived impulse response model, the
   performance of an underwater (UW) system is characterized and simulated
   for different water types and receiver field-of-view (FOV). For
   simplicity, an on-off keying (OOK) modulation scheme is used for the
   computer simulation experiments. The obtained results show that the
   proposed NLOS model provides a sufficiently accurate and realistic
   approach towards characterizing UW channels with non-line-of-sight
   conditions, which should prove useful for analyzing and developing
   effective UWOC systems.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the working condition of tubing systems used in oil and
   natural gas industries are severer than before with the increasing
   exploitation of acidic gas fields. The corrosion problems induced from
   the corrosive environment with chloride ion medium and high temperature
   have been much more concerned. The presence of chloride ion can
   accelerate the dissolution of metals. The corrosion performance is also
   sensitive to the operating temperature. Classic localized corrosions
   such as the pitting or the crevice type due to environmental temperature
   and chloride ion. The objective of this project is to investigate the
   influence of chloride ion and temperature on corrosion behavior of
   Ni-Fe-Cr base alloy 028 under sodium chloride (NaCl) solution and
   sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution by different electrochemical measurement
   techniques. Firstly, the electrochemical corrosion performance of the
   Ni-Fe-Cr alloy 028 under 1 MH2SO4 in the absence and presence of various
   chloride ion concentrations at room temperature have been investigated.
   The results of the potentiodynamic polarization measurements show that
   the alloy presents remarkable passivation characteristics at high
   potential range in H2SO4, indicated a protected film is formed in such
   medium. The increase of critical passivation current density (i(crit))
   and the decrease of primary passivation potential (E-pp) with increasing
   of chloride concentrations from 0.01 M to 2 M demonstrate that the
   chloride ion damages passivation property and reduces corrosion
   resistance of this alloy. On the other hand, the increase of passivation
   current (i(pp)) clarifies an accelerating effect of chloride ion on the
   anodic reaction. Furthermore, the corrosion behavior is closely related
   to the anodic reaction with increasing temperature. All the results will
   be greatly helpful to establish a database of this alloy for the future
   industrial application.}},

Abstract = {{A new method for real-time navigation of mobile robots in complex and
   mostly unstructured environment is presented. This novel human-inspired
   method (HIM) uses distance-based sensory data from a laser range finder
   for real-time navigation of a wheeled mobile robot in unknown and
   cluttered settings. The approach requires no prior knowledge from the
   environment and is easy to be implemented for real-time navigation of
   mobile robots. HIM endows the robot a human-like ability for reasoning
   about the situations to reach a predefined goal point while avoiding
   static and moving or unforeseen obstacles; this makes the proposed
   strategy efficient and effective. Results indicate that HIM is capable
   of creating smooth (no oscillations) paths for safely navigating the
   mobile robot, and coping with fluctuating and imprecise sensory data
   from uncertain environment. HIM specifies the best path ahead, according
   to the situation of encountered obstacles, preventing the robot to get
   trapped in deadlock and impassable conditions. This deadlock detection
   and avoidance is a significant ability of HIM. Also, this algorithm is
   designed to analyze the environment for detecting both negative and
   positive obstacles in off-road terrain. The simulation and experimental
   results of HIM is compared with a fuzzy logic based (FLB) approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a strategy to accomplish pick-and-place operations
   for a six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) robotic arm attached to a wheeled
   mobile robot. This research work is part of a bigger project in
   developing a robotic-assisted nursing to be used in medical settings.
   The significance of this project relies on the increasing demand for
   elderly and disabled skilled care assistance which nowadays has become
   insufficient. Several methods were implemented to make a 6-DOF
   manipulator capable of performing pick-and-place operations. This paper
   presents an approach for solving the inverse kinematics problem and
   planning collision-free paths. An Iterative Inverse Kinematics method
   (IIK) was introduced to find multiple configurations for the manipulator
   along a given path. The IIK method takes advantage of a specific
   geometric characteristic of the manipulator, in which several joints
   share a common plane. Ten different scenarios with different number and
   pattern of obstacles were used to verify the efficiency of a path
   planning algorithm introduced here. Other methods, also implemented in
   the current project, which describe the manipulator and its
   capabilities, are presented elsewhere {[}1]. Overall results confirmed
   the efficiency of the implemented methods for performing pick-and-place

Abstract = {{As an independent research and monitoring project, Aquistore intends to
   demonstrate that storing liquid carbon dioxide (CO2) deep underground
   (in a brine and sandstone water formation), is a safe, workable solution
   to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs). Managed by the Petroleum Technology
   Research Centre, Aquistore is built upon the learnings of the IEAGHG
   Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project, where over 22MT of
   CO2 have been stored in an oil field during EOR operations. As a global
   leader, PTRC has over a decade of experience in CO2 storage and
   monitoring work.
   Aquistore is Canada's first dedicated CO2 storage project, and is an
   integral component of SaskPower's Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture
   and Storage (CCS) Demonstration project - the world's first fully
   integrated CCS demonstration project from a coal-fired power plant. As
   an unique CCS project, Aquistore is providing buffer storage to this
   commercial CO2 capture plant and active oilfield EOR operations. In
   collaboration with SaskPower, Aquistore will be the first integrated
   project globally to demonstrate deep saline CO2 capture, transport, and
   storage on a commercial scale from a coal fired power plant. CO2 will be
   captured at unit 3 of the Boundary Dam powerstation (BD3), transported
   via underground pipeline to the Aquistore site, and injected to a depth
   of 3.4 km.
   The Winnipeg and Deadwood formations, which constitute the deepest units
   within the Williston Basin and were chosen as the target zone for CO2
   injection. These geological formations have much greater capacity for
   storing CO2 than any oil reservoir in western Canada. The suitability of
   the storage complex was investigated through 3D characterization using
   high-resolution 3D seismic images and data from the injection and
   observation wells. These data show that: there are no significant faults
   in the immediate area of the storage site; the regional sealing
   formation is continuous in the area; and lastly, that the reservoir is
   not adversely affected by knolls on the surface of the underlying
   Precambrian basement.
   In the Aquistore project PTRC has brought together internationally
   recognized expertise and diverse interests. Research in monitoring
   methods is central to the Aquistore Project. A permanent areal seismic
   monitoring array has been deployed which comprises 650 geophones
   installed at 20 m depth on a 2.5x2.5 km regular grid. The objective of
   this array is to test ``sparse array{''} seismic imaging and to provide
   continuous passive monitoring. This array is being utilized in
   conjunction and comparison with time-lapse 3D seismic imaging,
   continuous microseismic monitoring, vertical seismic profiling,
   cross-well seismic tomography, and broadband seismographs.
   Injection-related surface deformation monitoring is provided by InSAR
   analysis in conjunction with a network of tiltmeters and GPS stations.
   Electromagnetic surveys and gravimeters are also being used. In an
   effort to minimize surface impact these monitoring technologies - where
   possible - have been collocated and solar-powered.
   Surface electromagnetic methods and time-lapse gravity monitoring will
   be tested in conjunction with deployment of a fibre-optic distributed
   acoustic sensing (DAS) line. A fibre-optic distributed temperature
   sensing (DTS) line is also installed. A unique fluid recovery system
   (FRS) as well as casing conveyed pressure and temperature gauges will
   contribute to the project's down-hole monitoring techniques.
   Aquistore's MMV program will test and develop effective methods for
   monitoring CO2 storage sites and ensure conformance of the storage
   process through continuous monitoring. This program is seeking to
   minimize the risk associated with any potential leakage of CO2 from the
   storage reservoir through early detection. Aquistore's MMV program has
   included an added focus on integrated monitoring methods such as the
   inclusion of non-seismic methods and constraints from reservoir flow
   simulations. Aquistore will provide an efficient, cost effective, and
   field-tested basis for designing effective MMV programs for other
   similar projects worldwide. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In liquid-to-air membrane energy exchangers (LAMEEs), the heat and mass
   transfer resistances in the air channel are dominant. An eddy promoter
   air screen can effectively enhance the heat and mass transfers in the
   air channel. In this study, the heat transfer enhancement and pressure
   drop across three different eddy promoter air screens in an air channel
   are experimentally investigated. Eddy promoter air screens are comprised
   of plastic ribs in the stream-wise direction and aluminum cross-bars
   normal to the air flow direction. A low speed wind tunnel test facility,
   which simulates the air channel of a LAMEE is designed to measure the
   friction factor and enhanced convective heat transfer coefficient in the
   air channel with an eddy promoter air screen. Tests were conducted at
   Reynolds numbers of 920, 1550, and 2160. In this paper, the effects of
   the spacing of the cylindrical bars and plastic ribs on the heat
   transfer performance are studied experimentally. Also, the performance
   of eddy promoter air screens as a function of enhanced heat transfer
   coefficient and increased pressure drop is investigated. Results show
   that the eddy promoter air screens have the higheSI efficiencies at
   Reynolds of 1550 and double the convective heat transfer coefficient of
   the air with respect to a smooth channel.}},

Abstract = {{It is critical for the construction industry to ensure that new building
   designs and materials, including wall and floor assemblies (e.g., a
   studded wall with insulation and drywall) provide an acceptable level of
   fire safety. A key fire safety requirement that is specified in building
   codes is the minimum fire resistance rating, which is a measure of the
   ability of an assembly to limit fire spread within a building. A
   manufacturer of building materials (e.g., insulation or drywall) is
   required to perform full-scale fire resistance furnace tests to
   determine the fire resistance ratings of assemblies that use their
   products. Fire resistance test facilities are very limited and these
   tests are very expensive to perform. Therefore, it can be difficult to
   properly assess the impact of changes to individual components on the
   overall fire performance of an assembly during the design process.
   As part of a project to develop methods of using small-scale fire test
   data to predict full-scale fire resistance test results, the heat
   transfer through scale models of common wall assembly designs was
   measured during cone calorimeter tests using an incident heat flux of 75
   kW/m(2). Wall assemblies consisting of single and double layers of 12.7
   mm (1/2 in.) regular and lightweight gypsum board, and 15.9 mm (5/8 in.)
   type X gypsum board, along with mineral wool insulation and wood studs
   were tested. Temperature measurements made at various points within
   these assemblies are presented in this paper, and are discussed using
   results from thermal gravimetric analysis tests of the three types of
   gypsum board. Implications of this research to the development of heat
   transfer models and scaling relationships are also briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{IRIS (InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph) is a first light near-infrared
   diffraction limited imager and integral field spectrograph being
   designed for the future Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). IRIS is optimized
   to perform astronomical studies across a significant fraction of cosmic
   time, from our Solar System to distant newly formed galaxies (Barton et
   al. {[}1]). We present a selection of the innovative science cases that
   are unique to IRIS in the era of upcoming space and ground-based
   telescopes. We focus on integral field spectroscopy of directly imaged
   exoplanet atmospheres, probing fundamental physics in the Galactic
   Center, measuring 10(4) to 10(10) M-circle dot supermassive black hole
   masses, resolved spectroscopy of young star-forming galaxies (1 < z < 5)
   and first light galaxies (6 < z < 12), and resolved spectroscopy of
   strong gravitational lensed sources to measure dark matter substructure.
   For each of these science cases we use the IRIS simulator (Wright et al.
   {[}2], Do et al. {[}3]) to explore IRIS capabilities. To highlight the
   unique IRIS capabilities, we also update the point and resolved source
   sensitivities for the integral field spectrograph (IFS) in all five
   broadband filters (Z, Y, J, H, K) for the finest spatial scale of
   0.004'' per spaxel. We briefly discuss future development plans for the
   data reduction pipeline and quicklook software for the IRIS instrument
   suite.}},

Abstract = {{An improved iterative receiver is developed for multiuser communications
   using fast frequency-hopping modulation. Each user employs a channel
   encoder to protect its information and facilitate interference
   cancellation at the receiver. At the destination, in order to reliably
   extract signals from all users, the detection algorithm employs double
   iteration process: an outer iteration between the interference canceler
   and soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoder, and an inner iteration
   between the soft demapper and the SISO decoder. The proposed detection
   algorithm works with direct as well as relay-aided transmissions. Two
   relay scenarios are investigated, which are amplify-andforward and
   partial-decode-and-forward relaying. Under the same spectral efficiency,
   simulation results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed
   receiver when compared to the performance of single iterative receiver
   and other previously-proposed interference cancellation schemes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient color image enhancement method for
   endoscopic images. The enhancement is achieved in two parts: image
   enhancement at gray level followed by a color reproduction. The captured
   RGB endoscopic images are first converted into three 2-D spectral images
   using a well-known method called FICE (Fuji Intelligent Color
   Enhancement). Then the image with the maximum entropy is selected as the
   base image to be used for color reproduction in the next stage. In color
   reproduction, the chrominance map of a source color image is added to
   the base image. This chrominance map is found by matching luminance and
   texture information between these two images based on neighborhood
   statistic method. The distance between luminance components of base gray
   image and source color images is calculated using 2-norm Euclidean
   distance. The proposed method highlights some of the tissue
   characteristics in the base endoscopic image which will enable better
   diagnosis. The performance of the scheme is compared with other related
   algorithms in terms of simulation speed, image quality, efficiency of
   color reproduction and distortion.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a design of a microcontroller based Wi-Fi adapter
   that can be used in wireless capsule endoscopy application. Using the
   proposed adapter, image data from an endoscopic capsule, after
   swallowing, can be can be saved (or logged) directly on smart device,
   laptop, workstation or server that are connected to hospital's Wi-Fi
   network. This enables medical doctors to analyze data in real time
   during examination from a remote place. Two case studies are shown where
   (a) an Android mobile app for Smartphone and (b) computer software for
   standalone laptop workstation have been developed. The design has been
   prototyped in laboratory and the advantage of the proposed adapter is
   demonstrated for capsule endoscopy application. The proposed W-Fi
   adapter is also useful for other external or implantable biosensors with
   similar advantages where remote viewing and diagnosis in real-time are
   desired.}},

Abstract = {{Video capsule endoscopy is a non-invasive technique to receive images of
   intestine for medical diagnostics. The main design challenges of
   endoscopy capsule are accruing and transmitting acceptable quality
   images by utilizing as less hardware and battery power as possible. In
   order to save wireless transmission power and bandwidth, an efficient
   image compression algorithm needs to be implemented inside the endoscopy
   electronic capsule. In this paper, an integer discrete-cosine-transform
   (DCT) based algorithm is presented that works on a low-complexity
   color-space specially designed for wireless capsule endoscopy
   application. First of all, thousands of human endoscopic images and
   video frames have been analyzed to identify special intestinal features
   present in those frames. Then a color space, referred as YEF, is used.
   The YEF converter is lossless and takes only a few adders and shift
   operation to implement. A low-cost quantization scheme with variable
   chroma sub-sampling options is also implemented to achieve higher
   compression. Comparing with the existing works, the proposed transform
   coding based compressor performs strongly with an average compression
   ratio of 85\% and a high image quality index, peak-signal-to-noise ratio
   (PSNR) of 52 dB.}},

Abstract = {{A circuit model based on Bloch theory is introduced to simplify analysis
   and design of antennas composed of thick metal electromagnetic band-gap
   (EBG) cells with large intercell coupling capacitance. The cells are
   composed of thick metal patches periodically deployed on a metal-backed
   dielectric slab. Two versions of cells are presented that provide large
   intercell capacitance, one with narrow high aspect ratio (HAR) gaps
   between cells and the other with interdigitated gaps between cells. This
   large capacitance reduces the antenna resonance and dramatically
   miniaturizes the EBG cells. Three cascaded unit cells are used to
   demonstrate the applicability of the circuit model to characterize the
   recently introduced self-excited EBG resonator antenna. Full-wave
   numerical analysis and experimentation validate the robustness and
   accuracy of the model over large variations in electrical/physical cell

Abstract = {{It is well known that the presence of entrained air bubbles in hydraulic
   oil can significantly reduce the effective bulk modulus of hydraulic
   oil. The effective bulk modulus of a mixture of oil and air as pressure
   changes is considerably different than when the oil and air is not
   mixed. Theoretical models have been proposed in the literature to
   simulate the pressure sensitivity of the effective bulk modulus of this
   mixture. However, limited amounts of experimental data are available to
   prove the validity of the models under various operating conditions. The
   major factors that affect pressure sensitivity of the effective bulk
   modulus of the mixture are the amount of air bubbles, their size and the
   distribution and rate of compression of the mixture. An experimental
   apparatus was designed to investigate the effect of these variables on
   the effective bulk modulus of the mixture. The experimental results were
   compared with existing theoretical models and it was found that the
   theoretical models only matched the experimental data under specific
   conditions. The purpose of this paper is to specify; the conditions in
   which the current theoretical models can be used to represent the real
   behavior of the pressure sensitivity of the effective bulk modulus of
   the mixture. Additionally, a new theoretical model is proposed for
   situations where the current models fail to truly represent the
   experimental data.}},

   (PL) measurements over the UV-VIS range using light emitting diodes
   (LED) and laser diodes (LD) excitation sources. We have also irradiated
   thermally treated and non-treated glass samples by X-rays and have

Abstract = {{Amorphous selenium (a-Se) is currently used in x-ray image detectors as
   an x-ray photoconductor. Normally a-Se films used in device applications
   are fabricated by the evaporation of vitreous bulk material loaded into
   boats in a typical vacuum deposition system. The resistance against
   crystallization is an important factor in both film and bulk forms of
   a-Se. Previous work has indicted that the resistance to crystallization
   is surprisingly more pronounced around 35 degrees C {[} 1]. In this work
   we have therefore examined the essential thermal properties of vitreous
   selenium (99.999\%) samples that have been stored at different
   temperatures. The thermal characterization experiments involved a series
   of DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) measurements in which have
   monitored the glass transition and melting endotherms, and the
   crystallization exotherm in heating-cooling-heating scans. In DSC
   experiments, a sample would be heated to a temperature above the melting
   temperature, equilibrated, then cooled at a fixed rate down to 20
   degrees C, then equilibrated and finally scanned again under a heating
   schedule. The samples were isothermally stored at temperatures
   corresponding to 18, 35 and 55 degrees C. The thermal analysis results
   show that there are distinct differences in the thermal properties. We
   have examined the stability in terms of the difference in the
   crystallization onset temperature (T-c) and the onset of glass
   transition temperature (T-g). We also examined the Hruby coefficient
   (K-gl) of these samples, that is K-gl = (T-c - T-g)/(T-m - T-c) where
   T-c is the crystallization onset temperature and Tm is the melting onset
   temperature. We have found K-gl to depend on the storage temperature.
   Surprisingly, we observed that the Hruby coefficient is actually larger
   at 35 degrees C compared to the values at 18 and 55 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the architecture of a scalable elliptic curve
   cryptography (ECC) processor (ECP). Two versions of scalable ECPs are
   presented, one for binary field pseudorandom curves and one for binary
   field Koblitz curves. The implementations of these designs are able to
   support all 5 key sizes of pseudo-random or Koblitz curves recommended
   by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) without
   reconfiguring the hardware. The paper proposes an architecture of a
   finite field multiplier that uses the KaratsubaOfman algorithm in order
   to reduce the latency of the finite field multiplication for larger key
   sizes. As a result, the latency of the overall elliptic curve point
   multiplication (ECPM) is reduced compared to previous designs of the
   scalable ECPs. To the authors' best knowledge, the proposed scalable
   ECPs are the fastest ECPs that can support all 5 pseudo-random or

Abstract = {{Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processors, having a significant impact on
   the performance of communication systems, have been a hot topic of
   research for many years. FFT function consists of consecutive
   multiply-add operations over complex numbers, dubbed as butterfly units.
   Use of redundant number systems is a way of increasing the speed of FFT
   coprocessors. It eliminates carry-propagation and hence permits latency
   reduction of each stage of the pipelined FFT architecture.
   This paper proposes a high-speed FFT processor using the devised
   fused-dot-product-add (FDPA) unit, to compute AB +/- CD +/- E, based on
   Binary-Signed-Digit (BSD) representation. Three-operand BSD adder and
   BSD constant multiplier are the constituents of the proposed FDPA unit.
   A carry-limited BSD adder is proposed and used in the three-operand
   adder and in the parallel BSD multiplier, so as to improve the speed of
   the FDPA unit. Moreover, modified-booth encoding is used to accelerate
   the BSD multiplier.
   Synthesis results show that the proposed design is about two times
   faster than the best previous work; but at cost of more area/power
   consumption.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient planar array antenna composed of thick electromagnetic
   bandgap (EBG) antenna elements is proposed. The element, called
   SE-EBG-RA, is an efficient EBG antenna introduced in literature. The
   array comprises equally-spaced series-fed elements designed to have
   broadside radiation. A computationally efficient approach is presented
   to form the array in series with negligible mutual coupling between
   elements. To this end, first the terminated version of SE-EBG-RA element
   is introduced. Then, it is shown that how such elements can structure
   the series array effectively. Results show that the application of EBG
   cells and thick traces yields high efficiency, alleviated mutual
   coupling, and a symmetrical broadside pattern with reduced numerical
   computation load.}},

Abstract = {{The Ohm's law is modified when turbulent processes are accounted for.
   Besides an hyper-resistivity, already well known, pinch terms appear in
   the electron momentum flux. Moreover it appears that turbulence is
   responsible for a source term in the Ohm's law, called here turbulent
   current drive. Two terms contribute to this source. The first term is a
   residual stress in the momentum flux, while the second contribution is
   an electro-motive force. A non zero average parallel wave number is
   needed to get a finite source term. Hence a symmetry breaking mechanism
   must be invoked, as for ion momentum transport. E x B shear flows and
   turbulence intensity gradients are shown to provide similar
   contributions. Moreover this source term has to compete with the
   collision friction term (resistivity). The effect is found to be
   significant for a large scale turbulence in spite of an unfavorable
   scaling with the ratio of the electron to ion mass. Turbulent current
   drive appears to be a weak effect in the plasma core, but could be
   substantial in the plasma edge where it may produce up to 10 \% of the
   local current density.}},

Abstract = {{With shrinking process technologies, the likelihood of mid-life faults
   in combinatorial logic is increasing. Approximate logic functions are a
   promising approach to mitigate such faults as the technique can be
   applied to any digital circuit, it protects against multiple fault
   models and offers a trade-off between increased area and fault coverage.
   In this paper we present a new algorithm for generating approximate
   logic functions. The algorithm considers the failure probabilities of
   the gates and it uses a sum of product (SOP) representation. The results
   on some circuits show that FIT rate can be reduced by 75\% with an area
   penalty of 46\% and inserting only two additional layers of logic.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory heats of an API X100 steel (Mn-Mo-Nb)with two levels of
   vanadium (0.004\% and 0.063\%) were melted and control rolled simulating
   a coiled plate production process. Extensive microstructural analyses
   were performed, including optical, EBSD and TEM. Texture analyses of the
   two alloys were also compared. Mechanical properties were determined for
   various rolling and pipe axis orientations. Only minor differences in
   microstructure and texture properties were observed between the two
   alloys. Yet the 0.063\% V alloy had from 8 to 14\% higher yield and
   tensile strengths in all directions, while the toughness and ductility
   measurements were similar for both alloys. Higher strength of the V
   added pipeline steel was partially due to its smaller grain size and
   larger fraction of subgrain boundaries. Some, but perhaps not all, of
   the strength differences could be related to the observed smaller
   precipitate size of the higher vanadium steel. The vanadium addition was
   necessary in this alloy to ensure meeting the required strength
   properties of X100 steel.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of thermally driven convective air flow within waste rock
   or natural soil profiles has been well established; however, the
   potential impact that convective air flow may have on water storage
   within reclamation soil covers has not been previously explored. We
   conducted a numerical modeling study to evaluate the effect that
   convective air flow may have on stored water within a soil reclamation
   cover placed over a coke stockpile at an oil sands mine in Alberta,
   Canada. Coke is a carbon, sand-like byproduct of heavy oil processing.
   Two-dimensional simulations of thermally driven convective air flow were
   conducted for two different field sites based on available field data.
   The elevated temperature within the coke stockpile resulted in the
   development of strong convective air flow cells that drew in drier
   atmospheric air over the lower slope positions while releasing it across
   the upper slope and plateau areas of the cover. The magnitude of the gas
   flux and the intensity of the convection within the cell were a function
   of the air permeability of the coke and cover material, the depth of the
   coke, and the slope of the stockpile. It was estimated that convective
   air movement through the cover could produce as much as 1 to 2 mm/d of
   enhanced drying of the cover in lower slope positions. Field
   observations of water content distributions within the cover provided
   corroboration that the cover has undergone enhanced drying at lower
   slope positions.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption capacity of commercial powdered activated charcoal (PAC)

   The effects of the initial acyclovir concentration (100-400 mg/L), pH
   (3-11), contact time, temperature (25-45 degrees C), and PAC dose (1-4
   g/L) on the removal of acyclovir have been studied. The maximum removal
   was found to be 98\% for 100 mg/L of acyclovir solution with 4 g/L of
   PAC dose at 45 degrees C. The results indicate that basic pH from 7 to
   11 of acyclovir solution favored the adsorption on PAC. Moreover, the
   results showed that the adsorption kinetics can be represented by a
   pseudo-first-order model. The adsorption experimental data fitted in the
   order of decreasing accuracy as Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson, Temkin,
   Langmuir, and Dubinin-Radushkevich models. The Freundlich model was
   found the best to describe the equilibrium isotherm data of acyclovir
   adsorption on PAC. The maximum adsorption capacity of acyclovir
   determined from the Freundlich model was found to be 20.2 mg/g. The heat
   of adsorption was positive indicating endothermic nature and its low
   values (<70 kJ/mol) confirmed physisorption.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the effect of different parameters of ultrasonic
   power, pollutant initial concentration, pH and the presence of
   co-existing chemical species (oxygen, nitrogen, ozone, and radical
   scavengers) on the ultrasonic degradation of the endocrine disruptor
   1-H-benzotriazole. Increasing the 1-H-benzotriazole initial
   concentration from 41.97 to 167.88 mu M increased the pollutant
   degradation rate by 40\%. Likewise, a high applied ultrasonic power
   enhanced the extent of 1-H-benzotriazole removal and its initial
   degradation rate, which was accelerated in the presence of ozone and
   oxygen, but inhibited by nitrogen. The most favorable pH for the
   ultrasonic degradation was acidic media, reaching similar to 90\%
   pollutant removal in 2 h. The hydroxyl free radical concentration in the
   reaction medium was proportional to the ultrasound power and the
   irradiation time. Kinetic models based on a Langmuir-type mechanism were
   used to predict the pollutant sonochemical degradation. It was concluded
   that degradation takes place at both the bubble-liquid interfacial
   region and in the bulk solution, and OH radicals were the main species
   responsible for the reaction. Hydroxyl free radicals were generated by
   water pyrolysis and then diffused into the interfacial region and the
   bulk solution where most of the solute molecules were present.}},

Abstract = {{Naphthenic acids are a complex mixture of organic components, some of
   which include saturated alkyl-substituted cycloaliphatic carboxylic
   acids and acyclic aliphatic acids. They are naturally found in
   hydrocarbon deposits like oil sand, petroleum, bitumen and crude oil. In
   this study, the oxidation of a relatively high molecular weight
   naphthenic acid (Dicyclohexyl acetic acid) was investigated using
   ozonation, ultrasonication and hydrogen peroxide alone and their
   combinations. Effects on oxidation of dicyclohexyl acetic acid (DAA)
   were measured for different concentrations of ozone ranging between 0.7
   to 3.3 mg L-1 and pH in the range 6 to 10. Ultrasonication and hydrogen
   peroxide alone were not effective to oxidize dicyclohexyl acetic acid,
   but combining ultrasonication with H2O2 had a significant effect on
   oxidation of dicyclohexyl acetic acid with maximum removal reaching to
   84 +/- 2.2\% with 81 +/- 2.1\% reduction in chemical oxygen demand
   (COD). Synergistic effects were observed for combining ultrasonication
   with ozonation and resulted in 100\% DAA removal with 98 +/- 0.8\%
   reduction in COD within 15 min at 3.3 mg L-1 ozone concentration and 130
   Watts ultrasonication power. The reaction conditions obtained for the
   maximum oxidation of DAA and COD removal were used for the degradation
   of naphthenic acids mixture extracted from oil sands process water
   (OSPW). The percentage oxidation of NAs mixture extracted from OSPW was
   89.3 +/- 1.1\% in ozonation and combined ozonation and ultrasonication,
   but COD removal observed was 65 +/- 1.2\% and 78 +/- 1.4\% for ozonation
   and combined ozonation and ultrasonication treatments, respectively.}},

   above mentioned properties (p < 0.05). Drying affected the color at
   variable levels and increased the lightness of dried berries compared to
   frozen berries. Hardness, gumminess, and chewiness of dried berries
   increased and springiness and cohesiveness of dried berries decreased
   with microwave power and drying time. The porosity and the destruction

Title = {{ABC and IFC: Modules Detection Method for PPI Network}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Many clustering algorithms are unable to solve the clustering problem of
   protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks effectively. A novel
   clustering model which combines the optimization mechanism of artificial
   bee colony (ABC) with the fuzzy membership matrix is proposed in this
   paper. The proposed ABC-IFC clustering model contains two parts:
   searching for the optimum cluster centers using ABC mechanism and
   forming clusters using intuitionistic fuzzy clustering (IFC) method.
   Firstly, the cluster centers are set randomly and the initial clustering
   results are obtained by using fuzzy membership matrix. Then the cluster
   centers are updated through different functions of bees in ABC
   algorithm; then the clustering result is obtained through IFC method
   based on the new optimized cluster center. To illustrate its
   performance, the ABC-IFC method is compared with the traditional fuzzy
   C-means clustering and IFC method. The experimental results on MIPS
   dataset show that the proposed ABC-IFC method not only gets improved in
   terms of several commonly used evaluation criteria such as precision,
   recall, and P value, but also obtains a better clustering result.}},

Title = {{Identifying Dynamic Protein Complexes Based on Gene Expression Profiles
   and PPI Networks}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Identification of protein complexes from protein-protein interaction
   networks has become a key problem for understanding cellular life in
   postgenomic era. Many computational methods have been proposed for
   identifying protein complexes. Up to now, the existing computational
   methods are mostly applied on static PPI networks. However, proteins and
   their interactions are dynamic in reality. Identifying dynamic protein
   complexes is more meaningful and challenging. In this paper, a novel
   algorithm, named DPC, is proposed to identify dynamic protein complexes
   by integrating PPI data and gene expression profiles. According to
   Core-Attachment assumption, these proteins which are always active in
   the molecular cycle are regarded as core proteins. The protein-complex
   cores are identified from these always active proteins by detecting
   dense subgraphs. Final protein complexes are extended from the
   protein-complex cores by adding attachments based on a topological
   character of ``closeness{''} and dynamic meaning. The protein complexes
   produced by our algorithm DPC contain two parts: static core expressed
   in all the molecular cycle and dynamic attachments short-lived. The
   proposed algorithm DPC was applied on the data of Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae and the experimental results show that DPC outperforms CMC,
   MCL, SPICi, HC-PIN, COACH, and Core-Attachment based on the validation
   of matching with known complexes and hF-measures.}},

Title = {{State Observer Design for Delayed Genetic Regulatory Networks}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Genetic regulatory networks are dynamic systems which describe the
   interactions among gene products (mRNAs and proteins). The internal
   states of a genetic regulatory network consist of the concentrations of
   mRNA and proteins involved in it, which are very helpful in
   understanding its dynamic behaviors. However, because of some
   limitations such as experiment techniques, not all internal states of
   genetic regulatory network can be effectively measured. Therefore it
   becomes an important issue to estimate the unmeasured states via the
   available measurements. In this study, we design a state observer to
   estimate the states of genetic regulatory networks with time delays from
   available measurements. Furthermore, based on linear matrix inequality
   (LMI) approach, a criterion is established to guarantee that the dynamic
   of estimation error is globally asymptotically stable. A gene
   repressillatory network is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of
   our design approach.}},

Abstract = {{The extraction of medicinal or functional compounds from herbal plants
   is an important unit operation in food and bio-industries. The target
   compounds are generally present inter- or intra-cellularly in an
   intricate microstructure formed by cells, intercellular spaces,
   capillaries, and pores. The major resistance of molecular diffusion in
   materials of plant origin always comes from the intact cell walls and
   adhering membranes. Therefore, increasing the permeability of cell walls
   and membranes plays a very important role to increase extraction yield
   and/or extraction rate. Important pretreatment methods to modify the
   cellular structures and increase the permeability of cell walls or
   membranes are discussed in this paper. They include physical, biologic,
   and chemical treatments. In physical methods, mechanical disruption,
   high-pressure (HP) process, pulsed electric field (PEF) application,
   ultrasonic treatment, and freeze-thaw, and so on were applied. In
   biologic methods, different cell wall-degrading enzymes were applied to
   break-down cell walls or membranes and to diminish the overall internal
   resistance for transporting bioactive compounds from internal matrix to
   the external solution. In chemical methods, various chemicals for
   increasing the inner- or outer-membrane permeabilization were
   introduced. The principles of the technologies, examples of
   improvements, and advantages and disadvantages of the pretreatment
   methods are critically reviewed in this paper.}},

Title = {{Hotzone identification with GIS-based post-network screening analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{106-120}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a two-step method called post-network screening
   analysis for identifying collision hotzones (i.e., groups of neighboring
   hotspots) on a road network. The first step is the familiar safety
   network screening that uses AASHTO's Highway Safety Manual (HSM) to
   identify and rank individual locations (i.e., hotspots) according to
   their potential for safety improvement. The second step is new and
   involves network-constrained kernel density estimation (KDE), a type of
   spatial analysis. KDE uses expected collision counts to estimate
   collision density, and outputs a graphical display that shows areas with
   a high density of expected collision counts. These are the hotzones. A
   particularly interesting area of application is the identification of
   high-collision corridors that may benefit from a program of systemic
   safety improvements. The proposed method was tested using five years of
   collision data (2005-2009) for the City of Regina, Saskatchewan. Three
   different network screening measures were compared: (1) observed
   collision counts, (2) observed severity-weighted collision counts, and
   (3) expected severity-weighted collision counts. The study found that
   observed severity-weighted collision counts produced a dramatic picture
   of the city's hotzones, but this picture could be misleading as it could
   be heavily influenced by a small number of severe collisions. The
   results obtained from the expected severity-weighted collision counts
   smoothed the effects of the severity-weighting and successfully reduced
   regression-to-the-mean bias. A comparison is made between the proposed
   approach and the results of the HSM's existing network screening method.
   As the proposed approach takes the spatial association of roadway
   segments into account, and is not limited to single roadway segments,
   the hotzones identified capture a higher number of expected
   equivalent-property-damage-only (EPDO) collisions than the existing HSM
   methodology. The study concludes that the proposed two-step method can
   help transportation safety professionals to prioritize hotzones within
   high-collision corridors more efficiently and scientifically. (C) 2013

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of compressive load and particle size on
   compression characteristics of four varieties (Strongfield, Blackbird,
   DT773 and DT818) of wheat straw grown at two different fields was
   investigated. Particle size, bulk and particle densities of all wheat
   straw samples were determined after grinding. Ground wheat straw samples
   were densified in a cylindrical die at 90 C using an Instron testing
   machine. The wheat straw samples with 9\% moisture content were
   compressed at five levels of compressive pressures (31.6, 63.2, 94.7,
   126.4 and 138.9 MPa) and two levels of particle sizes (1.6 and 3.2 mm).
   Dimensions and mass of all compressed samples were measured to calculate
   the pellet density. The specific energy required to compress and eject
   the pellets was calculated from force-displacement data. Applied
   compressive force and particle size significantly affected the pellet
   density of wheat straw samples. The pellet density was in the range of
   699 -1064 kg m(-3) increasing with pressure and particle size. The total
   specific energy required for compression and ejection of pellets varied
   from 4.35 to 33.64 MJ t (1) that increased with compressive load and
   particle size. Higher compressive forces and particle size increased the
   durability of pellets to more than 95\%. Blackbird variety was the most
   compressible of the four varieties of wheat straw. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In the present study, specific energy for grinding and physical
   properties of wheat, canola, oat and barley straw grinds were
   investigated. The initial moisture content of the straw was about
   0.13-0.15 (fraction total mass basis). Particle size reduction
   experiments were conducted in two stages: (1) a chopper without a
   screen, and (2) a hammer mill using three screen sizes (19.05, 25.4, and
   31.75 mm). The lowest grinding energy (1.96 and 2.91 kWh t (1)) was
   recorded for canola straw using a chopper and hammer mill with 19.05-mm
   screen size, whereas the highest (3.15 and 8.05 kWh t (1)) was recorded
   for barley and oat straws. The physical properties (geometric mean
   particle diameter, bulk, tapped and particle density, and porosity) of
   the chopped and hammer-milled wheat, barley, canola, and oat straw
   grinds measured were in the range of 0.98-4.22 mm, 36-80 kg m (3),
   49-119 kg m (3), 600-1220 kg m (3), and 0.9-0.96, respectively. The
   average mean particle diameter was highest for the chopped wheat straw
   (4.22-mm) and lowest for the canola grind (0.98-mm). The canola grinds
   produced using the hammer mill (19.05-mm screen size) had the highest
   bulk and tapped density of about 80 and 119 kg m (3); whereas, the wheat
   and oat grinds had the lowest of about 58 and 88-90 kg m (3). The
   results indicate that the bulk and tapped densities are inversely
   proportional to the particle size of the grinds. The flow properties of
   the grinds calculated are better for chopped straws compared to hammer
   milled using smaller screen size (19.05 mm). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Due to the growing demand of digital convergence, there is a need to
   have a video encoder/decoder (codec) that is capable of supporting
   multiple video standards on a single platform. High Efficiency Video
   Coding (HEVC), successor to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, is a new standard under
   development that aims to substantially improve coding efficiency
   compared to AVC High Profile. This paper presents an efficient
   architecture based on a resource sharing strategy that can perform the
   quantization operation of the emerging HEVC encoder and six other video
   encoders: H.264/AVC, AVS, VC-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and Motion JPEG (MJPEG).
   Since HEVC is still in the drafting stage, the proposed architecture is
   designed in such a way that any final changes can be accommodated into
   the design. The proposed quantizer architecture is completely
   division-free, as the division operation is replaced by shift and
   addition operations for all the codecs. The design is implemented on an
   FPGA and later synthesized in CMOS 0.18 mu m technology. While working
   at 190 MHz, the design can decode a 1080p HD video at up to 61 frames
   per second. The multi-codec architecture is also suitable for low-cost
   VLSI implementation.}},

Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The accurate prediction of snowmelt runoff is a critical component of
   integrated hydrological and water quality models in regions where
   snowfall constitutes a significant portion of the annual precipitation.
   In cold regions, the accumulation of a snowpack and the subsequent
   spring snowmelt generally constitutes a major proportion of the annual
   water yield. Furthermore, the snowmelt runoff transports significant
   quantities of sediment and nutrients to receiving streams and strongly
   influences downstream water quality. Temperature-index models are
   commonly used in operational hydrological and water quality models to
   predict snowmelt runoff. Due to their simplicity, computational
   efficiency, low data requirements, and ability to consistently achieve
   good results, numerous temperature-index models of varying complexity
   have been developed in the past few decades. The objective of this study
   was to determine how temperature-index models of varying complexity
   would affect the performance of the water quality model SWAT(BF) (a
   modified version of SWAT that was developed for watersheds dominated by
   boreal forest) for predicting runoff. Temperature-index models used by
   several operational hydrological models were incorporated into SWAT(BF).
   Model performance was tested on five watersheds on the Canadian Boreal
   Plain whose hydrologic response is dominated by snowmelt runoff. The
   results of this study indicate that simpler temperature-index models can
   perform as well as more complex temperature-index models for predicting
   runoff from the study watersheds. The outcome of this study has
   important implications because the incorporation of simpler
   temperature-index snowmelt models into hydrological and water quality
   models can lead to a reduction in the number of parameters that need to
   be optimized without sacrificing predictive accuracy.}},

   data by proper analysis methods such as significance analysis and
   clustering analysis. Many statistic-based significance analysis methods
   and distance/correlation-based clustering analysis methods have been
   applied to time-course expression data. However, these techniques are
   unable to account for the dynamics of such data. It is the dynamics that
   characterizes such data and that should be considered in analysis of
   such data. In this paper, we employ a nonlinear model to analyse
   time-course gene expression data. We firstly develop an efficient method
   for estimating the parameters in the nonlinear model. Then we utilize
   this model to perform the significance analysis of individually
   differentially expressed genes and clustering analysis of a set of gene
   expression profiles. The verification with two synthetic datasets shows
   that our developed significance analysis method and cluster analysis
   method outperform some existing methods. The application to one
   real-life biological dataset illustrates that the analysis results of
   our developed methods are in agreement with the existing results.}},

Abstract = {{A liquid-to-air membrane energy exchanger (LAMEE) is an energy exchange
   device that transfers heat and moisture between air and salt solution
   streams through a semi-permeable membrane which is permeable for water
   vapor but impermeable for liquid water. LAMEEs have been used as a
   dehumidifier/regenerator in air-conditioning systems. In this paper, the
   solution-side effectiveness are presented for a small-scale single-panel
   LAMEE when it is used to regenerate the solution flow. The solution-side
   effectiveness are very important in regenerators where the main focus is
   on the salt solution, and the solution properties (i.e. solution outlet
   concentration) are important. The small-scale LAMEE is tested under air
   dehumidification and solution regeneration test conditions using a LiCl
   solution at one NTU (i.e. NTU = 5) and three different Cr{*} values
   (Cr{*} = 2,4 and 6). The results show that both the air-side and
   solution-side effectiveness of the LAMEE increase with Cr{*}. The
   solution-side latent effectiveness is lower for the regenerator in
   comparison to the dehumidifier (e.g. 43\% lower at Cr{*} = 6). Also, the
   numerical results for a small-scale LAMEE which were presented in
   literature are used in this paper to evaluate the solution-side
   effectiveness of the LAMEE under different test conditions. The
   numerical results show that the difference between the air-side and
   solution-side latent effectiveness are negligible. Therefore, the
   air-side latent effectiveness can be used to evaluate the solution-side
   latent effectiveness of LAMEEs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A time-course analysis was conducted of thermophilic anaerobic digestion
   of dairy manure and wheat distillery thin stillage. Sequencing of
   chaperonin targets provided a phylogenetic survey of both bacteria and
   archaea in the digestate, along with an appraisal of the diversity of
   the reactor microbiome. A total of 1129 bacterial operational taxonomic
   units (OTU) were detected in the reactors, with OTU related to
   Clostridium becoming numerically dominant by day 7, and
   Acetivibrio-related OTU by day 35. Archaeal communities were less
   diverse, with 19 OTU detected representing both acetoclastic and
   hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Regardless of input material, the same
   organisms came to dominate the reactors, reflecting strong selective
   pressures present in the digesters. Principal coordinate analysis of the
   microbial communities showed that the bacterial communities clustered
   based on factors other than input material. Bacterial and archaeal 011.1
   were identified with significant correlations to performance parameters,
   suggesting important roles in the methane production pathway. Crown

Title = {{Comparison of experimental data and a model for heat and mass transfer
   performance of a liquid-to-air membrane energy exchanger (LAMEE) when
   used for air dehumidification and salt solution regeneration}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Liquid-to-air membrane energy exchangers (LAMEEs) allow simultaneous
   heat and moisture transfer between salt solution flows and airflows.
   These exchangers can be used as air dehumidifiers for supply air or
   liquid desiccant regenerators in liquid desiccant air conditioning
   systems while the membrane eliminates entrainment of liquid desiccant as
   aerosols in air streams. In this study, the heat and mass transfer
   performance of a LAMEE used as dehumidifier and regenerator is
   experimentally and analytically investigated to determine the influences
   of air and desiccant solution flow rates, inlet air temperature and
   humidity, and inlet desiccant solution temperature and concentration.
   Using the experimental data, the analytical model for the
   counter-cross-flow LAMEEs is quantitatively validated for sensible and
   latent effectiveness during air dehumidification process for the inlet
   conditions tested, while agreement is not good for the salt solution
   regeneration or de-watering process. This discrepancy may be caused by
   the crystallization of LiCl aqueous solution within the membrane pores
   near the solution side of the membrane during the regeneration tests.
   The data implies that both the moisture flux ratios and the proximity of
   the solution concentration to the saturation concentration play a role
   for moisture transfer blockage within the membrane when the data for
   latent effectiveness is significantly below the theoretical values. The
   influences of inlet air and solution parameters on the mass transfer
   performances of the LAMEE used as dehumidifier and regenerator are also
   compared with those of direct-contact liquid desiccant devices available
   in the literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Saponins from the particulate Saponaria vaccaria L seeds (0.29-0.84 mm,
   15.35-61.40 g H2O/100 g dry mass) were extracted for methanol
   concentrations (MeOH) of 30, 50, 70, and 90 mL/100 mL H2O and
   temperatures (T) of, 30, 45, and 60 degrees C at ten extraction
   intervals (t) between 1 and 180 min. A calibration equation was
   developed from the liquid-chromatogram mass spectroscopy peaks to
   quantify the extract yields (mg mL(-1)) for various types of saponins.
   An artificial neural network (ANN) with three inputs, MeOH, T, and t
   predicted the extraction kinetics and the yields with less than ca. 12\%
   error. The ANN model not only slightly outperformed the numerical
   diffusional model, but it also made the prediction simple and faster
   eliminating the use of the partition coefficient and the effective
   diffusivity. Therefore an ANN model can be a right approach to predict
   the yields of saponins and similar products. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Electric energy generation from renewable sources has received
   considerable public support due to growing concerns about adverse
   environmental impacts from conventional energy sources. As wind power is
   environmentally friendly and suitable for bulk power generation, it is
   one of the fastest growing energy sources in meeting global electric
   energy demand. Many electric power systems are being connected to
   multiple wind farms that have diverse wind speed characteristics. Power
   systems with large wind power penetrations are subject to large
   fluctuations in power generation causing considerable reliability
   concerns in system planning and operation. Diversity in wind farms
   characteristics helps mitigate overall power fluctuations, and can
   therefore have considerable influence in system reliability. This paper
   analyzes wind site profiles in Saskatchewan and quantifies the benefit
   of wind farm diversification in the overall generation adequacy of the
   electric power system in Saskatchewan.}},

Abstract = {{For many communication systems, frequency offset is inevitable, since
   even minute differences between different oscillators are typically
   sufficient to cause this problem. The challenge is exacerbated by other
   non-ideal effects, including intersymbol interference (ISI). In this
   paper, the hardware modelling issues are considered for a frequency
   recovery scheme that has been previously shown to approach the
   Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) and is immune to ISI-induced biasing. The
   associated design and implementation are pursued in the context of a
   DOCSIS 3.0 upstream demodulator. To investigate the correspondences,
   with issues and implications, between theoretical and practical
   hardware-level performances, the frequency recovery scheme is
   implemented in MATLAB and Altera DSP Builder, which offers
   hardware-oriented modelling. The obtained results and analysis, which
   are performed by comparing corresponding outputs from MATLAB and Altera
   DSP Builder, show good match and support the practical validity of the
   frequency recovery scheme for DOCSIS 3.0.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of disease genes is the first step towards the
   understanding of genetic disease mechanisms. Although many computational
   algorithms are proposed to identify disease genes, they either have poor
   performance in terms of AUC scores or are very time consuming. To
   overcome these two problems, a logistic regression based algorithm is
   proposed in this study for identifying disease genes. The issue of
   disease gene identification is formulated as a two-class classification
   problem, where one class represents those disease genes, while the other
   class represents non-disease genes. A binary logistic regression is
   employed to predict the posterior probability of a gene associated with
   disease by taking prior labels as the categorical dependent variables
   and label related feature vectors as predictor variables. Numerical
   experiments show that the proposed logistic regression based algorithm
   not only have a very good performance, but also significantly reduce the
   computing time. The AUC score is 0.737 when no prior information is used
   and it increases to 0.766 when protein complex data are integrated.
   Averagely, the proposed algorithm only takes 1.31\% and 37.35\% running
   time of the existing MRF method and RWR algorithm, respectively, when
   generating one prediction in the leave-one-out cross validation method.}},

Abstract = {{Markov Clustering (MCL) is a popular algorithm for clustering networks
   in bioinformatics such as Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks and
   especially, shows excellent performance in clustering Dynamic
   Protein-protein Interaction Networks (DPIN). However, a limitation of
   MCL and its variants (e.g. regularized MCL and soft regularized MCL) is
   that the clustering results are mostly dependent on the parameters that
   user-specified. However we know that different networks with various
   scales need different parameters. In this article, we propose a new MCL
   method based on the Firefly Algorithm (FA) to optimize its parameters.
   The results on DIP dataset show that the new algorithm outperforms the
   state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy of identifying
   functional modules on a real DPIN.}},

Abstract = {{With tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), spectra can be generated by
   various methods including collision-induced dissociation (CID),
   higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD), electron capture
   dissociation (ECD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD). At the same
   time, de novo sequencing using multiple spectra from the same peptide is
   becoming popular in proteomics studies. The focus of this work is using
   a pair of spectra from CID (or HCD) and ECD (or ETD) fragmentation
   because of the complementarity between them. We present a new de novo
   sequencing method for such paired spectra named NovoPair, and compare
   its performance to another successful method named pNovo+. NovoPair
   extends our previously proposed graph model to suit paired spectra, and
   considers different ion types in the two spectra to extract more
   information. The results show that NovoPair outperforms pNovo+ in terms
   of full length peptide sequencing accuracy on three pairs of
   experimental datasets, with the accuracy increasing up to 13.6\%
   compared to pNovo+.}},

   N (N <= K) orthogonal channels, is studied. The K sensors are divided
   into N groups, where the sensors in each group simultaneously transmit
   on one orthogonal channel (and hence the transmitted signals are
   directly superimposed at the FC as opposed to being coherently
   combined). Two versions of the semi-orthogonal MAC are developed and
   analyzed in detail: fixed sensor grouping and adaptive sensor grouping.
   Both versions are shown to outperform the orthogonal MAC, especially the
   one with adaptive sensor grouping. In fact, the semi-orthogonal MAC with
   adaptive sensor grouping is shown to perform very close to that of the
   hybrid MAC, while requiring much smaller amount of feedback.}},

   establish the diversity and coding gains for three error types in the MA

   precoding in both frequency and time domains is proposed. It is proved
   that the proposed FT-GLCP is able to achieve the maximum diversity gain
   under type-3 errors, while maintaining the maximum diversity and coding
   gains under type-1 and type-2 errors. To corroborate the theoretical

   calculated within the ROI pixels. Instead of considering single color
   space all color spaces are investigated to extract feature, among them
   four statistical measures as mean of four color space is proposed. It is
   shown that use of ROI and CMYK color space not only reduces
   computational complexity but also offers significantly better
   discrimination between bleeding and non-bleeding pixels. For the purpose
   of classification, support vector machine (SVM) classifier is employed.
   From extensive experimentation on several WCE videos collected from a
   publicly available database, it is observed that the bleeding detection
   performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and
   specificity is quite satisfactory in comparison to that obtained by some
   of the existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{this paper proposes an analog-digital hybrid eigenmode transmission
   technique for massive short-range MIMO, which utilizes both analog and
   digital beamformings. In this method, first, a channel matrix in a
   plane-symmetrically configured MIMO array is block-diagonalized by
   analog beamforming with hybrid couplers. Then, eigenmode transmission is
   virtually realized by digital beamforming toward each block-diagonalized
   sub channel matrix. This approach is geometrically realizable and
   results in a reduction in the required number of calculations.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of a wake-mounted splitter plate on the flow around a
   surface-mounted finite-height square prism was investigated
   experimentally in a low-speed wind tunnel. Four square prisms of aspect
   ratios AR = 9, 7, 5 and 3 were tested at a Reynolds number of Re =
   7.4x10(4). The relative thickness of the boundary layer on the ground
   plane was delta/D = 1.5 (where D is the side length of the prism). The
   splitter plates were mounted vertically from the ground plane on the
   wake centreline, with a negligible gap between the leading edge of the
   plate and rear of the prism. The splitter plate heights were always the
   same as the heights of prisms, while the splitter plate lengths were
   varied from L/D = 1 to 7. Measurements of the mean drag force were
   obtained with a force balance, and measurements of the vortex shedding
   frequency were obtained with a single-sensor hot-wire probe. Compared to
   previously published results for an ``infinite{''} square prism, a
   splitter plate is less effective at drag reduction, but more effective
   at vortex shedding suppression, when used with a finite-height square
   prism. Significant reduction in drag was realized only for short prisms
   (of AR < 5) when long splitter plates (of L/D >= 5) were used. In
   contrast, a splitter plate of length L/D = 3 was sufficient to suppress
   vortex shedding for all aspect ratios tested. Compared to previous
   results for fmiteheight circular cylinders, finite-height square prisms
   typically need longer splitter plates for vortex shedding suppression.}},

Abstract = {{The flow above the free end of a surface-mounted finite height circular
   cylinder was studied in a low-speed wind tunnel using particle image
   velocimetry (PTV). The cylinder was mounted vertically in the wind
   tunnel, normal to a ground plane. The approaching flow was in the
   x-direction and the cylinder axis was aligned in the z-direction.
   Velocity measurements were made above the free-end surface in several
   vertical (x-z) planes and several horizontal (x-y). planes, for finite
   circular cylinders of aspect ratios AR = 9, 7, 5 and 3, at a Reynolds
   number of Re = 4.2x10(4). The relative thickness of the boundary layer
   on the ground plane was delta/D = 1.7. In the vertical symmetry plane,
   the mean velocity measurements show the prominent separation from the
   circumferential leading edge, the mean recirculation zone above the
   free-end surface, the arch vortex inside the recirculation zone, and
   reattachment of the flow onto the free end surface. Experimental
   evidence is found for a leading-edge separation bubble, a flow structure
   which has been reported in some numerical simulations in the literature.
   As AR decreases, the reattachment point and the centre of the arch
   vortex move downstream, the recirculation zone becomes thicker, and the
   centre of the arch vortex moves higher above the free end. Away from the
   symmetry plane, the recirculation zone becomes thinner, the arch vortex
   centre moves upstream and closer to the free-end surface, and the
   reattachment point moves upstream. In the horizontal planes,
   measurements made very close to the surface can approximate the mean
   surface streamline topology, revealing the pair of foci representing the
   termination points of the arch vortex, the prominent curved reattachment
   line, reverse flow beneath the mean recirculation zone, and the
   reattachment and separation saddle points on the free-end centerline.}},

Abstract = {{The mean wake of two identical surface-mounted finite height circular
   cylinders arranged in a tandem configuration was investigated in a
   low-speed wind tunnel using a seven-hole pressure probe. The Reynolds
   number was Re = 2.4x10(4), the cylinder aspect ratio was AR = 9, and the
   boundary layer thickness on the ground plane relative to the cylinder
   height was delta/H approximate to 0.4. Three centre-to-centre
   longitudinal pitch ratios of L/D = 1.125, 2, and 5 were examined,
   corresponding to the extended body, reattachment, and co-shedding flow
   regimes, respectively. Reference measurements were also made in the wake
   of a single finite circular cylinder of AR = 9. For the tandem
   configurations, velocity measurements were made behind the downstream
   cylinder in two orthogonal vertical planes. Compared to the wake of the
   single surface-mounted finite-height circular cylinder, the mean
   downwash and upwash flows for the tandem cylinders, behind the
   downstream cylinder, were weaker, the mean recirculation zone behind the
   downstream cylinder was shorter, and the mean wake extended higher above
   the ground plane, for all three pitch ratios. Marked changes were also
   observed in the mean streamwise wake vortex structures, compared to the
   case of the single finite cylinder. For the extended-body and
   reattachment flow regimes, the tip vortex structures became elongated in

   vortices were observed, with the second set possibly originating from

Abstract = {{Metabolic flux distribution may be altered by manipulating intracellular
   reducing equivalents. To favour ethanol synthesis by Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae, a reduced cytosolic environment is desired, otherwise
   biomass formation is favoured. Direct variation of intracellular
   NADH/NAD(+) is difficult, however, indirect control through measurement
   of fermentation redox potential is applicable. To utilize fermentation
   redox potential into designing an ethanol fermentation process under
   very-high-gravity (VHG) conditions, correlations between yeast growth
   pattern and fermentation redox potential profile were established. Under
   VHG conditions, S. cerevisiae initially encounters osmotic stress
   resulting in a lengthy lag phase. As fermentation proceeds, the built-up
   of ethanol inhibits yeast propagation, resulting in sudden cell death
   and incomplete sugar conversion. Additionally, an operational scheduling
   for a continuous VHG ethanol fermentation, consisting of a chemostat
   device and an ageing vessel, was proposed and compared to the equivalent
   batch operation. Results show that the proposed operational scheduling
   is superior to the batch counterpart. Process design criteria for a
   chemostat device connecting to several equal-size ageing vessels were
   developed in an attempt to increase annual ethanol productivity. (C)

Abstract = {{Farming consumes considerable energy, natural resources and intensive
   human labor. Robotic assisted farmer can make farming activities more
   precise and more efficient; particularly it may remedy shortage of
   farmers in the future. A planter is a mechanism which performs precision
   seeding. Design of a planter in the optimum manner that needs minimum
   draft force when attached to a mobile robot, was the main objective of
   this work. A planter was developed, fabricated and tested in the course
   of a research project.
   The main motivation for this research is the fact that a mobile robot,
   is an electric powered vehicle with limited power and pulling force.
   Thus, a customized planter with a customized connection mechanism should
   be designed that can be pulled by mobile robot. The developed planter
   should have the same efficiency as the existing planters in seeding.
   To study the interaction between soil engagement tool (disc coulter) and
   soil, experiments were performed in the Linear Soil Bin. Different
   parameters of the disc coulter were changed and the draft force,
   vertical force and side force were measured. The results of the
   experiments were used to find the optimum parameters of the disc that
   caused minimum draft force. A novel planter was designed and fabricated;
   it was attached to a mobile robot, and field tested. Tests performed in
   outdoor and indoor settings showed satisfactory results. Draft force
   developed on the planter was close to analytical value and performance
   of the planter in other aspects was as expected.}},

Abstract = {{A fully integrated navigation strategy of a wheeled mobile robot in farm
   settings and off-road terrains is described here. The proposed strategy
   is composed of four main actions which are: sensor data analysis,
   obstacle detection, obstacle avoidance, and goal seeking. Using these
   actions, the navigation approach is capable of autonomous row-detection,
   row-following and path planning motion in outdoor settings such as
   farms. In order to drive the robot in off-road terrain, it must detect
   holes or ground depressions (negative obstacles), that are inherent
   parts of these environments, in real-time at a safe distance from the
   robot. Key originalities of the proposed approach are its capability to
   accurately detect both positive (over ground) and negative obstacles,
   and accurately identify thethe end of the rows of trees/bushes in
   farm/orchard and enter the next row Experimental evaluations were
   carried out using a differential wheeled mobile robot in different farm
   settings. The mobile robot, used for experiments, utilizes a tilting
   unit which carries a laser range finder to detect objects in the
   environment, and a RTK-DGPS unit for localization. The experiments
   demonstrate that the proposed technique is capable of successfully
   detecting and following rows (path following) as well as robust
   navigation of the robot for point-to-point motion.}},

Journal = {{CARBON}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The unique electronic properties of graphene make it an advantageous
   material for use in many applications, except those that require a band
   gap. Much work has been done to introduce an appropriately tuned band
   gap into graphene, including uniaxial strain and oxidation, with varying
   levels of success. We report here that the stacking configuration of the
   sheets in multilayered graphene oxide can have a significant impact on
   the band gap. Through comparison of X-ray absorption near-edge spectra
   of multilayered pristine graphene sheets with spectra simulated using
   density functional theory, we have found that AA-stacking pushes
   unoccupied states closer to the Fermi level than AB-stacking by widening
   the pi{*} resonance in both graphene oxide and graphene. If the
   near-Fermi states have been removed such that the nearest unoccupied
   state to the Fermi level is the pi{*} band, then AA-stacked multilayered
   graphene oxide will have a smaller band gap than AB-stacked graphene
   oxide. We have confirmed this by measuring the band gap of graphene
   oxide and reduced graphene oxide indirectly using X-ray absorption
   near-edge spectroscopy and X-ray emission spectroscopy. Controlling the
   stacking configuration of multilayered graphene oxide may provide a
   novel method for tuning its band gap. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 26}},
Abstract = {{Experiments using controlled manipulation of climate variables in the
   field are critical for developing and testing mechanistic models of
   ecosystem responses to climate change. Despite rapid changes in climate
   observed in many high latitude and high altitude environments,
   controlled manipulations in these remote regions have largely been
   limited to passive experimental methods with variable effects on
   environmental factors. In this study, we tested a method of controlled
   soil warming suitable for remote field locations that can be powered
   using alternative energy sources. The design was tested in high
   latitude, alpine tundra of southern Yukon Territory, Canada, in 2010 and
   2011. Electrical warming probes were inserted vertically in the
   near-surface soil and powered with photovoltaics attached to a
   monitoring and control system. The warming manipulation achieved a
   stable target warming of 1.3 to 2 degrees C in 1 m(2) plots while
   minimizing disturbance to soil and vegetation. Active control of power
   output in the warming plots allowed the treatment to closely match
   spatial and temporal variations in soil temperature while optimizing
   system performance during periods of low power supply. Active soil
   heating with vertical electric probes powered by alternative energy is a
   viable option for remote sites and presents a low-disturbance option for
   soil warming experiments. This active heating design provides a valuable
   tool for examining the impacts of soil warming on ecosystem processes.}},

Abstract = {{Diamond nucleation and growth on Ti6Al4V substrates with tungsten (W)
   interlayers were investigated using hot filament chemical vapor
   deposition (HFCVD). W interlayers were firstly deposited on Ti6Al4V

   deposited on W-coated Ti6Al4V using the same HFCVD reactor. X-ray
   diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive

   thickness and surface morphology of W interlayer on the nucleation,
   growth, and adhesion of diamond on the Ti alloy was investigated. The
   results show that the pre-deposited W interlayers act as a diffusion
   barrier for carbon, and thus significantly enhancing the nucleation of
   diamond. In addition, the W interlayer reacts with carbon to form WC and
   W2C during the diamond deposition, thus enhancing the adhesion of

   extracted physical parameters such as the free-carrier density and

   law. These physical parameters are consistent with those obtained from
   the DC loss data, and provide further support for the model. Negative

Abstract = {{Background: In dynamic biological processes, genes, transcription
   factors(TF) and microRNAs(miRNAs) play vital regulation roles. Many
   researchers have focused on the transcription factors or miRNAs in
   transcriptional or post transcriptional stage, respectively. However,
   the transcriptional regulation and post transcriptional regulation is
   not isolated in the whole dynamic biological processes, there are few
   reserchers who have tried to consider the network composed by genes,
   miRNAs and TFs in this dynamic biological processes, especially in the
   mouse lung development. Moreover, it is widely acknowledged that cancer
   is a kind of developmental disorders, and some of pathways involved in
   tissue development might be also implicated in causing cancer. Although
   it has been found that many genes differentially expressed during mouse
   lung development are also differentially expressed in lung cancer, very
   little work has been reported to elucidate the combinational regulatory
   programs of such kind of associations.
   Results: In order to investigate the association of transcriptional and
   post-transcriptional regulating activities in the mouse lung
   development, we define the significant triple relations among miRNAs,
   TFs and mRNAs as circuits. From the lung development time course data
   GSE21053, we mine 142610 circuit candidates including 96 TFs, 129 miRNAs
   and 13403 genes. After removing genes with little variation along
   different time points, we finally find 64760 circuit candidates,
   containing 8299 genes, 50 TFs, and 118 miRNAs in total. Further analysis
   on the circuits shows that the circuits vary in different stages of the
   lung development and play different roles. By investigating the circuits
   in the context of lung specific genes, we identify out the regulatory
   combinations for lung specific genes, as well as for those lung
   non-specific genes. Moreover, we show that the lung non-specific genes
   involved circuits are functionally related to the lung development.
   Noticing that some tissue developmental systems may be involved in
   tumourigenesis, we also check the cancer genes involved circuits, trying
   to find out their regulatory program, which would be useful for the
   research of lung cancer.
   Conclusions: The relevant transcriptional or post-transcriptional
   factors and their roles involved in the mouse lung development are both
   changed greatly in different stages. By investigating the cancer genes
   involved circuits, we can find miRNAs/TFs playing important roles in
   tumour progression. Therefore, the miRNA-TF-mRNA circuits can be used in
   wide translational biomedicine studies, and can provide potential drug
   targets towards the treatment of lung cancer.}},

   films (of the type used in x-ray image detectors) by measuring the
   electron lifetime tau(e) through interrupted-field time-of-flight
   experiments. X-ray induced effects have been examined through two types
   of experiments. In recovery experiments, the a-Se was preirradiated with
   and without an applied field (5 V/mu m) during irradiation with
   sufficient dose (typically similar to 20 Gy at 21 degrees C) to
   significantly reduce the electron lifetime by similar to 50\%, and then
   the recovery of the lifetime was monitored as a function of time at
   three different temperatures, 10 degrees C, 21 degrees C, and 35 degrees
   C. The lifetime recovery kinetics was exponential with a relaxation time
   tau(r) that is thermally activated with an activation energy of 1.66 eV.
   tau(r) is a few hours at 21 degrees C and only a few minutes at 35
   degrees C. In experiments examining the irradiation induced effects, the
   a-Se film was repeatedly exposed to x-ray radiation and the changes in
   the drift mobility and lifetime were monitored as a function of
   accumulated dose D. There was no observable change in the drift
   mobility. At 21 degrees C, the concentration of x-ray induced deep traps
   (or capture centers), N-d, increases linearly with D (N-d similar to D)
   whereas at 35 degrees C, the recovery process prevents a linear increase
   in N-d with D, and N-d saturates. In all cases, even under high dose
   irradiation (similar to 50 Gy), the lifetime was recoverable to its
   original equilibrium (pre-exposure) value within a few relaxation times.

Abstract = {{The very nature of lignocellulosic biomass presents resistance and
   recalcitrance to biological and chemical degradation during enzymatic
   hydrolysis and the subsequent fermentation process. This leads to a very
   low conversion rate, which makes the process economically unfeasible. In
   this study, alkaline (NaOH) pretreatment was applied on barley straw,
   using radio-frequency-based dielectric heating to enhance accessibility
   and digestibility during the subsequent stage of enzymatic hydrolysis.
   Three levels of temperature (70, 80, and 90 degrees C), five levels of
   biomass:NaOH solution ratio (1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7, and 1:8), 1 h
   equilibration time, screen size of 1.6 mm, 1\% w/v NaOH concentration,
   and 20 min residence time were used for the pretreatment. The effect of
   the alkaline pretreatment was evaluated through chemical composition
   analysis of the pretreated and non-treated biomass samples. The use of
   NaOH solution and the biomass:NaOH solution ratio played a vital role in
   the breakdown of the lignified matrix. The ratio 1:6 at the four
   temperatures studied was determined to be the optimal treatment
   conditions. Radio frequency-assisted alkaline pretreatment resulted in
   lower acid insoluble lignin and higher total acid soluble lignin
   moieties. Based on the obtained data, we predict that this pretreatment
   will decrease the required amount and cost of enzymes by up to 64\%
   compared to using non-treated biomass. (C) 2013 IAgrE. Published by

Title = {{Effect of rest duration on recovery from repeated exercise in

Volume = {{91}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The process of transportation can be seen as a succession of stressors,
   from which pigs may not have time to recover before slaughter. The aim
   of this study was to determine the extent to which the duration of the
   rest time given to near-market-weight pigs after an initial exposure to
   exercise affected their recovery from subsequent exercise. Eighteen
   groups of 3 gilts were exercised (Ex(1)) through a standard handling
   course, including two 19 degrees ramps, and then were held in a holding
   pen for either 35 (RT35), 75 (RT75), or 150 (RT150) min (Rest Period 1,
   RP1). Afterward, pigs were exercised a second time (Ex(2)) and left to
   rest for 150 min. Recovery from Ex(2) (Rest Period 2, RP2) was assessed
   using measures of heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), skin
   temperature (ST), and posture. Repeated measures and regression analysis
   were used to analyze the data. For RT75 pigs, there were no detrimental
   effects of Ex(2) on HR, RR, and handling time (P > 0.05, for all) during
   the exercise and recovery periods. Skin temperature during Ex(2) was
   greater than ST during Ex(1) (P < 0.001), whereas ST during RP1 did not
   differ from ST during RP2 (P > 0.05). Doubling the rest period did not
   provide any more beneficial effects in regard to RR and HR (P > 0.05 for
   both) during Ex(2) and RP2 compared to RT75 pigs, as shown by the
   similar latencies to recover for these 2 variables. However, ST did not
   increase between exercises, and RT150 pigs required less time to
   complete the handling course during Ex(2). The results show that a lack
   of rest after an initial exposure to exercise made pigs more susceptible
   to stress during Ex(2) and RP2, as demonstrated by greater (P < 0.001
   for all) HR, RR, and ST during RP2 compared to RP1 and Ex(2) compared to
   Ex(1). When given more than 35 min to rest during RP2, RT35 pigs
   eventually recovered. Latencies of recovery for HR, ST, RR, and posture
   were all greater (P < 0.05 for HR, ST, and RR and P < 0.001 for posture)
   than those obtained for RT75 and RT150 pigs. This study highlights that
   if pigs are not initially given enough rest to recover from exercise, a
   subsequent exposure to the same exercise will cause an increase in these
   physiological variables during exercise and recovery. Further research
   is needed to investigate factors contributing to the quality of rest,
   with a particular focus on conditions not allowing a proper rest on the
   truck or in lairage.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to assess whether stress response during
   simulated loading could be reduced by providing pigs with experience
   prior to the event. Two weeks before simulated loading, 160 Large White
   x Landrace near market-weight pigs were allocated to one of four
   treatments: physical training (EXERCISE), psychological training (RAMP),
   EXERCISE and RAMP trainings (BOTH) or no training (CON). Once training
   was completed, pigs were loaded into a simulated trailer compartment,
   and the metrics of behaviour, pig and handler's heart rates, loading
   time and handling difficulty were measured. During loading, heart rate
   was lower (P<0.05) for EXERCISE and BOTH pigs compared with RAMP and CON
   pigs. The numbers of touch/slap and push were lower (P<0.05 and P<0.05,
   respectively) for EXERCISE pigs compared with CON, RAMP and BOTH pigs,
   which did not differ (P>0.05). The number of balks was the lowest (P
   <0.05) for EXERCISE pigs, whereas there were no differences (P>0.05)
   between BOTH and CON or RAMP pigs. This study demonstrates that daily
   exercise, by itself, improves the ease of handling and reduces
   cardiovascular response, while it appears that previous exposure to a
   ramp had no beneficial effects.}},

Abstract = {{The current trend of digital convergence leads to the need of the video
   decoder that should support multiple video standards such as, H.264/AVC,
   JPEG, MPEG-2/4, VC-1, and AVS on a single platform. In this paper, we
   present a cost-sharing architecture of multiple transforms to support
   all five popular video codecs. The architecture is based on a new
   multi-dimensional delta mapping. Here the inverse transform matrix of
   the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of AVS, that has the lowest
   computational unit, is taken as the base to compute the inverse DCT
   matrices of the other four codecs. The proposed architecture uses only
   adders and shifters on a shared basis to reduce the hardware cost
   significantly. The shared architecture is implemented on FPGA and later
   synthesized in CMOS 0.18 mu m technology. The results show that the
   proposed design satisfies the requirement of all five codecs with a
   maximum decoding capability of 60 fps of a full HD video. The scheme is
   also suitable for low-cost implementation in modern multi-codec systems.}},

Abstract = {{A liquid-to-air membrane energy exchanger (LAMEE) is an energy exchanger
   that allows heat and moisture transfer between air and salt solution
   flows through a semipermeable membrane. For the first time, a novel
   small-scale single-panel LAMEE test facility is used to experimentally
   investigate the effect of the direction of heat and mass transfers for
   the air and salt solution flows, and the effect of different salt
   solution types and concentrations on the LAMEE effectiveness. The data
   for steady-state effectiveness of the LAMEE are compared to the
   simulation results of a numerical model. Two studies are conducted;
   first a study based on different heat and mass transfer directions (four
   test cases), and second a study focused on the influence of solution
   types and concentration on LAMEE performance. For the first study, NTU-3
   and four different heat capacity ratios (i.e., Cr{*} = 1, 3, 5, 7) are
   used, with a LiCl salt solution in the exchanger. Mass and energy
   balances for all the test cases and the repeatability of the
   experimental data for the air cooling and dehumidifying test case show
   that the experimental data are repeatable and within an acceptable
   uncertainty range. The results show increasing effectiveness with
   increasing Cr{*}, and good agreement between the numerical and
   experimental results for both air cooling and dehumidifying and air
   heating and humidifying test cases. In the second study, two different
   salt solutions (i.e., LiCl and MgCl2), and three different
   concentrations for the LiCl solution (i.e., 25\%, 30\%, and 35\%) are
   selected to investigate the effect of different salt solution types and
   concentrations on the performance of the LAMEE. A maximum difference of
   10\% is obtained for the LAMEE total effectiveness data with the
   different salt solution types and concentrations. The results show that
   both the salt solution type and concentration affect the LAMEE
   effectiveness, and changing the concentration is one way to control the
   supply air outlet humidity ratio.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the performance of decision directed (DD) maximum
   likelihood (ML) channel tracking algorithm is analyzed. The ML channel
   tracking algorithm presents efficient performance especially in the
   decision directed mode of the operation. In this paper, after
   introducing the method for analysis of DD algorithms, the performance of
   ML MIMO channel tracking algorithm in the DD mode of operation is
   analyzed. In this method channel tracking error is evaluated for a given
   decision error rate. Then, the decision error rate is approximated for a
   given channel tracking error. By solving these two derived equations
   jointly, both the decision error rate and the channel tracking error are
   computed. The presented analysis is compared with simulation results for
   different channel ranks, Doppler frequency shifts, and signal-to-noise
   ratios, and it is shown that the analysis is a good match for simulation
   results especially in high rank MIMO channels and high Doppler shifts.

Abstract = {{Using 11 years of trace gas measurements made at the University of
   Toronto Atmospheric Observatory (43.66 degrees N, 79.40 degrees W) and
   Environment Canada's Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments (44.23
   degrees N, 79.78 degrees W), along with derived meteorological products,
   we identify a number of polar intrusion events, which are excursions of
   the polar vortex or filaments from the polar vortex extending down to
   midlatitudes. These events are characterized by enhanced stratospheric
   columns (12-50km) of hydrogen fluoride (HF), by diminished stratospheric
   columns of nitrous oxide (N2O), and by a scaled potential vorticity
   above 1.2 x 10(-4)s(-1). The events comprise 16\%of winter/spring
   (November to April inclusive) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectroscopic measurements from January 2002 to March 2013, and we find
   at least two events per year. The events are corroborated by Modele
   Isentrope du transport Meso-echelle de l'Ozone Stratospherique par
   Advection, Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and
   Applications potential vorticity maps, and Global Modeling Initiative
   N2O maps. During polar intrusion events, the stratospheric ozone (O-3)
   columns over Toronto are usually greater than when there is no event.
   Our O-3 measurements agree with the Optical Spectrograph and Infrared
   Imaging System satellite instrument and are further verified with the
   Earth Probe Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer and Ozone Monitoring
   Instrument satellite observations. We find six cases out of 53 for which
   chemical O(3)depletion within the polar vortex led to a reduction in
   stratospheric O-3 columns over Toronto. We have thus identified a
   dynamical cause for most of the winter/spring variability of
   stratospheric trace gas columns observed at our midlatitude site. While
   there have been a number of prior polar intrusion studies, this is the
   first study to report in the context of 11 years of ground-based FTIR
   column measurements, providing insight into the frequency of midlatitude
   polar vortex intrusions and observations of upper stratospheric (25-50
   km) intrusions. It is also the first to present HF measurements during
   multiple polar intrusions, which provided an excellent tracer for their
   identification.

Abstract = {{The microstructure and texture evolution in an aluminum-lithium alloy
   showing adiabatic shear band after dynamic deformation has been carried

   features indicating the existence of both continuous as well as

   by 120 MeV Ag ions with various fluences at room temperature. X-ray
   diffraction patterns indicate the decrease in average size of Ge NCs
   with increase in irradiation fluence. Raman scattering spectra showed a
   peak of Ge-Ge optical phonon vibrational mode shifted towards lower
   wavenumber side upon irradiation with respect to its bulk value, which
   is due to quantum confinement of optical phonons in the NCs. This blue
   shift also reflects decrease in the size of NCs upon irradiation. Change
   of NC size with the increase of irradiation fluence can be explained on
   the basis of energy deposited by incident ion inside the target

   This paper presents a comparative study of cladding tubes with different

   kinetic. The experimental results reveal that surface roughness affects
   the oxidation rate and weight gain of the cladding tubes. Although
   surface polishing slightly changes the substrate texture, it induces no

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the high-pressure behavior of carbon dioxide (CO2), an
   important planetary material found in Venus, Earth, and Mars, is vital
   to the study of the evolution and dynamics of the planetary interiors as
   well as to the fundamental understanding of the C-O bonding and
   interaction between the molecules. Recent studies have revealed a number
   of crystalline polymorphs (CO2-I to -VII) and an amorphous phase under
   high pressure-temperature conditions. Nevertheless, the reported phase
   stability field and transition pressures at room temperature are poorly
   defined, especially for the amorphous phase. Here we shed light on the
   successive pressure-induced local structural changes and the
   molecular-to-nonmolecular transition of CO2 at room temperature by
   performing an in situ study of the local electronic structure using
   X-ray Raman scattering, aided by first-principle exciton calculations.
   We show that the transition from CO2-I to CO2-III was initiated at
   around 7.4 GPa, and completed at about 17 GPa. The present study also
   shows that at similar to 37 GPa, molecular CO2 starts to polymerize to
   an extended structure with fourfold coordinated carbon and minor CO3 and
   CO-like species. The observed pressure is more than 10 GPa below
   previously reported. The disappearance of the minority species at 63(+/-
   3) GPa suggests that a previously unknown phase transition within the
   nonmolecular phase of CO2 has occurred.}},

Title = {{Predicting beta-turns in proteins using support vector machines with
   fractional polynomials}},
Journal = {{PROTEOME SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: beta-turns are secondary structure type that have essential
   role in molecular recognition, protein folding, and stability. They are
   found to be the most common type of non-repetitive structures since 25\%
   of amino acids in protein structures are situated on them. Their
   prediction is considered to be one of the crucial problems in
   bioinformatics and molecular biology, which can provide valuable
   insights and inputs for the fold recognition and drug design.
   Results: We propose an approach that combines support vector machines
   (SVMs) and logistic regression (LR) in a hybrid prediction method, which
   we call (H-SVM-LR) to predict beta-turns in proteins. Fractional
   polynomials are used for LR modeling. We utilize position specific
   scoring matrices (PSSMs) and predicted secondary structure (PSS) as
   features. Our simulation studies show that H-SVM-LR achieves Qtotal of
   82.87\%, 82.84\%, and 82.32\% on the BT426, BT547, and BT823 datasets
   respectively. These values are the highest among other beta-turns
   prediction methods that are based on PSSMs and secondary structure
   information. H-SVM-LR also achieves favorable performance in predicting
   beta-turns as measured by the Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) on
   these datasets. Furthermore, H-SVM-LR shows good performance when
   considering shape strings as additional features.
   Conclusions: In this paper, we present a comprehensive approach for
   beta-turns prediction. Experiments show that our proposed approach
   achieves better performance compared to other competing prediction
   methods.}},

Title = {{Peptide identification based on fuzzy classification and clustering}},
Journal = {{PROTEOME SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: The sequence database searching has been the dominant method
   for peptide identification, in which a large number of peptide spectra
   generated from LC/MS/MS experiments are searched using a search engine
   against theoretical fragmentation spectra derived from a protein
   sequences database or a spectral library. Selecting trustworthy peptide
   spectrum matches (PSMs) remains a challenge.
   Results: A novel scoring method named FC-Ranker is developed to assign a
   nonnegative weight to each target PSM based on the possibility of its
   being correct. Particularly, the scores of PSMs are updated by using a
   fuzzy SVM classification model and a fuzzy silhouette index iteratively.
   Trustworthy PSMs will be assigned high scores when the algorithm stops.
   Conclusions: Our experimental studies show that FC-Ranker outperforms
   other post-database search algorithms over a variety of datasets, and it
   can be extended to solve a general classification problem with uncertain
   labels.}},

Title = {{Detecting protein complexes from active protein interaction networks
   constructed with dynamic gene expression profiles}},
Journal = {{PROTEOME SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Protein interaction networks (PINs) are known to be useful
   to detect protein complexes. However, most available PINs are static,
   which cannot reflect the dynamic changes in real networks. At present,
   some researchers have tried to construct dynamic networks by
   incorporating time-course (dynamic) gene expression data with PINs.
   However, the inevitable background noise exists in the gene expression
   array, which could degrade the quality of dynamic networkds. Therefore,
   it is needed to filter out contaminated gene expression data before
   further data integration and analysis.
   Results: Firstly, we adopt a dynamic model-based method to filter noisy
   data from dynamic expression profiles. Then a new method is proposed for
   identifying active proteins from dynamic gene expression profiles. An
   active protein at a time point is defined as the protein the expression
   level of whose corresponding gene at that time point is higher than a
   threshold determined by a standard variance involved threshold function.
   Furthermore, a noise-filtered active protein interaction network
   (NF-APIN) is constructed. To demonstrate the efficiency of our method,
   we detect protein complexes from the NF-APIN, compared with those from
   other dynamic PINs.
   Conclusion: A dynamic model based method can effectively filter out
   noises in dynamic gene expression data. Our method to compute a
   threshold for determining the active time points of noise-filtered genes
   can make the dynamic construction more accuracy and provide a high
   quality framework for network analysis, such as protein complex
   prediction.}},

Abstract = {{In engineering practice, the space occupied by high conductivity
   materials together with the cost are the two elements of major concern.
   Therefore, seeking for more efficient designs of high conductivity
   pathways ('inserts'), embedded into a heat generating body constitutes a
   formidable challenge. The main idea of this paper is to introduce new
   patterns for the highly conductive pathways, called `fork-shaped'
   configurations. Essentially, two types of fork-shaped pathways, `F1' and
   `F2' are introduced. Numerical results demonstrate that, these two
   configurations of highly conductive pathways, remarkably surpass the
   latest configurations reported in the literature, with the same amount
   of high conductivity materials. It is further confirmed that the `peak'
   temperature can be reduced by 41\% and 46\% by using fork-shaped
   pathways of `F1' type, and `F2' type, respectively, when compared with
   the base X-shaped inserts. To highlight the discovery found in this
   paper, it is proved that if only about one third of the high
   conductivity material used for an X-shaped insert are used for the
   fork-shaped insert, the heat generating body operates at the same level
   of peak temperature associated with the new configurations. (C) 2013

Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{A small-scale single-panel liquid-to-air membrane energy exchanger
   (LAMEE) is a novel membrane based energy exchanger that allows heat and
   moisture transfer between a supply air stream and a salt solution flow
   through a semi-permeable membrane. In this paper, the steady-state
   effectiveness of the small-scale single-panel LAMEE is experimentally
   measured and numerically modeled. The numerical model is compared with
   the experimental data for summer and winter test conditions. Parameters
   those are investigated using the numerical model include membrane vapor
   diffusion resistance (VDR) and air side convective heat transfer
   coefficient. The membrane VDR in the small-scale LAMEE is measured and
   the effect of this parameter is studied for the steady-state
   effectiveness. Decreasing the membrane VDR from 56 s/m to 24 s/m
   increases the LAMEE latent effectiveness by 11\%, and as expected, it
   doesn't have any effect on the LAMEE sensible effectiveness. Enhanced
   convective heat transfer coefficient in the air flow of the small-scale
   LAMEE is calculated, and the effect of this parameter on the LAMEE
   effectiveness is investigated. The results show 138\% improvement in the
   convective heat transfer coefficient in the air channel of the LAMEE
   with an air screen at Re-air = 1570 which results in 11\% improvement in
   the LAMEE effectiveness. Finally, the modified numerical model is
   validated by the experimental data for the steady-state effectiveness of
   the small-scale LAMEE under summer test conditions at four different
   values of the thermal capacity ratio (Cr{*} = 1, 3, 5 and 7) and NTU =
   3.8. Moreover, the numerical model is used for winter test conditions,
   and the results are compared with the experimental data. The results
   show that the numerical model agrees with the experimental data for the
   latent and total effectiveness of the LAMEE under the air heating and
   humidifying and air heating and dehumidifying test conditions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Chinese solar greenhouse is the most common protected horticulture
   facility in China. The design of solar greenhouses has been evolving but
   few designs were based on solid engineering analyses and extensive field
   testing. This article analyzed three aspects that contribute to their
   good thermal performance: high solar transmittance of the South facing
   roof due to limited structural and equipment shading, interception and
   heat buffering of solar radiation by opaque walls and ground, and good
   insulation of the North facing roof wall, and sidewalls. A mathematical
   model is presented to predict and evaluate the thermal environment of
   solar greenhouses. The model is based on the heat balance and the heat
   exchange between the system components. Simulations and analyses using
   the solar greenhouse model suggest the following: I) materials with good
   heat insulation should be used for the outer layer of walls, and those
   with high thermal conductivity and volumetric specific heat should be
   used for the inner layer, 2) the gained benefits in terms of air
   temperature and heat flows released from walls to the inside air start
   to become marginal as the wall thickness increases, and 3)by lowering
   indoor ground the thermal environment of solar greenhouses can be
   greatly improved. An optimal wall thickness can be determined by
   weighing the improvements of the thermal environment against the
   increase in cost associated with material selection and construction.}},

Abstract = {{Electrostatic charges accumulated on wood particles through
   triboelectrification during their transportation and handling processes
   can cause hazardous electrical discharge which may further trigger dust
   explosion. In this work, tribo-charging behavior of different kinds of
   wood particles was investigated by a vibrating plate charging method. It
   was found that reduction in the work function difference between contact
   bodies might contribute to the reduction of tribo-charge generation,
   while the reduction of electrical resistivity of wood pellets could
   effectively accelerate the charge dissipation. As the particle size
   decreases, accumulated charges increase significantly. In contrast,
   higher moisture content of wood particles leads to lower charge
   accumulation due to an accelerated charge dissipation rate.
   Tribo-charging behaviors of white pellets, torrefied pellet, steam
   treated pellets and dark pellets have also been investigated. Compared
   to the white pellets, they all have shown a reduction on charge
   accumulation to some extent. However, results suggested that all of them
   have nearly equivalent tribo-charge density as coal and wheat grains

Abstract = {{The transport of patches of ionization across the polar cap is carried
   by the convection electric field, which imposes an ExB drift to the
   plasma. This drift has an upward component when the plasma is convected
   toward the north magnetic pole and a downward component as it moves away
   from the pole. The vertical motion modulates the rate at which
   recombination operates, which in turn is directly related to the
   luminosity of the patches. We show here that if a rapid increase in the
   electric field produces a downward velocity in excess of 10 m/s, the
   luminosity of the patches will at first increase before undergoing a
   marked decrease, in association with an increase in the recombination
   rates. Both the change in luminosity and the time scale for the
   temporary increase primarily depend on the vertical velocity, that is,
   on the strength of the convection electric field and on the magnetic
   latitude. Increases in luminosity by up to a factor of 2 or more are
   possible. The time scales for the variations are of the order of 10 to
   20 min. We present an example of an actual luminosity modulation
   obtained over Resolute Bay, Canada, that agrees well with the proposed
   theory.}},

Abstract = {{We present data from nighttime sounding rocket flights in the low
   latitude E region. The payloads carried a sweeping Langmuir probe, a
   plasma impedance probe, andelectric field probes. A detailed examination
   of the plasma density, temperature, and electric field measurements show
   two strong sporadic E (E-s) layers with very high electron temperatures
   (approximate to 1000 K) on each side of the upper layer. The lower layer
   was consistent with the presence of a strong zonal neutral wind shear.
   The upper layer was strongly influenced by the presence of a strongly
   negative vertical electric field, with zonal winds and their shears also
   contributing. A strong downward motion of the plasma from the combined
   action of the downward electric field and negative zonal wind advected
   the upper layer far below the region of maximum growth. We have
   attributed the more puzzling high electron temperatures to frictional
   heating from parallel currents and shown that the F region nighttime
   dynamo could easily generate the necessary parallel current densities
   (1Am(-2)) near the electron density troughs. The electron temperature
   was also elevated in the E-s layers themselves, implying parallel
   current densities of the order of 15Am(-2) around the E-s peaks. Those
   parallel currents were attributed to strong Hall current divergences
   driven by the zonal electric field around the E-s peaks.}},

Title = {{Flow above the free end of a surface-mounted finite-height circular
   cylinder: A review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{41-63}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The wake of a surface-mounted finite-height circular cylinder and the
   associated vortex patterns are strongly dependent on the cylinder aspect
   ratio and the thickness of the boundary layer on the ground plane
   relative to the dimensions of the cylinder. Above a critical aspect
   ratio, the mean wake is characterized by streamwise tip vortex
   structures and Karman vortex shedding from the sides of the cylinder.
   Below a critical aspect ratio, a unique mean wake structure is observed.
   Recent experimental studies in the literature that used phase-averaged
   techniques, as well as recent numerical simulations, have led to an
   improved physical understanding of the near-wake vortex flow patterns.
   However, the flow above the free end of the finite circular cylinder,
   and its relationship to the near wake, has not been systematically
   studied. The effects of aspect ratio and boundary layer thickness on the
   free-end flow field are also not completely understood, nor has the
   influence of Reynolds number on the free-end flow field been fully
   explored. Common features associated with the free end include
   separation from the leading edge, a mean recirculation zone containing a
   prominent cross-stream arch (or mushroom) vortex, and reattachment onto
   the free-surface. Other flow features that remain to be clarified
   include a separation bubble near the leading edge, one or two
   cross-stream vortices within this separation bubble, the origins of the
   streamwise tip or trailing vortices, and various critical points in the
   near-surface flow topology. This paper reviews the current understanding
   of the flow above the free end of a surface-mounted finite-height
   circular cylinder, with a focus on models of the flow field, surface oil
   flow visualization studies, pressure and heat flux distributions on the
   free-end surface, measurements of the local velocity field, and
   numerical simulations, found in the literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Redox potential (ORP) plays a pivotal role in yeast viability and
   ethanol production during very-high-gravity (VHG) ethanol fermentation.
   In order to identify the correlation between redox potential profiles
   and gene expression patterns, global gene expression of Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae was investigated. Results indicated that significant changes
   in gene expression occurred at the periods of 0 - 6 h and 30 - 36 h,
   respectively. Changes noted in the period of 0 - 6 h were mainly related
   to carbohydrate metabolism. In contrast, gene expression variation at 30
   - 36 h could be attributed primarily to stress response. Although CDC19
   was down-regulated, expression of PYK2, PDC6 and ADH2 correlated
   inversely with ORP. Meanwhile, expression of GPD1 decreased due to the
   depletion of dissolved oxygen in the fermentation broth, but expression
   of GPD2 correlated with ORP. Transcription of genes encoding heat shock
   proteins was characterized by uphill, downhill, valley and plateau
   expression profiles, accordingly to specific function in stress
   response. These results highlight the role of ORP in modulating yeast
   physiology and metabolism under VHG conditions.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{Radiant panel systems have one of the highest technical energy savings
   compared to other HVAC systems and they achieve high comfort levels.
   However, they are unable to maintain the indoor relative humidity as
   they only transfer sensible heat. In order to overcome this problem, a
   novel heat and moisture transfer panel (HAMP) is developed and tested.
   In this paper, the applicability of the HAMP is tested using the TRNSYS
   simulation program. The impact of the HAMP on space relative humidity is
   investigated by modeling a one-storey office building in four North
   American cities (Chicago, Miami, Phoenix, and Saskatoon) as
   representatives of four major climatic conditions. The validity of the
   HAMP and resulting energy savings is represented and compared against
   the same building operating with two other HVAC systems: a conventional
   all-air system and a radiant ceiling panel (RCP) system with 100\%
   outdoor air. The HAMP is able to control the relative humidity in the
   building between 25\% RH and 60\% RH in Chicago, Saskatoon, and Phoenix,
   and between 40\% RH and 62\% RH in Miami. The results also show the
   potential of the RCP system with the HAMP to reduce the total energy
   consumed by the conventional all-air system in different climates. (C)

Abstract = {{A new test facility was developed to assess the performance of a
   small-scale single-panel liquid-to-air membrane energy exchanger
   (LAMEE). Mass and energy balances of the exchanger were computed for
   each test. The steady-state performance of the small-scale LAMEE was
   experimentally investigated under different operating conditions. Water
   was used as a liquid transfer media for the experiments and the
   exchanger was tested for air heating and humidifying (H\&H), air cooling
   and humidifying (C\&H), and air cooling and dehumidifying (C\&D) at
   three different NTU values (2.5, 3.5 and 4.5) and Cr{*} = 7. The
   experimental results were compared to results from a numerical and two
   analytical models. In most cases, reasonable agreement among the
   experimental, numerical and analytical results was achieved except for
   the sensible effectiveness in the H\&H and latent and total
   effectiveness in the C\&H test cases. The results showed that the
   effectiveness of the small-scale LAMEE always increased with NTU for all
   test conditions. Sensible and latent effectiveness contour maps of the
   small-scale LAMEE were generated numerically for different inlet air
   conditions and for NTU = 3.5 and Cr{*} = 7, while the water inlet
   temperature was set at 22 degrees C. Finally, the effectiveness contour

   conducted for all biomass and pyrolysis products including bio-char,
   bio-oil and gas phase. Saw dust and wheat straw showed the largest
   cellulose and lignin contents (37.7 and 20.8 wt\%, respectively).
   Poultry litter had the highest ash content (12.3 wt\%). Amount of
   bio-oil collected from liquid product increased by an increase in the
   pyrolysis temperature for wheat straw and poultry litter. Total acid
   number of bio-oil product decreased by an increase in the pyrolysis
   temperature. Carbon content of bio-char was in the range of 70-81 wt\%
   which was much larger than that for original biomass. The pH for
   bio-chars derived from the wheat straw and poultry litter was in the
   range of bases. For all samples, the concentrations of CH4 and H-2 in
   the gas phase increased with an increase in the pyrolysis temperature.

Abstract = {{Biochar is a major product obtained from conversion of biogenic waste
   via pyrolysis, which is recognized to have both bioenergy and remarkable
   environmental benefits. This biochar is mainly composed of aromatic
   carbon with several degrees of aromaticity. The effectiveness of biochar
   produced from three different biomass species such as wheat straw,
   timothy grass and pinewood was estimated through two different
   conversion scenarios. The first scenario employed slow heating rate
   (SHR) to generate biochars that had an advantage of high yields and a
   limitation of producing relatively low-energy product. The second
   scenario employed high heating rate (HHR) pyrolysis with low yields of
   biochar and pyrolysis gas, and higher yields of bio-oil. HEIR pyrolysis
   produced substantially high-energy products (bio-oils), while SHR
   pyrolysis resulted in high amount of biochars with agronomic values. The
   HHR and SHR biochars were characterized physiochemically through CHNS,
   ICP-MS, SEM, Raman spectroscopy, FT-IR, TG-DTG and XRD analysis. The
   composition of N, P, K, Na, Ca and Mg was retained in higher amounts in
   SHR biochars. The highly alkaline nature of SHR biochars indicated their
   application to croplands for increasing crop yield and soil fertility.

Title = {{Transformation of sulfur during pyrolysis of inertinite-rich coals and
   correlation with their characteristics}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{585-592}},

Abstract = {{Sulfur transformation of inertinite-rich coals, which were sampled from
   three Western China coal mines, Xinjiang Hami (HM), Ningxia Lingwu (LW)
   and Shendong (SD), during pyrolysis is studied through measuring the
   release of H2S and COS gases by gas chromatography with flame
   photometric detector and through analyzing the sulfur forms in raw coals
   and chars from pyrolysis by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). It is
   revealed that the transformation of sulfur during coal pyrolysis is
   closely linked with coal properties, such as the vitrinite/inertinite
   ratio, alkaline mineral contents (especially calcium compounds) and H/C
   atomic ratio for three inertinite-rich coals. Comparisons are performed
   with a coal sample taken from Pingsuo (PS) coal mine located in North
   China, of which the properties are significantly different. The maximal
   release temperature of sulfur-containing gases for the pyrolysis of
   inertinite-rich coal is higher than that of the PS coal. The release of
   the S-containing gases in inertinite-rich coals has a maximal
   temperature interval around 600 degrees C and this is associated with
   the conversions of inorganic sulfur species, such as pyrite transforming
   to FeS observed by the XAS in chars of these coals. During the process
   of pyrolysis, the organic sulfur compounds in inertinite-rich coal can
   be oxidized to form sulfoxide-like species due to the decomposition of
   oxygen-containing function groups in the coal matrix, but the active
   sulfur in PS coal can react with fresh char to form relatively stable
   thiophene structures. The formation of COS during the pyrolysis of
   inertinite-rich coals is mainly due to secondary reactions between H2S
   with CO and/or CO2. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Levulinic acid (LA) has been recognized as a versatile building block

   preferential order to yield n-butyl levulinate was found to be: H-BEA >
   H-Y > H-ZSM-5 > H-MOR. Further, a study for optimizing the reaction
   conditions such as acid to n-butanol molar ratio, reaction time and

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two designs of optimal nonuniformed constellations
   for decode-and-forward wireless relay networks with an orthogonal
   space-time block code (STBC). The first design is concerned with the
   unequal error protection issue, in which two data streams to be
   transmitted from a source to a destination are protected at two
   different levels. The design is to minimize the bit error rate (BER) of
   one stream while maintaining the BER of the other stream to be no larger
   than a given threshold. Based on a simple approximation of the average
   BER, a design parameter is obtained in closed form. The second design
   focuses on minimizing the average BER of the combined data stream at the
   destination. Developed are two near-optimal designs for 4/16-quadrature
   amplitude modulation (QAM) and 4/64-QAM hierarchical modulation (HM)
   schemes. The designs are also extended to two-way relay networks where
   both the source and the destination have data to transmit to each other.
   Simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed designs and
   the advantages of relay-assisted transmission employing HM over
   conventional point-to-point transmission. A comparison with the existing
   relay-assisted transmission model is also discussed.}},

   oil, referred to as tuna-FFA contained 26 \% DHA. For
   purification/concentration of DHA in free fatty acids, selective
   esterification of the fatty acid mixtures with butanol was carried out
   using ROL in a water-organic solvent system. The best reaction
   parameters found in this study were pH 7, temperature 35 A degrees C,
   agitation speed 800 rpm and a fatty acid to solvent (iso-octane) ratio
   of 1:1.32 (w/v). Also, the effects of other parameters such as type of
   alcohol, type of enzyme, alcohol to fatty acid ratio, enzyme to fatty
   acid ratio were studied to determine the most suitable reaction

Abstract = {{This study investigates the optical properties of selected metal oxides
   due to their high dielectric constants. The local-spin-density
   approximation plus Hubbard U (commonly called LDA+U) is used in a study
   of the structural, mechanical and optical properties of UO2. The
   inclusion of a Hubbard U correction to 5f electrons of uranium changes
   UO2 from a metal to an insulator and, therefore, has a dramatic effect
   on the localisation of the electron spin and charge density of uranium.
   However although the band gap can be reproduced using the effective U
   parameter, which is equal to 3.5 eV and optical properties were
   calculated in our previous work, it is difficult to calculate ionic
   contribution to the static dielectric constant within LDA+U formalism
   for this compound. It is shown in the present work that the electronic
   structures of both ceria and thoria exhibit similarities to urania
   within LDA or PBE functional implementations. Within this functional and
   linear response theory one can easily calculate static dielectric
   permittivity and it is shown that in agreement with experiment the
   predicted values are an order of magnitude larger than the dielectric
   constant of SiO2. In this work, high accuracy, first-principles
   calculations are also used to compare properties of urania versus ceria
   and thoria and how these similarities can help in understanding these
   compounds. It is also shown that the B3LYP functional predicts slightly
   overestimated band gaps for ceria and thoria as well as smaller than
   experimentally observed electronic contribution to the static dielectric
   constant, while the index of refraction is well reproduced for thoria.

Abstract = {{The efficiency of decimal digit-recurrence division algorithms is
   totally affected by the number representations of the quotient, the
   divisor and partial remainders participated in quotient digit selection
   (QDS). This paper establishes general rules and conditions for QDS with
   operands represented in the generalized signed-digit format. As a result
   of this generalization, a universal convergence condition is introduced
   which obviates the unnecessary conservatism of previous algorithms and
   hence paves the way for more correct and efficient decimal division
   hardware designs. It is also concluded that keeping the partial
   remainders in minimally redundant symmetric signed-digit representation
   (with digit-set {[}-5,6])and applying into QDS the divisor represented
   in minimally asymmetric non-redundant signed-digit format (with
   digit-set {[}-4,5]) lead to the smallest minimum precision required, of
   the divisor and the partial remainder, for QDS and thus faster and
   simpler division algorithm. Moreover, it is shown that even in case of
   using non-redundant partial remainders (for the sake of lower area
   cost); minimally asymmetric signed-digit representation brings about
   more efficiency. The suggested representations are applied to the
   fastest previous decimal digit-recurrence divider and 10 \% speed-up is
   achieved while keeping the area cost approximately unaltered.}},

Abstract = {{Wheat Dried distiller's grain (DDG), a coproduct from the ethanol
   production process, is rich in potentially health-promoting phenolic
   compounds. In the extraction of phenolic compounds from DDG, the DDG
   cell wall is an important barrier for mass transfer from the inside to
   the outside of the cell. The effect of high-power ultrasound
   pretreatment on destruction of DDG cell walls and extraction yield and
   rate was investigated. Direct sonication by an ultrasound probe horn at
   24 kHz was applied and factors such as ultrasound power and treatment
   time were investigated. The method of nitrogen (N-2) adsorption at 77 K
   was used as a means to determine and compare the changes in physical
   properties (specific surface area, pore volume and pore size) of the
   treated samples at different levels of ultrasound power and treatment
   time. Increasing specific surface area, pore volume and pore size caused
   by ultrasonic treatment implied development of new or larger pores and
   damaged cell walls. Also, it was observed that the ultrasound
   pretreatment of DDG particles increased the extraction yield and rate of
   phenolic compounds from DDG by 14.29\%. Among tested ultrasound
   conditions, 100\% ultrasound power for 30 s was evaluated as the best
   pretreatment condition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   magnetization curves show ferromagnetic contributions for all samples at
   both 5 K and room temperature, decreasing with increasing the Ag
   concentration. First principles modeling of the possible configurations
   of Co-Ag defects suggests the formation of nano-clusters around
   interstitial Co impurity as the origin of the ferromagnetism. The Ag
   co-doping results in a decrease of the total spin of these clusters and

   This double nitride consists of an uncharged three-dimensional network

Abstract = {{In this paper, biosorbents based on canola meal obtained after protein
   extraction were developed to adsorb water from ethanol-water vapor
   mixture in a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process. It was
   demonstrated that through the process over 99 wt \% fuel grade ethanol
   was achieved from lower grade feeds containing 80-95 wt \% ethanol at
   90-110 degrees C and 136-243 kPa. The breakthrough curve technique was
   used to investigate the adsorption dynamics and equilibrium. The effects
   of temperature, pressure, vapor feed concentration, and adsorbent
   particle size on water and ethanol uptake and separation factor were
   examined. External water mass transfer coefficients were also
   calculated. The model based on Dubinin-Polanyi potential theory fit the
   water adsorption isotherms reasonably well. The mean free energy of
   water adsorption was calculated to be 0.04 kJ/mol, and heat of
   adsorption was -35.81 kJ/mol, which indicated the physical nature of the
   adsorption. Water saturated canola meal biosorbents were regenerated at
   90 degrees C under vacuum and reused.}},

Title = {{Ammonia loading rate: an effective variable to control partial
   nitrification and generate the anaerobic ammonium oxidation influent}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{2907-U80}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) is an innovative process for the
   treatment of ammonia-contaminated waters. ANNAMOX is usually preceded by
   a nitrifying step in which ammonia is partially oxidized to nitrite. The
   effectiveness of the overall process depends on control of the
   nitrification and creation of a suitable influent for ANAMMOX. In this
   work, impacts of ammonia concentration and loading rate on partial
   nitrification and composition of the resulting effluent were
   investigated in continuous stirred tank (CSTR) and biofilm reactors fed
   with various ammonia concentrations (17.6-61.5mM; 299-1045ppm).
   Regardless of ammonia concentration, loading rates from 3.1 to 5.4mM/h
   in the CSTR and 6.4-12.1mM/h in the biofilm reactor generated effluents
   with nitrite to ammonia ratios of 1.2 +/- 0.3 (suitable ANAMMOX
   influent). Under these conditions, the highest ammonia loading and
   nitrite production rates in the CSTR and biofilm reactors were 5.4 and
   2.5mM/h (HRT: 3.7h) and 12.1 and 6.5mM/h (HRT: 1.6h), respectively.
   Results reveal that ammonia loading rate can be used effectively to
   achieve suitable ANAMMOX influent without the need for precise control
   of dissolved oxygen (DO). Considering the difficulty in regulating DO in
   large-scale systems and the need for the nitrifying process to be
   flexible with respect to various ammonia concentrations, the loading
   rate appears to be a practical option to control partial nitrification.
   Verifying the range of ammonia loading rates that generate ANAMMOX
   influent allows operation of the nitrifying step with any level of
   ammonia in the feed, with the proper loading rate achieved through
   adjustment of hydraulic residence time.}},

Abstract = {{The flow above the free ends of surface-mounted finite-height circular
   cylinders and square prisms was studied experimentally using particle
   image velocimetry (PIV). Cylinders and prisms with aspect ratios of AR =
   9, 7, 5, and 3 were tested at a Reynolds number of Re = 4.2 x 10(4). The
   bodies were mounted normal to a ground plane and were partially immersed
   in a turbulent zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer, where the boundary
   layer thickness relative to the body width was delta/D = 1.6. PIV
   measurements were made above the free ends of the bodies in a vertical
   plane aligned with the flow centreline. The present PIV results provide
   insight into the effects of aspect ratio and body shape on the
   instantaneous flow field. The recirculation zone under the separated
   shear layer is larger for the square prism of AR = 3 compared to the
   more slender prism of AR = 9. Also, for a square prism with low aspect
   ratio (AR = 3), the influence of the reverse flow over the free end
   surface becomes more significant compared to that for a higher aspect
   ratio (AR = 9). For the circular cylinder, a cross-stream vortex forms
   within the recirculation zone. As the aspect ratio of the cylinder
   decreases, the reattachment point of the separated flow on the free end
   surface moves closer to the trailing edge. For both the square prism and
   circular cylinder cases, the instantaneous velocity vector field and
   associated in-plane vorticity field revealed small-scale structures
   mostly generated by the separated shear layer. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) plays an important role in
   pre-clinical imaging. The radiation from micro-CT can result in excess
   radiation exposure to the specimen under test, hence the reduction of
   radiation from micro-CT is essential. The proposed research focused on
   analyzing and testing an alternating direction augmented Lagrangian
   (ADAL) algorithm to recover images from random projections using total
   variation (TV) regularization. The use of TV regularization in
   compressed sensing problems makes the recovered image quality sharper by
   preserving the edges or boundaries more accurately. In this work TV
   regularization problem is addressed by ADAL which is a variant of the
   classic augmented Lagrangian method for structured optimization. The
   per-iteration computational complexity of the algorithm is two fast
   Fourier transforms, two matrix vector multiplications and a linear time
   shrinkage operation. Comparison of experimental results indicate that
   the proposed algorithm is stable, efficient and competitive with the
   existing algorithms for solving TV regularization problems. (C) 2013

   back-to-back RFA analyzers aligned along the toroidal magnetic field
   lines to measure the downstream and upstream ion temperatures. The true
   ion temperature was obtained by averaging the two temperatures. RFA
   measurements on HL-2A have consistently reported ion temperatures higher
   than electron temperature with ion-to-electron temperature ratios in the
   range 1-3. The entrance slit plates of the RFA were used as Mach probes
   for plasma flow measurements, a first among published RFA experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of this research was the characterization of the
   microstructure and texture of functionally graded nickel-Al2O3 nano
   composite coating. This coating was produced by changing the duty cycle
   under ultrasonic agitation during pulse deposition process. All of the
   electrodeposited layers were prepared at 20 A.dm(-2) peak current
   density and constant frequency of 10 Hz, and the duty cycle has been
   changed from 90\% at the first layer to 10\% at the fifth layer.
   According to SEM images and EBSD results, all layers except the last one
   showed a truncated pyramidal structure which is a typical morphology for
   Ni deposited coatings with {[}100] preferred texture. The last layer
   which was prepared at duty cycle of 10\% exhibited a cauliflower (or
   colony) structure with small grains that probably resulted in random
   texture in this layer. EDS results showed more alumina particles can be
   incorporated at lower duty cycles. Foreign ions incorporation during the
   deposition process could be the reason for a change of {[}100] fiber
   texture to almost random orientation of grains. This rather high
   incorporation is due to either lower current density or higher OFF-Time
   duration at low duty cycles in pulse plating process. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{As the permittivity of dielectric resonators decreases, it becomes
   difficult to feed the dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs) using direct
   microstrip lines. The variation of the resonant input resistance with
   the feed location becomes smaller, while the maximum achievable peak
   resistance dramatically drops to lower than 50 Omega in most cases. To
   satisfy the impedance matching, field matching, improve coupling to
   low-permittivity dielectric resonators, and further increase the antenna
   bandwidth associated with the dominant mode, without disturbing
   far-field properties, tapered microstrip line-fed DRAs are proposed,
   designed, fabricated and evaluated in this communication. Both
   measurements and simulation investigations are presented and the results
   are compared with other forms of microstrip feed lines. The impedance
   bandwidth can be 75\% larger than the bandwidth achieved by the
   step-shape microstrip-fed DRA. Symmetrical radiation patterns with low
   cross-polarization levels (lower than -22 dB) and a gain ranging from
   4.9 to 6.8 dBi, within the impedance bandwidth of the antenna, are
   observed in the measurements. It is also shown that the proximity
   coupled tapered microstrip line is an ideal feeding for
   high-permittivity DRAs in situations where the microstrip line cannot be
   positioned underneath the dielectric resonator. To verify, one such
   antenna is designed, simulated and experimentally investigated,
   obtaining satisfactory results.}},

Abstract = {{A class of industrial-grade biolubricants was synthesized from methyl
   oleate and canola (Brassica napus) biodiesel by transesterification with
   trimethylolpropane (TMP) using sodium methoxide as catalyst. Model
   transesterification reactions were performed with methyl oleate to
   optimize the reaction conditions to obtain maximum yield of TMP
   trioleate. Methyl oleate-derived biolubricant with TMP triester
   composition of 91.2\% was obtained after 5 h. Under similar reaction
   conditions, canola biodiesel-derived biolubricant comprising of 90.9\%
   of TMP triesters was obtained. Both biolubricants were evaluated for
   their tribological properties using ASTM and AOCS standards. They
   exhibited very high viscosity indices, excellent low temperature
   properties and moderate oxidative stabilities. The lubricity of the
   biolubricants was tested on a High Frequency Reciprocating Rig (HFRR)
   apparatus by measuring wear scar diameter on a test sample. Canola
   biodiesel-derived biolubricant was found to perform better than methyl
   oleate-derived biolubricant based on HFRR test. Both biolubricants met
   ISO VG 46 specifications. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Estuaries have been described as one of the most difficult environments
   on Earth. It is difficult to know how to treat the combined wastewater
   in tidal rivers at the estuary, where the situation is very different
   from ordinary fresh water rivers. Waste oyster shell was used as the
   active filler in this study in a bio-contact oxidation tank to treat the
   combined wastewater at the Fengtang Tidal River. With a
   middle-experimental scale of 360 m(3)/day, the average removal
   efficiency of COD, BOD, NH3-N, TP and TSS was 80.05\%, 85.02\%, 86.59\%,
   50.58\% and 85.32\%, respectively, in this bio-contact oxidation
   process. The living microbes in the biofilms on the waste oyster shell
   in this bio-contact oxidation tank, which were mainly composed of
   zoogloea, protozoa and micro-metazoa species, revealed that waste oyster
   shell as the filler was suitable material for combined wastewater
   degradation. This treatment method using waste oyster shell as active
   filler was then applied in a mangrove demonstration area for water
   quality improvement near the experiment area, with a treatment volume of
   5 x 10(3) m(3)/day. Another project was also successfully applied in a
   constructed wetland, with a wastewater treatment volume of 1 x 10(3)
   m(3)/day. This technology is therefore feasible and can easily be
   applied on a larger scale.}},

Abstract = {{Stability is essential for designing and controlling any dynamic
   systems. Recently, the stability of genetic regulatory networks has been
   widely studied by employing linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach,
   which results in checking the existence of feasible solutions to
   high-dimensional LMIs. In the previous study, the authors present
   several stability conditions for genetic regulatory networks with
   time-varying delays, based on M-matrix theory and using the non-smooth
   Lyapunov function, which results in determining whether a
   low-dimensional matrix is a non-singular M-matrix. However, the previous
   approach cannot be applied to analyse the stability of genetic
   regulatory networks with noise perturbations. Here, the authors design a
   smooth Lyapunov function quadratic in state variables and employ
   M-matrix theory to derive new stability conditions for genetic
   regulatory networks with time-varying delays. Theoretically, these
   conditions are less conservative than existing ones in some genetic
   regulatory networks. Then the results are extended to genetic regulatory
   networks with time-varying delays and noise perturbations. For genetic
   regulatory networks with n genes and n proteins, the derived conditions
   are to check if an n x n matrix is a non-singular M-matrix. To further
   present the new theories proposed in this study, three example
   regulatory networks are analysed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the performance of differential

   of the wireless channels, a new set of combining weights is proposed for
   signal detection at the destination. Expression of pairwise error
   probability (PEP) is provided and used to obtain the approximated total
   average bit error rate (BER). It is shown that the performance of the
   system is related to the autocorrelation of the direct and cascaded
   channels and an irreducible error floor exists at a high signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) region. The new weights lead to a better performance when
   compared with the conventional combining scheme. Computer simulation is
   carried out in different scenarios to support the analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Energy recovery from exhaust air to condition or partly condition
   outdoor ventilation air has been proved to be an effective method for
   building energy conservation and is now required in many building Codes
   and ASHRAE Standards for most commercial buildings. Nonetheless,
   existing energy recovery ventilators encounter some challenges in
   practical applications, such as: low exchanger effectiveness and system
   COP, requirement of adjacent air streams for most exchangers,
   elimination of cross-contamination between supply and exhaust air, and
   the avoidance of downstream airborne drift of liquid exchanger coupling
   fluids. A new kind of liquid-to-air membrane energy exchanger (LAMEE)
   has been under development in the Thermal Science Laboratory at the
   University of Saskatchewan, and progress has been made on the research
   and applications of LAMEEs in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
   (HVAC) systems in the past 10 years. The present paper gives a summary
   of this research. Specifically, properties and selections of
   semi-permeable membranes and desiccant solutions were studied. Design,
   steady-state and transient performance of single LAMEEs were
   investigated. Much attention has also been paid to energy and economic
   performance of run-around membrane energy exchanger (RAMEE) systems
   (typically consisting of two LAMEEs) for passive energy recovery in
   building HVAC systems. Related control and optimization methods for
   RAMEEs have been developed for some configurations. The application of
   IAMEEs in liquid desiccant air-conditioning systems as active
   dehumidifiers and regenerators has been studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Welfare and meat quality of market-weight pigs may be negatively
   affected by transport duration and environmental temperatures, which
   vary considerably between seasons. This study evaluated the effects of 3
   transport durations (6, 12, and 18 h) on the physiology and behavior of
   pigs in summer and winter in western Canada. Market-weight pigs were
   transported using a pot-belly trailer at an average loading density of
   0.375 m(2)/100 kg. Four replicates of each transport duration were
   conducted during each season. Heart rate and gastrointestinal tract
   temperature (GTT) were monitored from loading to unloading in 16 pigs
   from 4 selected trailer compartments (n = 96 groups, total of 384
   animals, BW = 120.8 +/- 0.4 kg), namely top front (C1), top back (C4),
   middle front (C5), and bottom rear (C10). Behavior was recorded for pigs
   (948 and 924 animals, in summer and winter, respectively) in C1, C4, and
   C5 during transportation (standing, sitting, lying), and during 90 min
   in lairage (sitting, lying, drinking, latency to rest) for pigs in all 4
   compartments. Transport was split into 7 periods: loading, pre-travel
   (PT), initial travel (IT), pre-arrival 1 (PA1) and 2 (PA2), unloading,
   and lairage. During IT and PA2, pigs spent less time lying in winter
   than summer (P < 0.05 and P < 0.05, respectively). During PA1, PA2, and
   unloading, a greater (P < 0.001) heart rate was found in pigs
   transported in winter compared with summer. During PA2, pigs subjected
   to the 18-h transport treatment in winter had a greater (P < 0.05) GTT
   than the other groups. In lairage, pigs transported for 18 h in winter
   drank more (P < 0.001) and took longer to rest (P < 0.01) than pigs from
   other groups. During PA1, pigs transported for 18 h had the greatest GTT
   (P < 0.001). At unloading, pigs transported for 6 h had the lowest GTT
   (P < 0.001). In lairage, pigs transported for 18 h spent less time lying
   than those transported for 6 or 12 h (P < 0.001). These results suggest
   that in winter, pigs increased their metabolism and were reluctant to
   rest on cold floors. Pigs transported for 18 h in winter showed greater
   evidence of thirst. It may be concluded that under western Canadian
   climatic conditions, long transports (18 h) in cold weather appear to be
   more detrimental to pig welfare.}},

   study}},
Journal = {{SOLID STATE SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In severe nuclear accident scenarios (in air environments and high
   temperatures) UO2 fuel pellets oxidise to produce uranium oxides with
   higher oxygen content, e.g., U4O9 or U3O8. As a first step in
   investigating the microstructural changes following UO2 oxidation to
   hexagonal high temperature phase of U3O8, density functional quantum
   mechanical calculations of the structure, elastic properties and
   electronic structure of U3O8 have been performed. The calculated
   properties of hexagonal phase of U3O8 are compared to those of the
   orthorhombic pseudo-hexagonal phase which is stable at room temperature.
   The total energy technique based on the local density approximation plus
   Hubbard U as implemented in the CASTEP code is used to investigate
   changes in the lattice constants. The first-principles calculations
   predict a 35-42\% increase in volume per uranium atom as a result of the
   transformation from UO2 to U3O8, in agreement with experimental data.
   The implications of this prediction on the linear expansion and
   fragmentation of fuel are discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{We report the use of samarium-doped (Sm3+) fluoroaluminate and
   fluorophosphate glasses for X-ray imaging. Incident X-rays convert
   samarium ions from the trivalent to the divalent state on a
   semi-permanent but erasable basis. Of the three fluorophosphate glass
   compositions investigated, that with the smallest fraction of phosphate
   bonds showed the greatest conversion, but fluoroaluminate glass showed
   better conversion than any of them. The effects of polyvalent co-dopants
   Ce, Eu, Pb, Sn, and In, (which may potentially act as electron donors or
   acceptors) on the conversion efficiency were investigated in
   fluoroaluminate glass, and whilst In and Sn inhibit the conversion, none
   of the co-dopants produced significant enhancement. The valence
   conversion may be used for X-ray imaging through the photoluminescence
   of the X-ray generated Sm2+ ions. With an optimal choice of the
   excitation wavelength and appropriate optical filtration in the
   camera-based recording system, very high-resolution X-ray imaging can be
   achieved. Recorded images show resolved detail down to the level of 25
   mu m, and the measured modulation transfer function extends out to 11
   line pairs/mm. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One of the key parameters and most difficult challenges related to
   Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) is the exact measurement of radiation
   dose delivered. The approach presented here is based on the conversion
   of the oxidation state of samarium ions (embedded in a suitable glass
   host) upon exposure to high energy radiation. The conversion from Sm3+
   to Sm2+ under the effect of high x-ray irradiation doses has been
   studied in four oxyfluoride glasses based on Ca, Mg, Sr and Ba. These
   glasses can easily be prepared in air, contrary to pure fluoride
   glasses. They provide good transparency in the visible range, essential
   for analysis by confocal microscopy. Only the Mg-based glasses exhibited
   a clear conversion of Sm3+ to Sm2+ under x-ray exposure; and hence show
   potential for use as MRT dosimetry. The conversion did not saturate even
   up to similar to 20 kGy (dose in air at the sample surface) under a 50
   keV synchrotron beam. Further, we were able to determine the spatial
   dose profile of the x-ray beam through confocal fluoroscopic microscopy;
   and the dose profile matched closely that from the Monte Carlo
   simulation. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{If properly designed, the use of a linear precoder can achieve the
   maximum coding gain and diversity order in bit-interleaved coded
   modulation with multiple-input multiple-output systems. However, such
   maximum coding gain and diversity order are compromised under the
   practical scenario of having imperfect channel state information (CSI)
   at the receiver. To alleviate the impact of imperfect CSI on the coding
   gain and diversity order, joint linear precoder and training pattern are
   designed in this paper. The design is carried out by considering both
   the pairwise error probability and the mean square error of the channel
   estimator. The effectiveness of the proposed design is illustrated by
   comparing its performance with the performance obtained when only the
   training pattern is designed for an precoder optimized under the perfect
   CSI. In particular, simulation results show that a dB gain is achieved

Abstract = {{GeO2 nanocrystal (NC) thin films were deposited on Si substrate using a
   magnetron sputtering method and irradiated with swift heavy ions of 80
   MeV Ni at various fluences ranging from 5 x 10(12) to 1 x 10(14)
   ions/cm(2). Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction measurements indicate
   the decrease in average size of NCs with increase in fluence of ion
   irradiation. Micro-Raman spectroscopy studies show clearly the formation
   of Ge NCs with the increase of irradiation fluence. Field emission
   scanning electron microscopy was employed to study the morphology and
   modifications in NCs due to ion irradiation. Transmission electron
   microscopy measurement of the ion-irradiated sample at 1 x 10(14)
   ions/cm(2) confirmed the presence of few nm-sized Ge NCs, which were not
   observed in as-deposited sample. The overall results suggest that GeO2
   NCs are reduced in size and few of them are converted into Ge NCs due to
   the effects of electronic energy deposition by the irradiating ions.
   This formation of Ge NCs in the ion-irradiated GeO2 NC thin films has
   been understood on the basis of irradiation-induced separation of oxygen
   from GeO2 NCs. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A green and environmentally friendly one step process for the
   preparation of bio-lubricant from epoxy canola oil is described in the
   present investigation. This study deals with simultaneous epoxy ring
   opening and esterification of epoxy canola oil in the presence of acetic
   anhydride using novel sulfated Ti-SBA-15(10) catalyst. Optimum reaction
   conditions were obtained by studying various reaction parameters such as
   agitation speed, acetic anhydride effect, catalyst loading, and
   temperature. Sulfated Ti-SBA-15(10) demonstrated 100\% conversion of
   epoxy canola oil to the esterified product (bio-lubricant).
   Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson type reaction mechanism was proposed,
   and the reaction follows a pseudo first order. The energy of activation
   was found to be 19.0 kcal/mol. The tribological properties of
   bio-lubricant such as oxidative induction time (56.1 h), cloud point (-3
   degrees C), pour point (-9 degrees C), and kinematic viscosity at 100
   degrees C was 670 cSt were measured. Prepared bio-lubricant demonstrated
   the excellent lubricity property by wear scar of 130 mu m. Crown

Abstract = {{Hydrogen induced cracking (HIC) in pipeline steels industry causes a
   huge amount of economic loss to the industry, but despite this, HIC
   behavior is still not fully understood. We have studied HIC behavior in
   API 5L X60 and X70 pipeline steels using analysis of hydrogen
   permeation, hydrogen discharge using microprint technique, HIC standard
   test and their correlation with microstructure, type and morphology of
   inclusions. We recognized that mixed oxide inclusions do not seriously
   influence HIC in either steel. HIC tests in both steels demonstrated
   that the zone at the thickness center has a high concentration of
   manganese, silicon and sulfur and most cracks nucleate around this zone.
   Manganese sulphide inclusion, the most harmful type, was not present in
   the X60 steel specimen but was found in the center of the cross section
   of the X70 steel. We recognized a linear correlation between HIC
   susceptibility and hardness value in both steels. Furthermore, we
   calculated the number of reversible and irreversible hydrogen trapping
   sites and amount of discharged hydrogen for both steels through hydrogen
   permeation test. The obtained results show that the role of reversible
   hydrogen trapping sites on HIC susceptibility and crack growth is very
   important. Finally, Hydrogen microprint technique (HMT) test-data
   demonstrated that there was rather uniform distribution of hydrogen
   discharge through the grains in both steels; however, the concentration
   of hydrogen at grain boundaries was higher than in other areas. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The recent breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing technologies,
   such as those of Roche 454, Illumina/Solexa, and ABI SOLID, have
   dramatically reduced the cost of producing short reads of the genome of
   new species. The huge volume of reads, along with short read length,
   high coverage, and sequencing errors, poses a great challenge to de novo
   genome assembly. However, the paired-end information provides a new
   solution to these problems. In this paper, we review and compare some
   current assembly tools, including Newbler, CAP3, Velvet, SOAPdenovo,
   AllPaths, Abyss, IDBA, PE-Assembly, and Telescoper. In general, we
   compare the seed extension and graph-based methods that use the
   overlap/lapout/consensus approach and the de Bruijn graph approach for
   assembly. At the end of the paper, we summarize these methods and
   discuss the future directions of genome assembly.}},

Journal = {{CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2137-2150}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Given the popularity of decimal arithmetic, hardware implementation of
   decimal operations has been a hot topic of research in recent decades.
   Besides the four basic operations, the square root can be implemented as
   an instruction directly in the hardware, which improves the performance
   of the decimal floating-point unit in the processors. Hardware
   implementation of decimal square rooters is usually done using either
   functional or digit-recurrence algorithms. Functional algorithms,
   entailing multiplication per iteration, seem inadequate to use for
   decimal square roots, given the high cost of decimal multipliers. On the
   other hand, digit-recurrence square root algorithms, particularly SRT
   (this method is named after its creators, Sweeney, Robertson, and
   Tocher) algorithms, are simple and well suited for decimal arithmetic.
   This paper, with the intention of reducing the latency of the decimal
   square root operation while maintaining a reasonable cost, proposes an
   SRT algorithm and the corresponding hardware architecture to compute the
   decimal square root. The proposed fixed-point square root design
   requires n+3 cycles to compute an n-digit root; the synthesis results
   show an area cost of about 31K NAND2 and a cycle time of 40 FO4. These
   results reveal the 14 \% speed advantage of the proposed decimal square
   root architecture over the fastest previous work (which uses a
   functional algorithm) with about a quarter of the area.}},

Abstract = {{Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an important polyunsatured fatty acid
   (PUFA) which can be purified from tuna fish oil fatty acids by selective
   enzymatic esterification. The present paper investigates the kinetic
   study for selective esterification of tuna fish oil fatty acids with
   butanol catalyzed by Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) in biphasic solvent
   system. Under the most suitable reaction conditions, 76.2\%
   esterification was achieved in 24 h. Different kinetic models for
   esterification given by Segel {[}1], Oliveira et al. {[}2], Gogoi et al.
   {[}3], and Kraai et al. {[}4] were tested for fitting the esterification
   data and the model given by Oliveira et al. {[}2] was found to be most
   suitable. The model given by Prazeres et al. {[}5] for hydrolysis was
   also tested for esterification and the model with second order product
   inhibition was found to provide better match between the predicted and
   experimental values than that of model by Oliveira et al. {[}2]. The
   kinetic model was fitted using MATLAB (R) to determine the best kinetic
   parameters. The average value of kinetic constants using the model given
   by Prazeres et al. were estimated as K-m = 23.6 mu moles FFA/ml, K-i1 =
   4.6 x 10(-5) mu moles FFA/mg enzyme h, K-i2 = 0.0062 mu moles FFA/mg

Abstract = {{In this work, the aluminum/copper multilayered composite was fabricated
   by new severe plastic deformation method named ``accumulative roll
   bonding and folding{''} (ARBF) process at room temperature. Evolution of
   structure of the composite was investigated by transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). It was demonstrated that ARBF process generated
   nanostructured aluminum/copper multilayered composite. Occurrence of the
   recrystallization (both continuous and discontinuous) in the copper
   layers led to the formation of nanograins with an average size of
   similar to 50 nm while, the average grain size of aluminum layers was
   similar to 200 nm after twelfth cycle of ARBF process. In both the
   copper and aluminum layers in grains and subgrains smaller than 100 nm
   almost no dislocations were observed, while grains larger than 200 nm
   had high density of dislocations. Also, when the number of ARBF cycle
   increased, the grains became equiaxed. Also as the number of ARBF cycles
   increased, the microhardness in both aluminum and copper layers
   increased. Differences in microstructural evolution during processing
   and hardness values of aluminum and copper layer were related to their
   stacking fault energies. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   density functional theory calculations are presented. We find that
   potassium-doping partially populates the LUMO level of anthrancene and
   phenanthrene and that both the measured and calculated electronic
   structures of the doped systems are quite different from that of the
   pristine molecular systems. This suggests that the extra charge carriers
   in the doped system are responsible for the increased conductivity and
   greater intermolecular interaction. Finally, our calculations suggest
   that both K-3:phenanthrene and K-3:anthracene have reduced or
   nonexistent band gaps as compared to their pure counterparts, further
   supporting the conclusion that doping is responsible for increased

Abstract = {{We present experimental data for the decay dynamics of a
   resonantly-produced 2p(1/2) vanadium core-hole in YVO4. The states
   produced by the fast Coster-Kronig decay are studied by resonant
   inelastic x-ray spectroscopy. They form groups of participant normal
   emission and spectator emission peaks. The spectator emission gives rise
   to sharp peaks whose shape and energy correspond to a screened resonant
   2P(3/2)<-> 3d transition. This behavior is compared with the emission
   features observed in the less localized system V2O5. The decay lifetime
   of the 2p(1/2) hole in YVO4 is measured by the broadening of the sharp
   peaks resulting in a value of the order of 1 fs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The spin coated ZnO thin films were synthesized and tested for O-2 and
   NO2 gas detection. It exhibited an increase in resistance i.e. n-type
   behavior for O-2 exposure (5-20\%) and decrease in resistance i.e.
   p-type behavior for NO2 (2-40 ppm) exposure at operating temperatures of
   250 degrees C and 300 degrees C in N-2 atmosphere (0.4 +/- 0.03 mbar).
   The origin of this aberrant behavior for NO2 exposure was attributed to
   the participation of defects in NO2 sensing characteristics in light of
   the data obtained from photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy studies
   demonstrating the unique defect morphology of ZnO thin film. The
   underlying mechanism is discussed on the basis of conclusions drawn from
   characterization techniques and subsisting knowledge in the literature.
   The NO2 gas sensing is explained in terms of two competing mechanisms:
   one is change in charge carrier density on gas exposure as explained by
   surface depletion model and another is due participation of defects
   (oxygen vacancies) in gas sensing characteristics. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Presented here is a study of the molecular self-ordering properties of
   four bis(phenylethynyl) anthracene based organic semiconductors related
   to their electronic structure employing X-ray spectroscopy techniques
   and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The local molecular
   order through polarization dependence of C 1s -> pi{*} transitions
   revealed ordered pi-stacking nearly perpendicular to the substrate due
   to van der Waals interactions between alkyl groups. DFT calculations
   were used to deconvolute the measured electronic structure and examine
   effects of small changes in molecular geometry in relation to measured
   charge carrier mobility in top contact field effect transistors. The
   highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
   molecular orbital (LUMO) are found to be conjugated from the anthracene
   core across the bridging ethynyl groups to the thiophene and phenyl end
   groups. The inclusion of ethynyl bridges connecting the thiophenes has a
   twofold effect of both reducing the rotational freedom of this
   functional group and increasing HOMO/LUMO conjugation across the
   molecules. These features help create a more rigid upright structure for
   HB-ant-THT with better molecular orbital conjugation and subsequent
   higher mobility. With this understanding of how different functional
   groups interact with an acene core, future synthesis of new materials
   may be directed toward annealing-free organic semiconducting materials.}},

Title = {{Mass spectrum of heavy quarkonium hybrids}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{We have extended the calculation of the correlation functions of heavy
   quarkonium hybrid operators with various J(PC) quantum numbers to
   include QCD condensates up to dimension six. In contrast to previous
   analyses which were unable to optimize the QCD sum-rules for certain
   J(PC), recent work has shown that inclusion of dimension six condensates
   stabilizes the hybrid sum-rules and permits reliable mass predictions.
   In this work we have investigated the effects of the dimension six
   condensates on the remaining channels. After performing the QCD sum-rule
   analysis, we update the mass spectra of charmonium and bottomonium
   hybrids with exotic and non-exotic quantum numbers. We identify that the
   negative-parity states with J(PC) = (0, 1, 2)(-+), 1(--) form the
   lightest hybrid supermultiplet while the positive-parity states with
   J(PC) = (0, 1)(+-), (0, 1, 2)(++) belong to a heavier hybrid
   supermultiplet, confirming the supermultiplet structure found in other
   approaches. The hybrid with J(PC) = 0(--) has a much higher mass which
   may suggest a different excitation of the gluonic field compared to
   other channels. In agreement with previous results, we find that the
   J(PC) = 1(++) charmonium hybrid is substantially heavier than the
   X(3872), which seems to preclude a pure charmonium hybrid interpretation
   for this state.}},

Abstract = {{Structural characteristics of lignocellulosic biomass such as surface
   area, pore volume, crystallinity, hemicellulose, and lignin content
   significantly affect the yield of fermentable sugars for bioethanol
   production. In the present work, the effect of dilute acid pretreatment
   was studied on structural characteristics of wheat straw, using
   different combinations of process variables (temperature, time, and acid
   concentration). Pretreated wheat straw (PWS) exhibited higher available
   surface area and pore volume along with low hemicellulose and lignin
   content. Crystallinity index (CrI) of biomass at different pretreatment
   conditions showed an increased trend followed by sharp decrease at high
   temperature (190 degrees C) conditions. Maximum increase in surface area
   (7.1m(2)/g compared to 4.0m(2)/g for untreated wheat straw) was obtained
   at pretreatment conditions of 180 degrees C temperature, 0.5\% (v/v)
   acid, and 7min time. SEM imaging of biomass revealed that pore breaking,
   compression of pores, and partial pore blocking in the case of high
   temperature (190 degrees C) pretreatment conditions may be the reason
   behind decreased surface area of biomass. FT-IR analysis showed almost
   complete hemicellulose removal and acid-soluble lignin removal after
   dilute acid pretreatment but insufficient removal of acid insoluble
   lignin. {[}Supplementary material is available for this article. Go to

   concentrations of carbodiimide and calcium chloride. The
   double-crosslinked composite hydrogels display biocompatibility that is
   comparable to simple HA hydrogels, allowing for Schwann cell survival
   and growth. No significant difference was found between composite
   hydrogels made from different ratios of alginate and HA. A 3D
   BioPlotterTM rapid prototyping system was used to fabricate 3D
   scaffolds. The result indicated that combining HA with alginate
   facilitated the fabrication process and that 3D scaffolds with porous
   inner structure can be fabricated from the composite hydrogels, but not
   from HA alone. This information provides a basis for continuing in vitro
   and in vivo tests of the suitability of alginate/HA hydrogel as a
   biomaterial to create living cell scaffolds to support nerve
   regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Canola meal is a byproduct of the biodiesel industry and abundantly
   available in Canada. Slow pyrolysis of deoiled canola meal was performed
   over the temperature range 300-700 degrees C to study the potential
   applications of the pyrolysis products as fuels and sources of
   value-added products. The biochar yield decreased with increasing
   pyrolysis temperature, but the yield of gas products showed the reverse
   trend. The bio-oil yield increased up to a pyrolysis temperature of 500
   degrees C and then decreased. The carbon and nitrogen contents of
   biochars were in the ranges 66-81 and 6-9 wt \%, respectively. Van
   Krevelen's diagram showed that a higher pyrolysis temperature formed a
   highly condensed aromatic structure for biochars. Alkaline elements had
   the largest concentration in the ash present in biochar, followed by P
   and Fe. Biochars showed a basic pH range, and their electrical
   conductivity decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature. A higher
   heating value of 29.8 MJ/kg was observed for biochar produced at 400
   degrees C. The energy recoveries by biochars and bio-oils were 42-65\%
   and 15-32\%, respectively. The bio-oil yield was in the range of 10-24
   wt \%. Bio-oil produced at a pyrolysis temperature of 400 degrees C had
   a higher heating value (30.8 MJ/kg) than bio-oils produced at other
   temperatures. The concentration of phenolic compounds in bio-oil
   increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature. The same trend was
   observed for nitrogen compounds produced at temperatures up to 500
   degrees C. The total acid number for bio-oils was in the range of 96-21
   mg of KOH/g. The largest heating value for gas products (14.9 MJ/m(3))
   was observed at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 degrees C.}},

Title = {{Impact of Textural Layering on Water Retention Within Drained Sand
   Profiles}},
Journal = {{SOIL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{178}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{496-504}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The impact of textural layering on water retention in sand profiles was
   evaluated through a series of laboratory column tests and numerical
   modeling. Alternating horizontal layers of coarse and medium sand were
   placed in 100-cm-long soil columns with three different layer
   thicknesses (5, 10, and 25 cm). A fourth column was constructed with a
   homogeneous mixture composed of equal amounts of coarse and medium sand.
   The soil columns were completely saturated and then allowed to drain to
   a water table boundary at the base of the columns. The changes of water
   storage with time were measured by weighing the columns during drainage
   and by measuring the soil water content profile after 120 h of drainage.
   The hydraulic properties of the coarse, medium, and the mixed sand were
   measured in the laboratory and also optimized using numerical
   simulations of the column tests. These properties were then used to
   simulate the longer-term drainage of deeper profiles, more typical of
   field conditions. The long-term simulations considered a 320-cm deep
   soil profile in which the upper 100 cm was composed of layers of the two
   sands or was a homogeneous profile of each sand or a mixture of the two.
   The lower 220 cm of the column was always coarse sand. A 320-cm
   homogeneous medium sand profile was also simulated. The laboratory tests
   suggested that, after 96 h of drainage, the 5- and 10-cm layered columns
   exhibited similar water retention that was higher than the 25-cm layered
   column or the mixture. The numerical modeling presented the same trends
   as the experimental results. Field capacity (FC) was assumed to have
   been attained in the simulations when the drainage rate reached 0.3 mm/d
   (10\% of the mean daily potential evapotranspiration) at a depth of 100
   cm. The water stored at FC was found to be 143, 145, 138, and 111 mm for
   the 5-, 10-, 25-, and 50-cm layered columns, respectively, much higher
   than that observed for the homogeneous medium (47 mm) and coarse (46 mm)
   sand columns. The time to reach FC after a large rainfall pulse (50 mm)
   was 100, 99, 72, and 45 days for the 5-, 10-, 25-, and 50-cm layered
   columns, respectively; again, a much longer time than that required for
   the homogeneousmedium (24 days) and coarse (28 days) sand columns. These
   results highlight the role of textural layering in not only increasing
   FC but extending the time frame during which this water is available for
   plant growth.}},

Abstract = {{Field emission from flat graphene sheets is a challenge due to fewer
   emission sites. Here, we have synthesized free-standing vertically
   oriented few-layer graphene (FLG) films directly on dielectric
   substrates by hot-filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) without any
   catalyst or special substrate treatment. The fabricated FLGs with a
   large smooth surface topography, standing roughly vertical to the
   substrate are found to grow according to the Stranski-Krastanov growth
   mechanism. The ease of large-area preparation and the low turn-on field
   of 22V mu m(-1) in addition to the large field enhancement factor of
   approximate to 6520 for electron field emission suggest that the
   vertically oriented FLGs could be used as a potential edge emitter.

Abstract = {{Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) is a promising cancer treatment
   technique. During the treatment, a micro-planar lattice of narrow X-ray
   beams called a microbeam (each narrow X-ray beam is typically 20-100 mu
   m wide separated by 100-400 mu m) delivers a very large dose (>1000 Gy)
   onto a tumor. Sm3+-doped glasses that involve the reduction of the
   Sm-valency (Sm3+ -> Sm2+) upon X-ray irradiation are one of the
   potential dosimetric detectors for this particular application. With
   this class of detectors, we use the extent of valency reduction as a
   measure of the delivered X-ray dose, and the response read out using a
   confocal microscopic technique via the Sm2+/Sm3+ photoluminescence. This
   method enables us to measure the dose distribution of the microbeam. In
   this paper, we show that both Sm3+-doped fluorophosphate and
   fluoroaluminate glasses exhibit a dynamic range for the conversion
   response from 1 to over 1000 Gy, which satisfies the dose range for MRT
   applications. The dynamic range depends on the concentration of Sm3+
   dopants as well as the detector glass composition. Moreover, X-ray
   induced absorbance, photobleaching and thermally-stimulated luminescence
   (TL) measurements suggest that the hole trapping process during X-ray
   irradiation is a dominant factor for the valency conversion, and the
   accommodation of precursor POHCs in fluorophosphate glasses gives rise
   to an acceleration of the conversion process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Various computational algorithms are developed to identify protein
   complexes based on only one of specific topological structures in
   protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, such as cliques, dense
   subgraphs, core-attachment structures and starlike structures. However,
   protein complexes exhibit intricate connections in a PPI network. They
   cannot be fully detected by only single topological structure. In this
   paper, we propose an algorithm based on multiple topological structures
   to identify protein complexes from PPI networks. In the proposed
   algorithm, four single topological structure based algorithms are first
   employed to identify raw predictions with specific topological
   structures, respectively. Those raw predictions are trimmed according to
   their topological information or GO annotations. Similar results are
   carefully merged before generating final predictions. Numerical
   experiments are conducted on a yeast PPI network of DIP and a human PPI
   network of HPRD. The predicted results show that the multiple
   topological structure based algorithm can not only obtain a more number
   of predictions, but also generate results with high accuracy in terms of
   f-score, matching with known protein complexes and functional
   enrichments with GO.}},

Abstract = {{The zonal analysis of industrial furnaces is considered with
   three-dimensional radiative heat transfer, incorporated with the
   mathematical zone method. In this method exchange areas are determined
   by simplified numerical integration in three dimensions for
   surface-surface, surface-gas and gas gas zones for absorbing and
   emitting media. By focusing on new strategies to overcome the drawbacks
   of evaluating direct exchange areas, it is shown that the zone method is
   an effective numerical method for modeling three-dimensional thermal
   performance of gas-filled enclosures. Also the developed method for
   evaluating of exchange area is presented and compared with other methods
   in both sides of CPU time and accuracy. The method can decrease about
   70\% in error of calculation of some exchange areas as compared with the
   other numerical methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Novel procedure for the estimation of swelling pressures of compacted
   bentonites based on diffuse double layer theory}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{70}},

Abstract = {{Bentonite clays are proven to be attractive as buffer and backfill
   material in high-level nuclear waste repositories around the world. A
   quick estimation of swelling pressures of the compacted bentonites for
   different clay-water-electrolyte interactions is essential in the design
   of buffer and backfill materials. The theoretical studies on the
   swelling behavior of bentonites are based on diffuse double layer (DDL)
   theory. To establish theoretical relationship between void ratio and
   swelling pressure (e versus P), evaluation of elliptic integral and
   inverse analysis are unavoidable. In this paper, a novel procedure is
   presented to establish theoretical relationship of e versus P based on
   the Gouy-Chapman method. The proposed procedure establishes a unique
   relationship between electric potentials of interacting and
   non-interacting diffuse clay-water-electrolyte systems. A procedure is,
   thus, proposed to deduce the relation between swelling pressures and
   void ratio from the established relation between electric potentials.
   This approach is simple and alleviates the need for elliptic integral
   evaluation and also the inverse analysis. Further, application of the
   proposed approach to estimate swelling pressures of four compacted
   bentonites, for example, MX 80, Febex, Montigel and Kunigel V1, at
   different dry densities, shows that the method is very simple and
   predicts solutions with very good accuracy. Moreover, the proposed
   procedure provides continuous distributions of e versus P and thus it is
   computationally efficient when compared with the existing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Streamflow in small forested watersheds on the Boreal Plain of western
   Canada can be a challenge to monitor due to high variation in flow,
   shifting channel morphology, aufeis obstructions, shallow channel depth,
   and debris in the channel. Intensive monitoring in natural channels can
   overcome some of these problems, but frequent assessment and
   recalibration of streamflow-stage relationships are necessary.
   Experience over 8years indicates that in-channel structures designed to
   provide a stabilized stream-monitoring section (SSMS) proved beneficial
   to monitoring efforts during the ice-free season. The SSMS facilitated
   accurate gauging of the highest and lowest flows encountered during this
   period, provided a relatively stable foundation against streambank and
   channel erosion, and allowed passage of fish and the majority of debris
   and sediments. Functionality of the structures was markedly limited
   during ice-in conditions, but was improved with the addition of fitted
   canopies and propane heating systems.}},

Abstract = {{We present the electronic structure of vanadium in YVO4 compound

   compound was prepared by solid-state reaction. XAS results show that the
   increase of heat treatment favored the presence of one oxidation state
   V5+. We observed a distinctive broadening at L-2 edge of vanadium due to
   the L(2)L(3)v Coster-Kronig process. We identify the excitations of 3d
   bonding orbitals by CTM on the XAS results. Tetragonal parameters (D (s)

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study is to examine commercial ion exchange
   resins (IER) as heterogeneous catalysts at high temperatures for
   biodiesel production from triolein in a batch reaction system. Various
   commercial IER were screened as catalysts in transesterification of
   triolein and methanol. Of the catalysts tested, Amberlyst 15 was the
   most active catalyst in screening experiments. Reaction conditions were
   optimized within the experimental bounds using central composite design
   (CCD). At the optimized conditions, triolein conversion to products was
   97 mol\%. In longevity experiments Amberlyst 15 was reused once with no
   loss in catalytic activity, while successive experiments demonstrated
   decreases in catalytic activity. Product acid value, addition of free
   fatty acids as well as water addition to the reactants indicate that
   hydrolysis and esterification side reactions are taking place at the
   optimized conditions. Reaction kinetics were examined at 100-120 degrees
   C. A mathematical model of transesterification was developed in MATLab
   and demonstrated a close approximation to experimental data. For the
   three forward reactions: triglyceride to diglyceride, diglyceride to
   monoglyceride, and monoglyceride to glycerol, reaction rate constants
   are reported to be 9.3 x 10(-7), 2.5 x 10(-6), and 7.5 x 10(-5) L/mol/s.
   The first reversible reaction step converting triglycerides to
   diglycerides was found to be the rate limiting step. Activation energy
   for this step was 120 kJ/mol. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The corrosion behavior of electrodeposited Zn-Ni alloy coatings was
   studied with a view to replace Zn and Cd coatings. A three electrode
   electrochemical cell was utilized to understand corrosion of the
   coatings in 3.5\% NaCl solution by measuring the open circuit potentials
   (OCPs), polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS). EIS was performed at intermittent time intervals to understand
   the extent of dezincification in Zn-Ni alloys and to determine the
   polarization resistance change with respect to time. Coatings were
   examined with SEM and XRD to correlate the corrosion behavior with the
   surface/interface morphology and residual stresses and to understand the
   nature of corrosion products. The effect of heat treatment and trivalent
   chrome passivation on the corrosion behavior of Zn-Ni coatings is also
   reported. Zn-Ni coatings studied here have higher polarization
   resistance, lower corrosion currents and the corrosion products offer
   additional protection in increasing the life of the coatings compared
   with Zn and Cd coatings. Based on these results Zn-Ni coatings are an
   attractive alternative to Cd and Zn coatings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   three water models. In all cases, interfacial density equalisation
   occurred rapidly showing no preference for inhomogenous distribution. A
   uniform density (of ca. 0.99-1.067 g/cm(3), depending on the potential)
   was always observed at the interface, indicating the free energy of
   water in low-and high-density forms is metastable, and that LDL and HDL
   should not coexist as independent entities at thermodynamic equilibrium.
   It is reckoned that previous MD studies supporting the ``two-liquid{''}
   model have an explicit, if inappropriate, assumption of mechanical
   equilibrium between the two phases. The present result challenges the
   notion that a second critical point exists, and that LDL/HDL mixtures
   could be even kinetically metastable. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{myo-Inositol dehydrogenase (IDH, EC 1.1.1.18) from Bacillus subtilis
   converts myo-inositol to scyllo-inosose and is strictly dependent on NAD
   for activity. We sought to alter the coenzyme specificity to generate an
   NADP-dependent enzyme in order to enhance our understanding of coenzyme
   selectivity and to create an enzyme capable of recycling NADP in
   biocatalytic processes. Examination of available structural information
   related to the GFO/MocA/IDH family of dehydrogenases and precedents for
   altering coenzyme selectivity allowed us to select residues for
   substitution, and nine single, double, and triple mutants were
   constructed. Mutagenesis experiments with B. subtilis IDH proved
   extremely successful; the double mutant D35S/V36R preferred NADP to NAD
   by a factor of 5. This mutant is an excellent catalyst with a second
   order rate constant with respect to NADP of 370 000 s(-1) M-1, and the
   triple mutant A12K/D35S/V36R had a value of 570 000 s(-1) M-1 higher
   than that of the wild type IDH with NAD. The high resolution X-ray
   crystal structure of the double mutant A12K/D3SS was solved in complex
   with NADP. Surprisingly, the binding of the coenzyme is altered such
   that although the nicotinamide ring maintains the required position for
   catalysis, the coenzyme has twisted by nearly 90 degrees, so the adenine
   moiety no longer binds to a hydrophobic cleft in the Rossmann fold as in
   the wild type enzyme. This change in binding conformation has not
   previously been observed in mutated dehydrogenases}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of this research is the synthesis of functionally graded

   agitation, frequency and duty cycle changes can be applied and in this
   research, the influence of both parameters has been studied.
   Microstructure of these coatings investigated by SEM, EBSD and XRD
   methods. By changing the duty cycle from 90\% to 10\% at different
   frequency, the microstructure of the coatings did not change
   significantly. These coatings showed ductile structure with \{001\}
   texture at primary layers and small randomly oriented grains at final
   layers. The most important factor affecting the microstructure of the
   nickel matrix was the average current density and incorporation of nano
   alumina particles does not have significant effect on the
   microstructure. The optimum condition for production of functionally
   graded nano Al2O3-Ni coating was changing of the duty cycle from 90\% to
   10\% at fixed frequency of 10 Hz. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Monodisperse hollow and core-shell calcium alginate microcapsules are
   successfully prepared via internal gelation in microfluidic-generated
   double emulsions. Microfluidic emulsification is introduced to generate
   monodisperse oil-in-water-in-oil (O/W/O) double emulsion templates,
   which contain Na-alginate, CaCO3 nanoparticles, and photoacid generator
   in the middle aqueous phase, for synthesizing Ca-alginate microcapsules.
   The internal gelation of the aqueous middle layer of O/W/O double
   emulsions is induced by crosslinking alginate polymers with Ca2+ ions
   that are released from CaCO3 nanoparticles upon UV exposure of the
   photoacid generator. The as-prepared hollow and core-shell calcium
   alginate microcapsules are highly monodisperse and spherical in water.
   Model proteins Bovine serum albumin (BSA) molecules can be encapsulated
   into the Ca-alginate microcapsules after the capsule preparation, which
   demonstrates an alternative route for loading active drugs or chemicals
   into carriers to avoid the inactivation during the carrier preparation.
   The proposed technique in this study provides an efficient approach for
   synthesis of monodisperse hollow or core-shell calcium alginate
   microcapsules with large cavity or encapsulated lipophilic drugs,

   Growth}},

Abstract = {{Direct CVD deposition of dense, continuous, and adherent diamond films
   on conventional Fe-based alloys has long been considered impossible. The
   current study demonstrates that such a deposition can be realized on Al,
   Cr-modified Fe-based alloy substrate (FeAl or FeCrAl). To clarify the
   fundamental mechanism of Al, Cr in promoting diamond growth and
   enhancing interfacial adhesion, fine structure and chemical analysis
   around the diamond film-substrate interface have been comprehensively
   characterized by transmission electron microscopy. An intermediate
   graphite layer forms on those Al-free substrates such as pure Fe and
   FeCr, which significantly deteriorates the interfacial adhesion of
   diamond. In contrast, such a graphite layer is absent on the FeAl and
   FeCrAl substrates, whereas a very thin Al-rich amorphous oxide sublayer
   is always identified between the diamond film and substrate interface.
   These comparative results indicate that the Al-rich interfacial oxide
   layer acts as an effective barrier to prevent the formation of graphite
   phase and consequently enhance diamond growth and adhesion. The adhesion
   of diamond film formed on FeCrAl is especially superior to that formed
   on FeAl substrate. This can be further attributed to a synergetic effect
   including the reduced fraction of Al and the decreased substrate
   thermal-expansion coefficient on FeCrAl in comparison with FeAl, and a
   mechanical interlocking effect due to the formation of interfacial
   chromium carbides. Accordingly, a mechanism model is proposed to account
   for the different interfacial adhesion of diamond grown on the various
   Fe-based substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the structures of Ta that appear at high pressures and high
   temperatures is critical for addressing the recent controversies
   regarding the phase diagram and melting temperatures of this refractory
   metal. Structural searches based on a density functional metadynamics
   method were therefore employed to obtain candidate structures at
   high-pressure and finite-temperature conditions. A structural
   transformation from the initial body-centered cubic phase of Ta stable
   under ambient conditions to an orthorhombic structure with the space
   group Pnma is predicted. The Pnma structure is shown to be energetically
   more favorable and more reasonable than other candidate structures
   considered previously, since it was also confirmed to be mechanically
   and dynamically stable by phonon and metadynamics calculations. However,
   a recently proposed hexagonal-omega phase for dense Ta is found to be
   mechanically and dynamically unstable when anharmonic effects are
   characterized by high-temperature, self-consistent phonon calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic and isotopic data collected from aquifers are routinely used
   to characterize hydrogeological conditions within sedimentary basins,
   but similar data from confining units are generally not collected
   despite their ability to provide insights on important water/solute
   transport controls. We characterized paleogroundwater flow and solute
   transport mechanisms across 384 m of Cretaceous shale (aquitard) in the
   Williston Basin, Canada, using high-resolution depth profiles of water
   isotopes (O-18, H-2). Water samples were also collected from wells
   installed in the underlying regional sandy aquifer (Mannville Fm; 93 m
   thick) and from seepage inflows into potash mine shafts (to 825 m below
   ground). The 1-D numerical transport modeling of O-18 profiles provided
   insight into large-scale/long-term solute transport in both Cretaceous
   sediments and the basin. Despite the potential for significant advective
   migration during glaciations, molecular diffusion appears to be the
   dominant solute transport mechanism through the aquitard. Simulations
   suggest average vertical groundwater velocities of <0.05 m/10 ka and an
   average excess hydraulic head of <10 m; these values are much less than
   anticipated by successive glaciations. The dominant paleoevent reflected
   in present-day profiles is introduction during the Pleistocene of
   glaciogenic meteoric water to the aquifer underlying the shale, likely
   along an aquifer outcrop area east of the site or through local vertical
   conduits. Simulations suggest these recharge events occurred during one
   or more glacial periods. The isotopic profile over the upper 25 m of
   Pleistocene till and shale is consistent with glacial deposition and
   transport processes within these units over the Holocene (past 10 ka).}},

Abstract = {{Shallow geothermal energy is a renewable energy resource that has become
   increasingly important. However, the use has environmental, technical
   and social consequences. Biological, chemical, and physical
   characteristics of groundwater and subsurface are influenced by the
   development of this resource. To guarantee a sustainable use it is
   therefore necessary to consider environmental and technical criteria,
   such as changes in groundwater quality and temperature. In the current
   study a comprehensive overview of consequences of geothermal systems in
   shallow aquifers is provided. We conclude that there is still a lack of
   knowledge on long-term environmental consequences. Due to local
   differences in geology and hydrogeology as well as in technical
   requirements, it is not recommendable to define only static regulations,
   such as fixed and absolute temperature thresholds. Flexible temperature
   limits for heating and cooling the groundwater and subsurface are
   therefore advisable. The limits should be oriented on previously
   undisturbed temperatures, and chemical, physical and biological
   conditions of aquifers. Based on these findings, recommendations for a
   sustainable policy for shallow geothermal systems are provided including
   a potential legal framework for a sustainable use. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To study the importance and interactions of pH control and
   delignification of a medium derived from oat hull hemicellulose, as well
   as the influence of supplemental nitrogen source and cell recycling,
   Candida guilliermondii was used as the biocatalyst in repeated batch
   bioconversion processes in three successive batches each lasting 144 h.
   The research study was conducted based on a factorial design with three
   factors consisting of: a) pH control (pH(s): pH constant during the
   process; pH(i): pH adjusted to 6.0 at the beginning of bioconversion
   with no control thereafter; and pH(t): pH set to 6.0 before
   sterilization of the medium with no control thereafter); b) medium
   detoxification/supplementation (Conc.: medium used directly with no
   treatment; AC1.25: medium treated with 1.25\% activated carbon; AC2.5:
   medium treated with 2.5\% activated carbon; AC5: medium treated with 5\%
   activated carbon; and AC2.5-N: medium detoxified with 2.5\% activated
   carbon and then supplemented with ammonium sulphate); and c) cell
   recycling {[} three cycles (C-1, C-2, and C-3)]. Results from the
   bioconversion process indicated that detoxification of the medium was
   the least important factor affecting product yield and productivity,
   while cell recycling and medium supplementation were much more important
   parameters which needed to be considered to achieve a successful
   process. Results also indicated that medium supplementation by inorganic
   nitrogen (ammonium sulphate) could be a requirement to achieve a
   consistent process performance in consecutive cycles of bioconversion
   using recycled biocatalyst. However, there is no need to use a
   supplemental nitrogen source in a single-cycle process.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the occurrence of the adiabatic shear bands in AISI 4340
   steel under high velocity impact loading was investigated using finite
   element analysis and experimental tests. The cylindrical specimen
   subjected to the impact load was divided into different regions
   separated by nodes using finite element method in ABAQUS environment
   with boundary conditions specified. The material properties were assumed
   to be lower in the region where the probability of strain localization
   is high based on prior experimental results in order to initialize the
   formation of the adiabatic shear bands. The finite element model was
   used to determine the maximum flow stress, the strain hardening, the
   thermal softening, and the time to reach the critical strain for the
   formation of adiabatic shear bands. Experimental results show that
   deformed bands were formed at low strain rates and there was a minimum
   strain rate required for the formation of the transformed band in the
   alloy and the cracks were initiated and propagated along the transformed
   bands leading to fragmentation under the impact loading. The
   susceptibility of the adiabatic shear bands to cracking was markedly
   influenced by the strain-rates and the initial material microstructure.
   The simulation results obtained were compared with the experimental
   results obtained from the AISI 4340 steel under high strain-rate loading
   in compression using split impact Hopkinson bars. A good agreement
   between the experimental and simulation results was obtained.}},

Title = {{Effect of ramp configuration on easiness of handling, heart rate, and
   behavior of near-market weight pigs at unloading}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3889-3898}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Three experiments, each using 280 pigs, were conducted in a simulated
   compartment to test the effect of angle of entrance (AOE) to the ramp
   (90 degrees, 60 degrees, 30 degrees, or 0 degrees), ramp slope (0
   degrees, 16 degrees, 21 degrees, or 26 degrees), and an initial 20-cm
   step associated with 16 or 21 ramp slopes on the ease of handling, heart
   rate (HR), and behavior of near market-weight pigs during unloading.
   Heart rate (pigs and handler), unloading time, interventions of the
   handler, and reactions of the pigs were monitored. The results of the
   first experiment show that using a 90 degrees AOE had detrimental
   effects on ease of handling (P < 0.05), HR of the pig (P < 0.05), and
   behavior (P < 0.05). The 0 degrees and 30 degrees AOE appeared to
   improve the ease of unloading, whereas the 60 degrees AOE had an
   intermediate effect. The 30 AOE appeared to be preferable, because pigs
   moved at this angle balked less frequently (P < 0.01) and required less
   manipulation (P < 0.05) than pigs moved with a 0 degrees AOE. The
   results of the second experiment show that the use of a flat ramp led to
   the easiest unloading, as demonstrated by the lower number of balks (P <
   0.001) when pigs were moved to the ramp and less frequent use of paddle
   (P = 0.001) or voice (P < 0.001) on the ramp, compared with the other
   treatments. However, the flat ramp did not differ from the 21 degrees
   ramp in many of the variables reflecting ease of handling, which may be
   explained by the difference in configuration between the ramps. The
   results also show that the use of the steepest ramp slope had the most
   detrimental effect on balking and backing up behavior of pigs (P <
   0.001), and handling (touches, slaps, and pushes; P < 0.05 for all) when
   moved to the ramp and on unloading time (P < 0.01). No differences in
   pig HR (P < 0.05) and ease of handling on the ramp (P < 0.05) were found
   between a 26 degrees and 16 degrees ramp slope, suggesting that the
   length of the ramp may be one of the factors that make unloading more
   difficult. The results of the last experiment show that an initial step
   made unloading physically more demanding for the handler (P < 0.001) and
   pigs on the ramp (P < 0.05) as demonstrated by their greater HR. The
   greater difficulty of handling (P < 0.01) and reluctance to move (P <
   0.05) of pigs moved toward the 16 degrees ramp with a step suggest that
   pigs perceived this ramp as more psychologically challenging. Making a
   few changes in terms of the design of the ramp could improve the
   efficiency of handling and reduce stress in pigs.}},

   natural rubber (Belt A-35 shore) and canvas belt (Belt B-65 shore) for
   three drum speeds. The machine capacity was in the range of 45.59 to
   68.54 kg h(-1) for belt A with a yield of 1.148, 1.069 and 1.066 kg, and

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 29}},
Abstract = {{The question raised recently about the mechanisms of the
   pressure-induced B4-B1 transition of GaN is investigated using a density
   functional-based metadynamics method. A homogeneous deformation path
   through a tetragonal intermediate structure is found to be energetically
   favorable under hydrostatic pressure conditions. This transition path is
   initialized by the soft phonon modes that appear along the transverse
   acoustic branches near the transition point. However, under certain
   nonhydrostatic pressure conditions an elastic instability replaces the
   phonon instability to become a dominant mechanism for the structural
   transformation of GaN. The phase transition would avoid the tetragonal
   path when a uniaxial stress is applied on the c axis but follows a
   different path through a hexagonal intermediate structure. The selection
   of the transformation mechanisms, determined by specific stress
   conditions applied, highlights the important role the competition
   between phonon and elastic instabilities plays in the reconstructive

Abstract = {{Satellite observations from three instruments (Microwave Limb Sounder,
   Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imaging System, and Atmospheric
   Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer) reveal coherent
   patterns of low ozone events (<20 ppb) in the tropical upper
   troposphere. Using a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem), we find that
   these events result from deep convective processes that rapidly
   transport air with low ozone concentrations from the marine boundary
   layer. These events occur with greater frequency over the tropical South
   Pacific warm pool, which is consistent with ozonesonde observations. The
   satellite observations indicate spatial shifts in the frequency of low
   ozone events that we attribute to changes in convection. As the location
   of the warm pool shifts eastward during El Nino events, the location of
   the most frequent low ozone events in the satellite record follows.
   Mapping of low ozone events over time reveals eastward propagating
   systems resembling the Madden-Julian Oscillation. These observations and
   analyses strengthen the link between deep convection and ozone
   concentrations in the tropical upper troposphere.}},

Abstract = {{The Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imaging System (OSIRIS) on the
   Odin satellite currently has an eight-year dataset of nighttime
   Antarctic nitric oxide densities, {[}NO], in the mesosphere-lower
   thermosphere (MLT) region. In this work, the OSIRIS data are compared
   with a similar data set from the Sub-Millimeter Radiometer (SMR), also
   on the Odin satellite. Both of the Odin data sets are compared with
   twilight {[}NO] from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier
   Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) on the SciSat-I satellite. Direct
   comparisons of OSIRIS and SMR profiles show large differences,
   indicating that the individual {[}NO] profiles of one or both data sets
   may not be valid. However, when comparing averaged {[}NO], variations on
   timescales of weeks-years in all three data sets are in good agreement
   and correspond to the 27 day and 11 year solar cycles. The averaged
   OSIRIS values are typically 10\% greater than SMR and 30\% greater than
   ACE-FTS, which are within the estimated OSIRIS systematic uncertainties.
   These results suggest that the satellite-derived data sets can be used
   for determining polar-mean NO climatology and variations on timescales
   of weeks-years. The OSIRIS and SMR nighttime data sets show that the
   {[}NO] peak height in the MLT decreases throughout the autumn, from an
   altitude near or above 100 km to a minimum altitude ranging from 90 to
   95 km around winter solstice. A similar decrease in {[}NO] peak height
   is observed in modeled NO climatology from the Specified Dynamics-Whole
   Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM), although the SD-WACCM
   climatology exhibits a decrease throughout autumn from 107 km down to
   102 km. The results suggest that global climate models require more
   sophisticated auroral forcing simulations in order to reproduce observed
   NO variations in this region.}},

Abstract = {{We present calculated electronic structures and x-ray emission and

   emission and absorption spectra, which probe the occupied and unoccupied
   states, respectively, provide an empirical justification of the
   calculated electronic structure. We therefore verify the prediction that
   the copper 3d states are fully occupied and buried deep in the valence
   band, and the Fermi surface of these materials is characterized by s, p
   states. We show that generally the calculated electronic structure is in
   excellent agreement with our measurements. We finally examine the Fermi
   surfaces of these pnictides, and suggest that copper antimonides may
   exhibit efficient Fermi surface nesting similar to iron pnictides.}},

Title = {{A decoding-based fusion rule for cooperative spectrum sensing with
   nonorthogonal transmission of local decisions}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{Cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio (CR) networks is studied
   in which each CR performs energy detection to obtain a binary decision
   on the absence/presence of the primary user. The problem of interest is
   how to efficiently report and combine the local decisions to/at the
   fusion center under fading channels. In order to reduce the required
   transmission bandwidth in the reporting phase, the paper examines
   nonorthogonal transmission of local decisions by means of on-off keying.
   Proposed and analyzed is a novel decoding-based fusion rule that
   essentially performs in three steps: (1) estimating minimum mean-square
   error of the transmitted information from cognitive radios, (2) making
   hard decisions of the transmitted bits based on the estimated
   information, and (3) combining the hard decisions in a linear manner.
   Simulation results support the theoretical analysis and show that the
   added complexity of the decoding-based fusion rule leads to a
   considerable performance gain over the simpler energy-based fusion rule
   when the reporting links are reasonably strong.}},

Journal = {{CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{It is recently conjectured that generic non-extremal Kerr black hole
   could be holographically dual to a hidden conformal field theory (CFT)
   in two dimensions. Moreover, it is known that there are two CFT duals
   (pictures) to describe the charged rotating black holes which correspond
   to angular momentum J and electric charge Q of the black hole.
   Furthermore these two pictures can be incorporated by the CFT duals
   (general picture) that are generated by SL(2, Z) modular group. The
   general conformal structure can be revealed by looking at charged scalar
   wave equation in some appropriate values of frequency and charge. In
   this regard, we consider the wave equation of a charged massless scalar
   field in the background of Kerr-Sen black hole and show that in the
   `near region', the wave equation can be reproduced by the Casimir
   operator of a local SL(2, R)(L)xSL(2, R)(R) hidden conformal symmetry.
   We find the exact agreement between macroscopic and microscopic physical
   quantities like entropy and absorption cross section of scalars for
   Kerr-Sen black hole. We then find an extension of vector fields that in
   turn yields an extended local family of SL(2, R)(L) x SL(2, R)(R) hidden
   conformal symmetry, parameterized by one parameter. For some special
   values of the parameter, we find a copy of SL(2, R) hidden conformal
   algebra for the charged Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger
   black hole in the strong deflection limit.}},

Abstract = {{It is shown that turbulence is responsible for a source of momentum,
   which cannot be recast as a divergence of a momentum flux. This process
   is similar to turbulent heating, with similar properties. The sum over
   all species vanishes up to polarization contributions. Hence, toroidal
   momentum is transferred from species to species, mediated by turbulence.
   As for momentum flux, symmetry breaking is needed. Flow shear is
   investigated as a source of symmetry breaking, leading to a source of
   momentum proportional to the shear rate. Turbulent acceleration is
   significant for ion species. It is found that it is proportional to the
   charge number Z, while turbulent heating scales as Z(2)/A, where A is
   the mass number. It is maximum in the edge, where the E x B flow shear
   rate and turbulence intensity are maximum. When both are large enough,
   the turbulent torque may overcome the collisional friction between
   impurities and main ions, thus leading to different toroidal velocities.

Abstract = {{Direct conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons is an effective
   process to solve the problem of natural gas utilization. Although
   remarkable progress has been achieved on the dehydro-aromatization of
   methane (DAM), low conversion caused by severe thermodynamic
   limitations, coke formation, and catalysis deactivation remain important
   drawbacks to the direct conversion process. Molybdenum catalysts
   supported on HZSM-5 type zeolite support are among the most promising
   catalysts. This review focuses on the aspects of direct methane
   conversion, in terms of catalysts containing metal and support, reaction
   conditions, and conversion in different types of reactors. The reaction
   mechanism for this catalytic process is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The potential effectiveness for long-term closure of a desulphurized
   tailings cover placed on reactive tailings at the Detour Lake Mine was
   assessed. The single-layer cover was aimed at reducing oxygen ingress
   using high water saturation to limit oxygen diffusion and consumption of
   oxygen in the cover by residual sulphide minerals. The cover was 1.0 to
   1.5 m thick and met desulphurization targets, but was coarser grained
   than the design. One-dimensional unsaturated flow and oxygen diffusion
   modelling was used to predict water content profiles, depth of oxygen
   penetration, and diffusive oxygen fluxes. Effective diffusion and
   reaction rate coefficients estimated from field data matched laboratory
   measurements. Depth to water table was identified as the most important
   factor for reducing tailings oxidation. The deeper (4 m) water tables
   measured at the cover edges led to a lower degree of saturation and
   higher oxygen flux. Finer grain size and higher air-entry values in the
   cover materials helped maintain saturation, and a capillary break (fine
   over coarse) cover reduced oxygen fluxes to <5\% of fluxes to uncovered
   tailings. The as-built cover (coarse over fine) reduced oxygen influx by
   at most 50\% and as low as <1\% of uncovered tailings.}},

Abstract = {{A run-around membrane energy exchanger (RAMEE) is a novel energy
   recovery system which can avoid carryover of desiccant solution while
   transferring both heat and moisture between non-adjacent supply and
   exhaust air streams. In this study, an analytical model for a flat-plate
   counter-cross-flow liquid-to-air membrane energy exchanger (LAMEE) is
   compared with experimental test results and numerical simulations for a
   single LAMEE and a RAMEE system under various operating conditions.
   Agreements are obtained among the analytical, experimental and numerical
   results. The effectiveness of a RAMEE system under balanced and
   unbalanced airflow conditions is evaluated by using the analytical
   model. Optimization studies for exchanger size and solution flow rate in
   RAMEE systems are investigated. Results show that RAMEE systems with
   equal-sized supply and exhaust exchangers can achieve the highest
   effectiveness in most conditions for both balanced and unbalanced
   airflow. Optimization control of the solution flow rate can enhance
   annual energy recovery rate up to 7\%. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A new membrane liquid desiccant air-conditioning (LDAC) system is
   proposed and investigated in this paper. Liquid-to-air membrane energy
   exchangers (LAMEEs) are used as a dehumidifier and a regenerator in the
   proposed membrane LDAC system, which can eliminate the desiccant
   droplets carryover problem occurring in most direct-contact LDAC
   systems. A parametric study on steady-state performance of the membrane
   LDAC system is performed using the TRNSYS energy simulation platform.
   The impacts of various climatic conditions and key system parameters on
   the system performance are evaluated. Results show that the proposed
   membrane LDAC system is capable of achieving recommended supply air
   conditions for productive, comfort and healthy environments if the key
   system parameters are effectively controlled. The system coefficient of
   performance (COP) at the design condition is 0.68, and the sensible heat
   ratio (SHR) for the dehumidifier lies in the range between 0.3 and 0.5
   under different climatic, operating and design conditions. The proposed
   membrane LDAC system is able to effectively remove latent load in
   applications that require efficient humidity control. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In the present work, the effect of dilute acid pretreatment was studied
   on the composition of liquid hydrolysate obtained after pretreatment by
   employing different combinations of process variables (temperature, time
   and acid concentration). The effect of pretreatment was also studied on
   subsequent enzymatic saccharification of remaining solids to obtain
   maximum yield of sugars. The efficiency of pretreatment was measured in
   terms of high-xylose and low-glucose yields, which was found most
   suitable at pretreatment conditions of 120 degrees C, 120min and 2\%
   (v/v) acid concentration. With increased severity of pretreatment,
   xylose yield decreased with concomitant increase in glucose yield. The
   decrease in xylose yield was attributed to conversion into degradation
   products such as 5-hydroxylmethyl furfural (HMF) and acetic acid. The
   percentage of enzymatic saccharification increased with increased
   pretreatment severity. Saccharification of biomass pretreated at 180
   degrees C, 7min and 0.5\% (v/v) acid concentration produced the maximum
   glucose yield of saccharification of 352g/kg dry matter, compared to
   just 97g glucose/kg dry matter in the case of untreated biomass. The
   same pretreatment conditions resulted in maximum total sugar yield of
   pretreatment and saccharification of 459g/kg dry matter, which was more
   than 67\% of the total potential sugars in biomass. (c) 2012 Canadian

Abstract = {{Fuels from biomass (biofuels) are used to mitigate the greenhouse gases
   produced through the utilization of fossil fuels. Non-edible or waste
   biomass can be pyrolyzed to produce bio-oil. The oil, an unstable and

   to produce gas and/or diesel range hydrocarbons and value added
   chemicals. The objective of this review is to explore upgrading
   techniques that are currently being researched and utilized. This review
   reveals several aspects that in turn will serve as an aid for bio oil
   valorization, such as, evaluating characterization techniques involved
   in understanding salient features of bio-oil, insight of bio-oil
   pretreatment methods for water removal to increase heating values and
   decrease risk of catalyst poisoning in subsequent hydroprocessing,
   studies regarding model compound upgrading, reaction mechanism and
   finally, provides brief review of common catalysts for hydrotreatment of
   bio-oil in order to yield value added chemicals and fuels. Crown

Abstract = {{Microspheres composed of vanadium pentoxide nanorods have been
   successfully synthesized using a single step solvothermal method. Field
   emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and transmission electron
   microscope (TEM) analysis were used to characterize the morphology of
   the nanorod-like structures. The results show that the microspheres have
   an average diameter of 3.5 mu m and that the diameter of the nanorods,
   of which these microspheres consist, ranges from 150 to 200 nm. Chemical
   and phase composition of the microspheres was analyzed using X-ray
   Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Selective
   Area Electron Diffraction (SAED). XRD patterns show that the nanorods
   are composed of V2O5 phase. The SAED patterns confirm the
   polycrystalline nature of V2O5 phase in the samples. The XPS spectra
   indicate that the surface of the microsphere samples consist
   predominantly of vanadium in its V5+ oxidation state. Vibrational
   analysis was done using Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform
   Infrared spectroscopy and the results further confirm the formation of
   V2O5 phase. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The tuning of semiconductor band gaps can often provide significant
   performance increases and new applications for electronic,
   optoelectronic, and photocatalytic devices. Here, we study the band gaps
   of pure and nickel-doped zinc oxide thin films synthesized using the
   low-cost spray pyrolysis deposition method. Nickel concentration is
   varied from 0 to 15\%, and the effects that this doping has on the
   electronic structure are analyzed. Using optical and synchrotron X-ray
   techniques, two regimes of band gap reduction via Ni doping are
   uncovered. For doping up to 4\% Ni, there is a strong reduction in the
   gap, while continued doping up to 15\% further reduces the gap, but to a
   lesser extent. The results are explained using X-ray spectroscopy and an
   Anderson impurity model. These tools show that the low doping case is
   driven by the interaction of the Ni 3d and O 2p states in both the
   valence and conduction bands. At high doping, the removal of Zn 3d
   states from the valence band and the change in Ni coordination from T-d
   to O-h both contribute to counteract the gap reduction. These results
   show how Ni can be used to tune the ZnO band gap over a large range
   useful for many applications.}},

Abstract = {{The newly synthesized manganese carbodiimide is antiferromagnetic, green
   in color, and optically transparent. The electronic properties of MnNCN
   are relatively unstudied; determining the electronic band gap and
   understanding the effects of the O2- -> NCN2- substitution is extremely
   important to use this material for practical applications. We present
   high-resolution measurements of the local density of electronic states
   of MnNCN and compare them to spectra simulated using detailed density
   functional theory calculations. We further show that MnNCN has a larger
   degree of covalent bonding than MnO and has a reduced indirect
   electronic band gap of 3.40 +/- 0.20 eV of the charge-transfer type.
   However, the mechanism for this band gap reduction is not clear and
   requires further study. In conclusion, MnNCN is a wide band gap,
   antiferromagnetic semiconductor suitable for applications that currently
   use MnO but require a smaller electronic band gap.}},

Abstract = {{Dilute magnetic semiconductors are widely studied due to their potential
   applications in spin-resolved electronics. We report the direct
   evidences of intrinsic ferromagnetism in the primarily ferromagnetic
   ZnO:Co thin films using near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure
   (NEXAFS) and soft X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). The single
   phase Zn1-xCoxO thin films with nominal compositions (0.00 <= x <= 0.15)
   were synthesized by a spray pyrolysis technique, which exhibit room
   temperature ferromagnetism as revealed by alternating gradient force
   magnetometer (AGFM) measurements. The spectroscopic measurements
   indicate that most of Co dopants have substituted for Zn sites in ZnO
   matrix and they are present in divalent Co2+ (d(7)) state with
   tetrahedral symmetry according to the atomic multiplet calculations. The
   0 Is NEXAFS spectra suggest strong hybridization between O 2p and Co 3d
   electrons within ZnO matrix. The Co 2p XMCD measurements rule out the
   magnetism due to the presence of Co clusters, and show that Co-O-Co
   bonding provides localized magnetic moments leading to ferromagnetism.

Abstract = {{The tribocorrosion behavior of electrodeposited Zn-Ni alloy coatings was
   investigated with a view to assessing their suitability to replace Zn,
   Cd and Cd-Ti coatings. A modified pin on flat tribometer in an
   electrochemical cell was utilized to understand wear induced corrosion
   of the coatings in 3.5\% NaCl solution. Wear tests were conducted at
   open circuit potentials, and impressed anodic potentials of the coatings
   to determine the corrosion resistance of coatings before, during and
   after the wear test Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was utilized
   to understand the polarization resistance of the coatings before and
   after the wear tests. Wear tracks were analyzed with SEM and XRD to
   determine the nature of corrosion products and surface morphology
   changes during the tribocorrosion tests. Zn-Ni coatings had higher
   polarization resistance after wear test as compared to zinc and cadmium
   coatings. The mass loss due to wear enhanced corrosion was less with
   Zn-Ni than with Zn and Cd coatings. Zn-Ni coatings are a suitable
   replacement to Cd coatings when the surfaces are subjected to
   simultaneous wear and corrosion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The use of carbon nanotube (CNT) films for strain detection is one of
   the most encouraging findings in the field of sensors. Our previous
   studies have shown that the density of the CNT networks (randomly
   distributed) plays an important role in governing the piezoresistive
   response in CNT films under the in-plane straining. The influence of
   aligned CNT networks on the piezoresistive response is presented. In
   particular, the CNTs are first decorated with iron oxide nanoparticles
   (to enhance magnetism), and then the decorated CNTs are used to form
   aligned CNT networks in the films with the aid of a magnetic field. The
   films are loaded in the three points bending tester, and their
   piezoresistive response is investigated under a cycled in-plane
   straining. The results show that the CNT networks aligned at 0 degrees
   to electrodes and 90 degrees to electrodes exhibit the highest and the
   lowest piezoresistive sensitivity, respectively, but the poor
   repeatability (i.e., severe resistant reduction -6\% to -27\%) is also
   found in the CNT networks aligned at 0 degrees to electrodes. (C) 2013

Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Diquarks with J(P) = 0(+/-), 1(+/-) containing a heavy (charm or bottom)
   quark and a light quark are investigated using QCD Laplace sum rules.
   Masses are determined using appropriately constructed gauge invariant
   correlation functions, including for the first time next-to-leading
   order perturbative contributions. The J(P) = 0(+) and 1(+) charm-light
   diquark masses are, respectively, found to be 1.86 +/- 0.05 and 1.87 +/-
   0.10 GeV, while those of the 0(+) and 1(+) bottom-light diquarks are
   both determined to be 5.08 +/- 0.04 GeV. The sum rules derived for
   heavy-light diquarks with negative parity are poorly behaved and do not
   permit unambiguous mass predictions, in agreement with previous results
   for negative parity light diquarks. The scalar and axial vector
   heavy-light diquark masses are degenerate within uncertainty, as
   expected by heavy quark symmetry considerations. Furthermore, these mass
   predictions are in good agreement with masses extracted in constituent
   diquark models of the tetraquark candidates X(3872) and Y-b(10890). Thus
   these results provide QCD support for the interpretation of the X(3872)
   and Y-b(10890) as J(PC) = 1(++) tetraquark states composed of diquark
   clusters. Further implications for tetraquarks among the heavy
   quarkoniumlike XYZ states are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates effect of manganese loading on total oxidation
   of toluene by ozone using alumina-supported manganese oxide catalysts.
   Activities of four loadings of Mn (1, 5, 10 and 20\%) were studied in
   the temperature range of 22-100 degrees C. Catalysts were characterized
   by BET, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption near edge structure
   (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). All
   catalysts became deactivated at room temperature and their activities
   were improved by increase of temperature. CHNS and Fourier transform
   infra red (FT-IR) spectroscopy were used to study catalyst deactivation
   at room temperature. Alcohols and carboxylic acids were identified as
   deposited species on the catalysts responsible for catalyst
   deactivation. A direct relationship between Mn loading and average
   oxidation state of manganese was found. Catalysts at lower loadings up
   to 10\% were mostly composed of Mn2O3 while a mixture of MnO2 and Mn2O3
   were present in catalysts with loadings higher than 10\%. It was
   observed that lower Mn loadings have higher activity in oxidation of
   toluene. It was proposed that lower oxidation states of manganese are
   more favorable in decomposition of ozone resulting in higher rate of
   toluene oxidation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two types of dayside localized proton-induced auroral emissions on the
   dayside were identified in SI12 images from the Imager for
   Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) spacecraft. Auroral
   oval spots occurred at or toward the poleward edge of the dayside proton
   auroral oval. Polar cap spots occurred well into the polar cap. The
   polar cap spots occurred when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)
   was strongly northward and radially aligned along the Sun-Earth line,
   which results in reconnection with northern lobe field lines. For the
   auroral oval spots that occurred during northward-IMF only, there was a
   large azimuthal component of the IMF. During northward IMF conditions, a
   large azimuthal component of the IMF leads to reconnection at high
   latitudes on closed geomagnetic field lines. The reconnection site would
   map closer to auroral oval latitudes, which is consistent with the
   location of the auroral oval spots. The auroral oval spots were found to
   be much larger in size and total intensity than the polar cap spots, but
   the average intensities of the two types of spots were comparable. The
   average intensity of the auroral oval spots was proportional to the
   solar wind dynamic pressure and solar wind density, suggesting that the
   average intensity of the auroral oval spots is dependent on the number
   of protons precipitating from the reconnection site, rather than the
   proton energy. No clear trend was found for the polar cap spots, but
   there was a notable lack of polar cap spots for high solar wind dynamic
   pressures and densities.}},

Abstract = {{A scalable elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) processor is presented in
   this paper. The proposed ECC processor supports all five Koblitz curves
   recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
   without the need to reconfigure the FPGA. The paper proposes a finite
   field arithmetic unit (FFAU) that reduces the number of clock cycles
   required to compute the elliptic curve point multiplication (ECPM)
   operation for ECC. The paper also presents an improved point addition
   (PADD) algorithm to take advantage of the novel FFAU architecture. A
   scalable ECC processor (ECP) that is completely implemented in hardware
   that makes use of the novel PADD algorithm and FFAU is also presented in
   this paper.
   The design is synthesized and implemented for a target Virtex-4 XC4VFX12
   FPGA. It uses 2431 slices, 1219 slice registers, 3815 four-input look-up
   tables (LUT) and can run at a maximum frequency of 155.376 MHz. The
   proposed design is the fastest scalable ECP that supports all five
   Koblitz curves known to the authors as it evaluates the ECPM for K-163
   in 0.273 ms, K-233 in 0.604 ms, K-283 in 0.735 ms, K-409 in 1.926 ms and
   K-571 in 4.335 ms. The proposed design is suitable for server-side
   security applications where both high-speed and scalability are
   important design factors. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with design problems of joint source power
   allocation and relay beamforming in multiuser multi-relay networks that
   use single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) and
   amplify-and-forward relaying. Examined are the joint programs of (i)
   maximizing the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
   under various transmitted power constraints, and (ii) minimizing the
   total transmitted power subject to prescribed SINR thresholds of users.
   Although these optimization problems are highly non-convex and have
   large dimensions, by exploiting their partial convexities and making
   elegant nonlinear variable changes, they are recast as d.c. (difference
   of two convex) programs. Efficient d.c. iterative procedures are then
   developed to find the solutions. Simplified joint programs under the two
   cases of equal source power and equal relay beamforming weights,
   respectively, are also considered. Branch-and-bound algorithms of
   deterministic global optimization are then proposed for solving the
   simplified joint programs. Simulation results confirm the excellent
   performance and computational efficiency of all the proposed solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric actuators have been widely employed in various
   nanopositioning systems. Hysteresis exhibited by piezoelectric actuators
   can degrade their behavior, and thus the tracking performance of
   positioning systems. To improve the performance of the systems, control
   of hysteresis has been drawing considerable attention. One of the issues
   that remain to be addressed in the controller design is how to deal with
   the constraints (e. g., the input voltage) that might be applied to the
   piezoelectric actuators. To avoid overloading the piezoelectric
   actuators, the mechanism of saturation is typically employed in control
   schemes, which, however, can degrade the control performance. This paper
   presents the development of an inversion-based model predictive control
   with an integral-of-error state variable to compensate for the
   piezoelectric-actuator hysteresis. The proposed method allows for the
   consideration of constraints in the controller design. Theoretical proof
   of the zero steady-state error and disturbance rejection properties of
   the proposed method is also provided. To verify the effectiveness of the
   control method, experiments were conducted with the results showing that
   the proposed method can improve the performance of piezoelectric
   actuators.}},

Abstract = {{Precise and consistent production forecasting is indeed an important
   step for the management and planning of petroleum reservoirs. A new
   neural approach to forecast cumulative oil production using higher-order
   neural network (HONN) has been applied in this study. HONN overcomes the
   limitation of the conventional neural networks by representing linear
   and nonlinear correlations of neural input variables. Thus, HONN
   possesses a great potential in forecasting petroleum reservoir
   productions without sufficient training data. Simulation studies were
   carried out on a sandstone reservoir located in Cambay basin in Gujarat,
   India, to prove the efficacy of HONNs in forecasting cumulative oil
   production of the field with insufficient field data available. A
   pre-processing procedure was employed in order to reduce measurement
   noise in the production data from the oil field by using a low pass
   filter and optimal input variable selection using cross-correlation
   function (CCF). The results of these simulation studies indicate that
   the HONN models have good forecasting capability with high accuracy to
   predict cumulative oil production. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by

Title = {{Robust identification method for nonlinear model structures and its

Abstract = {{A common assumption is that the model structure is known for modelling
   high performance aircraft. In practice, this is not the case. Actually,
   structure identification plays the most important role in the processing
   of nonlinear system modelling. The integration of mode structure
   identification and parameter estimation is an efficient method to
   construct the model for high performance aircraft, which is nonlinear
   and also contains uncertainties. This article presents an efficient
   method for identifying nonlinear model structure and estimating
   parameters for high-performance aircraft model, which contains
   uncertainties. The parameters associated with nonlinear terms are
   considered one after the other if they should be included in the
   nonlinear model until a stopping criterion is met, which is based on
   Akaike's information criterion. A numerically efficient U-D
   factorisation is presented to avoid complex computation of high-order
   matrices. The proposed method is applied to flight test data of a
   high-performance aircraft. The results demonstrate that the proposed
   method could obtain the good aircraft model with a reasonably good
   fidelity based on the comparison with flight test data.}},

   results demonstrate that glass-ceramic materials are reproducibly
   obtained in all cases, with optically active Sm3+ ions stabilised within
   both the glass and crystalline phases formed during the synthesis. The
   obtained materials display strong orange-red emission under UV
   irradiation. Further, the materials are stable over a broad temperature
   interval with comparatively high glass transition temperatures (T-g
   above 300 degrees C), they are not sensitive to moisture and are thus
   suitable for a number of industrial applications.}},

Title = {{Reference dosimetry at the Australian Synchrotron's imaging and medical
   beamline using free-air ionization chamber measurements and theoretical
   predictions of air kerma rate and half value layer}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Novel, preclinical radiotherapy modalities are being developed
   at synchrotrons around the world, most notably stereotactic synchrotron
   radiation therapy and microbeam radiotherapy at the European Synchrotron
   Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. The imaging and medical beamline
   (IMBL) at the Australian Synchrotron has recently become available for
   preclinical radiotherapy and imaging research with clinical trials, a
   distinct possibility in the coming years. The aim of this present study
   was to accurately characterize the synchrotron-generated x-ray beam for
   the purposes of air kerma-based absolute dosimetry.
   Methods: The authors used a theoretical model of the energy spectrum
   from the wiggler source and validated this model by comparing the
   transmission through copper absorbers (0.1-3.0 mm) against real
   measurements conducted at the beamline. The authors used a low energy
   free air ionization chamber (LEFAC) from the Australian Radiation
   Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency and a commercially available free
   air chamber (ADC-105) for the measurements. The dimensions of these two
   chambers are different from one another requiring careful consideration
   of correction factors.
   Results: Measured and calculated half value layer (HVL) and air kerma
   rates differed by less than 3\% for the LEFAC when the ion chamber
   readings were corrected for electron energy loss and ion recombination.
   The agreement between measured and predicted air kerma rates was less
   satisfactory for the ADC-105 chamber, however. The LEFAC and ADC
   measurements produced a first half value layer of 0.405 +/- 0.015 and
   0.412 +/- 0.016 mm Cu, respectively, compared to the theoretical
   prediction of 0.427 +/- 0.012 mm Cu. The theoretical model based upon a
   spectrum calculator derived a mean beam energy of 61.4 keV with a first
   half value layer of approximately 30 mm in water.
   Conclusions: The authors showed in this study their ability to verify
   the predicted air kerma rate and x-ray attenuation curve on the IMBL
   using a simple experimental method, namely, HVL measurements. The HVL
   measurements strongly supports the x-ray beam spectrum, which in turn
   has a profound effect on x-ray dosimetry. (c) 2013 American Association

Abstract = {{This study compares the performance of uncalibrated and calibrated
   Highway Safety Manual (HSM) safety performance functions (SPFs) with
   jurisdiction-specific SPFs. The first edition of the HSM includes a
   number of SPFs which can be used to identify collision-prone locations
   on a roadway network. The HSM recommends that these SPFs be calibrated
   to more accurately reflect a specific jurisdiction's unique roadway
   characteristics, driver behaviour, etc. and to produce better-fitting
   results. An alternative approach is the creation of
   jurisdiction-specific SPFs. This study used negative binomial regression
   and 5 years of collision data (2005-2009) from the City of Regina,
   Saskatchewan to develop a set of SPFs. Three intersection categories
   were investigated: 3-leg unsignalized, 4-leg unsignalized, and 3- and
   4-leg signalized. The SPFs provided in the HSM were calibrated using the
   Regina data, and a set of calibration factors was produced. To compare
   the different SPFs and find the best-fitting SPFs for the study region,
   the study used statistical goodness-of-fit tests and cumulative residual
   plots. The jurisdiction-specific SPFs provided the best fit to the data,
   and would be the best SPFs for predicting collisions at 3- and 4-leg
   intersections in the City of Regina.}},

Abstract = {{During a period of heliospheric disturbance in 2007-9 associated with a
   co-rotating interaction region (CIR), a characteristic periodic
   variation becomes apparent in neutron monitor data. This variation is
   phase-locked to periodic heliospheric current sheet crossings.
   Phase-locked electrical variations are also seen in the terrestrial
   lower atmosphere in the southern UK, including an increase in the
   vertical conduction current density of fair weather atmospheric
   electricity during increases in galactic cosmic ray-induced neutron
   monitor count rate at the surface and energetic proton count rates
   measured by geosynchronous spacecraft. At the same time as the
   conduction current increases, changes in the cloud microphysical
   properties lead to an increase in the detected height of the cloud base
   at Lerwick Observatory, Shetland, with associated changes in surface
   meteorological quantities. As electrification is expected at the base of
   layer clouds, which can influence droplet properties, these observations
   of phase-locked thermodynamic, cloud, atmospheric electricity and solar
   sector changes are not inconsistent with a heliospheric disturbance
   driving lower troposphere changes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Evidence of measurement precision, annual changes and monitoring time
   interval is essential when designing and interpreting longitudinal
   studies. Despite the precise measures, small annual changes in bone
   properties led to monitoring time intervals (MTIs) of 2-6 years in
   peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT)-derived radial and
   tibial bone area, density, and estimated strength in postmenopausal
   women.
   The purpose of the study was to determine the precision error, annual
   change, and MTI in bone density, area, and strength parameters in
   postmenopausal women.
   Postmenopausal women (n = 114) from the Saskatoon cohort of the Canadian
   Multicentre Osteoporosis Study had annual pQCT scans of the distal and
   shaft sites of the radius and tibia for 2 years. Median annualized rates
   of percent change and the MTI were calculated for bone density, area,
   and strength parameters. Root mean squared coefficients of variation
   (CV\%) were calculated from duplicate scans in a random subgroup of 35
   postmenopausal women.
   CV\% ranged from 1.4 to 6.1 \% at the radius and 0.7 to 2.1 \% at the
   tibia. MTIs for the distal radius were 3 years for total bone density
   (ToD) and 4 years for total bone cross sectional area (ToA), trabecular
   area, and bone strength index. At the diaphyseal radius, MTI was 3 years
   for ToA, 5 years for cortical density, and 6 years for polar stress
   strain index (SSIp). Similarly, MTI for total and trabecular density was
   3 years at the distal tibia. At the diaphyseal tibia, MTI for ToA was 3
   years and SSIp 4 years.
   MTI for longitudinal studies in older postmenopausal women should be at
   least 2-6 years at the radius and tibia, with specific monitoring of the
   total and trabecular area, total density, and bone strength at the
   radius and total and trabecular density, total area, and bone strength
   at the tibia.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{The motion of a person wearing protective clothing induces the clothing
   to move periodically towards the skin causing a cyclic variation in the
   air gap between the fabric and the skin. At the same time, the clothing
   movement causes cooling air to periodically flow into the air gap

   to investigate these two effects and the resultant effect of the
   protective clothing movement on its performance during flash fire
   exposure. Special attention is drawn to the air gap model since it
   responds directly to the clothing movement. A parametric study is
   carried out to investigate the influence of a wider range of clothing
   movement. Specifically, the effect of the variation in the periodic
   movement frequency and amplitude on the clothing performance was
   investigated. The results show that increasing the movement frequency
   improves the clothing protective performance, while increasing the
   movement amplitude worsens the clothing performance.}},

Abstract = {{Tailings sand associated with oil sands mining contains saline
   process-affected pore-water which can have a detrimental impact on the
   performance of reclamation covers. A reclamation cover site, located at
   the Syncrude Canada Ltd.'s South West Sand Storage facility (SWSS),
   consisted of 45cm of cover soil over tailings sand. The site was
   instrumented in 2001 to measure real-time local meteorology, soil
   temperature, water content and suction over an eight-year period. A
   one-dimensional numerical model (VADOSE/W) was created to calculate
   moisture fluxes through the cover/tailings interface over a long-term
   period (51 years). A pore-water volume method was then used to evaluate
   the potential risk of salt transport into the overlying cover soil. The
   long-term modelling demonstrated that the cumulative water flux across
   the cover/tailings interface is downward, towards the water table, when
   the water table is deeper than 3m below the cover/tailings interface;
   although the water flux across this interface in any single year may be
   upward. The risk of cover salinisation due to the upward movement of
   saline tailings pore-water from the underlying water table under these
   conditions was low (less than one occurrence in over 50 years).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Colonoscopy is common procedure frequently carried out. It is not
   without its problems, which include looping formation. Looping formation
   prevents the tip of the colonoscope itself from advancing, thus further
   probing induces a risk of perforation, significant patient discomfort,
   and failure of colonoscopy. During colonoscopy, the manipulated
   colonoscope for intubation in the colon goes through the friction
   between the colonoscope and the colon. Due to major frictional force,
   the sigmoidal colon forms looping with the scope during intubation. The
   interactive frictional force between the colon and the colonoscope is
   highly complex because of frictional contact between two deformable
   objects. In this paper, contact force computation was formulated into a
   linear complementarity problem (LCP) by linearizing Signorini's problem,
   which was adapted into non-interpenetration with unilateral constraints.
   Frictional force was computed by the mechanical compliance of finite
   element method (FEM) models with the consideration of dynamic friction
   between the colonoscope and the intestinal wall. Furthermore, we
   presented a mathematical model of the elongation of the colon that
   predicts the motion of scope relative to the intestinal wall in
   colonoscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Gasification process is regarded as a viable option for disposal of
   various types of organic waste. Its application to meat and bone meal
   (MBM) and dried distillers grains (DDG) is a new concept that is
   recently receiving more attention as possible strategy for safe
   recycling of these materials to benefit from their energy and nutrient
   value. Besides, this process produces ash that is rich in phosphorus (P)
   and may be suitable for utilization as a P fertilizer. Therefore, the
   objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of these
   specific types of ashes as P fertilizer via evaluating their direct
   effect on canola growth, P uptake, apparent P recovery and changes in
   some selected soil chemical properties after their addition to a
   P-deficient soil.
   A growth chamber experiment was set up to meet the study objective. The
   experimental treatments included meat and bone meal ash (MBMA) and dried
   distillers grains ash (DDGA) applied at three rates (25, 50, or 100 kg P
   ha(-1)) in comparison to a mineral (mono-calcium phosphate) fertilizer
   (MP) applied at the same rates in addition to non-P-treated soil
   (control).
   After a growth period of 5 weeks, the DDGA was the most effective ash
   type and provided biomass yield, P uptake, and apparent P recovery
   better or similar to that of MP, indicating high availability of its P.
   The MBMA had a limited effect on measured crop variables, suggesting
   that a significant portion of this ash P is present in insoluble form
   and is not as readily available for plant uptake. This was also
   indicated by its lesser effect on enhancing extractable available P
   remaining in soil after harvest in comparison to MP or DDGA. Application
   of all ash material caused a slight but significant change in soil
   content of inorganic N as well as soil pH and EC; however, this change
   was more evident with DDGA treatments.
   Ash derived from gasified DDG was the most effective P fertilizer and
   was comparable to mineral fertilizer. The results of this study
   demonstrated that the effectiveness of organic material ash as a P
   fertilizer is controlled by the type of gasified feedstock. The positive
   results obtained from this study should stimulate further research on
   utilization of these ashes as a source of P for different crops in
   different soil types, especially repeated application under field
   conditions.}},

Title = {{Application of radioactive particle tracking to indicate shed fouling in

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1175-1182}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The stripper section of a fluid-coker consists of a system of baffles
   (sheds) that enhances the removal efficiency of entrained and adsorbed
   hydrocarbons from the fluidised coke-particles. If the particles contain
   a thin liquid film layer of heavy hydrocarbons, making them excessively
   wet' or sticky', and if they stay in contact with sheds for too long,
   solid deposits are formed that lead to stripper fouling. Extensive
   fouling decreases stripping efficiency and liquid product yield and can
   shorten run-times between shutdowns. Because of the fouling, the shape
   of sheds mostly changes by increasing their surfaces thickness. An early
   indication of that fouling and the ability to follow its development are
   essential for choosing optimal parameters of the process. The
   radioactive particle tracking (RPT) method has been tested to determine
   its applicability to indicate the change in the shape of internals
   within a fluidised bed reactor when direct observation is impossible. A
   single radioactive tracer-particle has been traced in experiments
   lasting from 2 to 6h. The experiments were conducted in a lab-scale,
   cold-flow fluidised bed into which a single shed with walls of different
   thickness was incorporated. This experimental fluidised bed provides
   intensive solid phase mixing that allows a single tracer-particle to be
   located in any place within the reactor. By registering the frequency of
   the tracer-particle appearance within a defined internal space
   surrounding the shed, the shape of shed was reconstructed. The conducted
   experiments suggest that RPT technique allows for tracking internals'
   fouling within a fluidised bed reactor. (c) 2012 Canadian Society for

   becoming progressively essential. Much attention is focused on
   identifying suitable biomass species that can provide high energy
   outputs to replace conventional fossil fuels. The current study
   emphasizes on some commonly available biomasses in North America such as
   pinewood, timothy grass, and wheat straw for their usage towards next
   generation biofuels. Fast pyrolysis of the feedstocks was performed at
   450 A degrees C to generate biochars that were further characterized to
   advocate their energy and agronomic relevance. The biomasses were
   examined physiochemically to understand their compositional and
   structural characteristics through analytical approaches such as CHNS
   (carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur), ICP-MS (inductively coupled
   plasma-mass spectrometry), particle size, FTIR (Fourier transform
   infrared) and Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric and differential
   thermogravimetric, XRD (X-ray diffraction), and high-pressure liquid
   chromatography. The chemical composition of feedstocks significantly
   differed from that of biochars and the variations among feedstock
   composition were also found to be greater than for biochars. The
   presence of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin along with other
   organic components were identified in the spectroscopic and
   chromatographic analysis. The FTIR spectra of biochars showed removal of
   oxygen- and hydrogen-containing functionalities from feedstocks due to
   pyrolysis at higher temperature, although retaining certain significant
   cellulose-derived functionalities. A number of crystallographic phases
   in the XRD of biomass, ash, and biochars were due to minerals commonly
   Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Fe, and Mn. ICP-MS of biochars demonstrated substantial
   amount of alkali elements indicating their compatibility towards soil
   amendment for restoring degraded soils.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural biomass residue such as barley, canola, oat and wheat straw
   has the potential to be used for sustainable production of bio-fuels and
   offset greenhouse gas emissions. The biomass substrate must be processed
   and handled in an efficient manner in order to reduce industry's
   operational cost as well as meet the requirement of raw material for
   biofuel production. Biomass has low bulk density, making it difficult
   and costly to store and transport in its native loose form. Therefore,
   in this study, an integrated approach to densification of non-treated
   and steam exploded barley, canola, oat and wheat straw was developed.
   During this process, the significance of major contributing factors
   (independent variables such as biomass type, treatment, pressure and
   grind size) on pellet density, durability and specific energy were
   determined. It has been found that applied pressure (60.4\%) was the
   most significant factor affecting pellet density followed by the
   application of steam explosion pre-treatment (39.4\%) for lab-scale
   single pelleting experiments. Similarly, the type of biomass (47.1\%) is
   the most significant factor affecting durability followed by the
   application of pre-treatment (38.2\%) and grind size (14.6\%) for
   pellets manufactured using the pilot-scale pellet mill. Also, applied
   pressure (58.3\%) was the most significant factor affecting specific
   energy required to manufacture pellets followed by the biomass (15.3\%),
   pre-treatment (13.3\%) and grind size (13.2\%), which had lower but
   similar effect on specific energy for lab-scale single pelleting
   experiments. Overall energy analysis of post-harvest processing and
   densification of agricultural straw was performed, which showed that a
   significant portion of original agricultural biomass energy (89\%-94\%)
   is available for the production of biofuels. Almost, similar amount of
   specific energy is required to produce pellets from barley, canola, oat
   and wheat straw grinds. Customized pellets having steam exploded straw
   required more energy to manufacture resulting in availability of only
   89\% of total energy for biofuel production.}},

Abstract = {{Samples of wheat distillers grain with solubles were prepared at 15\%,
   30\%, and 45\% condensed distillers solubles (CDS) and dried under 40
   degrees C, 80 degrees C, and 120 degrees C to examine the effects of CDS
   level and drying temperature on their chemical, physical, flow,
   compression, thermal, and frictional properties. As CDS level increased,
   protein and ash contents increased while fat and fiber contents
   decreased. Fat and acid detergent fiber contents were also markedly
   affected by drying temperature. While CDS level, drying temperature, and
   their interaction significantly affected a number of the physical
   properties, results suggest that CDS level had a stronger influence.
   Samples with high CDS level, for example, were significantly finer,
   denser, less flowable, and less dispersible than those with lower CDS.
   These samples also had significantly higher thermal diffusivity and
   coefficient of internal friction and produced pellets with higher
   failure stresses than those with lower CDS. Their pellet density
   increased with CDS level and was also significantly affected by drying
   temperature. Further, the samples were classified as fairly flowable and
   floodable and their compression characteristics were adequately
   described by the Kawakita-Ludde model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an overview of a field program undertaken to assess
   wellbore integrity in a 54-year old vertical well, conducted as a
   component of the IEAGHG Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage
   Project. The well investigated had been drilled to a depth of 1471 m
   (4824 ft), cased with 139.7 mm (5.5 in.) production casing and cemented
   with a 1-to-1 blend of Portland cement and pozzolan. Cased-hole logging
   indicated that the top of the cemented annulus was located approximately
   500 m (1640 ft) above total depth of the well. A built-for-purpose tool
   was used to conduct pressure transient (vertical interference) testing
   to assess the hydraulic properties of the cemented annulus within the
   Watrous Formation, which serves as the regional seal in the vicinity of
   the Weyburn and Midale fields. A modified version of an existing tool
   was used to mill through casing then drill small cement core samples.
   This paper presents an overview of the entire testing program, and a
   detailed account of the analysis methodology used to estimate the
   equivalent permeability of the cemented annulus from a vertical
   interference test. The results of this analysis suggest that vertical
   permeability of the cemented annulus is very low, falling somewhere in
   the 7-80 microdarcy range. This result is consistent with cased-hole
   logging results; more specifically, the combined interpretation of sonic
   and ultrasonic logs, which suggest effective cement emplacement, and the
   paucity of casing defects identified by an electromagnetic log, which
   suggests the cement sheath has effectively shielded the casing from
   exposure to native formation fluids. The results presented here
   demonstrate that a well constructed using standard practices and
   materials of the 1950s can serve as an effective barrier against CO2
   migration, although similar work should be undertaken in more wells to
   confirm that this holds across a broad spectrum of conditions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The interactions between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM)
   are important with respect to a number of cell behavoirs, yet remain
   unclear. In this study, self-assembled monolayers with different
   terminal chemical groups (hydroxyl (-OH), carboxyl (-COOH), animo
   (-NH2), mercapto (-SH), and methyl (-CH3)) were employed as substrates
   for the culture of MCF-7 cells to examine effects on cell behavior. Cell
   spreading was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, tallin
   expression by immunofluorescence, proliferation rate by counting cell
   numbers, cell cycle by flow cytometry, metabolism by high-performance
   liquid chromatography and cell migration by live cell imaging. Annexin
   V-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and JC-1 assays were performed to
   determine cell apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential,
   respectively. Our results demonstrate the varied behaviors of MCF-7
   cells in response to different chemical groups. Specifically, NH2 and
   COOH terminal functional groups promote proliferation, the production of
   lactic acid and mobility of MCF-7 cells; SH and OH terminal groups
   enhance the expression and distribution of tallin but result in weak
   cell proliferation, metabolism, spreading and mobility. These results
   are meaningful for uncovering the interactions between the ECM and
   cancer cells; they are potentially useful for designing novel cancer
   treatment strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Two groups of catalysts containing Ni and/or Co metals and MgAlOx as
   support material were made using coprecipitation and incipient wetness
   impregnation methods, respectively. The mechanism of metal particle
   growth during reduction of the monometallic Ni or Co and bimetallic
   Ni-Co catalysts was studied using X-ray absorption near edge
   spectroscopy (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure
   spectroscopy (EXAFS). The results show that the bimetallic Ni-Co
   catalysts made by coprecipitation method resulted in smaller metal
   nanoparticles upon reduction. TEM confirmed this observation and
   revealed that this catalyst has well-dispersed, more uniform metal
   particles. The metal reduction extent of Ni monometallic catalysts and
   the bimetallic catalysts made by impregnation was similar with respect
   to each metal. For the bimetallic Ni-Co catalysts made by
   coprecipitation, the interactions between two metals in reduction were
   observed such that Ni reduction was mitigated by Co, and Co reduction
   was promoted by Ni. And the first derivative of XANES of such made
   catalysts indicated stronger interaction between Ni and Co atoms and,
   perhaps, alloy formation. Time resolved analysis found that Ni reduction
   followed the second order kinetics at early stage and Co proceeded
   through the zero order all the way in catalyst reduction. The catalyst
   stability enhancement by Co atoms and the mechanism of Ni and Co
   interaction during reduction are explained. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All

Abstract = {{Bio-oil derived from biomass can be used to produce hydrogen which will
   be a key player for global economy. In the present study steam reforming
   of acetic acid was conducted in a fixed bed reactor with different
   supported metal catalysts in a temperature range of 500-750 degrees C.
   In this study Ni-Co, Ni-Co/CeO2/ZrO2 and lanthanum oxide promoted
   Ni/La2O3/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared either by wet impregnation or by
   co-precipitation method and characterized by XRD, SEM-EDX, TG-DTA, BET
   and TEM analysis. It was found that bimetallic and without support
   catalyst Ni-Co (0.25: 1) had higher activity and H-2 yield compared with
   Ni-Co/CeO2/ZrO2 and 17\% Ni/La2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. The effects of
   reaction temperature, space time (W/F-A0), acetic acid feed
   concentration and time-on-stream were studied in detail over Ni-Co
   catalyst. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Green seed canola (GSC) oil is a nonedible potential feedstock for
   biodiesel production. In this work, 12-tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) was
   supported by using organic functional group (i.e. APTES) and was
   incorporated into the SBA-15 structure. The catalysts were characterized
   by BET, XRD, FTIR, Raman, TPD and ICP-MS analysis techniques. The
   catalytic activity of these catalysts was tested using a stirred tank
   reactor. From the study, organic functional group anchored TPA on SBA-15
   shows higher catalytic activity for esterification of free fatty acid
   (FFA), whereas TPA incorporated into SBA-15 shows higher catalytic
   activity for transesterification, for biodiesel production from waste
   green seed canola oil. A 45 wt\% TPA incorporated SBA-15 produces the
   ester yield of 97.33 wt\%, when 2.96 wt\% catalyst (based on green seed
   canola oil) and 25.84 methanol to green seed canola (GSC) oil molar
   ratio are used at 200 degrees C for reaction time of 6.25 h. Besides,
   the catalyst also improves the quality of the biodiesel by adsorbing
   chlorophyll from the feedstock (75.56\% chlorophyll removal), during
   transesterification reaction. Kinetic study shows that the formation of
   methyl oleate is the slowest, compared to other fatty acid methyl ester
   (FAME) formation. The thermodynamic property values also agree with this
   result. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper investigates the comparative enzymatic hydrolysis of
   cod liver oil with Candida cylindracea lipase (CCL) and Candida rugosa
   lipase (CRL) in biphasic solvent system for the production of free fatty
   acids (FFAs). These two lipases were characterized for their
   physiochemical properties with methods such as BET surface area
   analyzer, particle size analyzer and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
   spectroscopy to find the relationship between the characteristic and
   activity. The yield of FFAs from cod liver oil was studied by varying
   suitable reaction conditions such as pH, temperature, agitation speed,
   water and solvent concentrations. The maximum FFAs yields of 36.3 and
   26.1 wt\% FFAs (equivalent to 122.9 and 88.6 mu moles FFAs formed/ml)
   were obtained for CCL and CRL respectively under the most suitable
   reaction conditions. The Michaelis-Menten kinetic model was found to fit
   satisfactorily for the hydrolysis of cod liver oil with both CCL and CRL
   enzymes and the kinetic parameters such as maximum rate of reaction
   (V-max) and rate constant (K-M) were calculated. The activation energy
   (E = 21.3 kJ/mol) demonstrates that the hydrolysis of cod liver oil is
   kinetically controlled and free from mass transfer limitations under the
   experimental conditions studied. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{In the present work, a series of FeW/SBA-15 catalysts were prepared and
   screened for their hydrodesulfurization and hydrodenitrogenation
   activities using bitumen-derived heavy gas oil from Athabasca. A
   systematic process optimization study has been conducted to investigate
   the optimum process conditions required to evaluate kinetic parameters
   for these reactions. Catalyst metal loadings were varied from 0 to 5 and
   15 to 45 wt.\% for Fe and W, respectively; resulting in an optimum
   catalyst (Cat-5) with metal loadings of 3.0 and 30.0 wt.\% for Fe and W,
   respectively. Several techniques were employed to characterize the
   prepared catalysts and activity results have been correlated with that
   obtained from characterization. Hydrotreating experiments were performed
   in a continuous flow micro trickle-bed reactor at the temperatures,
   pressures, and LHSVs of 633-693 degrees K, 7.6-9.6 MPa, and 0.5-2 h(-1),
   respectively, with H-2 flow rate and catalyst weight maintained constant
   at 50 mL/min and 1.5 g, respectively, in all cases. Three kinetic models
   were applied to fit experimental data obtained from HDS and HDN reaction
   studies evaluated within temperature range of 633-693 degrees K. The
   optimum operating conditions for maximum sulfur and nitrogen conversions
   occurred at temperature, pressure, and LHSV of 673 degrees K, 8.8 MPa,
   and 1 h(-1), respectively. Experimental data fitted with the Power Law
   model yielded reaction orders of 2.0 and 1.5 for HDS and HDN reactions,
   respectively; and activation energies of 129.6 kJ/mol and 150.6 kJ/mol,
   respectively. By fitting a modified power law model (Multi-parameter
   model) to the kinetic data yielded hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and
   hydrotreating (HDN) reactions orders of 2.2 and 1.8, with respective
   activation energies of 126.7 kJ/mol and 118.8 kJ/mol. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{CATALYSIS TODAY}},

Abstract = {{SBA-15-supported nickel phosphides with a Ni/P atomic ratio of 2 and 0.5
   were prepared by temperature programmed reduction method (TPR). The
   phase purity and structural/surface properties were studied by X-ray
   diffraction and N-2 sorption measurements respectively. X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) analysis of the passivated catalysts confirmed the
   presence of Ni12P5 and Ni2P phases in catalysts prepared from oxidic
   precursors. Supports and catalysts were thoroughly characterized using
   other techniques such as SEM, EDAX, and TEM. Results from low angle XRD
   measurements confirmed the presence of hexagonally ordered mesoporous
   structure in SBA-15 material. Hydrotreating experiments were conducted
   under industrial conditions using coker light gas oil (CLGO) as feed
   which contains 2439 ppm nitrogen 23,420 ppm sulfur respectively. The
   activity results show that SBA-15 supported NixPy catalysts show higher
   catalytic activities compared to reference NiMo/SBA-15 and
   NiMo/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts under similar reaction conditions. This
   higher catalytic activity of NixPy/SBA-15 is due to the structure and
   surface chemical properties of this phase which is resistant to sulfur
   poisoning. It was also found that the Ni/P ratio had a profound effect
   on the active structure and hydroprocessing behavior of the NixPy/SBA-15
   catalysts. The HDS and HDN conversions was found in the following order
   NixPy/SBA-15 (0.5) > NixPy/SBA-15 (2.0) > NiMo/SBA-15 >
   NiMo/gamma-Al2O3. The NixPy/SBA-15 (0.5) catalyst showed higher HDS and
   HDN activities compared with NixPy/SBA-15 (2.0) catalyst which has lower
   P content. The higher amount of P content in NixPy/SBA-15 (0.5) catalyst
   modifies the nature of the nickel in that catalyst and increased the
   amount of octahedral nickel species and causes higher hydrotreating
   activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CATALYSIS TODAY}},

Month = {{MAY 30}},
Abstract = {{NiMo catalysts were prepared on different hetero atom doped SBA-15
   supports for hydrotreatment evaluation. The nature of the hetero atom
   (Ti, Zr and TiZr) was observed to have a profound impact on the final
   molybdenum phase formed after calcination of the catalysts. Mo L-3 edge
   XANES analysis of the catalysts along with results from Raman and XRD,
   show that Zr-SBA-15 support is able to disperse the Molybdenum oxide
   phase better than the other supports. The formation of bulk phases viz.,
   MoO3 and NiMoO4 is accelerated in pure SBA-15 supports. Evidence of Mo
   present as tetrahedral MoO4 units was only found in TiZr-SBA-15 support.
   The presence of tetrahedral Mo species on TiZr-SBA-15 support was
   attributed to be due to the relative positive charge on the Zr site
   arising from the electronegative difference between Ti and Zr leading to
   {[}MoO4](2-) stabilization. Sulfidation studies of the catalysts
   revealed that formation of active NiMoS phase is maximum in Zr-SBA-15
   support and minimum in the SBA-15 supported catalysts. The low
   sulfidation of Mo in SBA-15 and TiZr-SBA-15 was due to the presence of
   bulk MoO3 phase. The hydrotreating activities were in confirmation with
   the characterization studies, with NiMo/Zr-SBA-15 and NiMo/Ti-SBA-15
   exhibiting highest HDS and HDN conversions respectively. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Biased target ion beam deposition (BTIBD) was firstly used to synthesize
   hydrogen free diamond-like carbon (DLC) thin films. The structure and
   properties of the synthesized films were characterized by atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS), nanoindentation, and ball-on-disk testing. The effect of target
   bias voltage, ranging from - 200 to - 1000 V, on the structure and
   properties of the films was investigated. The results show that the
   sp(3) bonding content increases from 20\% to 60\%, the root-mean squared
   (RMS) roughness decreases from 0.2 nm to 0.05 nm, the coefficient of
   friction (COF) decreases from 03 to 0.06, the hardness increases from
   4.5 GPa to 15 GPa, and the Young's modulus increases from 65 GPa to 170
   GPa with increasing the absolute value of target bias voltage from 200 V
   to 800 V. However, when the target bias voltage further increased to -
   1000 V, the sp(3) bonding content decreases to 44\%, RMS roughness
   increases to 0.09 nm, COF raises to 0.11, hardness decreases to 12.9 GPa
   and Young's modulus is lowered to 150 GPa. It has been found that the
   higher the fraction of sp(3) bonds, the lower the surface roughness and
   friction coefficient, and the higher the hardness and Young's modulus.

Title = {{Flux-freezing breakdown in high-conductivity magnetohydrodynamic

Abstract = {{The idea of `frozen-in' magnetic field lines for ideal plasmas(1) is
   useful to explain diverse astrophysical phenomena(2), for example the
   shedding of excess angular momentum from protostars by twisting of field
   lines frozen into the interstellar medium. Frozen-in field lines,
   however, preclude the rapid changes in magnetic topology observed at
   high conductivities, as in solar flares(2,3). Microphysical plasma
   processes are a proposed explanation of the observed high rates(4-6),
   but it is an open question whether such processes can rapidly reconnect
   astrophysical flux structures much greater in extent than several
   thousand ion gyroradii. An alternative explanation(7,8) is that
   turbulent Richardson advection(9) brings field lines implosively
   together from distances far apart to separations of the order of
   gyroradii. Here we report an analysis of a simulation of
   magnetohydrodynamic turbulence at high conductivity that exhibits
   Richardson dispersion. This effect of advection in rough velocity
   fields, which appear non-differentiable in space, leads to line motions
   that are completely indeterministic or `spontaneously stochastic', as
   predicted in analytical studies(10-13). The turbulent breakdown of
   standard flux freezing at scales greater than the ion gyroradius can
   explain fast reconnection of very large-scale flux structures, both
   observed (solar flares and coronal mass ejections) and predicted (the
   inner heliosheath, accretion disks, gamma-ray bursts and so on). For
   laminar plasma flows with smooth velocity fields or for low turbulence
   intensity, stochastic flux freezing reduces to the usual frozen-in
   condition.

Abstract = {{Reduced protein quality is one of the concerns currently confronting the
   supply and utilization of wheat distillers dried grain with solubles
   (DDGS) as an animal feed ingredient. This study assessed the protein
   quality of wheat DDGS, expressed as acid detergent insoluble crude
   protein (ADICP) and lysine content, by blending wet distillers grain
   (WDG) with varying condensed distillers solubles (CDS) levels and drying
   using forced air convection, microwave, and microwaveconvection methods.
   As the CDS level was increased, the protein content of wheat DDGS
   generated from the three drying methods increased. Interactions of CDS
   level with drying air temperature, microwave power, and
   microwaveconvection settings had a significant effect (p<0.05) on
   average ADICP and lysine contents. Higher ADICP and lower lysine
   contents were observed in samples dried at higher temperature, microwave
   power, and microwave convection settings. Further, the CDS level
   significantly affected the color parameters of microwave- and
   microwaveconvection-dried samples and the drying air temperatureCDS
   level interaction significantly affected the color of forced air
   convectiondried samples. Significant lysine contentredness,
   ADICPlightness color parameter, and ADICPtotal color difference

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Refraction x-ray contrast is an imaging modality used primarily in a
   research setting at synchrotron facilities, which have a biomedical
   imaging research program. The most common method for exploiting
   refraction contrast is by using a technique called Diffraction Enhanced
   Imaging (DEI). The DEI apparatus allows the detection of refraction
   between two materials and produces a unique ``edge enhanced{''} contrast
   appearance, very different from the traditional absorption x-ray imaging
   used in clinical radiology. In this paper we aim to explain the features
   of x-ray refraction contrast as a typical clinical radiologist would
   understand. Then a discussion regarding what needs to be considered in
   the interpretation of the refraction image takes place. Finally we
   present a discussion about the limitations of planar refraction imaging
   and the potential of DEI Computed Tomography.

   Applications}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Hall plasma devices with electron E x B drift are subject to a class of
   long wavelength instabilities driven by the electron current, gradients
   of plasma density, temperature, and magnetic field. In the first
   companion paper {[}Frias et al., Phys. Plasmas 19, 072112 (2012)], the
   theory of these modes was revisited. In this paper, we apply analytical
   theory to show that modern Hall thrusters exhibit azimuthal and axial
   oscillations in the frequency spectrum from tens KHz to few MHz, often
   observed in experiments. The azimuthal phase velocity of these modes is
   typically one order of magnitude lower than the E x B drift velocity.
   The growth rate of these modes scales inversely with the square root of
   the ion mass, similar to 1/root m(i). It is shown that several different
   thruster configurations share the same common feature: the gradient
   drift instabilities are localized in two separate regions, near the
   anode and in the plume region, and absent in the acceleration region.
   Our analytical results show complex interaction of plasma and magnetic
   field gradients and the E x B drift flow as the sources of the
   instability. The special role of plasma density gradient is revealed and
   it is shown that the previous theory is not applicable in the region
   where the ion flux density is not uniform. This is particularly
   important for near anode region due to ionization and in the plume
   region due to diverging ion flux. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Beamforming design for multi-user wireless relay networks under the
   criterion of maximin information throughput is an important but also
   very hard optimization problem due to its nonconvex nature. The existing
   approach to reformulate the design as a matrix rank-one constrained
   optimization problem is highly inefficient. This paper exploits the d.c.
   (difference of two convex functions) structure of the objective function
   and the convex structure of the constraints in such a global
   optimization problem to develop efficient iterative algorithms of very
   low complexity to find the solutions. Both cases of concurrent and
   orthogonal transmissions from sources to relays are considered.
   Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithms provide
   solutions that are very close to the upper bound on the solution of the
   non-orthogonal source transmissions case and are almost equal to the
   optimal solution of the orthogonal source transmissions case. This
   demonstrates the ability of the developed algorithms to locate
   approximations close to the global optimal solutions in a few
   iterations. Moreover, the proposed methods are superior to other methods
   in both performance and computation complexity.}},

   within peat foundations below three different railway embankments in
   response to cyclic heavy axle loading. The study sites include two at
   Canadian National (CN) Railway's Edson and Lac-La-Biche subdivisions in
   northern Alberta, and one at CN's Levis subdivision in southeastern
   Quebec. The three sites were instrumented to monitor the spatial
   distribution of strain, pore pressure generation, and stress, and the
   distribution of horizontal cyclic displacement with depth during the
   passage of trains. The horizontal cyclic displacement with depth was
   measured using a ShapeAccelArray (SAA). An analysis was conducted to
   determine how close the peat is to yielding under heavy axle loads. This
   analysis was based on the elastic response determined from undrained
   triaxial testing, a constitutive model developed for peat, and finite
   element modelling. The field response and the numerical modelling
   suggest that the embankments at the northern Alberta sites are stable
   under current loading conditions. The highest potential for yielding at
   these sites occurs just beneath the embankment and at the interface
   between the peat and underlying stiffer soil. At the Levis site the
   analysis suggests that a recently constructed ditch concentrates shear
   stress at a location where the principal stress orientation corresponds
   to a reduced strength of peat and may have increased the potential for
   yielding.}},

Abstract = {{Colonoscopy is the most sensitive and specific means for detection of
   colon cancers and polyps. To make colonoscopy more effective several
   problems must be overcome including: pain associated with the procedure,
   the risk of perforation, and incomplete intubation colonoscopy.
   Technically, these problems are the result of loop formation during
   colonoscopy. Although, several solutions such as modifying the stiffness
   of the colonoscope, using an overtube and developing image-guided
   instruments have been introduced to resolve the looping problem, the
   results of these systems are not completely satisfactory. A new paradigm
   to overcome loop formation is proposed that is doctor-assistive
   colonoscopy. In this approach, the endoscopists performance is enhanced
   by providing using a kinetic model that provides information such as the
   shape of the scope, direction of the colon and forces exerted within
   certain sections. It is expected that with the help of this model, the
   endoscopist would be able to adjust the manipulation to avoid loop
   formation. In the present studies, the kinetic model is developed and
   validated using an ex vivo colonoscopy test-bed with a comprehensive
   kinematic and kinetic data collection. The model utilizes an established
   colon model based on animal tissue with position tracking sensors,
   contact force sensors for the intraluminal portion of the scope and a
   Colonoscopy Force Monitor for the external insertion tube.}},

Abstract = {{The production of ethanol from sugarcane bagasse by simultaneous
   saccharification and fermentation (SSF) using thermotolerant
   Kluveromyces marxianus var. marxianus and commercial cellulase of
   Accellerase 1000 was investigated. Sugarcane bagasse pretreated with
   NaOH at the room temperature for 24 h resulted in an increase in
   cellulose content to 55.2\% (w/w). With 10\% of water-insoluble-solids
   (WIS) at pH 5.0 supplemented with 0.2 ml cellulase/g-WIS and 1 g/L of
   thermotolerant yeast, the SSF of pretreated sugarcane bagasse conducted
   in flasks led to a respective theoretical ethanol yield of 85.1\%,
   92.2\% and 76.2\% under 37, 42 and 45 degrees C As the rotary drum
   reactor was scaled up to 100L and loaded with 10 kg alkali-pretreated
   sugarcane bagasse, the SSF at 42 degrees C for 72 h along with same
   doses of WIS, cellulase and yeast resulted in a final ethanol
   concentration and the theoretical ethanol yield of 24.6 g/L and 79\%,
   respectively. These observations indicated that the performance and the
   chosen SSF operating conditions for the scale-up drum reactor was as
   effective as those attained from flask runs. As demonstrated, the use of
   rotary drum reactor for cellulosic ethanol production under SSF
   operating conditions is simple to scale up and shows commercial
   potential. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The decimal multiplication is one of the most important decimal
   arithmetic operations which have a growing demand in the area of
   commercial, financial, and scientific computing. In this paper, we
   propose a parallel decimal multiplication algorithm with three
   components, which are a partial product generation, a partial product
   reduction, and a final digit-set conversion. First, a redundant number
   system is applied to recode not only the multiplier, but also multiples
   of the multiplicand in signed-digit (SD) numbers. Furthermore, we
   present a multioperand SD addition algorithm to reduce the partial
   product array. Finally, a digit-set conversion algorithm with a hybrid
   prefix network to decrease the number of the logic gates on the critical
   path is discussed. An analysis of the timing delay and an HDL model
   synthesized under 90 nm technology show that by considering the tradeoff
   of designs among three components, the overall delay of the proposed 16
   x 16-digit multiplier takes about 11 percent less timing delay with 2
   percent less area compared to the current fastest design.}},

Abstract = {{Castor oil methyl ester (COME) was produced by reactive extraction of
   castor seed and the purpose of this study is to investigate the
   feasibility of the reaction and to find out optimum reaction conditions.
   Reactive extraction of castor seed was carried out at varied reaction
   conditions such as oil to methanol molar ratio (1:50-1:250), catalyst
   concentration (0.5-2\%), temperature (35-65 degrees C) and rate of
   mixing (200-800 rpm) and the effect of above parameters on reactive
   extraction were investigated. The optimum reaction conditions for
   reactive extraction were found to be 1\% KOH (wt basis of oil), reaction
   temperature 65 degrees C, reaction time 3 h, methanol to oil molar ratio
   250:1 and mixing speed of 600 rpm. The kinetics of the reaction was
   studied and the activation energy was found to be 38.916 kJ mol(-1). The
   potential use of COME as bio lubricants is promising due to its high
   viscosity, low pour point, and good lubricity. Economic analysis and
   sensitivity study of reactive extraction has been carried out which
   estimated the price of COME at \$3.71/gal. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A specially-designed catalysis reaction cell was used for acquiring
   X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) with heating and gas
   treatment in an intermediate-X-ray energy regime (similar to 2.1-4 keV)
   at the Advanced Photon Source beamline 9-BM. In situ X-ray measurements
   in this energy range can be complicated due to absorption by cell
   components, the reaction gases themselves, air surrounding the reaction
   cell, and a host of other reasons. As a proof of concept, bimetallic
   palladium catalysts were examined from the Pd L-II and L-III edges, at
   approximately 3.2 keV. The XANES edge position, the height of the
   ``white line{''} peak, and the shape of the peak display significant
   changes with alloy formation and CO adsorption. This in turn shows that
   the Pd L-edge XANES are very sensitive to changes in the d-band
   density-of-states and can be used to derive rich information about how a
   supported Pd, or other 4d transition metal catalyst, behaves when under
   reaction conditions or upon alloy formation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

   Higgs Mass?}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 10}},
Abstract = {{The mechanism of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking occurs through
   loop corrections, and unlike conventional symmetry breaking where the
   Higgs mass is a parameter, the radiatively generated Higgs mass is
   dynamically predicted. Pade approximations and an averaging method are
   developed to extend the Higgs mass predictions in radiative electroweak
   symmetry breaking from five- to nine-loop order in the scalar sector of
   the standard model, resulting in an upper bound on the Higgs mass of 141
   GeV. The mass predictions are well described by a geometric series
   behavior, converging to an asymptotic Higgs mass of 124 GeV consistent
   with the recent ATLAS and CMS Collaborations observations. Similarly, we
   find that the Higgs self-coupling converges to lambda = 0.23, which is
   significantly larger than its conventional symmetry breaking counterpart
   for a 124 GeV Higgs mass. In addition to this significant enhancement of
   the Higgs self-coupling and HH -> HH scattering, we find that Higgs
   decays to gauge bosons are unaltered and the scattering processes WL+WL+
   -> HH, Z(L)Z(L) -> HH are also enhanced, providing signals to
   distinguish conventional and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking
   mechanisms. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.151601}},

Volume = {{107}},

Month = {{APR 2}},
Abstract = {{Total mineralization of bisphenol A (BPA) has been investigated through
   non-catalytic and catalytic ozonation treatments in a semi-batch
   reactor. Non-catalytic ozonation led to complete degradation of BPA in
   less than 4 min, but did not convert the by-products of BPA ozonation
   completely. In sole ozonation systems only 35\% conversion of the total
   organic carbon (TOC) was achieved in 60 min. Using 1 g/L alumina
   catalyst increased the TOC removal to 90\%. Study of the effect of
   catalyst particles showed that by reducing the particle size from
   pellets to powder, TOC removal increased significantly from 44\% to 90\%
   under particular reaction conditions. However, increasing the amount of
   alumina catalyst from 0.5 g/L to 4 g/L did not show a strong effect on
   the TOC removal. Catalyst reusability and deactivation studies indicated
   that catalyst showed stable activity after three consecutive cycles of
   catalytic ozonation. A two-stage kinetic regime was used to express rate
   of TOC removal for both non-catalytic and catalytic ozonation of BPA.

Abstract = {{Although reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) has proven its
   noticeable merits in many industries, has not been yet furnished with
   efficient analytical methods in the power engineering context. The first
   of this two-paper set presents a practical framework by which the RCM
   procedure can be implemented in power distribution systems. The proposed
   algorithm consists of three main stages. The prerequisites of the
   analysis are outlined in the first stage. In the second stage, an
   approach is developed to identify the network's critical components,
   from the reliability point of view. Having practically modeled the
   components' failure rates, an efficient cost/benefit evaluation approach
   is then proposed to distinguish a variety of maintenance plans. The
   optimal set of maintenance strategies is next adopted for
   implementation. The algorithm is terminated in the third stage by
   recording both technical and economical outcomes for tuning the forward
   maintenance activities. The proposed methodology, although tailored to
   distribution networks, is generic enough to be applied to other power
   system areas. In the companion paper, the proposed methodology is
   examined by application to the Birka distribution system of Stockholm
   City, Sweden, and more practical aspects are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Optimizations of precoding matrices in precode-and-forward (PF) MIMO
   relaying are nonconvex programs in precoding matrix variables. The
   semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, which relaxes the concerned
   nonconvex quadratic constraints by (convex) semi-definite ones, can
   locate the optimal solutions, provided that the numbers of relaying
   antennas and users are very small. The computational complexity of the
   SDR grows explosively even with a very moderate increase in the numbers
   of relaying antennas and/or users, making the existing semidefinite
   programming (SDP) solvers incapable. In this paper, much more efficient
   problem formulations of precoding matrix design that exploit the
   spectral matrix optimization are developed. Such formulations have a low
   dimensionality and are computationally-tractable nonconvex matrix
   programs. Furthermore, by exploiting their partial convex structures in
   the d.c. (difference of two convex functions) framework, new effective
   iterative solutions are obtained. Extensive simulation results are
   presented to support the computational advantage of the proposed
   approach and show that the proposed approach can effectively handle all
   three considered optimization problems of precoding matrices in MIMO PF
   relaying, while the SDR approach either is computationally impractical
   or fails.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of neural stem cells (NSCs), which have the ability to
   self-renew and differentiate into all types of neural lineages, offers
   promising prospect for the treatment of brain neurological disorders
   such as stroke cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury and
   neurodegenerative disorders. However, only limited number of NSCs could
   survive or propagate due to tissue inflammation or blood brain barrier.
   Therefore, it is necessary to develop an appropriate culture system that
   highly mimics the natural NSCs niche to direct stem cell fate and
   behavior for nerve regeneration. Both biophysical and biochemical
   properties of the NSC niche, including topology, mechanical properties,
   bioactive molecules, and their spatial and temporal presentations should
   be considered for the design of functionalized scaffolds, which could
   not only serve as the delivery vehicles of NSCs but also stimulate
   specific cellular responses at the molecular level, such as support
   endogenous or exogenous cells proliferation, migration and homing, even
   promote the growth of axon at the injured brain site. This review
   attempts to outline the varieties of biomaterial parameters that are
   applied as biophysical and biochemical signals to direct neural stem
   cell fate and behavior. The understanding on the interaction of NSCs
   decision and biomaterial parameters is helping to advance NSCs-based
   clinical approaches for nerve tissue regeneration and repair. (c) 2013

Title = {{The role of lung inflation and sodium transport in airway liquid
   clearance during lung aeration in newborn rabbits}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Recent phase-contrast X-ray imaging studies suggest that
   inspiration primarily drives lung aeration and airway liquid clearance
   at birth, which questions the role of adrenaline-induced activation of
   epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). We hypothesized that pressures
   generated by inspiration have a greater role in airway liquid clearance
   than do ENaCs after birth.
   METHODS: Rabbit pups (30 d of gestation) were delivered and sedated, and
   0.1 ml of saline (S) or amiloride (Am; an ENaC inhibitor) was instilled
   into the lungs before mechanical ventilation. Two other groups (30 d of
   gestation) were treated similarly but were also given adrenaline (S/Ad
   and Am/Ad) before mechanical ventilation.
   RESULTS: Amiloride and adrenaline did not affect functional residual
   capacity (FRC) recruitment (P>0.05). Amiloride increased the rate of FRC
   loss between inflations (Am: -5.2 +/- 0.6 ml/kg/s), whereas adrenaline
   reduced the rate of FRC loss (S/Ad: -1.9 +/- 0.3 ml/kg/s) as compared
   with saline-treated controls (S: -3.5 +/- 0.6 ml/kg/s; P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: These data indicate that inspiration is a major determinant
   of airway liquid clearance and FRC development during positive pressure
   ventilation. Although ENaC inhibition and adrenaline administration had
   no detectable effect on FRC development, ENaC may help to prevent liquid
   from re-entering the airways during expiration.}},

Abstract = {{The reestablishment of productive forests over mining waste and
   overburden is a primary reclamation goal in oil sands mining in Northern
   Alberta, Canada. Soil water conditions in coarse-textured soils can be
   limiting to forest growth. The objective of this study was to evaluate
   the effect that textural variability may have on plant-available water
   and concomitant forest productivity on coarse-textured reclamation
   soils. The ecophysiological and biogeochemical processes model,
   Biome-BGC (Thornton et al., Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 113:
   185222, 2002), was employed to simulate forest dynamics. The water flow
   sub-model in Biome-BGC was replaced by a field-validated physically
   based formulation for transient unsaturated water flow. The modified
   model was assessed using validated physiological parameters, and model
   predictions were compared with measurements of aboveground biomass
   dynamics for jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb), white spruce {[}Picea
   glauca (Moench) Voss], and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.).
   The modified Biome-BGC model was then used to evaluate the response of
   leaf area index and net primary production to available water holding
   capacity on texturally variable, coarse-textured soils. The results
   indicate that textural variability could increase the available water
   holding capacity within a 1-m profile of coarse-textured soil by 8 to
   16mm. This enhanced available water holding capacity could increase
   forest leaf area index by 0 center dot 3 to 0 center dot 8 and net
   primary production by 1430\% depending on the specific soil texture and
   tree species. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   4HI -> 2H(2) + 2I(2)
   form a H2S chemical splitting cycle that converts 1 mol H2S into 2 mol
   of H-2. This makes it possible to provide hydrogen in upgrading the
   Canadian oil sands bitumen from processing its waste product H2S. To
   engineer the chemistry, process design and experiments on reactions and
   separations are under investigation. In this paper, efforts have been
   made in order to have reactions 1, 3 and 4 be conducted at ambient
   temperatures and in fluid medium, thus minimizing side reactions,
   corrosiveness and other process difficulties and making the separations
   of products easier. The results show that the separation of the elemetal
   sulfur from the spent sulfuric acid after reaction 1 can be done by
   phase separation, that using the I-2-toluene solution can make the
   Bunsen reaction (reaction 3) take place below the melting point of

Abstract = {{Compliant mechanisms with embedded direct-driven actuators are gaining a
   wide interest in manufacturing systems as well as structural systems. In
   this paper, we present a procedure for motion analysis of a compliant
   mechanism which is driven by three embedded piezoelectric actuators with
   a general-purpose finite element system, in particular, ANSYS. This
   includes finite element modeling of the piezoelectric actuator and
   finite element modeling of the compliant mechanism. An experimental
   validation was conducted, which shows that the model is highly accurate.
   The contribution of this paper is a novel application of finite element
   methods with multidisciplinary elements to motion and stress analysis of
   compliant mechanisms with embedded piezoelectric actuators. In the
   current literature, for a complaint mechanism, either the piezoelectric
   actuator is modeled with absence of piezoelectric effects or a pseudo
   rigid body approach is applied with poor accuracy. Another contribution
   lies in the use of a general-purpose finite element software system,
   which will greatly increase the generalization of finite element
   modeling applications.}},

Abstract = {{Sacrificial coatings, such as Zn and Cd, are used to protect steel
   against corrosion. During the electrodeposition of metals, hydrogen is
   evolved due to electrolysis. The evolved hydrogen may diffuse outward

   into the steel lattice causing delayed embrittlement when the component
   is subjected to stress. This study reports two principal variables for
   Zn, Zn-Ni, and Cd coatings: (i) the quantity of hydrogen absorbed by the
   coating and substrate by vacuum thermal desorption and (ii) the
   permeability of the coating material to hydrogen by electrochemical
   permeation. The findings were analyzed in correlation with the
   microstructural characteristics of both the coating material and the
   coating/substrate interface. With Zn-Ni, both coating process and
   coating material combined to significantly reduce the risk of internal
   hydrogen embrittlement by (i) introducing the least amount of hydrogen
   during the electrodeposition process and (ii) by the ease with which
   hydrogen can be extracted by baking due to the presence of cracks in the
   coating.}},

Abstract = {{Collision diagnosis is the second step in the six-step road safety
   management process described in the AASHTO Highway Safety Manual (HSM).
   Diagnosis is designed to identify a dominant or abnormally high
   proportion of particular collision configurations (e.g., rear end, right
   angle, etc.) at a target location. The primary diagnosis method
   suggested in the HSM is descriptive data analysis. This type of analysis
   relies on, for example, pie charts, histograms, and/or collision
   diagrams. Using location specific collision data (e.g., collision
   frequency per collision configuration for a target location), safety
   engineers identify (the most) frequent collision configurations. Safety
   countermeasures are then likely to concentrate on preventing the
   selected collision configurations. Although its real-world application
   in engineering practice is limited, an additional collision diagnosis
   method, known as the beta-binomial (BB) test, is also presented as the
   secondary diagnosis tool in the HSM. The BB test compares the proportion
   of a particular collision configuration observed at one location with
   the proportion of the same collision configuration found at other
   reference locations which are similar to the target location in terms of
   selected traffic and roadway characteristics (e.g., traffic volume,
   traffic control, and number of lanes). This study compared the outcomes
   obtained from descriptive data analysis and the BB test, and
   investigates two questions: (1) Do descriptive data analysis and the BB
   tests produce the same results (i.e., do they select the same collision
   configurations at the same locations)? and (2) If the tests produce
   different results, which result should be adopted in engineering
   practice? This study's analysis was based on a sample of the most recent
   five years (2005-2009) of collision and roadway configuration data for
   143 signalized intersections in the City of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The
   study results show that the BB test's role in diagnosing safety concerns
   in road safety engineering projects such as safety review projects for
   existing roadways may be just as important as the descriptive data
   analysis method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   metals in the catalyst was delineated. Incorporation of Zn increases the
   activity for furfural conversion whereas Zr contributes significantly to
   the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol. It was also found that Zr loading
   not only increases the acidity of the catalyst but also helps in the
   dispersion of metallic Cu. The particle size of metallic Cu was found to
   be in the range of 17-19 nm as confirmed by TEM, XRD and CO
   chemisorption techniques. XANES analysis confirmed the presence of
   copper in Cu-0 and Cu2+ oxidation states in Cat-C (freshly reduced) and
   Cat-C (fresh), respectively. Hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl
   alcohol follows a pseudo-first order reaction with an the apparent
   activation energy of 24.4 kcal/mol. Cat-C was recycled at least 4 times
   for the hydrogenation of furfural with no loss of activity and
   selectivity when compared to the fresh catalyst. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Titanium ions are implanted into amorphous SiO2 at two different
   fluences using pulsed ion implantation, and the resulting samples are
   annealed. Bulk sensitive soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the Ti
   L-2,L-3 edge reveal strikingly different spectra for the two fluences.
   Spectral simulations using multiplet crystal field theory show clearly
   that for low fluence the Ti ions have a local octahedral coordination,
   while at higher fluence the formation of Ti4+-O tetrahedra dominates.
   Using O K-edge X-ray absorption and emission, the effect of the Ti
   states on the valence and conduction bands of the host SiO2 is revealed.
   With the introduction of Ti tetrahedra, the band gap reduces from about
   8 eV to just over 4 eV, due entirely to the Ti 3d conduction band
   states. These results demonstrate the possibility to obtain Ti-O
   tetrahedra in silica by Ti ion implantation and a suitable thermal
   treatment, clarify the mechanism of band gap reduction with Ti doping in
   SiO2, and demonstrate the sensitivity of L-edge X-ray absorption with a
   multiplet crystal field theory analysis to the Ti coordination of novel
   materials. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{High-pressure phase transitions in Al2Br6 were theoretically
   investigated using first principles density functional methods. A
   structural transformation from the initial molecular solid phase to a
   planar polymeric phase is predicted near 0.4 GPa that is accompanied
   with a substantial volume drop. A unique feature of this phase
   transition is that the hcp lattice of Br atoms remains unchanged during
   the transition, whereas the Al atoms are displaced from the original
   tetrahedral sites to the octahedral sites. The calculated phonon spectra
   indicate that the predicted phase is mechanically stable at 1 atm, and
   therefore it may be quench-recovered to ambient conditions and exist as
   a metastable form. A second structural transformation is predicted to
   occur at around 80 GPa, and also at this point, the AlBr3 reaches a
   metallic state. The electronic structure of the metallic phase features
   soft phonon modes and Fermi surface nesting in the Brillouin zone, which
   leads to localized electron-phonon coupling. By comparing with the
   experimental data available for high-pressure BI3, the superconducting
   critical temperature T-c for the metallic phase of AlBr3 is estimated to
   be at 0.5 K or above. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Calcium cross-linked alginate hydrogel has shown positive results for
   the treatment of myocardial infarction in both acute and chronic rat
   models. However, cross-linked alginate hydrogels possess poor mechanical
   properties, uncontrollable degradation, and poor cell adhesion and
   infiltration. In this study, covalent cross-linking of partially
   oxidized alginate and gelatin hydrogel was developed for myocardial
   infarction treatment, as compared to cross-linked alginate hydrogel and
   saline. Specifically, the gelation process, mechanical properties, and
   biodegradation of both cross-linked alginate hydrogel and oxidized
   alginate and gelatin hydrogel were examined in vitro and in vivo; and a
   rat myocardial infarction model was developed by injecting hydrogel into
   hearts, and postinjection, echocardiography was performed at 2, 4, and 6
   weeks, respectively. Matrix metalloprotease-2/9 activity was also
   examined by in situ zymography on frozen slices of the treated hearts.
   Based on the results, that both hydrogels enhanced scar thickness and
   attenuated heart remodeling compared with the saline control group and
   that, compared to cross-linked alginate hydrogel, oxidized alginate and
   gelatin hydrogel exhibited the increased mechanical strength, enhanced
   angiogenesis, and stronger cell-recruiting capacity. It has also been
   illustrated that oxidized alginate and gelatin hydrogel-treated hearts
   have much weaker cardiac remodeling, enhanced extracellular matrix
   accumulation, and reduced matrix metalloprotease activity than
   cross-linked alginate hydrogel-treated ones. All results suggest
   oxidized alginate and gelatin hydrogel may be more suitable for the
   myocardial infarction treatment.}},

Abstract = {{It has been speculated that resting muscle mechanical activity, also
   known as minor tremor, microvibration, and thermoregulatory tonus, has
   evolved to maintain core temperature in homeotherms, and may play a role
   in nonshivering thermogenesis. This experiment was done to determine
   whether resting muscle mechanical activity increases with decreasing
   ambient temperature. We cooled 20 healthy, human, resting, supine
   subjects from an ambient temperature of 40 to 12 degrees C over 65 min.
   Core temperature, midquadriceps mechanomyography, surface
   electromyography, and oxygen consumption ((V) over dotO(2)) were
   recorded. Resting muscle mechanical and electrical activity in the
   absence of shivering increased significantly at temperatures below 21.5
   degrees C. Women defended core temperature more effectively than men,
   and showed increased resting muscle activity earlier than men.
   Metabolism measured by (V) over dotO(2) correlated with resting muscle
   mechanical activity (R = 0.65; p = 0.01). Resting muscle mechanical
   activity may have evolved, in part, to maintain core temperature in the
   face of mild cooling.}},

   insect bodies and wheat kernels were considered to assess the
   effectiveness of the proposed method. Dielectric and other physical
   properties of the insect and wheat were measured, and the electric field
   intensities in the system were estimated using an electromagnetic model.
   The host grain at three levels of moisture contents, 12\%, 15\%, 18\%
   wet weight basis, were included to cover a wide range of grain storage
   scenarios, and the dielectric properties were measured at temperatures
   between 15 degrees C and 75 degrees C. The ratios of electric field
   intensity (E-i(2)/E-g(2)) and dielectric loss factor (epsilon
   `'(i)/epsilon `'(g)) within the insect bodies to that in grain kernels
   ranged from 0.13 to 0.76 and from 8.61 to 169.93 respectively. The
   latter had a significant effect on insect-to-wheat power absorption
   factor, P-ig, which varied between 5 and 40. The relative rate of
   increase of temperature for insect-to-wheat was directly related to
   P-ig, but inversely related to the product of insect/grain specific heat
   and density, which varied between 0.89 and 1.33, and was therefore
   almost identical to P-ig, and ranged from 6.47 to 29.6. This large
   relative rate of increase of temperature in insect bodies compared to
   wheat may have potential benefits in heating the insects selectively
   with radio frequency energy to their lethal temperature while keeping
   the host grain at moderate temperature, and therefore minimising or
   eliminating adverse effects on its physicochemical properties. (C) 2012

   43-55. A total of 3756 pigs were transported for 2 h in summer and
   winter using a ``pot-belly{''} trailer (PB) and a hydraulic
   double-decked truck (DD) in order to assess the effect of vehicle design
   on animal welfare and carcass and meat quality. Animal welfare was
   assessed in randomly selected barrows by measuring heart rate of pigs
   and lactate and creatine phospho-kinase (CPK) concentrations in
   exsanguination blood. Skin damage was scored and meat quality was
   evaluated in the longissimus dorsi (LD), semimembranosus (SM) and
   adductor (AD) muscles. Heart rates in winter were higher (P<0.01) during
   transport, at unloading and in lairage. Blood CPK and lactate
   concentrations at slaughter were higher (P<0.05 and P<0.01,
   respectively) in pigs transported on the PB trailer. Bruises increased
   in winter (P<0.001) and in pigs from the DD truck (P<0.05). The pHu was
   higher (P<0.01) in all muscles and L{*} value was lower (P<0.05) in the

Title = {{Planning Target Volume Margin Evaluation and Critical Structure Sparing
   for Rectal Cancer Patients Treated Prone on a Bellyboard}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To calculate a planning target volume (PTV) margin that would
   account for inter-fractional systematic and random clinical target
   volume positional errors for patients treated prone on a recently
   available couch top bellyboard and to evaluate potential critical
   structure dose reduction using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)
   techniques.
   Materials and methods: Twenty-four patients (12 men and 12 women) were
   included in this study, all treated on a commercial bellyboard. Cone
   beam computed tomography (CBCT) data were acquired once every five
   fractions for a total of five images per patient. A
   three-dimensional-three-dimensional bony anatomy auto-match was carried
   out off-line and the residual difference in position used as a surrogate
   for clinical target volume inter-fractional positional errors.
   Systematic (Sigma) and random (sigma) variations were evaluated and used
   in PTVmargin = 1.96 Sigma + 0.7 sigma. The influence of intra-fractional
   positional errors was evaluated in the margin analysis by introducing
   published values. Critical structure sparing, as a function of PTVmargin
   size, was investigated through the evaluation of three-dimensional
   conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) and IMRT treatment plans developed
   using the margin derived from this work, the American Society for
   Radiation Oncology Contouring Atlas and the Radiation Therapy Oncology
   Group 0822 trial specifications.
   Results: The PTVmargin that accounts for only the inter-fractional
   positional errors was calculated to be (anterior-posterior (AP),
   superior-inferior (SI), left-right (LR)) = (5.2 mm, 3.1 mm, 2.8 mm). If
   we assumed a combined intra-fractional motion up to 3.0 mm then the
   required PTVmargin increased to (AP, SI, LR) = (7.0 mm, 5.0 mm, 5.0 mm).
   Treatment plan evaluation showed that the bellyboard provides excellent
   small bowel sparing regardless of planning technique. In most cases;
   IMRT reduced the average femoral head, bladder and small bowel dose by
   20, 15 and 40\% with respect to 3DCRT planning.
   Conclusion: A PTVmargin expansion of (AP, SI, LR) = (7.0 mm, 5.0 mm, 5.0
   mm) is required to account for all positional uncertainties. The use of
   a bellyboard with IMRT provides better critical structure sparing when
   compared with a bellyboard with 3DCRT. (c) 2012 The Royal College of

   with three embedded PZT actuators, which has been used as a part of the

Abstract = {{The key design challenge in capsule endoscopic system is to reduce the
   area and power consumption while maintaining acceptable video quality.
   In this paper, a subsample-based image compressor for such endoscopic
   application is presented. The algorithm is developed around some special
   features of endoscopic images. It consists of a differential pulse coded
   modulation followed by Golomb-rice coding. Based on the nature of
   endoscopic images, several subsampling schemes on the chrominance
   components are applied. This scheme is particularly suitable to work
   with any commercial low-power image sensors that outputs image pixels in
   a raster scan fashion, eliminating the need of memory buffer, as well as
   temporary storage (as needed in transform coding schemes). An image
   corner clipping algorithm is also presented. The reconstructed images
   have been verified by medical doctors for acceptability. The proposed
   algorithm has a very low complexity and is suitable for the VLSI
   implementation. Compared to other transform-based algorithms targeted to
   capsule endoscopy, the proposed raster-scan-based scheme performs very
   strongly with a compression ratio of 80\% and a very high reconstruction
   PSNR (over 45 dB).}},

Abstract = {{Corrosion of reinforced concrete is the most challenging durability
   problem that threatens reinforced concrete structures, especially
   structures that are subject to severe environmental conditions (i.e.,
   highway bridges, marine structures, etc.). Corrosion of reinforcing
   steel leads to cracking and spalling of the concrete cover and billions
   of dollars are spent every year on repairing such damaged structures.
   New types of reinforcements have been developed to avoid these high-cost
   repairs. Thus, it is important to study the corrosion behavior of these
   new types of reinforcements and compare them to the traditional carbon
   steel reinforcements. This study aimed at characterizing the corrosion
   behavior of three competing reinforcing steels; conventional carbon
   steel, micro-composite steel (MMFX-2) and 316LN stainless steel, through
   experiments in carbonated and non-carbonated concrete exposed to
   chloride-laden environments. Synthetic pore water solutions have been
   used to simulate both cases of sound and carbonated concrete under
   chloride ions attack. A three-electrode corrosion cell is used for
   determining the corrosion characteristics and rates. Multiple
   electrochemical techniques were applied using a Gamry PC4 (TM)
   potentiostat manufactured by Gamry Instruments (Warminster, PA). DC
   corrosion measurements were applied on samples subjected to fixed
   chloride concentration in the solution.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering scaffolds are designed not only to provide structural
   support for the repair of damaged tissue, but can also serve the
   function of bioactive protein delivery. Here we present a study on the
   preparation and characterization of protein-loaded microspheres, either

   delivery. Alginate microspheres were prepared by a novel, small-scale
   water-in-oil emulsion technique and loaded with fluorescently labeled
   immunoglobulin G (IgG). Microsphere size appears to be influenced by the
   magnitude and distribution of force generated by mechanical stirring
   during emulsion. Protein release studies show that sustained IgG release
   from microspheres could be achieved and that application of a secondary
   coating of chitosan could further slow the rate of protein release.
   Preservation of bioactivity of released IgG protein was confirmed using
   an immunohistochemical assay. When IgG-loaded microspheres were
   incorporated into mock scaffolds, initial protein release was diminished
   and the overall time course of release was extended. The present study
   demonstrates that protein-loaded microspheres can be prepared with a
   controlled release profile and preserved biological activity, and can be
   incorporated into scaffolds to achieve sustained and prolonged protein
   delivery in a tissue engineering application.}},

   non-coherent detection of the transmitted symbols. Therefore, in
   contrast to the maximum ratio combining (MRC), no channel information is
   needed at the destination. The exact average bit-error-rate (BER) of the

Abstract = {{In compact torus injection (CTI) experiments on the STOR-M tokamak, an
   ion Doppler spectrometer is installed to observe the effects of CTI on
   toroidal plasma flows. The intrinsic toroidal flow in ohmic discharges
   without CTI is sheared with counter plasma current flow in the core
   region and co-current direction at the periphery. With tangential CTI
   along the co-current direction, the flow velocity in the core region
   decreases by more than 5 kms(-1), while in the periphery the flow
   velocity increases by 3-4 km s(-1). These data indicate that the
   observed flow change is due to the injection of toroidal momentum.
   Density increase and high soft x-ray emission after CTI are observed
   during the changes in the toroidal flow.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of microstructure and texture in commercially pure
   titanium has been studied as a function of strain path during rolling
   using experimental techniques and viscoplastic self-consistent
   simulations. Four different strain paths, namely unidirectional rolling,
   two-step cross rolling, multistep cross rolling, and reverse rolling,
   have been employed to decipher the effect of strain path change on the
   evolution of deformation texture and microstructure. The cross-rolled
   samples show higher hardness with lower microstrain and intragranular
   misorientation compared to the unidirectional rolled sample as
   determined from X-ray diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction,
   respectively. The higher hardness of the cross-rolled samples is
   attributed to orientation hardening due to the near basal texture.
   Viscoplastic self-consistent simulations are able to successfully
   predict the texture evolution of the differently rolled samples.
   Simulation results indicate the higher contribution of basal slip in the
   formation of near basal texture and as well as lower intragranular
   misorientation in the cross-rolled samples.}},

   electron microscopy. The ARBF process induced formation of a strong
   preferred orientation along the beta-fiber and also to the pronounced
   copper texture component. In the aluminum side, occurrence of dynamic
   recovery reduced the intensity of the beta-fiber rolling texture due to
   change in dislocation structure and decrease in the degree of strain
   hardening. On the other hand, occurrence of discontinuous dynamic
   recrystallization at the third and fourth ARBF cycles led to decreasing
   the intensity of fibers and texture components in the copper side. The
   average grain sizes of the final sample for the copper and aluminum
   sides were similar to 50 and similar to 200 nm, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Adverse environmental impacts of carbon emissions are causing increasing
   concerns to the general public throughout the world. Electric energy
   generation from conventional energy sources is considered to be a major
   contributor to these harmful emissions. High emphasis is therefore being
   given to green alternatives of energy, such as wind and solar. Wind
   energy is being perceived as a promising alternative. This source of
   energy technology and its applications have undergone significant
   research and development over the past decade. As a result, many modern
   power systems include a significant portion of power generation from
   wind energy sources. The impact of wind generation on the overall system
   performance increases substantially as wind penetration in power systems
   continues to increase to relatively high levels. It becomes increasingly
   important to accurately model the wind behavior, the interaction with
   other wind sources and conventional sources, and incorporate the
   characteristics of the energy demand in order to carry out a realistic
   evaluation of system reliability. Power systems with high wind
   penetrations are often connected to multiple wind farms at different
   geographic locations. Wind speed correlations between the different wind
   farms largely affect the total wind power generation characteristics of
   such systems, and therefore should be an important parameter in the wind
   modeling process. This paper evaluates the effect of the correlation
   between multiple wind farms on the adequacy indices of wind-integrated
   systems. The paper also proposes a simple and appropriate probabilistic
   analytical model that incorporates wind correlations, and can be used
   for adequacy evaluation of multiple wind-integrated systems.}},

Abstract = {{The direct conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons is considered as
   one of the most promising methods to produce liquid fuels. Different
   percentages of Zn loaded on zeolitic 5\% Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalysts were
   prepared by using a conventional impregnation method; these catalysts
   were used to convert methane into a range of liquid hydrocarbon fuels in
   the presence of methanol. The catalysts were characterized by using
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, temperature-programmed reduction,
   temperature-programmed desorption, SEM-energy dispersive X-ray, and XRD
   analysis. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the process
   variables for the conversion of methane into liquid hydrocarbon fuels.
   The catalytic activity tests were carried out in a fixed-bed
   microreactor and methanol was used as a co-reactant to activate the
   methane molecules. Central composite experimental design was used to
   study the effects of each variable on methane conversion. Analysis of
   variance indicated a high coefficient of determination value (R-2=0.96),
   and a satisfactory prediction for a second-order regression model was
   developed. The optimum methane conversion (30.7\%) was obtained with
   flow rates of 1500 and 1.25 mLh(-1) for methane and methanol,
   respectively, over a 3\% Zn-Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. The major reaction
   products were ethane, ethylene, C4+ aliphatic hydrocarbons, and aromatic
   hydrocarbons. Kinetic studies were also performed for methane conversion
   using a power law model; the activation energy for the reaction was 61.6

Abstract = {{Recent research shows that the addition of chitosan microspheres (CMs)
   to poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) can result in a composite scaffold material
   with improved biocompatibility and mechanical properties for tissue
   engineering applications. However, research regarding the influence of
   CMs on scaffold degradation is absent in the literature. This paper
   presents a study on the in vitro degradation of scaffolds made from PLLA
   with CMs. In this study, the PLLA/CMs scaffolds with a 25\% ratio of CMs
   to PLLA were immersed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at 37
   degrees C for 8 weeks. The in vitro degradation of the scaffolds was
   investigated using microcomputed tomography (mu CT), weight loss
   analysis, Raman spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC). Microstructure changes during degradation were monitored using mu
   CT. The mu CT results were consistent with the results obtained from
   Raman spectra and DSC analysis, which reflected that adding CMs into
   PLLA can decrease the degradation rate compared with pure PLLA
   scaffolds. The results suggest that PLLA/CMs scaffold degradation can be
   regulated and controlled to meet requirements imposed a given tissue
   engineering application.}},

   AA 6061 aluminum alloy in compression}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{212-221}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{AA 6061 aluminum alloy in T4, T6 and T8 temper were subjected to
   quasi-static compressive loading at a strain-rate of 3.2 x 10(-3) s(-1)
   and dynamic compressive loading at strain-rates between 7.0 x 10(3) and
   8.5 x 10(3) s(-1). The effects of strain rates and temper condition on
   the deformation behavior of the alloy are discussed. Under the
   quasi-static loading, deformation was relatively homogeneous and
   controlled by strain hardening, which is more pronounced in the
   naturally aged than the artificially aged alloys. Thermal softening
   played a dominant role under impact loading leading to strain
   localization along narrow bands called adiabatic shear bands (ASBs).
   Both deformed bands consisting of aligned second phase particles and
   transformed bands consisting of fine recrystallized grains were
   observed. The average size of the recrystallized grains in the
   transformed bands is about 600 nm and varies slightly depending on the
   temper condition. The fine grains are suggested to form by dynamic
   recrystallization. The T4 alloy showed the highest propensity for
   thermal softening, strain localization and cracking under impact loading
   while the T8 alloy showed the least tendency. The degree of
   recrystallization in the transformed band is influenced by temper
   condition with T8 alloy having the highest fraction of unrecrystallized
   grains inside the transformed bands. This is related to the temperature
   rise in the transformed bands that was estimated to be highest in the T4
   alloy and lowest in the T8 alloy. The combined effects of high
   temperature and severe strain inside the transformed bands caused
   dissolution of second phase particles and induced microstructural
   changes that resulted in less silicon inside the transformed bands than
   in the adjacent region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a high speed and low power runtime dynamically
   reconfigurable Viterbi decoder architecture with constraint lengths 3-7
   with different code rates is proposed for different wireless standards.
   The proposed architecture uses an improved modular implementation of Add
   Compare Select (ACS) and Trace back units to obtain high speed. With a
   throughput of 81 Mbps, the architecture is suitable for use in receivers
   of 802.11a wireless local area network, 3G cellular code division
   multiple access environments, UMTS and EDGE. The proposed architecture
   gives high performance without any pipelining or parallelism in ACS and
   shows at least 13\% throughput and 5x power improvement over the
   reported architectures. To verify the efficacy of this dynamic partial
   reconfigurable (DPR) Viterbi decoder method, a conventional multiplexer
   based reconfigurable architecture was designed and tested. DPR based
   technique shows 27\% of resource saving and the reconfiguration time is
   reduced about 1/9 compared to the static reconfiguration. (C) 2012

   Profiles}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The mechanisms controlling surface evaporation and water redistribution
   in layered, unsaturated soil profiles are of particular interest for the
   design of soil covers for landfills and mine waste (e.g., tailings)
   where layering of texturally contrasting soils is common. Evaporation
   and water redistribution were observed in laboratory tests of three
   layered soil columns (sand overlying silt, silt overlying sand, and
   multiple sand and silt layers), with two homogeneous soil columns (sand
   or silt) serving as controls. Changes in water storage were monitored
   along with changes in potential and actual evaporation with time. Near
   continuous monitoring of temperature along the columns was also
   conducted. The hydraulic properties of the sand and silt were measured
   but also verified through simulations of the homogeneous sand and silt
   columns. These optimized parameters were then used to simulate the
   layered columns. Layered columns with silt at the surface had more
   evaporation than homogeneous soil columns of either sand or silt.
   Changes in water storage in the columns with sand at the surface
   occurred primarily within the surficial sand layer without drawing water
   from deeper in the column. Columns with silt at surface drew water for
   evaporation from sand layers deeper within the column. Numerical
   modeling of the columns was able to reproduce the observed changes in
   evaporation rates and water content for all layered soil columns. The
   laboratory and simulation studies illustrated the strong influence that
   textural layering may have on water dynamics in soil profiles under
   evaporative conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear evolution of magnetic islands is investigated by means of

Journal = {{WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{224}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Antiviral drugs have been recently recognized as one of the emerging
   contaminants in the environment. These are discharged after therapeutic
   use through human excretion. Effluent containing high concentration of
   antiviral drugs discharged from production facilities is also a cause of
   concern to nearby aquatic bodies. There is an increased interest in
   their removal because they are highly bioactive. Some antiviral drugs
   are resistant to conventional methods of degradation, and there is a
   risk of development of antiviral resistance in humans and animals if
   exposed repeatedly for long periods. To date, the potential human,
   animal, and ecological risks associated with the discharge of these
   antiviral compounds to the environment are not well documented. This
   study presents a brief summary on occurrence, ecotoxicological risks,
   and physicochemical properties of antiviral drugs in the environment.
   The needs regarding removal, disposal, and treatment of antiviral drugs

Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{185-200}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The influence of a wake-mounted splitter plate on the flow around a
   surface-mounted circular cylinder of finite height was investigated
   experimentally using a low-speed wind tunnel. The experiments were
   conducted at a Reynolds number of Re=7.4 x 10(4) for cylinder aspect
   ratios of AR=9, 7, 5 and 3. The thickness of the boundary layer on the
   ground plane relative to the cylinder diameter was delta/D=1.5. The
   splitter plates were mounted on the wake centreline with negligible gap
   between the base of the cylinder and the leading edge of the plate. The
   lengths of the splitter plates, relative to the cylinder diameter,
   ranged from L/D=1 to 7, and the plate height was always equal to the
   cylinder height. Measurements of the mean drag force coefficient were
   obtained with a force balance, and measurements of the vortex shedding
   frequency were obtained with a single-component hot-wire probe situated
   in the wake of the cylinder-plate combination. Compared to the
   well-studied case involving an infinite circular cylinder, the splitter
   plate was found to be a less effective drag-reduction device for finite
   circular cylinders. Significant reduction in the mean drag coefficient
   was realized only for the finite circular cylinder of AR=9 with
   intermediate-length splitter plates of L/D=1-3. The mean drag
   coefficients of the other cylinders were almost unchanged. In terms of
   its effect on vortex shedding, a splitter plate of sufficient length was
   able to suppress Karman vortex shedding for all of the finite circular
   cylinders tested. For AR=9, vortex shedding suppression occurred for L/D
   >= 5, which is similar to the case of the infinite circular cylinder.
   For the smaller-aspect-ratio cylinders, however, the splitter plate was
   more effective than what occurs for the infinite circular cylinder: for
   AR=3, vortex shedding suppression occurred for all of the splitter
   plates tested (L/D >= 1); for AR=5 and 7, vortex shedding suppression
   occurred for L/D >= 1.5. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel microfluidic method to prepare

   by the piezoelectric actuator and flow to the main channel to pinch off
   the focused stream to form a liquid chopper. By changing the frequencies
   of the liquid chopper, the size of the W/O microspheres can be
   successfully controlled in the range of 78.55-185.63 mu m with very good
   uniformity (lower than 5\% of the coefficient of variation). The present
   method has the advantages over conventional methods such as hydrodynamic
   flow focusing and T-junction. The proposed chopper method presents good

Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, numerous studies have been undertaken in
   identifying the inhibiting and deactivating effects of basic nitrogen
   compounds present in heavy gas oil (HGO) on catalyst active sites;
   however, limited information is available on the presence and effect of
   neutral nitrogen species, which have shown to exhibit both inhibitory
   and deactivating effects comparable to those of the basic species. A
   novel pretreatment process employing the heterogeneously cross-linked
   macroporous polymer poly(glycidyl methacrylate) as the hydrophilic
   support coupled with organic compound tetranitrofluorenone has been
   synthesized in a four stage procedure for the selective removal of
   neutral nitrogen heterocyclic compounds from heavy gas oil using charge
   transfer complexes. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), low temperature
   N-2 adsorption-desorption (BET), CHNOS elemental analysis, Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), epoxy content titration, and
   thermo gravimetry/differential thermal analyzer (TG/DTA) were employed
   for determining the optimum parameters during the synthesis of each
   stage. The optimized polymer has shown promising results with successful
   removal of up to 6.7\% of the nitrogen species in a single contact using
   approximately 15 wt.\% of the polymer with respect to HGO, while having
   little to no influence on the sulfur species. The reusability of the
   polymer has also shown consistency in the selective removal of nitrogen
   compounds, with continuous removal rates in the range of 6.7\%. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Activated carbons were produced from fluid petroleum coke using physical
   (steam and CO2) and chemical (KOH and H3PO4) activations. Effects of
   process parameters including activation temperature, activation time
   period and water flow rate on yield and BET surface area of
   steam-activated carbons were investigated and optimized. Steam
   activation improved BET surface area of the precursor more than 40 times
   at optimum operating conditions and KOH activation increased BET surface
   area from 11 to 692 m(2)/g. Properties of activated carbons were
   characterized by BET, SEM, CHSNO, FTIR, ICPMS and Boehm analysis
   techniques. The steam-activated carbons were treated with HNO3 and H2O2
   separately to study the effects of acid treatments on surface chemistry,
   porous characteristics and environmental applications of activated
   carbons. Activated carbons produced in this study were used as adsorbent
   for ammonium ion (40.0 and 260.0 mg/L) in liquid phase and as catalyst
   for direct oxidation of H2S (10,000 ppm) in gas stream. Among all other
   samples HNO3 and H2O2-treated samples showed the highest ammonium
   adsorption by 184.6 and 169.6 mg/g, respectively. The largest
   breakthrough time (320 min) among all samples was shown by KOH activated
   carbon. The SO2 production was less than 5\% of H2S fed to the reactor.

Abstract = {{The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass, such as residual wood or
   straw, to synthetic fuels and chemicals is currently being developed
   within the bioliq (R) concept. The aim of this study is to model and
   assess two different biomass-to-liquid (BtL) concepts for the production
   of gasoline via dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis as well as gasoline and
   diesel via Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. The techno-economic
   assessment concludes that total energy efficiencies from biomass to
   final products range between 38 and 39\%. The resulting production costs
   of gasoline via DME synthesis are about 1.15 (sic)/L (0.82 US\$/L).
   Gasoline and diesel via FT synthesis can be produced at costs of about
   1.23 (sic)/L (0.88 US\$/L). The production costs for biomass-derived
   fuels are 76 to 93\% higher than current market prices. However, the
   considered technologies are close to becoming competitive to
   conventional refineries since the production costs are only 7 to 18\%
   higher than current market prices when coal is used as main feedstock.
   Further, the implications of negative CO2 emissions, mineral oil tax
   reduction and the combination of both kinds of subsidies in order to
   compensate high biomass feedstock costs as well as the sensitivity of
   production costs to biomass feedstock costs are evaluated in this study.

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a general design methodology for conceptual design
   of microchannel systems by applying axiomatic design theory (ADT). As an
   example, this paper takes a microchannel system that is used to produce
   uniform microspheres based on the phase separation principle. There are
   two general design goals for this system: controllability of the size of
   microspheres and uniformity or narrow size distribution of microspheres.
   It is found that the conventional approach to this example system will
   result in a so-called ``coupled design,{''} which is considered a poor
   design, according to ADT. This paper demonstrates how to change the
   coupled design for the example system to a better design called
   ``decoupled design{''} (according to ADT). The proposed methodology can
   be applied to all the microchannel systems based on the phase separation
   principle and, as a matter of fact, can be used to generate many
   decoupled designs. The effectiveness of such a decoupled design is
   demonstrated through simulation.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of crystallographic texture and the mechanical properties
   of copper subjected to severe plastic deformation (SPD) using equal
   channel angular pressing (ECAP) were investigated. Samples were
   subjected to ECAP under two different processing routes: B-60 and B-C.
   As the cross sections of the samples were circular, a new route with a
   rotation angle of 60 degrees in the same direction between consecutive
   passes was introduced. The material exhibited texture development
   similar to the simple shear texture in both routes and the most
   significant changes in texture strength in both processing routes took
   place after the second pass. Microstructure of ECAP processed samples
   were investigated using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)
   analysis. Comparison of the EBSD data with optical micrograph of the
   initial sample confirmed that ECAP process has led to a significant
   decrease in grain size. Significant increases in hardness and tensile
   strength were observed after the first pass of ECAP. Variations of
   tensile strength as a function of the number of passes were related to
   the dislocation densities and the average boundary spacing. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper studies the design of a robust discrete-time sliding-mode
   control (DT-SMC) for a high precision electrohydraulic actuator (EHA)
   system. Nonlinear friction in the hydraulic actuator can greatly
   influence the performance and accuracy of the hydraulic actuators, and
   it is difficult to accurately model the nonlinear friction
   characteristics. In this paper, it is proposed to characterize the
   frictions as an uncertainty in the system matrices. Indeed, the effects
   of variations of the nonlinear friction coefficients are considered as
   norm-bounded uncertainties that span a bounded region to cover a wide
   range of the real actuator friction. For such a discrete-time dynamic
   model, for the EHA system with system uncertainty matrices and a
   nonlinear term, a sufficient condition for existence of stable sliding
   surfaces is proposed by using the linear matrix inequality approach.
   Based on this existence condition, a DT-SMC is developed such that the
   reaching motion satisfies the discrete-time sliding mode reaching
   condition for uncertain systems. Simulation and experimental studies on
   the EHA system illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the
   proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{It is shown that the spatial dispersion in composite systems formed by
   inclusion of finite size spheres may lead to negative group velocity
   and, subsequently, to negative refraction. Longitudinal and transverse
   electromagnetic modes exhibiting negative dispersion are found in the
   system of finite size charged clouds. It is also shown that similar
   mechanism due to the electric quadrupole coupling leads to excitation of
   longitudinal and transverse eigenmodes with negative dispersion in a
   random set of nonmagnetic metal spheres embedded in a dielectric host.
   It is shown that the negative refraction related to the spatial
   dispersion effects may alternatively be viewed as a result of
   simultaneously negative permittivity and permeability. DOI:

Journal = {{THIN SOLID FILMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{528}},

Abstract = {{Coating adherent diamond-like carbon (DLC) thin films directly on Ti
   alloys is technologically difficult. This research incorporates
   nanodiamond particles to form a diamond/DLC composite interlayer to
   enhance the adhesion of DLC thin films on Ti6Al4V substrates. Initially,
   nanodiamond particles were deposited on Ti6Al4V substrates by microwave
   plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition from a methane-hydrogen gas
   mixture. A DLC thin film was then deposited, on top of the nanodiamond
   particles, by direct ion beam deposition. Scanning electron microscopy,
   Atomic force microscopy, X-ray Diffraction and Raman spectroscopy were
   used to characterize the microstructure and chemical bonding of the
   deposited particles and films, and Rockwell indentation testing was used
   to evaluate the adhesion of the deposited films. The results indicate
   that the pre-deposited nanodiamond particles significantly enhance the
   interfacial adhesion between the DLC thin film and the Ti6Al4V
   substrate, possibly by enhanced interfacial bonding, mechanical
   interlocking, and stress relief. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Energy recovery ventilators (ERVs) are exhaust air energy recovery
   devices for outdoor ventilation air preconditioning in building HVAC
   systems. The energy and economic performance of an ERV depends on its
   effectiveness, cost, maintenance as well as other parameters such as
   climate, building design and HVAC system parameters. In this study, a
   sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the impact of uncertainty of
   building and HVAC system parameters on the energy savings potential and
   economics of ERVs. Firstly, the impact of building parameters on HVAC
   system peak loads, capital cost, annual energy use and operating cost
   are investigated for an office building located in Chicago using TRNSYS
   simulations. The results show that the ventilation rate has the most
   significant impact on total HVAC system energy performance. Secondly,
   energy and economic analysis on the ERV's payback period is conducted
   with a specified variation of each input parameter. The results
   illustrate that an ERV with 75\% sensible and 60\% latent effectiveness
   can reduce the peak heating load by 30\%, the peak cooling load by 18\%,
   the annual heating energy usage by 40\% and the annual cooling energy
   usage by 8\%, with a payback period of 2 years. The uncertainty of ERV's
   payback period to its initial cost, recovery effectiveness, energy rate,
   HVAC equipment initial cost and efficiency as well as ventilation rate
   are also presented. A +/- 25\% uncertainty in the 7 building and HVAC
   system input parameters studied results in a maximum 17\% and 225\%
   uncertainty in the payback period of the ERV respectively. Crown

Abstract = {{We have studied dense hydrogen and deuterium experimentally up to 320
   GPa and using ab initio molecular dynamic (MD) simulations up to 370 GPa
   between 250 and 300 K. Raman and optical absorption spectra show
   significant anharmonic and quantum effects in mixed atomic and molecular
   dense phase-IV of hydrogen. In agreement with these observations, ab
   initio MD simulations near 300 K show extremely large atomic motions,
   which include molecular rotations, hopping, and even pair fluctuations,
   suggesting that phase IV may not have a well-defined crystalline
   structure. The structurally diverse layers (molecular and graphenelike)
   are strongly coupled, thus opening an indirect band gap; moreover, at
   300 GPa, we find fast synchronized intralayer structural fluctuations.
   At 370 GPa, the mixed structure collapses to form a metallic molecular
   Cmca-4 phase, which exhibits a new interstitial valence charge bonding
   scheme. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.87.024101}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the joint optimization of user power
   allocation and distributed relay beamforming in two-way wireless relay
   networks in which multiple multi-antenna relays assist multiple
   single-antenna users. The design aims at maximizing the minimum
   information rate among user pairs subject to various practical power
   constraints at the users and relays. Since the nonconvex structure of
   the problem is highly complicated, the existing approaches to relax the
   design problem into a convex program do not appear to be applicable. To
   solve this challenging nonconvex optimization problem, we introduce
   auxiliary variables and cast the design problem into a d.c.(difference
   of convex functions) program. Then, we develop an efficient iterative
   algorithm of sequential convex optimization to obtain the optimized
   solutions. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed
   joint design outperforms the only relay beamforming design.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for energy has been increasing in the current decade due to
   rapid industrialization and urbanization. Limited fossil fuel resources,
   rising fuel prices, and global warming are some of the factors leading
   to increased interest in lignocellulosic biomass to generate renewable
   fuels. Forestry residues which contain a major proportion of
   lignocellulosic matter are suitable candidates for conversion to liquid
   and gaseous fuels. This review highlights forestry biomass from a
   bioenergy point of view, focusing on its global applications,
   availability, chemical composition, and conversion. The conversion
   pathways discussed here are biochemical conversion to ethanol and
   butanol as well as thermochemical conversions, including pyrolysis,
   liquefaction, and gasification, to produce process-specific end products
   such as bio-oil and synthesis gas. A wide variety of woody biomass
   species are also discussed, indicating their variation in cellulose,
   hemicellulose, and lignin content; bio-oil, biochar, and gas yields
   through pyrolysis; and bioethanol and biobutanol yields through
   bioconversion.}},

   area of mid-term electricity MCP forecasting. Mid-term electricity MCP
   forecasting has become essential for resources reallocation, maintenance
   scheduling, bilateral contracting, budgeting and planning purposes. The
   proposed hybrid model showed improved forecasting accuracy compared to a
   forecasting model using a single SVM. PJM interconnection data have been
   utilized to illustrate the proposed model with numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies dual-hop amplify-and-forward relaying over
   time-varying Rayleigh fading channels with differential M-PSK modulation
   and non-coherent detection. For the case of ``two-symbol{''} detection,
   a first order time-series model is utilized to characterize the
   time-varying nature of the cascaded channel. Based on this model, an
   exact bit error rate (BER) expression is derived and confirmed with
   simulation results. The obtained expression shows that the BER is
   related to the auto-correlation of the cascaded channel and an
   irreducible error floor exists at high transmit power. To overcome the
   error floor experienced with fast-fading, a nearly optimal
   ``multiplesymbol{''} differential sphere detection (MSDSD) is also
   developed. The error performance of MSDSD is illustrated with simulation
   results under different fading scenarios.}},

   geometries with modified shapes was designed and included in an X-ray
   mask. Then the ultra-thick dry films were exposed through this mask to
   construct antennas. 2 mm tall structures with fine features down to 50
   mu m are achieved. The preliminary results show the existence of new

   dis-favours a hybrid interpretation of the X(3872), if it has J(PC) =

   Electrical power and speed are used as input variables to the proposed

   tested in the IEEE 12-bus test system for first swing stable, unstable,
   and multi-swing instability conditions to verify its performance.
   Electromagnetic transient modeling of the test system is done and
   simulations are performed using PSCAD/EMTDC (TM) in order to test the
   proposed algorithm. The simulation results indicate that the proposed
   method is computationally simple and accurate in predicting the

Abstract = {{In a deregulated electricity market, offering the appropriate amount of
   electricity at the right time with the right bidding price is of
   paramount importance. Mid-term electricity market clearing price (MCP)
   forecasting has become essential for resources reallocation, maintenance
   scheduling, bilateral contracting, budgeting and planning purposes.
   Although there are many techniques available for short-term electricity
   MCP forecasting, very little has been done in the area of mid-term
   electricity MCP forecasting. In this paper, a mid-term electricity MCP
   forecasting model utilizing multiple support vector machine (SVM) is
   presented. Two modules: data classification and price forecasting
   modules are designed to first pre-process the input data into
   corresponding price zones and then forecast the electricity prices. The
   proposed model showed improved forecasting accuracy on both peak prices
   and overall system compared to the forecasting model using single SVM.
   PJM interconnection data are used to test the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a low power, high linearity wideband cascode low
   noise amplifier (LNA) targeting the multi-standard wireless
   communication applications including LTE, GSM and Zigbee. Analyzing a
   cascode amplifier shows the common source (CS) stage is the main
   nonlinearity source for the LNA. The modified derivative superposition
   (MDS) technology is widely adopted to improve the linearity. In
   addition, when the operating frequency increases, the nonlinearity
   influence coming from the common gate (CG) increases and limits the
   linearity performance of the LNA. Based on the modified derivative
   superposition (MDS) technique, this work investigates the nonlinearity
   effects of the common gate (CG) stage on the cascode amplifier and
   employs both the derivative superposition (DS) and a terminal LC
   resonator on the CG stage. The nonlinearity coming from the CG stage is
   degraded in higher frequency and the high linear bandwidth is also
   increased. A cascode LNA was designed, analyzed, and implemented in the
   IBM 0.13-mu m CMOS technology. The LNA achieved a third-order intercept
   point (IIP3) of + 13.6 dBm, 3 dB NF and a 12 dB gain in a wide frequency

Abstract = {{In this paper, an input inductive network for the wideband LNA is
   proposed. The two input inductors located in and out of the feedback
   loop are set respectively to combine with the conventional resistive
   feedback structure. Input matching and NF of the LNA can be optimized
   separately by varying the value of the two input inductors without

   was analyzed, designed, and fabricated in the IBM 0.13 mu m CMOS
   technology to verify the concept. A - 10 dB S11 is achieved in a wide
   range of frequency from 1 GHz to 3 GHz. Within this bandwidth, the LNA
   has a gain of 7.5 dB and a minimum noise figure of 2.5 dB while consumes

Abstract = {{Reforestation is a primary end use for reconstructed soils following oil
   sands mining in northern Alberta, Canada. Limited soil water conditions
   in this climate will restrict plant growth. The objective of this study
   was to evaluate the effect of soil texture (gradation and layering) on
   plant available water and consequently on forest productivity for
   reclaimed coarse textured soils. A previously validated system dynamics
   (SD) model of soil water dynamics was coupled with ecophysiological and
   biogeochemical processes model, Biome-BGC-SD, to simulate forest
   dynamics for different soil profiles. These profiles included
   contrasting 50 cm textural layers of finer sand and coarser sand in
   which the sand layers had either a well graded or uniform soil texture.
   These were compared to homogeneous profiles of the same sands. Two tree
   species of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb) and trembling aspen (Populus
   tremoloides Mickx.) were simulated using a 60-year climatic data base
   from northern Alberta. Available water holding capacity (AWHC) was used
   to identify soil water regime, while leaf area index (LAI) and net
   primary production (NPP) were used as indices of forest productivity.
   Using the published and previously validated physiological parameters,
   the Biome-BGC-SD was used to study the responses of forest leaf area
   index and potential productivity to AWHC on different soil profiles.
   Simulated results indicated that layering of uniform fine sand overlying
   coarse sand could significantly increase AWHC in the 1-m profile for
   coarse textured soils. This enhanced AWHC could result in an increase in
   forest LAI and NPP. The extent of the increase varied with coarse sand
   gradation and vegetative types. The simulated results showed that the
   presence of 50 cm of uniform fine sand overlying 50 cm of graded coarse
   sand would provide an effective reclamation prescription to increase
   AWHC and forest productivity. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{A hardware channel emulator is essential for testing hardware receiver
   systems. The conventional test methodology uses a hardware radio
   frequency (RF) channel emulator connected between the transmitter and
   receiver under test. This method requires an RF channel emulator as well
   as a transmitter, both of which are expensive. In this article a method
   of hardware channel emulation is introduced whereby a multipath channel,
   as well as Gaussian noise at the analog front-end of the receiver, are
   modelled digitally at complex baseband. This approach allows integration
   of the channel emulator and the modulator into a single hardware
   structure resulting in a compact circuit that can reside inside the
   receiver system's digital signal processing (DSP) platform. Such an
   approach facilitates testing of the receiver's DSP implementation
   earlier in the development cycle.}},

   of position has to be determined from the north-south motion of the
   satellites due to the inclination of the orbit. Unfortunately most
   communications satellites are in a nearly geostationary orbit with very
   low inclination and have very little north-south motion. This paper
   describes algorithms that can be used to locate an earth based source of
   interference with acceptable accuracy given satellites with low

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel technique for detecting bleeding regions in

   from image-regions by calculating mean, standard deviation, skew and
   energy from the first order histogram of the RGB planes separately.
   Through the use of RGB color space, three times more number of features
   can be obtained than while using a grayscale image. Such color features
   have been used in content based retrieval system in pathology images.
   However, in spite of simplicity and ease of calculation, these features
   have not yet been studied in the classification of bleeding and
   non-bleeding regions in capsule endoscopic images. This paper studies
   the feasibility of using these features by assessing all possible
   feature subsets through the use of classification accuracy. The proposed
   algorithm could obtain classification accuracy up to 89\%.}},

Abstract = {{The seismocardiogram (SCG) measures the acceleration generated by the
   mechanical contraction and relaxation activities of the heart. It has
   been demonstrated to facilitate accurate identification of various
   coronary artery diseases. However, applications involving SCG are
   severely hampered by the large amount of data to be processed,
   preventing real-time monitoring and detection of diseases. This
   challenge is exacerbated in the case of tri-axial SCG, with the increase
   in data collected. Addressing this challenge, compressed sensing (CS) is
   a promising technique to potentially capture and represent signals
   significantly below the Nyquist rate. To this end, this work explores
   the possibility of using CS with SCG systems, by proposing suitable
   signal processing algorithms, and evaluating these methods with
   experimental data. The obtained results demonstrate significant
   reduction in bandwidth, while maintaining accurate signal recovery.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the performance of differential amplify-and-forward
   (D-AF) relaying over time-varying Rayleigh fading channels. Using the
   auto-regressive time-series model to characterize the time-varying
   nature of the wireless channels, new weights for the maximum ratio
   combining (MRC) of the received signals at the destination are proposed.
   Expression for the pair-wise error probability (PEP) is provided and
   used to obtain an approximation of the total average bit error
   probability (BEP). The obtained BEP approximation clearly shows how the
   system performance depends on the auto-correlation of the direct and the
   cascaded channels and an irreducible error floor exists at high
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulation results also demonstrate that,
   for fast-fading channels, the new MRC weights lead to a better
   performance when compared to the classical combining scheme. Our
   analysis is verified with simulation results in different fading

Title = {{Absorbing aerosol radiative effects in the limb-scatter viewing geometry}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2761-2776}},
Abstract = {{The limb-scatter satellite viewing geometry is well suited to detecting
   low-concentration aerosols in the upper troposphere due to its long
   observation path length (similar to 200 km), high vertical resolution
   (similar to 1-2 km) and good geographic coverage. We use the fully
   three-dimensional radiative transfer code SASKTRAN to simulate the
   sensitivity of limb-scatter viewing Odin/OSIRIS satellite measurements
   to absorbing mineral dust and carbonaceous aerosols (smoke and pure
   soot), as well as to non-absorbing sulfate aerosols and ice in the upper
   troposphere.
   At long wavelengths (813 nm) the addition of all aerosols (except soot)
   to an air only atmosphere produced a radiance increase as compared to
   air only, on account of the low Rayleigh scattering in air only at 813
   nm. The radiance reduction due to soot aerosol was negligible (< 0.1 \%)
   at all heights (0-100 km).
   At short wavelengths (337, 377, 452 nm), we found that the addition of
   any aerosol species to an air only atmosphere caused a decrease in
   single-scattered radiation due to an extinction of Rayleigh scattering
   in the direction of OSIRIS. The reduction was clearly related to
   particle size first, with absorption responsible for second-order
   effects only. Multiple-scattered radiation could either increase or
   decrease in the presence of an aerosol species, depending both on
   particle size and absorption. Large scatterers (ice, mineral dust) all
   increased multiple-scattered radiation within, below and above the
   aerosol layer. Small, highly absorbing pure soot particles produced a
   negligible multiple-scattering response (< 0.1 \%) at all heights,
   primarily confined to within and below the soot layer. Medium-sized
   scatterers produced a multiple-scattering response that depended on
   their absorbing properties. Increased radiances were simulated as
   compared to air only at all short wavelengths (337, 377 and 452 nm) for
   sulfate aerosol particles (non-absorbing) while decreased radiances were
   simulated for smoke particles (absorbing) at 337 and 377 nm, where
   multiple scattering involving the medium-sized carbonaceous particles
   amplified their absorbing properties. At 452 nm, however, this effect
   was attenuated and albedo-dependent.
   At short wavelengths, the combined effect of single scattering decreases
   and multiple scattering increases led to complex total radiance
   signatures that generally could not unambiguously distinguish absorbing
   versus non-absorbing aerosols. Smoke aerosols led to a total radiance
   decrease (as compared to air only) at all altitudes above the aerosol
   layer (15-100 km). This unique signature was a result of the aerosols'
   strong absorbing properties, non-negligible scattering efficiency, and
   number concentrations high enough to make multiple scattering effects
   due to the aerosol itself significant. Thus, in the limb-scatter viewing
   geometry scene darkening above the aerosol layer is unambiguously due to
   absorption whereas scene darkening within and below the aerosol layer
   can simply be the result of a reduction in single-scattered radiance.
   Our simulations show a greater scene darkening for decreasing
   wavelengths, increasing surface albedo, decreasing solar zenith angle,
   and increasing particle number concentration, however, at 337 nm this
   effect did not exceed 0.5\% of the total radiance due to air only,
   making the unique identification of medium-sized carbonaceous aerosols,
   i.e., smoke, difficult. Scene darkening (or brightening) varies linearly
   with particle number concentration over three orders of magnitude.
   A fortuitous, unexpected implication of our analysis is that
   limb-scatter retrievals of aerosol extinction are not sensitive to
   external information about aerosol absorption.}},

   discovery of Higgs particle as a momentous event, it is also an
   opportune moment to assess the physicists' conception of nature.

   many body theoretical methods of solid state physicists. Their efforts
   render the universe a superconductor of correlated quasi-particle pairs.
   Experimentalists, devoted to ascertain the elementary constituents and

Title = {{Complexity Analysis and Parameter Estimation of Dynamic Metabolic
   Systems}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{A metabolic system consists of a number of reactions transforming
   molecules of one kind into another to provide the energy that living
   cells need. Based on the biochemical reaction principles, dynamic
   metabolic systems can be modeled by a group of coupled differential
   equations which consists of parameters, states (concentration of
   molecules involved), and reaction rates. Reaction rates are typically
   either polynomials or rational functions in states and constant
   parameters. As a result, dynamic metabolic systems are a group of
   differential equations nonlinear and coupled in both parameters and
   states. Therefore, it is challenging to estimate parameters in complex
   dynamic metabolic systems. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze
   the complexity of dynamic metabolic systems for parameter estimation. As
   a result, the estimation of parameters in dynamic metabolic systems is
   reduced to the estimation of parameters in a group of decoupled rational
   functions plus polynomials (which we call improper rational functions)
   or in polynomials. Furthermore, by taking its special structure of
   improper rational functions, we develop an efficient algorithm to
   estimate parameters in improper rational functions. The proposed method
   is applied to the estimation of parameters in a dynamic metabolic
   system. The simulation results show the superior performance of the
   proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Fouling of surfaces is a major challenge in design and operation of many
   industrial heat transfer equipment. Fouling causes significant energy,
   material and production losses, which increase the environmental impact
   and decrease economic profitability of processes. Even small
   improvements in prevention of fouling would lead to significant savings
   in a wide range of heat transfer applications.
   In this study, crystallization fouling of aqueous calcium carbonate
   solutions on a heated stainless steel surface is used to investigate the
   prevention of fouling in heat transfer equipment by physical surface
   modifications. Fouling behaviour of different surface patterns are
   studied experimentally in a laboratory scale fouling test apparatus. CFD
   modelling is used to study hydrodynamic and thermal conditions near
   surfaces with different patterns. In addition, the effect of surface
   pattern on the removal of particles is studied numerically.
   Surface patterning is found to affect the hydrodynamic and thermal
   conditions near the wall, and therefore to change the conditions for
   fouling layer build-up and removal, when compared to a flat heat
   transfer surface. The most promising surface pattern includes curved
   shapes, and it seems to create flow conditions in which improved
   convective heat transfer decreases the driving force for crystallization
   fouling. In addition, curved surfaces increase the shear forces at the
   wall, which prevents adhesion of the foulants to the surface and
   increases resuspension.}},

Abstract = {{Observations of the mesospheric semi-annual oscillation (MSAO) in the
   equatorial region have been reported dating back several decades.
   Seasonal variations in both species densities and airglow emissions are
   well documented. The extensive observations available offer an excellent
   case study for comparison with model simulations. A broad range of MSAO
   measurements is summarised with emphasis on the 80-100 km region. The
   objective here is not to address directly the complicated driving forces
   of the MSAO, but rather to employ a combination of observations and
   model simulations to estimate the limits of some of the underlying
   dynamical processes. Photochemical model simulations are included for
   near-equinox and near-solstice conditions, the two times with notable
   differences in the observed MSAO parameters. Diurnal tides are
   incorporated in the model to facilitate comparisons of observations made
   at different local times. The roles of water vapour as the ``driver{''}
   species and ozone as the ``response{''} species are examined to test for
   consistency between the model results and observations. The simulations
   suggest the interactions between vertical eddy diffusion and background
   vertical advection play a significant role in the MSAO phenomenon.
   Further, the simulations imply there are rigid limits on vertical
   advection rates and eddy diffusion rates. For August at the Equator, 90
   km altitude, the derived eddy diffusion rate is approximately 1 x 10(6)
   cm(2) s(-1) and the vertical advection is upwards at 0.8 cm s(-1). For
   April the corresponding values are 4 x 10(5) cm(2) s(-1) and 0.1 cm
   s(-1). These results from the current 1-D model simulations will need to
   be verified by a full 3-D simulation. Exactly how vertical advection and
   eddy diffusion are related to gravity wave momentum as discussed by
   Dunkerton (1982) three decades ago remains to be addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Minimally invasive surgery represents the future of many types of
   medical intervention, such as endoscopic surgery. Colonoscopy involves
   the insertion of a flexible instrument (a colonoscope) into the human
   colon for the diagnosis and management of diseases of the colon. A
   colonoscope consists of a control hand unit with valves and a
   manoeuvrable bend section at the distal end controlled by two knobs at
   the control hand unit. During colonoscopy, loop formation present
   challenges. The form of a walking stick at the distal end of the scope
   plays a major role in loop formation in colonoscopy. Thus, an accurate
   kinematic model of the relationship between the motion of the distal end
   and the control unit could help colonoscopists effectively manipulate
   the motion of the distal end to avoid loop formation. This study uses
   D-H parameters to model the kinematics of the distal end of a
   colonoscope and analyzes the kinematic relationship between the motion
   of the tip of the colonoscope and the angular control at the control
   hand unit. The position and orientation of the distal end of the scope
   can be predicted for a given operation at the control unit. The
   kinematic model is validated by the experiment.}},

Abstract = {{The maximum useable beam width at the Biomedical Imaging and Therapy
   (BMIT) beamline at the Canadian Light Source (CLS) is suitable for most
   imaging applications. But access to a wider beam would benefit many
   programs especially computed tomography where the beam width defines the
   largest sample that can be imaged. A double crystal bent Laue
   monochromator capable of doubling the width of the incident beam is
   proposed; this is possible by taking advantage of symmetric off-axis, or
   skew reflections in the crystals. A preliminary experiment to establish
   proof of concept for this design has been completed using a double
   crystal unbent Laue system. Results are presented showing the beam width
   doubling from 28.3mm to 56.6mm and the effect of the skew reflections on
   the monochromaticity of the exit beam. Further work on this
   monochromator will include an investigation into the choice of
   reflections, a study of the effect on the change in energy across the
   exit beam, the development of strategies to minimize the effect of the
   beam overlap region downstream from the monochromator and the
   development of an alignment process for the double crystal bent Laue
   system.}},

Abstract = {{The micrometer range resolution of Synchrotron Radiation Tomography has
   developed an important technique for characterizing the three

Abstract = {{Diffraction Enhanced Imaging is an imaging modality that derives
   contrast from x-ray refraction, an extreme form of scatter rejection
   (extinction) and absorption which is common to conventional radiography.
   A critical part of the imaging system is the ``analyzer crystal{''}
   which is used to re-diffract the beam after passing through the object
   being imaged. The analyzer and monochromator crystals form a matched
   parallel crystal set. This analyzer needs to be accurately aligned and
   that alignment maintained over the course of an imaging session.
   Typically, the analyzer needs to remain at a specific angle within a few
   tens of nanoradians to prevent problems with image interpretation.
   Ideally, the analyzer would be set to specific angle and would remain at
   that angle over the course of an imaging session which might be from a
   fraction of a second to several minutes or longer. In many instances,
   this requirement is well beyond what is possible by relying on
   mechanical stability alone and some form of feedback to control the
   analyzer setting is required.
   We describe a novel analyzer control system that allows the analyzer to
   be set at any location in the analyzer rocking curve, including the peak
   location. The method described is extensible to include methods to
   extend the range of analyzer control to several Darwin widths away from
   the analyzer peaked location. Such a system is necessary for the
   accurate implementation of the method and is intended to make the use of
   the method simpler without relying on repeated alignment during the
   imaging session.}},

Title = {{Silicon clathrates as anode materials for lithium ion batteries?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{26}},
Pages = {{7782-7789}},
Abstract = {{Very recently, Si clathrates have been proposed to be useful as anodes
   in lithium ion batteries (LIBs). To explore this possibility, a
   systematic study was performed on the type-II Si clathrate (Si-136)
   using first-principles electronic structure calculations. The
   investigation focuses on five key properties of a good anode material,
   viz. structural stability, electrical conductivity, intercalation
   voltage, Li ion mobility, as well as storage capacity. Since pristine
   Si-136 is thermodynamically less stable with respect to crystalline Si,
   we focus on clathrates which are stabilized by doping Ba atoms in the
   large cages of empty Si-136. The lithiation of BaxSi136 (6 <= x <= 8)
   clathrates was then studied. It is found that the volume change
   associated with lithiation is negligibly small. The intercalation
   voltages are very low (similar to 0.4 V) and almost constant with Li
   concentration. Two distinct diffusion mechanisms for Li ion transport in
   the clathrates were identified. The lowest energy diffusion pathway
   (0.33 eV) is through the hexagonal face shared by two adjacent large
   5(12)6(4) cages. The Li diffusion between 5(12) and 5(12) or 5(12) and
   5(12)6(4) cages through a pentagonal face has a higher energy barrier of
   0.73-0.85 eV. The Li diffusion through a pentagonal face is found to be
   a complicated process involving sequential breaking and reformation of a
   particular Si-Si bond from the clathrate structure. Moreover, the
   activation barrier is reduced substantially from 2.08 eV by the
   simultaneous presence of Ba atoms in the two neighboring 5(12)6(4) cages
   connected by the Si-Si bond. Although the maximum theoretical capacity
   (123 mA h g(-1)) is lower than that of the graphite anode, it is still
   comparable with the current cathode materials. The information obtained
   in this study will be helpful to assess whether Si clathrates can be
   used as anode materials.}},

Pages = {{451-457}},
Abstract = {{Temperature anisotropies may be encountered in space plasmas when there
   is a preferred direction, for instance, a strong magnetic or electric
   field. In this paper, we study how ion temperature anisotropy can affect
   the threshold conditions of a shear-modified current driven
   electrostatic ion-acoustic (CDEIA) instability. In particular, this
   communication focuses on instabilities in the context of topside auroral
   F-region situations and in the limit where finite Larmor radius
   corrections are small. We derived a new fluid-like expression for the
   critical drift which depends explicitly on ion anisotropy. More
   importantly, for ion to electron temperature ratios typical of F-region,
   solutions of the kinetic dispersion relation show that ion temperature
   anisotropy may significantly lower the drift threshold required for
   instability. In some cases, a perpendicular to parallel ion temperature
   ratio of 2 and may reduce the relative drift required for the onset of
   instability by a factor of approximately 30, assuming the ion-acoustic
   speed of the medium remains constant. Therefore, the ion temperature
   anisotropy should be considered in future studies of ion-acoustic waves
   and instabilities in the high-latitude ionospheric F-region.}},

Pages = {{133-137}},
Abstract = {{Colonoscopy that is a very commonly carried out procedure has several
   problems, including a risk of perforation of the colon and significant
   discomfort for patients. Loop formation can be the reason of these
   problems. Loop formation is further associated with the configuration of
   the colon, in particular the rectum-sigmoid and sigmoid-descending
   segments that have a small curvature and ``S{''}-shaped profiles where
   the looped colonoscope exerts a quasi-static force on intestinal wall,
   and then results in deformation of the intestinal wall.
   Variable-stiffness colonoscope and over-tube colonoscope may be used to
   prevent loop formation; however, conflicting results relating to their
   use have been reported. In this paper, influence of a looped colonoscope
   on deformation of the intestinal wall is analyzed. It was found that the

Abstract = {{This study describes a support vector machine (SVM)-based technique for
   identifying loss-of-excitation (LOE) condition in synchronous generators
   from other disturbances such as external faults and power-swing

   the time coordination is reduced significantly. The proposed method is
   compared with traditional two-zone impedance method. Several operating
   conditions within the generator capability are used to verify the
   generality of the SVM-based classifier. The proposed classifier
   identifies an LOE condition in all cases before the impedance enters the
   larger mho impedance zone. Faults and power-swing conditions are
   identified correctly, thereby preventing incorrect operation of the LOE
   impedance zone.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS}},

Pages = {{486-502}},
Abstract = {{Neural network (NN) models have gained much attention for river flow
   forecasting because of their ability to map complex non-linearities.
   However, the selection of appropriate length of training datasets is
   crucial and the uncertainty in predictions of the trained NNs with new
   datasets is a crucial problem. In this study, self-organising maps (SOM)
   are used to classify the datasets homogeneously and the performance of
   four types of NN models developed for daily discharge predictions -
   namely traditional NN, wavelet-based NN (WNN), bootstrap-based NN (BNN)
   and wavelet-bootstrap-based NN (WBNN) - is analysed for their
   applicability cluster-wise. SOM classified the training datasets into
   three clusters (i.e. cluster I, II and III) and the trained SOM is then
   used to assign testing datasets into these three clusters. Simulation
   studies show that the WBNN model performs better for the entire testing
   dataset as well as for values in clusters I and III; for cluster II the
   performance of BNN model is better compared with others for a 1-day lead
   time forecasting. Overall, it is found that the proposed methodology can
   enhance the accuracy and reliability of river flow forecasting.}},

Title = {{A stochastic reconstruction framework for analysis of water resource
   system vulnerability to climate-induced changes in river flow regime}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{Assessments of potential impacts of climate change on water resources
   systems are generally based on the use of downscaled climate scenarios
   to force hydrological and water resource systems models and hence
   quantify potential changes in system response. This approach, however,
   has several limitations. The uncertainties in current climate and
   hydrological models can be large, such analyses are rapidly outdated as
   new scenarios become available, and limited insight into system response
   is obtained. Here, we propose an alternative methodology in which system
   vulnerability is analyzed directly as a function of the potential
   variations in flow characteristics. We develop a stochastic
   reconstruction framework that generates a large ensemble of perturbed
   flow series at the local scale to represent a range of potential flow
   responses to climate change. From a theoretical perspective, the
   proposed reconstruction scheme can be considered as an extension of both
   the conventional resampling and the simple delta-methods. By the use of
   a two-parameter representation of regime change (i.e., the shift in the
   timing of the annual peak and the shift in the annual flow volume),
   system vulnerability can be visualized in a two-dimensional map. The
   methodology is applied to the current water resource system in southern
   Alberta, Canada, to explore the system's vulnerability to potential
   changes in the streamflow regime. Our study shows that the system is
   vulnerable to the expected decrease in annual flow volume, particularly
   when it is combined with an earlier annual peak. Under such conditions,
   adaptation will be required to return the system to the feasible
   operational mode. Citation: Nazemi, A., H. S. Wheater, K. P. Chun, and

Title = {{Improved Compressed Sensing-Based Algorithm for Sparse-View CT Image
   Reconstruction}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{In computed tomography (CT), there are many situations where
   reconstruction has to be performed with sparse-view data. In sparse-view
   CT imaging, strong streak artifacts may appear in conventionally
   reconstructed images due to limited sampling rate that compromises image
   quality. Compressed sensing (CS) algorithm has shown potential to
   accurately recover images from highly undersampled data. In the past few
   years, total-variation-(TV-) based compressed sensing algorithms have
   been proposed to suppress the streak artifact in CT image
   reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an efficient compressed
   sensing-based algorithm for CT image reconstruction from few-view data
   where we simultaneously minimize three parameters: the l(1) norm, total
   variation, and a least squares measure. The main feature of our
   algorithm is the use of two sparsity transforms-discrete wavelet
   transform and discrete gradient transform. Experiments have been
   conducted using simulated phantoms and clinical data to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed algorithm. The results using the proposed
   scheme show much smaller streaking artifacts and reconstruction errors
   than other conventional methods.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic climate change and energy security concerns have created a
   demand for new ways of meeting society's demand for energy. The Earth's
   crust is being targeted in a variety of energy developments to either
   extract energy or facilitate the use of other energy resources by
   sequestering emitted carbon dioxide. Unconventional fossil fuel
   developments are already being pursued in great numbers, and large scale
   carbon capture and sequestration and geothermal energy projects have
   been proposed. In many cases, these developments compete for the same
   subsurface environments and they are not necessarily compatible with
   each other. Policy to regulate the interplay between these developments
   is poorly developed. Here, the subsurface footprints necessary to
   produce a unit of energy from different developments are estimated to
   assist with subsurface planning. The compatibility and order of
   development is also examined to aid policy development. Estimated
   subsurface energy footprints indicate that carbon capture and
   sequestration and geothermal energy developments are better choices than
   unconventional gas to supply clean energy.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{We propose an approach to solve continuous variable optimization
   problems. The approach is based on the integration of predatory search
   strategy (PSS) and swarm intelligence technique. The integration is
   further based on two newly defined concepts proposed for the PSS,
   namely, ``restriction{''} and ``neighborhood,{''} and takes the particle
   swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm as the local optimizer. The PSS is
   for the switch of exploitation and exploration (in particular by the
   adjustment of neighborhood), while the swarm intelligence technique is
   for searching the neighborhood. The proposed approach is thus named
   PSS-PSO. Five benchmarks are taken as test functions (including both
   unimodal and multimodal ones) to examine the effectiveness of the
   PSS-PSO with the seven well-known algorithms. The result of the test
   shows that the proposed approach PSS-PSO is superior to all the seven
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely accepted that pulse transit time (PTT), from the R wave

   relationship between blood pressure and PTT is illustrated, and the
   problems of calibration and re-calibration are also discussed in this
   paper. Moreover, multi-innovation recursive least square algorithm is
   employed to update the unknown parameter vector for the model and
   improve the results. Our algorithm is tested based on the continuous

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A green process for the preparation of biolubricant base stock from
   canola oil was developed. Three branched chain products were synthesized
   from commercially available canola oil. This process involves two steps,
   first, the preparation of epoxidized canola oil by using amberlite IR
   120 catalyst followed by ring opening reaction with different alcohols
   such as n-butanol, amyl alcohol, and 2-ethylhexanol catalyzed with
   Amberlyst-15 (dry). These products were confirmed by using FTIR, H-1 and
   C-13 NMR. The prepared oleo chemical derivatives show improved low
   temperature properties determined by measuring pour point and cloud
   point. These derivatives were used as additives in low lubricating
   diesel fuel and the lubricating properties were studied by using HFRR
   wear scar. These derivatives have good anti-wear and friction reducing
   properties at relatively low concentrations. Thermal stability of these
   derivatives was studied by using TGA. The material with higher chain
   alcohol had shown more lubricity and good thermal stability. The finding
   of this study shows that derivatives of epoxy canola oil can be used as
   a starting material for the lubricant formulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Predicting beta-Turns in Protein Using Kernel Logistic Regression}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{A beta-turn is a secondary protein structure type that plays a
   significant role in protein configuration and function. On average 25\%
   of amino acids in protein structures are located in beta-turns. It is
   very important to develope an accurate and efficient method for
   beta-turns prediction. Most of the current successful beta-turns
   prediction methods use support vector machines (SVMs) or neural networks
   (NNs). The kernel logistic regression (KLR) is a powerful classification
   technique that has been applied successfully in many classification
   problems. However, it is often not found in beta-turns classification,
   mainly because it is computationally expensive. In this paper, we used
   KLR to obtain sparse beta-turns prediction in short evolution time.
   Secondary structure information and position-specific scoring matrices
   (PSSMs) are utilized as input features. We achieved Q(total) of 80.7\%
   and MCC of 50\% on BT426 dataset. These results show that KLRmethod with
   the right algorithmcan yield performance equivalent to or even better
   than NNs and SVMs in beta-turns prediction. In addition, KLR yields
   probabilistic outcome and has a well-defined extension tomulticlass
   case.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses effect of addition of two noble metals, platinum or
   palladium (1 wt.\%), on performance of alumina-supported manganese
   oxides (10 wt.\%) in catalytic ozonation of toluene in the range of
   22-100 degrees C. Catalysts were characterized by ICP-MS, BET, X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR)
   and X-ray absorption spectroscopy ((AS) including quantitative X-ray
   absorption near edge structure (XANES) and qualitative extended X-ray
   absorption fine structure (EXAFS). It was found that addition of
   platinum improves activity of manganese oxides leading to complete
   conversion of toluene at 70 degrees C. Palladium was found to be
   ineffective in enhancing activity of manganese oxides mainly because of
   lack of atomic interaction between Pd and Mn. Pt and Mn XANES and EXAFS
   spectra changed after addition of Pt to manganese oxides implying an
   atomic interaction between platinum and manganese oxides. It is proposed
   that the interaction between Pt and Mn occurs via surface oxygen of
   manganese oxide clusters increasing dispersion of Pt atoms in the
   presence of Mn. This interaction could increase electron occupancy of Mn
   3d orbital which is more favorable in decomposition of ozone and
   consequently oxidation of toluene. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Safety network screening is used to identify road locations, such as
   intersections and roadway segments that exhibit an unusually high number
   of expected collisions or an abnormally high proportion of a certain
   configuration of collisions. Current state-of-the-art network screening
   methods rely on safety performance functions (SPFs) that require traffic
   volume as an input, but many cities in North America, including the city
   of Saskatoon, do not collect traffic volume for every intersection and
   segment within the city limits. Lack of traffic volume data severely
   restricts the applicability of a SPF-based network screening method. The
   binomial and beta-binomial tests, however, are formal collision
   diagnosis tests that can be used as a supplementary tool for screening
   roadway networks that include roadway segments for which traffic volume
   data are not available. However, previous studies have applied these two
   collision diagnosis tests without explicitly defining the particular
   circumstances that indicate which test is preferable. This study
   introduces a formal statistical test known as the ``C(alpha) test{''} to
   determine when there is a need to apply the beta-binomial test instead
   of the binomial test to screen a roadway network The study targeted
   major arterial uncontrolled access segments in Saskatoon using five
   years (2005-2009) of collision data for the two most frequent collision
   configurations: (1) rear end, and (2) side swipe same direction
   collisions. ArcGIS was used to develop collision maps that visually
   display the screening results. The collision maps are designed to
   facilitate the governing agencies' decision-making processes when
   selecting appropriate safety countermeasures to reduce target collision
   configurations at screened locations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the optimal cooperative beamforming design for
   multi-user multi-relay wireless networks in which the single-carrier
   frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) technique is employed at
   the terminals. The problem of interest is to find the beamforming
   weights across relays to maximize the minimum
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among source users
   subject to individual power constraints at each relay. Such a
   beamforming design is shown to be a hard non-convex optimization problem
   and therefore it is mathematically challenging to find the optimal
   solution. By exploring its partial convex structures, we recast the
   design problem as minimization of a d.c. (difference of two convex)
   objective function subject to convex constraints and develop an
   effective iterative algorithm of low complexity to solve it. Simulation
   results show that our optimal cooperative beamforming scheme realizes
   the inherent diversity order of the relay network and it performs
   significantly better than the equal-power beamforming weights.}},

Abstract = {{Essential proteins are indispensable to support cellular life.
   Identifying essential proteins can help us understand the minimal
   requirements for cell survival, which plays a significant role in the
   emerging field of synthetic biology. Moreover, essential proteins also
   serve as candidates of drug targets for developing novel therapy of
   diseases, such as cancer or infectious disease caused by emerging
   pathogens. However, it is expensive and time consuming to experimentally
   identify essential proteins. With accumulation of sequenced genomes, the
   gap between genome-wide essential protein data and sequence data become
   increasingly wide. Thus, computational approaches for detecting
   essential proteins are useful complements to limited experimental
   methods. There are many features related to protein essentiality. By
   taking advantage of these features, many computational approaches have
   been proposed to identify essential proteins. In this paper, we review
   the state-of-the-art techniques for computational detection of essential
   proteins, and discuss some challenges for future research in this field.}},

Abstract = {{We first propose a new method to process peptide identification reports
   from databases search engines. Then via it we develop a method for
   unifying protein inference and peptide identification by adding a
   feedback from protein inference to peptide identification. The feedback
   information is a list of high-confidence proteins, which is used to
   update an adjacency matrix between peptides. The adjacency matrix is
   used in the regularization of peptide scores. Logistic regression (LR)
   is used to compute the probability of peptide identification with the
   regularized scores. Protein scores are then calculated with the LR
   probability of peptides. Instead of selecting the best peptide match for
   each MS/MS, we select multiple peptides. By testing on two datasets, the
   results have shown that the proposed method can robustly assign accurate
   probabilities to peptides, and have a higher discrimination power than
   PeptideProphet to distinguish correct and incorrect identified peptides.
   Additionally, not only can our method infer more true positive proteins
   but also infer less false positive proteins than ProteinProphet at the
   same false positive rate. The coverage of inferred proteins is also
   significantly increased due to the selection of multiple peptides for
   each MS/MS and the improvement of their scores by the feedback from the
   inferred proteins.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of protein complexes plays a key role in
   understanding major cellular processes and biological functions. Various
   computational algorithms have been proposed to identify protein
   complexes from proteinprotein interaction (PPI) networks. In this paper,
   we first introduce a new seed-selection strategy for seed-growth style
   algorithms. Cliques rather than individual vertices are employed as
   initial seeds. After that, a result-modification approach is proposed
   based on this seed-selection strategy. Predictions generated by higher
   order clique seeds are employed to modify results that are generated by
   lower order ones. The performance of this seed-selection strategy and
   the result-modification approach are tested by using the entropy-based
   algorithm, which is currently the best seed-growth style algorithm to
   detect protein complexes from PPI networks. In addition, we investigate
   four pairs of strategies for this algorithm in order to improve its
   accuracy. The numerical experiments are conducted on a Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae PPI network. The group of best predictions consists of 1711
   clusters, with the average f-score at 0.68 after removing all similar
   and redundant clusters. We conclude that higher order clique seeds can
   generate predictions with higher accuracy and that our improved
   entropy-based algorithm outputs more reasonable predictions than the
   original one.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers joint transceiver designs for single-user
   multiple-input, multiple-output systems employing improper
   constellations such as binary phase shift-keying and M-ary amplitude
   shift-keying (M-ASK). Proposed are novel joint linear transceivers that
   minimize the total mean squared error of the symbol estimation at the
   output of the decoder. The joint linear transceiver designs are carried
   out for both cases of perfect channel state information (CSI) and
   imperfect CSI at the transmitter and receiver. For the case of imperfect
   CSI, the channel model takes into account both transmit and receive
   correlations as well as the channel estimation error. The superiority of
   the proposed transceivers over the previously-proposed designs is
   verified by simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{The sorption capacity parameters obtained for batch studies provide
   useful information about biosorption system. However, such data fail to
   explain the process under continuous-flow conditions. The present study
   is an attempt to explore the biosorption of Pb(II) and Cr(III) by straw
   from local wheat (Triticum aestivum). The biosorbent has been
   characterized by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and
   surface area and elemental analyses and found to be porous and
   polyfunctional. S-shaped breakthrough curves were obtained at different
   column heights for the both metal ions. Various breakthrough parameters
   and saturation times have been determined. The column data have been
   successfully used to study the Bohart-Adams' bed depth service time
   (BDST) model and Yoon and Nelson's model. It was found that BDST model
   quite efficiently explained the whole column data whereas Yoon and
   Nelson model could explain it below 90 \% breakthrough concentration.
   The predicted and calculated BDST parameters were in agreement with each
   other. Yoon and Nelson's constant decreased with an increase in the
   column height for both metal ions. Effect of change in flow rate on the
   Pb(II) biosorption has also been discussed with respect to BDST
   approach.}},
