Abstract = {{Allium fistulosum was investigated as a novel model system to examine
   the mechanism of freezing resistance in cold hardy plants. The 250 x 50
   x 90 mu m average cell size and single epidermal cell layer system
   allowed direct observation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), functional
   group localization during acclimation, freezing and thawing on an
   individual cell basis in live intact tissues. Cells increased freezing
   resistance from an LT50 of -11 degrees C (non-acclimated) to -25 degrees
   C under 2?weeks of cold acclimation. Samples were processed using
   Fourier transform infrared technology (FTIR) on a synchrotron light
   source and a focal plane array detector. In addition, confocal
   fluorescent microscopy combined with a cryostage using ER selective dye
   of ER-Tracker allowed more detailed examination of membrane responses
   during freezing. Cold acclimation increased the ER volume per cell, and
   the freeze-induced cell deformation stopped ER streaming and ER
   vesiculation subsequently occurred through the breakdown in the ER
   network. Freeze-induced ER vesicles in cold-acclimated cells were larger
   and more abundant than those in non-acclimated cells. According to FTIR,
   the carbohydrate/ester fraction and a-helical/beta-sheet secondary
   structure localized in the apoplast/plasma membrane region were most
   visibly increased during cold acclimation. Results suggest the mechanism
   of cold acclimation and freezing resistance in very hardy cells may be
   associated with both alterations in the apoplast/plasma membrane region
   and the ER cryodynamics. Allium fistulosum appears to be a useful system
   to obtain direct evidence at both intra and extracellular levels during
   cold acclimation and the freezing process.}},

Abstract = {{Self-generation and sustainment of toroidal flux via a dynamo is one of
   the unique characteristics of the reversed-field pinch (RFP)
   configuration. In a small aspect ratio RFP machine RELAX, it has been
   observed that a sudden dynamo usually occurs at a localized toroidal
   location. This localized dynamo evolves in time, causing a toroidally
   asymmetric flux distribution. The degree of asymmetry depends on the
   location and propagation of the localized dynamo. It has been observed
   that the position where the localized dynamo occurs coincides with the
   position where the phases of the internally resonant tearing modes
   align. The phase alignment plays an important role in triggering a
   localized dynamo activity and in the formation of asymmetric toroidal
   flux distribution especially in deep-reversal plasmas in RELAX.}},

Title = {{Study of factors affecting syngas quality and their interactions in
   fluidized bed gasification of lignite coal}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{308-320}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A series of experiments has been designed and conducted to study the
   effect of three operating factors, namely, coal feedrate, coal particle
   size, and steam/O-2 ratio, and their interactions on the quality of
   syngas produced from fluidized bed gasification of lignite coal. The
   quality of syngas is evaluated based on five indices including carbon
   conversion, H-2/CO ratio, CH4/H-2 ratio, gas yield, and gasification
   efficiency. The design of experiment tool based on the response surface
   methodology (RSM), which is believed to be more accurate than the common
   one-factor-at-a-time approach, is used to facilitate the comparison of
   the effect of all factors. The factors are tested in the ranges of
   0.036-0.063 g/s, 70-500 mu m, and 0.5-1.0, for coal feedrate, coal
   particle size, and steam/O-2 ratio, respectively. The carbon conversion,
   H-2/CO ratio, CH4/H-2 ratio, gas yield, and gasification efficiency are
   found to range from 91\% to 97\%, 0.776 to 1.268, 0.0517 to 0.0702, 3.4
   to 3.7 m(3) gas/kg coal, and 56\% to 67\%, respectively. The effects of
   individual operating factors and their interactions on each syngas
   quality index are discussed using RSM tools. A set of operating
   conditions to achieve syngas with a desired quality for different
   applications is also proposed by optimization of the response surface of
   each index. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Mercury removal by bio-char based modified activated carbons}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{570-578}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of mercury concentration, process
   temperature, halides impregnating agents, halides precursor, and halides
   loading concentration on the mercury removal efficiency of the bio-char
   derived activated carbons from gaseous phase. The mercury was mainly in
   the elemental state. The activated carbons were prepared using steam
   activation method in a pilot scale set-up for the bio-char obtained from
   fast pyrolysis of whitewood. The elemental, porous structure, particle
   size, ash content, and thermogravimetric analyses were performed for the
   bio activated carbons. The activated carbons were impregnated using
   various precursors such as potassium and ammonium halides, with the
   halide loadings in the range of 0.1-1.0 mol\% of carbon content. It was
   observed that impregnation of the halide ions significantly improved the
   performance of the activated carbon (AC) for elemental mercury capture
   in nitrogen flow. For the same molar loading of halide ions, mercury
   removal efficiency increased in the following order: AC < Cl-impregnated
   AC < Br-impregnated AC < I-impregnated AC. Also, Hg removal efficiency
   of ammonium halide impregnated activated carbon was higher compared to
   potassium halide impregnated activated carbon, which is due to the
   better access of Hg to active sites in pores for ammonium halide
   impregnating agent. Changes in Hg removal efficiency with the process
   temperature showed that possibly the main mechanism for Hg capture by
   activated carbon changed from physisorption to chemisorption after
   impregnation. In the present study, the field test was performed for
   bio-based unimpregnated activated carbon and was observed to
   significantly reduce the carbon to mercury ratio for mercury removal
   from actual flue gas compared with that for the commercial activated
   carbon. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple and efficient color image enhancement
   method for endoscopic images. The proposed image enhancement method
   works by two interrelated steps: image enhancement at gray level and
   color reproduction. At, first, the captured RGB endoscopic image is
   converted into 2 dimensional gray level spectral images using a
   well-known method called FICE (Fuji Intelligent Color Enhancement). In
   the next stage the image with maximum entropy is selected as the base
   image to be used for color reproduction. Maximum entropy value indicates
   the maximum enhanced image. In color reproduction, the entire
   chrominance map of a source image is transferred into the base image by
   matching luminance and texture information between two images. The
   distance between luminance components of target (base image) and source
   images are calculated using 2-norm Euclidean distance. The proposed
   color image enhancement method is compared with popular narrow-band
   imaging on the scale of image quality, image enhancement, simulation
   speed and efficiency of color reproduction and distortion. The proposed
   method can be applied on any RGB images collected from any white light
   endoscopic devices. Is highlights the tissue characterization on the
   surface part of base endoscopic image that enables better diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{A novel iterative receiver is proposed for relay-aided multiuser
   communications in which multiple users transmit to a destination with
   the help of a relay and using fast frequency-hopping modulation. Each
   user employs a channel encoder to protect its information data and to
   help interference cancellation at the receiver. The received signal at
   the relay is partially decoded with a simple energy detector. At the
   destination, the iterative receiver exploits the soft outputs of the
   channel decoders to successively extract the maximum likelihood symbols
   of the users and perform interference cancellation. Under the same
   spectral efficiency, simulation results demonstrate the excellent
   performance of the proposed receiver when compared to the performance of
   decoding without interference cancellation as well as performance of the
   maximum likelihood multiuser detection previously developed for uncoded

Abstract = {{Adaptive physical layer network coding (PNC) has been shown to be
   effective in two-way relay communications (TWRC). Given that the
   existing PNC methods were developed for frequency-flat fading channels,
   this paper studies adaptive PNC in OFDM systems operating over
   frequency-selective fading channels. Proposed and investigated are three
   methods to determine a common clustering for all subcarriers in order to
   reduce the overhead information required in the broadcast phase. The
   ``Min-SER{''} method is given based on the analysis of the error event
   in the multiple access phase, while the ``Max-fade-SER{''} and
   ``Min-fade-distance{''} methods are recommended to further reduce the
   computational complexity in determining the common clustering.

Abstract = {{Now multiple types of data are available for prioritizing human disease
   genes, including gene-disease associations, disease phenotype
   similarities, locations of genes or their corresponding proteins in
   biological networks, etc.. Integrating multiple types of data is
   expected to be effective for prioritizing human disease genes. In this
   paper, we propose a multiple data integration method based on the theory
   of Markov Random Field (MRF) and the method of Bayesian analysis for
   prioritizing human disease genes. The proposed method is not only
   flexible in easily incorporating different kinds of data, but also
   reliable in predicting candidate disease genes. Numerical experiments
   are carried out by integrating known gene-disease associations, protein
   complexes, protein-protein interactions and gene expression profiles.
   Predictions are evaluated by both the leave-one-out method and the fold
   enrichment method. The sensitivity and the specificity can reach at
   roughly 80\% simultaneously. The method achieves 56.02-fold enrichment
   on average when integrating all those biological data in our
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{A novel clustering model is proposed which combines the optimization
   mechanism of artificial bee colony (ABC) with the fuzzy membership
   matrix in this paper. The clustering model contains two parts: one is to
   search optimum cluster centers using ABC mechanism, the other is to
   implement clustering using intuitionistic fuzzy clustering (IFC) method.
   Firstly, the cluster centers are set randomly and the initial clustering
   results are obtained using fuzzy membership matrix. The new cluster
   centers are updated with the nodes that contain the maximal amount of
   information in the previous clusters of onlookers by ABC algorithm. If
   the onlookers are incapable of updating, the scouts will generate new
   cluster centers via global searching. Then the clustering result is
   obtained through IFC method based on the new optimized cluster centers.
   Considering that some protein nodes in PPI networks are unreachable,
   which leads to the traditional distance based clustering criteria
   infeasible. Therefore the new objective function is designed. The
   improved algorithm, named ABC-IFC, is also compared with the traditional
   fuzzy C-means clustering and IFC method. The experimental results on
   MIPS dataset show that the new algorithm does not only get improved in
   terms of several commonly used evaluation criteria such as precision,
   recall and P-value, but also obtains a better clustering result.}},

   network are collected from different experiments. The inference of gene
   regulatory networks (GRNs) can be improved by integrating these

   outliers, which may affect the inference results. A novel method, Huber
   group LASSO, is proposed to reconstruct the GRNs from multiple datasets
   as well as taking the robustness into account. To solve the optimization
   problem involved in the proposed method, an efficient algorithm which
   combines the ideas of auxiliary function minimization and block
   coordinate descent is developed. Simulations and real data applications
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Results show that the
   proposed method outperforms the group LASSO method and is able to
   reconstruct reasonably good GRNs from multiple datasets even the number
   of genes exceeds the number of observations.}},

Abstract = {{Local network alignment is an effective way to comparatively analyze a
   pair of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks so as to identify the
   common subnetworks (conserved protein complexes) across species, which
   helps us better understand the structure, function and evolution of
   biological cells. In this work, we propose a new dividing-and-matching
   method named by DAMAlign to detect conserved protein complexes via local
   network alignment. DAMAlign firstly partitions one of PPI network into
   subnetworks and then these subnetworks are mapped to the other PPI
   network to find common connected components. In the course of finding
   common connected components, DAMAlign adopts a lenient criteria that is
   we locally extend a pair of homologous proteins if there exists at least
   one path of length not larger than 2 to connect one of node in the
   homologous protein pair in its corresponding network. We implement
   network alignment between S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster. The
   experimental results show that DAMAlign outperforms other existing
   methods in recovering known protein complexes. Moreover, the conserved
   protein complexes that are detected by DAMAlign from different PPI
   networks are also functional similar in terms of their GO semantic
   similarity.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, de novo peptide sequencing from mass spectrometry data
   has developed as one of the major peptide identification methods with
   the emergence of new instruments and advanced computational methods.
   However, there are still limitations to this method; for example, the
   typically used spectrum graph model cannot represent all the information
   and relationships inherent in tandem mass spectra (MS/MS spectra). Here,
   we present a new spectrum graph model with multiple types of edges
   (called a multi-edge graph), and integrate amino acid combination (AAC)
   information and peptide tags into it for peptide sequencing. In
   addition, the information about immoniun ions observed particularly in
   higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) spectra are incorporated.
   Comparisons between the proposed method and another successful de novo
   peptide sequencing method for HCD spectra, pNovo, were performed.
   Experiments were conducted on four HCD spectral datasets. Results show
   that the proposed method outperforms pNovo in terms of full length
   peptide identification accuracy; specifically, the accuracy increases
   7\%-13\% over all four datasets.}},

Abstract = {{This research work is to control motion of a manipulator attached to a
   mobile robot for pick-and-place operations; this is part of a bigger
   project in developing a robotic-assisted nursing to be used in medical
   settings. In this paper a strategy to accomplish pick-and-place
   operations, using a six degree-of-freedom robotic arm, is presented.
   Such operations are completed by creating a collision-free path to move
   an object from an initial to a final position. The collision-free path
   is planned by considering the entire workspace of the manipulator. The
   workspace is defined as the subtraction of the stationary objects and
   the robot volumes from all of the possible reachable points of the
   robotic arm. Once the path is planned, the kinematics of the manipulator
   is considered. Although this project can be applied into a wide range of
   applications, it is mainly intended to be used for medical robotic
   assistance. Simulation results for several different paths are
   presented. The simulation results were verified with experimental
   results, although not shown here.}},

Abstract = {{The tribocorrosion behavior of titanium-based alloys is of significant
   interest as bio-implant materials. Bare alloys may not offer enough
   resistance to tribocorrosion, so coatings could be used to improve their
   performance. An important biomedical alloy, Ti-13Nb-13Zr, and a newly
   developed beta titanium alloy called ``Gum metal{''}
   (Ti-23\%Ni-0.7\%Ta-2 \%Zr-1 \%02) were used as substrates in the current
   work. Both were coated with conventional and nano-ceramic materials of
   Al2O3-TiO2. Bilayered coatings of ZrO2 Al2O3-13 \%TiO2 were also applied
   to the Ti-13Nb-13Zr using plasma spray. The coatings on Ti-13Nb-13Zr
   were applied using plasma spray, whereas that on the Gum metal was
   applied by a detonation gun (D-Gun). Surface morphology was
   characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Tribocorrosion
   experiments were performed in salt water using a linear reciprocating
   ball-on-plate tribometer with an aluminum ball as the slider. The nano
   particles are embedded in the fully melted splats and offered better
   crack propagation resistance. The high velocity of the D-Gun process
   resulted in a higher volume fraction of the embedded nano particles and
   produced substantial improvement in wear resistance relative to the
   air-plasma-sprayed coating. The conventional coating, with its higher
   porosity, exhibited a high corrosion rate compared to nano coating. The
   D-Gun coating, with its lower porosity, had a higher corrosion
   resistance than the plasma-sprayed coating, but bilayered plasma-sprayed
   coating showed even higher corrosion resistance, owing to its dense
   microstructure. Open-circuit potential measurements before and during
   tribocorrosion showed that the bilayered plasma-sprayed coating had
   better tribocorrosion resistance than the other coatings.
   Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated stable impedance values
   for the bilayered plasma-sprayed coating before and after
   tribocorrosion.}},

Abstract = {{Al-SBA-15 with high surface area and avg. pore diameter was prepared
   using hydrothermal synthesis. Platinum (0-1.75 wt.\%) was incorporated
   in the Al-SBA-15 support and the catalytic activity was tested using
   hydrotreated light gas oil (HLGO) as the feed. All the catalysts were
   thoroughly characterized using N-2 adsorption, ICP, TPD, SAX, FTIR, NMR
   and TEM analysis. Most of the Al in the support was in the framework
   with tetrahedral coordination (Al-27 NMR) and the prevalence of the
   hexagonal mesoporous structure with Pt doping was confirmed from the low
   angle SAX, BET and TEM study. The incorporation of Al in the framework
   and the corresponding acidity improvement were confirmed from the TPD
   and Pyridine FTIR (Py-FTIR) analysis. The dispersion of the Pt was
   improved until 1.5\% Pt incorporation, beyond which the Pt clusters were
   formed. Screening of the catalysts was carried out in a Parr autoclave
   and observed that 1.5\% Pt/Al-SBA-15 is an effective catalyst for
   improvement in cetane index of HLGO. These activity results are in
   correlation with the dispersion of the Pt on Al-SBA-15. More than 90\%
   of aromatic conversions were observed on 1.5\% Pt/Al-SBA-15. A maximum
   cetane index of 64 was observed on 1.5\% Pt/Al-SBA-15 at 350 degrees C,
   whereas reference (Pt/HY) catalyst could not improve the cetane index
   mainly due to the formation of secondary cracking products. (C) 2012

Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{41-47}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The dissolved carbon dioxide (DCO2) evolved from Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae was measured for the duration of very-high-gravity (VHG)
   ethanol fermentation conducted at four glucose feeds (150, 200 +/- 0.21,
   250 +/- 0.12, and 300 +/- 0.28 g/L). The DCO2 concentration profiles
   depict evolution patterns that depend on the extent of glucose utilized.
   A mass balance for DCO2 was proposed by taking into account the
   physiochemical behavior of CO2 and biological processes occurring under
   VHG ethanol fermentation conditions. The proposed equations could
   interpret the underlying CO2 desorption, CO2 conversion, and CO2
   evolution on the basis of yeast activity during VHG ethanol
   fermentation. Consequently for 150 and 200 +/- 0.21 g glucose/L absence
   of yeast activity was interpreted in terms of zero CO2 evolution rate
   (CER(t)). In contrast, under 250 +/- 0.12 and 300 +/- 0.28 g glucose/L
   conditions the presence of non-zero residual glucose resulted in
   non-zero CER(t). The mass balance equation could also interpret that the
   physical desorption of CO2 from the fermentation broth did not follow
   the equilibrium relation between dissolved and off-gas CO2
   concentrations as defined by Henry's law under current experimental
   conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   tissue-engineered constructs (TECs) to repair or replace the damaged
   tissues/organs in various engineered applications. In the past, the TEC
   culture process was typically treated as a black box and performed on
   the basis of trial and error. Recently, computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) has demonstrated its potential to analyze the fluid flow inside
   and around the TECs, therefore, being able to provide insight into the
   culture process, such as information on the velocity field and shear
   stress distribution that can significantly affect such cellular
   activities as cell viability and proliferation during the culture
   process. This paper briefly reviews the CFD and experimental methods
   used to investigate the in vitro culture process of skeletal-type TECs
   in bioreactors, where mechanical deformation of the TEC can be ignored.
   Specifically, this paper presents CFD modeling approaches for the
   analysis of the velocity and shear stress fields, mass transfer, and
   cell growth during the culture process and also describes various
   particle image velocimetry (PIV) based experimental methods to measure
   the velocity and shear stress in the in vitro culture process. Some key
   issues and challenges are also identified and discussed along with
   recommendations for future research. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007952]}},

Abstract = {{The electronic structures of Sn and Pb implanted SiO2 are studied using
   soft X-ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopy. We show,
   using reference compounds and ab initio calculations, that the presence
   of Pb - O and Sn - O interactions can be detected in the pre-edge region
   of the oxygen K-edge XAS. Via analysis of this interaction-sensitive
   pre-edge region, we find that Pb implantation results primarily in the
   clustering of Pb atoms. Conversely, with Sn implantation using identical
   conditions, strong Sn - O interactions are present, showing that Sn is
   coordinated with oxygen. The varying results between the two ion types
   are explained using both ballistic considerations and density functional
   theory calculations. We find that the substitution of Pb into Si sites
   in SiO2 requires much more energy than substituting Sn in these same
   sites, primarily due to the larger size of the Pb ions. From these
   calculated formation energies it is evident that Pb requires far higher
   temperatures than Sn to be soluble in SiO2. These results help explain
   the complex processes which take place upon implantation and determine
   the final products. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration-based damage detection (VBDD) comprises a promising set of
   techniques for damage detection and health monitoring of civil
   engineering structures. However, the successful application of these
   methods to real structures is still a challenging task, due primarily to
   the large size of such structures and the relatively high levels of
   variability in their dynamic response under operational load conditions.
   In this paper, a new methodology is introduced for the application of
   VBDD techniques, with the goal of enhancing their effectiveness for
   identifying and locating low damage levels and improving their
   applicability to the continuous or periodic health monitoring of
   structures. The basic features of the methodology include the use of a
   controlled and consistent excitation force, the use of operational
   deflection shapes (ODSs) at all measured frequency increments rather
   than only at natural frequencies, the use of a logarithmic scale for
   representing the ODS amplitudes at each frequency increment and the
   establishment of a threshold level for damage detection that accounts
   for experimental variability. The performance of the proposed
   methodology is verified and demonstrated by applying several Level 1
   (damage detection) and Level 2 (damage localization) VBDD techniques
   using experimental data measured on a steel girder taken from a railway
   bridge. The proposed approach is shown to perform very well at
   detecting, locating and monitoring the growth of damage. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{We present the derivation of a supersymmetric model for fermionic fields
   with integer-valued mass dimension based on a general superfield with
   one free spinor index. First, we develop a formalism based on a general
   superfield with one free spinor index. Then, we systematically derive
   all associated chiral and antichiral superfields up to third order in
   covariant derivatives. Using this formalism we are able to construct a
   supersymmetric on-shell Lagrangian that contains a kinetic term for the
   fermionic fields with mass dimension one. We then derive the
   corresponding on-shell supercurrent and succeed in formulating a
   consistent second quantisation for the component fields. Finally, we
   present our result for a supersymmetric Hamiltonian. As the Lagrangian
   is by construction supersymmetric and the Hamiltonian was derived from
   the Lagrangian using supersymmetry algebra the Hamiltonian must be
   positive definite.}},

Abstract = {{Various evidences have demonstrated that functional modules are
   overlapping and hierarchically organized in protein-protein interaction
   (PPI) networks. Up to now, few methods are able to identify both
   overlapping and hierarchical functional modules in PPI networks. In this
   paper, a new hierarchical clustering algorithm, called OH-PIN, is
   proposed based on the overlapping M\_clusters, lambda-module, and a new
   concept of clustering coefficient between two clusters. By recursively
   merging two clusters with the maximum clustering coefficient, OH-PIN
   finally assembles all M\_clusters into lambda-modules. Since M\_clusters
   are overlapping, lambda-modules based on them are also overlapping.
   Thus, OH-PIN can detect a hierarchical organization of overlapping
   modules by tuning the value of lambda. The hierarchical organization is
   similar to the hierarchical organization of GO annotations and that of
   the known complexes in MIPS. To compare the performance of OH-PIN and
   other existing competing algorithms, we apply them to the yeast PPI
   network. The experimental results show that OH-PIN outperforms the
   existing algorithms in terms of the functional enrichment and matching
   with known protein complexes.}},

   handling is explicitly taken care by implanting augmented lagrangian

   are evaluated and compared on 10 benchmarked problems (made constrained

Abstract = {{The urania fuel oxidation model for a steam-rich atmosphere developed by
   Cox et al. using the extensive experimental database has been
   subsequently used widely but with some inconsistencies in
   implementations. They are listed and evaluated in this work to help
   improve the existing models as well as for future model development. The
   comparison of the equilibrium stoichiometry deviation, calculated using
   various models, is also given. Small differences between the equilibrium
   constants used for steam dissociation are found. In one application, the
   original model for steam dissociation was rewritten in terms of
   component partial pressures for simplification. It is shown that the
   modified model differs from the original model by a multiplicative
   factor (1 - p(O2)/P-tot). A more complex equation that preserves total
   pressure is derived. However, the effect on the calculated fuel
   oxidation is much smaller than the effect of the uncertainty of the
   equilibrium stoichiometry deviation. The discrepancies in stoichiometry
   deviations and the estimate of the surface area of a pellet may lead to
   a double underprediction of fuel oxidation rate.}},

   26(12): 3406-3417, 2012-There is a need to investigate the effect of
   specific movement strategies in reducing biomechanical risk factors for
   anterior cruciate ligament injury in young female athletes. The purpose
   of this study was (a) to determine the feasibility of implementing a
   novel movement strategy (Core-PAC) into a team warm-up before soccer
   training based on subject compliance and integration of the Core-PAC
   into the warm-up and (b) to determine whether the Core-PAC would improve
   peak knee flexion angles and peak abduction moments at the knee during a
   side cut (SC) and an unanticipated side cut (USC) before kicking a
   soccer ball, and a side hop (SH) task after immediate instruction and
   after a 4-week training program. A convenience sample of ten 14- to
   16-year-old female soccer players were instructed in the Core-PAC
   immediately after baseline testing and during a training program
   consisting of a 20-minute warm-up, 2 times per week. The Core-PAC was
   understood and accepted by the subjects and incorporated into their
   warm-up activities with good compliance. After the immediate
   instruction, there were significant increases in peak knee flexion
   angles of a mean 6.4 degrees during the SC (p = 0.001), 3.5 degrees
   during the USC (p = 0.007), and 5.8 degrees during the SH (p < 0.001)
   tasks. Peak knee abduction moments decreased by a mean of 0.25
   N.m.kg(-1) during the SC (p < 0.03), 0.17 N.m.kg(-1) during the USC (p =
   0.05), and 0.27 N.m.kg(-1) during the SH (p = 0.04) tasks. After the
   4-week training program, some individuals showed improvement. The
   results of this study suggest that the Core-PAC may be 1 method of
   modifying high-risk movements for ACL injury such as side cutting and
   single-leg landing.}},

Abstract = {{Alfven eigenmodes (AEs) were studied in neutral beam injection (NBI)
   heated plasmas in the TJ-II stellarator using a heavy ion beam probe
   (HIBP) in the core, and by Langmuir (LP) and Mirnov probes (MP) at the
   edge. AEs were detected over the whole plasma radius by the HIBP with a
   spatial resolution of about 1 cm. AE-induced oscillations were detected
   in the plasma density n(e), electric potential phi and poloidal magnetic
   field B-pol with frequencies 50 kHz < f(AE) < 300 kHz. The LP, MP and
   HIBP data showed a high level of coherency for specific branches of AEs.
   Poloidal mode wave-vectors k(theta), mode numbers m (m < 8) and
   propagation velocities V-theta similar to 30 km s(-1) were detected for
   various branches of AEs, having different radial locations. When the
   density rose due to NBI fuelling, the AE frequency decreased as
   predicted by the Alfven law f(AE) similar to n(e)(-1/2). During the AE
   frequency decay the following new AE features were observed: (i) the
   poloidal wave-vector k(theta) and mode number m remained constant, (ii)
   the cross-phases between the oscillations in B-pol, n(e) and electric
   potential remained constant, having an individual value for each AE
   branch, (iii) V-theta decreased proportional to the AE frequency. The
   interaction of the AEs with the bulk (thermal) plasma resulted in
   clearly pronounced quasi-coherent peaks in the electrostatic turbulent
   particle flux spectra. Various AE branches exhibited different
   contributions to the particle flux: outward, inward and also zero,
   depending on the phase relations between the oscillations in E-pol and
   n(e), which are specific for each branch. A comparison with MHD mode
   modelling indicated that some of the more prominent frequency branches
   can be identified as radially extended helical AEs.}},

Abstract = {{Bioengineered tissue scaffolds are a potential tool for improving
   regenerative repair of damaged peripheral nerves. Novel modes of
   fabrication coupled with scaffold design strategies that are based on an
   understanding of the biology of nerve injury offer the prospect of

   incidence of peripheral nerve injury and the biological events that
   unfold during nerve regeneration after an injury. Newly available tissue
   scaffold fabrication technologies using bioplotting and laser-based
   techniques are described. Scaffold design strategies are also discussed,
   including the incorporation of living cells during scaffold fabrication,
   inclusion of neurotrophic gradients, use of electric stimulation,
   inclusion of antioxidant compounds to counteract neural apotosis, and
   promotion of angiogenesis. Use of these advanced fabrication techniques
   and incorporation of one or more of these active biological strategies
   may eventually lead to a greater success in peripheral nerve tissue
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{With the technological advancement, entertainment has become
   revolutionized and the high-definition (HD) video has become an integral
   feature of our modern amusement system. The demand for wireless
   transmission of HD video is rapidly rising for its ubiquitous nature,
   easy installation and relocation. Such wireless transmissions of HD
   video streams require very high bandwidth. The ultra-wideband (UWB)
   offers a large bandwidth, and short-range high-speed data transmission
   at low cost and low power consumption. In this paper, we present the
   feasibility study to transmit HD video wirelessly using H.264/AVC
   compression over the UWB communication channel. Simulations are carried
   out by controlling key H.264/AVC encoder parameters such as, in-loop
   deblocking filter, group of pictures, and quantization parameter. Based
   on the analysis, an optimum setting of these parameters is proposed for
   different bandwidth requirements, as well as acceptable video quality.
   The bandwidth achieved is restricted between 1.5 and 20 Mbps with a
   minimum reconstruction quality of 34 dB. The HD bit stream is then
   transmitted over the UWB communication channel and the demonstration
   shows that the overall encoder performance is satisfactory with the
   transmission bit-error-rate (BER) in the range of 10(-5)-10(-8).}},

Abstract = {{Detection and discrimination of nanoparticles is a vital step in several
   analytical and diagnostic procedures. Towards this, the authors present
   in the current study, for the first time, an all
   poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer membrane-based solid-state
   sensor capable of detecting single silica nanoparticles. The sensor is
   based on a single cylindrical submicron pore of 450 nm in diameter and 1
   mm in length, patterned by electron beam lithography in a PMMA membrane.
   It was subsequently integrated into a PMMA-based electrophoretic flow
   detector system containing two electrolyte reservoirs. Silica
   nanoparticles of 100 nm in diameter were dispersed in an electrolyte and
   detected as they temporarily block the current flow during translocation
   through the submicron pore, driven by an electric field. The submicron
   pore was highly stable, and able to not only detect but also
   discriminate between silica nanoparticles of different dimensions
   recognised by different amounts of current blockade produced as they
   translocated through the pore. The translocations of individual 100 and
   150 nm diameter silica nanoparticles through the single submicron pore,
   and thus the amounts of current blockade they produce, were shown in
   very close agreement with the results evaluated mathematically using the
   model presented in this study.}},

Journal = {{PROTEOME SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Protein inference is an important computational step in
   proteomics. There exists a natural nest relationship between protein
   inference and peptide identification, but these two steps are usually
   performed separately in existing methods. We believe that both peptide
   identification and protein inference can be improved by exploring such
   nest relationship.
   Results: In this study, a feedback framework is proposed to process
   peptide identification reports from search engines, and an iterative
   method is implemented to exemplify the processing of Sequest peptide
   identification reports according to the framework. The iterative method
   is verified on two datasets with known validity of proteins and
   peptides, and compared with ProteinProphet and PeptideProphet. The
   results have shown that not only can the iterative method infer more
   true positive and less false positive proteins than ProteinProphet, but
   also identify more true positive and less false positive peptides than
   PeptideProphet.
   Conclusions: The proposed iterative method implemented according to the
   feedback framework can unify and improve the results of peptide
   identification and protein inference.}},

   and rutile TiO2. The electronic structure of ZnTiO3 was calculated using
   a variety of exchange-correlation functionals, and we compare the
   predicted band gaps of this material obtained from each functional with
   estimates from our experimental data and optical gaps quoted from the
   literature. We find that the main hybridizations in the electronic
   structure of ZnTiO3 can be predicted from the electronic structures of
   the two binary oxides. We further find that ZnTiO3 has weaker O 2p-Zn 3d
   repulsion than in ZnO, resulting in a relatively lower valence band
   maximum and consequently a larger band gap. Although we find a
   significant core hole shift in the measured O K XAS of ZnTiO3, we
   provide a simple empirical scheme for estimating the band gap that may
   prove to be applicable for any d(10)-d(0) ternary oxide, and could be
   useful in finding a ternary oxide with a band gap tailored to a specific
   energy.}},

   plasma structure with spatially nonuniform distributions of electron

   the two-layer structure are found for the thin slab case and when the
   plasma inhomogeneity is weak. It is shown that the transmission
   coefficient of the p-polarized wave can be about unity, even if the
   plasma inhomogeneity is large. The effects of plasma inhomogeneity on
   transparency of the structure are more important if the slabs are thick,

Abstract = {{Microbial communities were characterized through a depth of 10 m in and
   near an eight-year-old burial site that was implemented as a control
   measure for cases of chronic wasting disease among wild elk.
   Quantitative PCR based on the 16S rRNA-encoding gene showed that the
   burial trench had significantly (2 to 5 orders of magnitude) more
   bacterial 16S rRNA-encoding genes g(-1) soil within and up to 2 m below
   the burial site compared to a nonburial control core sample at the same
   depths. Topsoil and depths below the burial site (>6 m) showed similar
   quantities of 16S rRNA genes for both cores. Furthermore, when microbial
   communities were examined by cpn60 universal target amplification and
   pyrosequencing, 5825 operational taxonomic units (OTU) were found at a
   variety of abundances in all of the 13 core samples that were analyzed.
   Taxonomic analysis indicated that the overall community composition
   changed considerably with increasing depth, and that the burial core
   community was distinct from that of the control core at all depths.
   Organisms associated with phosphate accumulation, nitrogen fixation, and
   ammonium oxidation were found in highest abundance near the surface of
   the burial core (up to 2.5 m), while organisms associated with
   ammonification were found at the burial depth, consistent with an
   increase in ammonium concentration in pore water Sequences from
   organisms associated with dissimilatory metal reduction were
   concentrated just below the burial depth (4.5 to 5.5 m). Anaerobic
   microorganisms dominated the microbial community at the burial site
   (3.75 m). The approaches described in this study provided distinct
   sequences that can be used to develop molecular assays for organism
   tracking and overall fingerprinting of microbes associated with burial
   sites. These data can be helpful in site evaluation and may help in the
   selection of future burial sites.}},

Abstract = {{Nine redox potential-controlled operating conditions during ethanol
   fermentation were evaluated by means of a process simulator. Results
   show that the lowest unit production cost (0.764 \$/kg ethanol) was
   estimated for similar to 250 g glucose/L among all studied conditions.
   Controlling the redox potential at -150 mV increases the ethanol yield
   when glucose concentrations are greater than 250 g/L; while no
   significant effects were observed at glucose feeds below 250 g/L. For a
   facility with an annual production capacity of similar to 85-130 million
   kg ethanol, the shortest payout period of similar to 5.33 years was
   obtained under similar to 250 g glucose/L conditions, either with or
   without redox potential control. If similar to 300 g glucose/L is
   applied, controlling the redox potential at -150 mV is required to limit
   the process payout period to be less than 6 years. Carbon dioxide
   disposal options are presented. Selling CO2 as a byproduct can bring in
   1.43 million \$/year income for an ethanol plant with a capacity of 100
   million kg ethanol/year. Capture and transport of CO2 to deep injection
   sites for geological underground storage is economically unprofitable
   and adds similar to 4.78 million \$/year in processing costs; however,
   this option results in a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, making
   it environmentally preferable. The presented process model is available

Abstract = {{Discovering network motifs could provide a significant insight into
   systems biology. Interestingly, many biological networks have been found
   to have a high degree of symmetry (automorphism), which is inherent in
   biological network topologies. The symmetry due to the large number of
   basic symmetric subgraphs (BSSs) causes a certain redundant calculation
   in discovering network motifs. Therefore, we compress all basic
   symmetric subgraphs before extracting compressed subgraphs and propose
   an efficient decompression algorithm to decompress all compressed
   subgraphs without loss of any information. In contrast to previous
   approaches, the novel Symmetry Compression method for Motif Detection,
   named as SCMD, eliminates most redundant calculations caused by
   widespread symmetry of biological networks. We use SCMD to improve three
   notable exact algorithms and two efficient sampling algorithms. Results
   of all exact algorithms with SCMD are the same as those of the original
   algorithms, since SCMD is a lossless method. The sampling results show
   that the use of SCMD almost does not affect the quality of sampling
   results. For highly symmetric networks, we find that SCMD used in both
   exact and sampling algorithms can help get a remarkable speedup.
   Furthermore, SCMD enables us to find larger motifs in biological
   networks with notable symmetry than previously possible.}},

Abstract = {{As the number of resonances increases, it becomes difficult to improve
   and maintain the performance of dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs),
   over the expanded impedance bandwidth. To remove unwanted modes, adjust
   the frequency distance between individual modes, reduce antenna size and
   cross polarization, and preserve radiation patterns in a wideband
   configuration, a dielectric resonator antenna fed with parallel standing
   strips is proposed in this paper. The use of parallel standing strips
   provides several degrees of freedom in the design procedure to enhance
   the DRA characteristics. To validate the effectiveness of this approach,
   two DRAs with parallel standing strips were fabricated using different
   procedures. The antennas were tested and characterized. The measured
   results are in good agreement with simulation ones. A 46\% size
   reduction was achieved for the multimode DRA. The impedance bandwidth of
   the proposed DRA of simple rectangular shape was over 60\% with a
   measured gain ranging from 5.5 to 9.5 dBi. Broadside radiation patterns
   with fairly low cross polarizations can be maintained over the impedance
   bandwidth. The simulated radiation efficiency is more than 96\% within
   the frequency band.}},

Title = {{General Method for Determination of the Surface Composition in
   Bimetallic Nanoparticle Catalysts from the L Edge X-ray Absorption
   Near-Edge Spectra}},

Abstract = {{Bimetallic PtPd on silica nanoparticle catalysts have been synthesized,
   and their average structure has been determined by Pt L-3 and Pd K edge
   extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The bimetallic
   structure is confirmed from elemental line scans by scanning
   transmission electron microscopy of the individual 2-nm-sized particles.
   A general method is described to determine the surface composition of
   bimetallic nanoparticles even when both metals adsorb; for example, CO,
   by combining the quantitative characterization by X-ray absorption
   near-edge structure spectra at L edges with CO adsorption with the
   adsorption stoichiometry determined by Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy. Determination of the surface composition leads to a better
   understanding of the changes in catalytic chemistry that accompany alloy
   formation. Although monometallic Pt and Pd have similar turnover rates
   for neopentane hydrogenolysis and isomerization, on the basis of the
   surface composition, it appears that in the bimetallic PtPd catalysts,
   the rate and products are determined predominantly by Pt with little
   contribution from surface Pd. Density functional theory calculations
   indicate that the center of the Pt d-band density of states shifts to
   higher energy, or closer to the Fermi level, whereas that in Pd shifts
   to lower energy away from the Fermi level. Similarly, the calculated
   enthalpy of CO adsorption increases on Pt, but decreases on Pd. It is
   speculated that because of the very low surface coverage of the
   neopentane reaction intermediates, only surface atoms that form the
   strongest bonds are catalytically active-that is, Pt-rather than all
   surface atoms. The dominant role of Pd, therefore, appears to be to
   (slightly) modify Pt rather than to contribute to the catalytic
   conversion.}},

Title = {{Hydrogen production from steam reforming of acetic acid over Cu-Zn
   supported calcium aluminate}},
Journal = {{BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{558-565}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Hydrogen can be produced by catalytic steam reforming (CSR) of
   biomass-derived oil. Typically bio oil contains 12-14\% acetic acid;
   therefore, this acid was chosen as model compound for reforming of
   biooil with the help of a Cu-Zn/Ca-Al catalyst for high yield of H-2
   with low CH4 and CO content. Calcium aluminate support was prepared by
   solid-solid reaction at 1350 degrees C. X-ray diffraction indicates
   12CaO center dot 7Al(2)O(3) as major, CaA(14)O(7) and Ca(5)A(16)O(14) as
   minor phases. Cu and Zn were loaded onto the support by wet-impregnation
   at 10 and 1 wt.\%, respectively. The catalysts were characterized by
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and
   Transmission Electron Microscopy TEM and the surface area for both
   support and Cu-Zn were 10.5 and 5.8 m(2)/g, respectively. CSR was
   carried out in a tubular fixed bed reactor (I.D. = 19 mm) at
   temperatures between 600 and 800 degrees C with 3-g loadings and
   (H2O/acetic acid) wt. ratio of 9:1. Significantly high (80\%) yield of
   hydrogen was obtained over Cu-Zn/Ca-Al catalyst, as incorporation of Zn
   enhanced the H-2 yield by reducing deactivation of the catalyst. The
   coke formation on the support (Ca-12/Al-7) surface was negligible due to
   the presence of excess oxygen in the 12CaO center dot 7Al(2)O(3) phase.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the stability and stabilization problem
   for discrete-time switched systems. We consider a probabilistic case
   where the system is switched among different subsystems, and the
   probability of each subsystem being active is defined as its occurrence
   probability. The relationship between the developed model of the
   switched system and the Markovian jump system is analyzed. For a
   switched system with a known subsystem occurrence probabilities, we give
   a stochastic stability criterion in terms of a linear matrix inequality.
   Then, we extend the results to a more practical case where the subsystem
   occurrence probabilities of switching are known to be constant, but
   their specific values are only known with some uncertainty. A new
   iterative approach is employed to choose the switching law between the
   subsystems. For unstable switched systems, mode-dependent state feedback
   and static output feedback controllers are developed to achieve the
   stabilization objective. Finally, several simulation examples are
   presented to show the efficacy of the proposed criteria and methods.

   The transient sensible, latent and total effectiveness are each

   transient effectiveness is assessed for various air and desiccant mass
   flow rates under summer test conditions and the LAMEE's time constant is
   investigated as an important variable that depends primarily on the
   thermal capacity of the exchanger and liquid content. The calculated
   effectiveness shows considerable dependency on the air and desiccant

Abstract = {{Crystallization fouling occurs when dissolved salts precipitate from an
   aqueous solution. In the case of inversely soluble salts, like calcium
   carbonate (CaCO3). this may lead to crystal growth on heated walls.
   Crystallization may also take place in the bulk solution either via
   homogeneous nucleation or heterogeneous nucleation on suspended
   material.
   In this paper, surface crystallization of CaCO3 and crystallization in
   the bulk fluid and its effect on the fouling rate on a heated wall are
   studied. The fouling experiments are done in a laboratory scale set-up
   of a flat plate heat exchanger. Accuracy of the results is analyzed by
   uncertainty analysis. SEM and XRD are used to determine the morphology
   and the composition of the deposited material.
   The uncertainty analysis shows that the bias and precision uncertainties
   in the measured wall temperature are the largest source of uncertainty
   in the experiments. The total uncertainty in the fouling resistance in
   the studied case was found to be +/- 13.5\% at the 95\% confidence
   level, which is considered to be acceptable.
   Surface crystallization rate is found to be controlled by the wall
   temperature indicating that the surface integration dominates the
   fouling process. The flow velocity affects the fouling rate especially
   at high wall temperature by decreasing the fouling rate with increasing
   flow velocity. Crystallization to the bulk fluid is found to enhance
   significantly the fouling rate on the surface when compared to a case in
   which fouling is due to crystal growth on the surface. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The evolution of crystallographic texture as well as microstructure in
   an AA5083 aluminum alloy during the accumulative roll bonding (ARB)
   process was investigated by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). It was found that the dominant deformation textures of
   AA5083 were Copper, Dillamore, Goss, and Brass components. When the
   number of ARB cycle was increased, the intensity of texture components
   increased at the beginning, then it became saturated, and finally
   slightly decreased (for Copper, Dillamore, and Rotated Cube). The
   ARB-processed samples showed very strong fibers compared to the initial
   strip with no signs of alpha-fiber, beta-fiber, or tau-fiber. In a
   general trend, the orientations first move into alpha-fiber and
   beta-fiber, simultaneously, and finally towards Goss, Brass, Copper, and
   Dillamore texture components. By increasing the number of ARB cycles,
   the fraction of low angle grain boundaries was decreased whereas the
   fraction of high angle grain boundaries fraction was increased. The
   formation of nano shear bands at the fourth ARB cycle was facilitated by
   the formation of Brass and Goss components. The formation of nano grains
   ( < 100 nm) microstructural was also confirmed by transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) investigation. At the final ARB cycles, the intensity
   of major texture components (Copper and Dillamore) was reduced slightly;
   this can be explained by the formation of equiaxed nano grains due to
   occurrence of redundant shear strain and continuous recrystallization.

Abstract = {{We report on two extensions of the traditional analysis of
   low-dimensional structures in terms of low-dimensional quantum
   mechanics. On one hand, we discuss the impact of thermodynamics in one
   or two dimensions on the behavior of fermions in low-dimensional
   systems. On the other hand, we use both quantum wells and interfaces
   with different effective electron or hole mass to study the question
   when charge carriers in interfaces or layers exhibit two-dimensional or
   three-dimensional behavior. We find in particular that systems with
   different effective masses in the bulk and in the interface exhibit
   separation of two-dimensional and three-dimensional behavior on
   different length scales, whereas quantum wells exhibit linear
   combination of two-dimensional and three-dimensional behavior on short
   length scales while the behavior on large length scales cannot be
   associated with either two-dimensional or three-dimensional behavior.}},

Abstract = {{To meet the ever increasing demand for energy and fuels, it is essential
   to produce renewable fuels such as bioethanol at low cost and in reduced
   time. In the present work, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was immobilized on a
   novel Pinewood chips (PC) support and the immobilized yeast was used in
   fermentation with an aim to increase bioethanol yield and productivity
   in single and mixed sugar fermentation. Different concentrations of
   glucose or xylose were used to see the effect on ethanol production from
   S. cerevisiae and P stipitis, separately. With PC immobilized S.
   cerevisiae, ethanol yield of 0.44 g/g and productivity of 1.11 g/l.h
   were obtained for 200 g/l initial glucose concentration. This
   immobilized S. cerevisiae, was then used in co-culture along with free
   culture of Pichia stipitis for ethanol production from glucose-xylose
   sugar mixtures (1.5:1 ratio of glucose to xylose; average concentration
   50.75 g/l) and compared with co-culture of free S. cerevisiae and free P
   stipitis. Improvement in ethanol yield (0.47 g/g from 0.45 g/g in case
   of co-culture of free cells) and productivity (0.73 g/h.h from 0.45 g/l.
   h in case of co-culture of free cells) were obtained with co-culture of
   immobilized S. cerevisiae and free P stipitis. Further, PC were treated
   with a sequential treatment of H2SO4 followed by sodium sulphite and
   sodium chlorite and used to immobilize S. cerevisiae. Yeast immobilized
   on treated pine wood chips support (TP) was then used in co-culture with
   free P stipitis and further improvement in ethanol yield (0.50 g/g) and
   productivity (0.80 g/l.h) were obtained for 50.8 g/l initial
   glucose-xylose mixture concentration. This work showed that this novel
   co-culture scheme of S. cerevisiae immobilized on pine wood chips and
   free P stipitis can be used for efficient fermentation of mixed sugars
   to bioethanol.}},

Abstract = {{A smooth steel roller was tested in an indoor soil bin. Subsoil forces
   and displacements were measured at depths of 50, 100, 150, and 200 mm.
   Roller operating conditions included roller travel speed, the vertical
   load, and number of passes. Three travel speeds, 1, 3, and 5 km h(-1)
   and three vertical loads 20, 40, and 60 kN were tested. The draft needed
   to move the roller was also recorded. For multiple passes, subsoil
   forces were increased by 30\% if vertical load increased by 50\%; while
   the roller draft increased by 20\%. For a single pass, no significant
   differences detected between the subsoil forces at speeds of 1 and 3 km
   h(-1); when the roller traveled at 5 km h(-1) with a vertical load of 60
   kN, the subsoil force was approximately reduced by 30\% compared to
   those at lower travel speeds. For both single and multiple passes,
   increasing travel speed did not significantly increase subsoil forces
   and displacement below 150-mm depth; however, the power required to
   drive the roller was significantly increased. Higher travel speed was
   more effective in creating larger subsoil displacement and subsoil
   forces within 100-mm from the soil surface. For similar effects below
   100-mm, lower travel speed was found appropriate. (C) 2012 ISTVS.

Abstract = {{Fluorophosphate and fluoroalutninate glasses doped with trivalent
   samarium were evaluated as sensors of x-ray radiation for microbeam
   radiation therapy at the Canadian Light Source using the conversion of
   trivalent Sm3+ to the divalent form Sm2+. Both types of glasses show
   similar conversion rates and may be used as a linear sensor up to
   similar to 150 Gy and as a nonlinear sensor up to similar to 2400 Gy,
   where saturation is reached. Experiments with a multi-slit collimator
   show high spatial resolution of the conversion pattern; the pattern was
   acquired by a confocal fluorescence microscopy technique. The effects of
   previous x-ray exposure may be erased by annealing at temperatures
   exceeding the glass transition temperature T-g while annealing at T-A <
   T-g enhances the Sm conversion. This enhancement is explained by a
   thermally stimulated relaxation of host glass ionic matrix surrounding
   x-ray induced Sm2+ ions. In addition, some of the Sm3+-doped glasses
   were codoped with Eu2+-ions but the results show that there is no marked
   improvement in the conversion efficiency by the introduction of Eu2+.

Abstract = {{We propose an eventually all-polymer flow detector platform based on
   PMMA membranes with single cylindrical pores covering two orders of
   magnitude (approximately 1.5 rim to 450 nm diameter) for the eventual
   identification of various biomolecules. Demonstrated rapid prototyping
   micropatterning sequences include electron beam lithography (EBL) and
   molecular self assembly (the latter to date depends on a PMMA/lipid
   bi-layer material sandwich), depending on desired pore sizes, and will
   get extended to X-ray lithography for parallel fabrication of proven
   layouts. In the case of 450 nm wide EBL patterned pores, long-term
   stability was proven over a period of 3 months and more, with an open
   pore current noise level determined in a patch-clamp setup to be better
   than 1\%. Open pore current-voltage characteristics are linear and do
   scale with KCl electrolyte concentrations (0.1-0.75 M). The cylindrical
   pores do not exhibit rectification properties, as opposed to
   non-cylindrical pores (artificial or naturally occuring), and therefore
   allow for operation with either polarity. First test objects
   (synthesized silica nanospheres of 100 nm diameter) were detected as
   temporary current blockages of approximately 3.5\%. Furthermore,
   self-assembled naturally occurring alpha-hemolysin pores of 1.5 nm
   diameter in a lipid bi-layer were introduced into the PMMA system to
   verify the detection of much smaller biomolecules, e.g. single stranded
   linear plasmid DNA. Current blockages of up to 10\% were reproducibly
   detected. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Contour tracking is one of the most common control problems encountered
   by many industrial manipulators and robots to achieve high precision
   contour performance. In this paper, a new contour tracking control
   method developed in position domain is proposed aiming at improving the
   contour tracking performance. To develop the new control algorithm, a
   multi-axis motion system is treated as a master-slave cooperative motion
   system; the master motion is sampled equidistantly and used as a
   reference, while the slave motions are expressed as functions of the
   master motion according to desired contour requirements. A dynamic model
   of the multi-axis motion system represented in position domain is
   developed based on the master motion through one to one mapping from
   time domain to position domain. A PD type position domain control is
   proposed, and the stability analysis is conducted based on the Lyapunov
   function method. The developed position domain control is applied to
   contour tracking of linear motion and circular motion, and some
   comparison studies are performed between time domain control and
   position domain control. Simulation results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the position PD control compared with traditional PD
   control and the crossed-coupled control. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{There is a tremendous demand for hydrogen production worldwide but the
   current H-2 production routes from natural gas and other carbon fuels
   lead to large greenhouse gas emissions. Intentionally coupled with
   nuclear power, the sulfur-iodine (S-I) thermochemical water splitting
   cycle is one of the most widely studied cycles for the large-scale
   hydrogen production that has environmental benignity. Based on the
   inspiration of the S-I cycle, a novel chemical cycle called hydrogen
   sulfide splitting cycle has been proposed for hydrogen production. In
   addition to the SO2 production from the reaction of H2S and sulfuric
   acid, SO2 can be produced from the burning (direct oxidation) of
   hydrogen sulfide or elemental sulfur. And it can also be provided by SO2
   capture from flue gas or other SO2-containing waste gases. This paper
   performs exergy analysis on the various SO2 provisions to the Bunsen
   reaction that make different routes for hydrogen production from waste
   sulfur-containing compounds as feedstock. It has been found that the
   route including SO2 from direct H2S oxidation potentially makes the best
   energy-efficient process of H-2 production. The heat that is generated
   from H2S oxidation can be recovered and used to support the energy
   requirements for other steps of the cycle, making the entire hydrogen
   production cycle more energy-efficient Copyright (c) 2012, Hydrogen

Abstract = {{Although a fundamental prerequisite for the successful implementation of
   any waste management plan is the availability of sufficient and accurate
   data, there are few available studies regarding the characterization and
   management of gas distribution company waste (GDCW). This study aimed to
   characterize the industrial waste generated by the East Azerbaijan Gas
   Distribution Company (EAGDC) and to present environmental management
   strategies. The EAGDC serves 57 cities and 821 villages with a total
   population of more than 2.5 million as well as numerous industrial
   units. The methodology of this study was based on a checklist of data
   collected from each zone of the company, site visits (observation), and
   quantity and quality analysis according to the formal data available
   from different zones. The results indicate that more than 35 different
   kinds of industrial solid waste are generated in different industrial
   installations. The most important types of generated waste include empty
   barrels (including mercaptans, diesel fuel, deionized waters and oil),
   faulty gas meters and regulators, a variety of industrial oils, sleeves,
   filter elements and faulty pipes, valves and fittings. The results
   indicated that, currently, GDCW is generally handled and disposed of
   with domestic waste, deposited in companies' installation yards and
   stores or, sometimes, recycled through non-scientific approaches that
   can create health risks to the public and the environment, even though
   most of the GDCW was determined to be recyclable or reusable materials.
   This study concludes that gas distribution companies must pay more
   attention to source reduction, recycling and reusing of waste to
   preserve natural resources, landfill space and the environment.}},

Abstract = {{The trajectory tracking problem of a closed-chain five-bar robot is
   studied in this paper. Based on an error transformation function and the
   backstepping technique, an approximation-based tracking algorithm is
   proposed, which can guarantee the control performance of the robotic
   system in both the stable and transient phases. In particular, the
   overshoot, settling time, and final tracking error of the robotic system
   can be all adjusted by properly setting the parameters in the error
   transformation function. The radial basis function neural network
   (RBFNN) is used to compensate the complicated nonlinear terms in the
   closed-loop dynamics of the robotic system. The approximation error of
   the RBFNN is only required to be bounded, which simplifies the initial
   ``trail-and-error{''} configuration of the neural network. Illustrative
   examples are given to verify the theoretical analysis and illustrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Finally, it is also shown that
   the proposed approximation-based controller can be simplified by a smart
   mechanical design of the closed-chain robot, which demonstrates the
   promise of the integrated design and control philosophy.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to investigate the electrical properties of
   photoresist-alumina microcomposites with different portions of ceramic
   content. Substrates of photoresist-alumina microcomposites are
   fabricated and a comprehensive analysis is performed to characterize
   their dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent at microwave
   frequencies up to 40 GHz. To evaluate the performance of these materials
   for microwave applications, the properties of various lithographically
   fabricated antenna elements are examined and analysed based on the
   measured electrical properties. The experimental results show that the
   electrical properties of the photoresist composite are nonlinearly
   affected by ceramic content and also a minimum percentage of ceramic
   portion is required to improve the electrical properties of the
   photoresist composite. For instance, comparison of 0 wt\% with 23 wt\%
   SU8-alumina shows that no reduction is achieved for the dielectric loss
   tangent. Comparison of 38 wt\% with 48 wt\% SU8-alumina microcomposite
   shows that the dielectric loss tangent is improved from 0.03 to 0.01 and
   the dielectric constant is increased from 3.8 to 5.0 at 25 GHz. These
   improvements can result in superior performance for the
   photoresist-based microwave components.}},

Abstract = {{Application of soft computing methods (i.e. neural networks and genetic
   algorithms) for modeling and controlling the dynamic and transient
   behavior of systems has been increasing during the last decade. In this
   study, a neural network (NN) model is developed to predict the transient
   heat and moisture transfer performances (i.e., the sensible and latent
   effectivenesses) of a novel HVAC energy exchanger, called the Run-Around
   Membrane Energy Exchanger (RAMEE), which is able to transfer both heat
   and moisture between exhaust and supply air streams. The training data
   set for the NN model covers a wide range of outdoor conditions and
   system parameters and is produced using a Transient Numerical Model
   (TNM) that has been experimentally validated for some transient
   applications. Two separate NNs (one for sensible and one for latent
   energy transfer) each with 12 inputs and one output, are selected to
   represent the RAMEE. The ability of NN models to predict the performance
   of a given RAMEE design in different climates is numerically validated.
   The mean absolute difference (MAD) between the results of TNM and NN
   models for different locations are 0.5 degrees C for the sensible model
   and 0.2 g(v)/kg(a) for the latent model, which indicates satisfactory
   agreement for energy exchange calculations. These NN models are very
   fast and easy to use therefore, they might be used for design purposes
   or estimating the annual energy savings in different buildings with
   continuous operation and a RAMEE in their HVAC system. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The local flow field and near-wake region of a surface-mounted finite
   circular cylinder were studied experimentally in a low-speed wind tunnel
   using particle image velocimetry (PIV). The cylinder was mounted normal
   to a ground plane and was partially immersed in a flat-plate turbulent
   boundary layer. Four finite circular cylinders of aspect ratios AR=9, 7,
   5 and 3 were tested at a Reynolds number of Re-D=4.2 x 10(4). At the
   location of the cylinder, the boundary layer thickness relative to the
   cylinder diameter was delta/D=1.6. PIV velocity field measurements were
   made in a vertical plane parallel to the mean flow direction on the flow
   centerline (the symmetry plane), within five diameters upstream and
   downstream of the cylinder, and also above the free end. Above the free
   end of the cylinder, flow separation from the leading edge leads to the
   formation of a mean recirculation zone on the free-end surface. The
   point of reattachment of the flow onto the free-end surface moves
   towards the trailing edge as the cylinder aspect ratio is decreased.
   Large regions of elevated turbulence intensity and Reynolds shear stress
   are found above the free end. In the near-wake region, the large
   recirculation zone contains a vortex immediately behind and below the
   free end; this vortex was found for all four aspect ratios. A second
   vortex is found behind the cylinder near the cylinder-wall junction;
   this vortex was not observed for the cylinder of AR=3, indicating a
   distinct wake structure for this cylinder. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Breast cancer diagnosis can be done through the pathologic assessments

   result of analysis on this sample by pathologist is crucial for breast
   cancer patient. In this paper, nucleus of tissue samples are
   investigated after decomposition by means of the Log-Gabor wavelet on
   HSV color domain and an algorithm is developed to compute the color
   wavelet features. These features are used for breast cancer diagnosis
   using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier algorithm. The ability of
   properly trained SVM is to correctly classify patterns and make them
   particularly suitable for use in an expert system that aids in the
   diagnosis of cancer tissue samples. The results are compared with other
   multivariate classifiers such as Na < ves Bayes classifier and
   Artificial Neural Network. The overall accuracy of the proposed method
   using SVM classifier will be further useful for automation in cancer

Abstract = {{Observations of magnetism in semiconductors doped with nonmagnetic atoms
   (C, N, etc.) show promise for spintronics applications, but pose an
   interesting challenge for conventional theories of magnetism. In this
   work, the magnetic semiconductor carbon-doped In2O3 is studied using
   theoretical and experimental techniques. Density-functional theory
   calculations predict that ferromagnetism can exist near room
   temperatures when substitutional carbon atoms have a formally unpaired
   2p electron that does not participate in bonding. The unpaired 2p
   electrons lead to an impurity band near the Fermi level and consequent
   enhanced density of states which accommodates a strong p-p coupling
   between local magnetic moments. The unpaired electrons and ferromagnetic
   coupling are found to arise from a combination of interstitial and
   substitutional carbon atoms in close proximity. Finally, experimental
   measurements on samples with varying magnetic properties verify the
   importance of both strong C 2p character at the Fermi level and strong C
   2sp-In 4d hybridization for yielding room-temperature ferromagnetism.
   These results shed light on the interesting field of nonmagnetic dopants
   inducing ferromagnetism in semiconductors.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic structure and chemical bonding of three differently
   prepared samples of graphene oxide paper-like sheets are studied. Two
   are created by water filtration of fully oxidized graphene sheets,
   although one is later intercalated with dodecylamine. The third is
   created by reducing graphene oxide with hydrazine hydrate. The
   spectroscopic fingerprints of the aligned epoxide functional groups that
   unzip the carbon basal plane are found. This unzipping appears to be a
   result of aging, and the extent to which the basal plane is unzipped can
   be controlled via the preparation method. In particular, reduction with
   hydrazine enhances line defect formation, whereas intercalation inhibits
   the process.The hydroxyl functional group also has a tendency to gather
   in zones of dense oxidation on the carbon basal plane, a predilection
   that is not shared by the other prominent functional group species.
   Finally, the non-functionalized carbon sites exhibit very similar
   bonding despite the increase in the sp2/sp3 ratio, confirming that
   reduction alone is insufficient for producing pristine graphene from
   graphene oxide. These results are obtained by directly probing the
   electronic structure of the graphene oxide samples via X-ray absorption
   near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) and resonant X-ray emission
   spectroscopy (RXES). This work has important significance for the
   development of graphene oxide as a band gap-engineered electronic
   material, as preparation methodology strongly affects not only the
   initial condition of the sample, but how the electronic structure
   evolves over time.}},

   a warming climate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{Using numerical models, we evaluate hydrogeological regime changes in
   high-latitude river basins under conditions of ground surface warming.
   These models describe transient heat- and fluid flow coupled to the
   hydrogeological impacts of phase-changes from ice to liquid water. We
   consider an idealized unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer system in which
   groundwater flow is driven by topography, representing a series of small
   drainage basins in riverine terrain of relatively subdued topography.
   Various temporal and spatial surface temperature conditions are
   considered to control the initial permafrost distributions for the
   simulations. The simulated rates of increase in groundwater contribution
   to streamflow during and after permafrost thaw, are in the order of
   magnitude comparable to hydrogeological regime changes over the past
   decades as reported for several (sub-)Arctic rivers. The simulations
   further show that two distinct features of the subsurface response
   control the temporal evolution of base flow increase: (1) shifts in
   aquifer permeability architecture during permafrost degradation and (2)
   uptake of water into aquifer storage when sub-permafrost hydraulic heads
   rise. Model analysis shows that the latter process delays base flow
   increase by several decades to centuries. In order to evaluate the
   relative importance of both processes in natural systems, the current
   hydraulic regime of sub-permafrost aquifer systems as well as patterns
   of permafrost heterogeneity, taliks and their hydraulic connectivity are
   insufficiently known.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{SEP 19}},
Abstract = {{Coordinated observations of ionospheric variability near the geomagnetic
   pole using the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radar (RISR-N), Super
   Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) High Frequency (HF) radars, and
   all-sky imagers have clarified the relative contribution of structuring
   mechanisms operating on polar plasma patches. From the multipoint RISR-N
   observations, a three dimensional image can be constructed of the plasma
   parameters. The colocated coherent echoes from the SuperDARN radars
   provide information on field aligned irregularities, and from all-sky
   imagers located in Resolute Bay, Canada and Qaanaaq, Greenland,
   information is obtained on the emission brightness at different
   wavelengths. A good correlation is found between the location of the
   coherent, incoherent and optical signals of patches. From the SuperDARN
   radar data it is evident that plasma irregularities seem to be present
   throughout the region of enhanced electron density. The patches are
   observed to be formed in the cusp region due to bursty flux transfer
   events and are then transported across the polar cap. During the time
   period of about 10 minutes when a patch drifted through the RISR-N field
   of view, the patch seemed to undergo significant deformation in all
   three spatial dimensions, with density fluctuations of about 10\% and
   spatial variations leading to stretching and tilting of the patch. The
   findings show that plasma structuring can likely occur within polar cap
   patches, which support previous suggestions that a patch is highly
   variable as it drifts across the polar cap, with a faster spread of
   irregularities throughout the patch as a result.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure-induced amorphization of methane hydrate has been investigated
   by molecular dynamics simulation. In accord with experimental results of
   Tulk et al., a crystalline -> amorphous transition was confirmed at 3.3
   GPa where the water lattice collapsed around the encaged methane.
   Thermal annealing at 5.5 GPa allows the water to adopt a lower energy
   conformation with a denser structure. In both structures, methane
   molecules are immobilized and maintain long-range correlation as in the
   crystal. Consequently, both phases are predicted to revert back to the
   crystalline form upon decompression. Pressure-induced amorphization is a
   nonequilibrium process due to a mechanical instability; the
   interconversion between kinetically stable amorphous phases is a
   relaxation effect.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of mass transport parameters is necessary for
   overall design and evaluation processes of the waste disposal
   facilities. The mass transport parameters, such as effective diffusion
   coefficient, retardation factor and diffusion accessible porosity, are
   estimated from observed diffusion data by inverse analysis. Recently,
   particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has been used to develop
   inverse model for estimating these parameters that alleviated existing
   limitations in the inverse analysis. However, PSO solver yields
   different solutions in successive runs because of the stochastic nature
   of the algorithm and also because of the presence of multiple optimum
   solutions. Thus the estimated mean solution from independent runs is
   significantly different from the best solution. In this paper, two
   variants of the PSO algorithms are proposed to improve the performance
   of the inverse analysis. The proposed algorithms use perturbation
   equation for the gbest particle to gain information around gbest region
   on the search space and catfish particles in alternative iterations to
   improve exploration capabilities. Performance comparison of developed
   solvers on synthetic test data for two different diffusion problems
   reveals that one of the proposed solvers, CPPSO, significantly improves
   overall performance with improved best, worst and mean fitness values.
   The developed solver is further used to estimate transport parameters
   from 12 sets of experimentally observed diffusion data obtained from
   three diffusion problems and compared with published values from the
   literature. The proposed solver is quick, simple and robust on different
   diffusion problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Endotoxin as a determinant of asthma and wheeze among rural dwelling
   children and adolescents: A case-control study}},
Journal = {{BMC PULMONARY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: The association between endotoxin exposure and asthma is
   complex and has been associated with rural living. We examined the
   relationship between domestic endotoxin and asthma or wheeze among rural
   school-aged children (6-18 years) and assessed the interaction between
   endotoxin and other characteristics with these outcomes.
   Methods: Between 2005 and 2007 we conducted a case-control study of
   children 6-18 years in the rural region of Humboldt, Canada. Cases (n =
   102) reported doctor-diagnosed asthma or wheeze in the past year.
   Controls (n = 208) were randomly selected from children without asthma
   or wheeze. Data were collected to ascertain symptoms, asthma history and
   indoor environmental exposures (questionnaire), endotoxin (dust
   collection from the play area floor and child's mattress), and tobacco
   smoke exposure (saliva collection). Statistical testing was completed
   using multiple logistic regression to account for potential confounders
   and to assess interaction between risk factors. A stratified analysis
   was also completed to examine the effect of personal history of allergy.
   Results: Among children aged 6-12 years, mattress endotoxin
   concentration (EU/mg) and load (EU/m(2)) were inversely associated with
   being a case {[}odds ratio (OR) = 0.44, 95\% confidence interval (CI) =
   0.20-0.98; and OR = 0.38, 95\% CI = 0.20-0.75, respectively]. These
   associations were not observed in older children or with play area
   endotoxin.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that endotoxin exposure might be
   protective for asthma or wheeze. The protective effect is found in
   younger school-aged, non-allergic children. These results may help
   explain the inconsistencies in previous studies and suggest that the
   protective effects of endotoxin in the prevention of atopy and asthma or
   wheeze are most effective earlier in life.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Recombinant microorganisms are a promising alternative for production of
   bioethanol from sugars produced from lignocellulosic materials. In the
   present work, recombinant Escherichia coli FBR16 has been utilized to
   produce bioethanol from simulated glucose-xylose mixtures and wheat
   straw hydrolysates. Hydrolysates were produced by sequential treatment
   of dilute acid pretreatment at 180 degrees C for 7 min using 0.5\% (v/v)
   H2SO4 and enzymatic saccharification using cellulase from Trichoderma
   reesei and beta-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger. With increased
   concentration of glucose-xylose sugar mixtures, ethanol yield and
   volumetric ethanol productivity decreased. At 22 g/l, ethanol yield of
   0.34 g/g and volumetric ethanol productivity of 0.36 g/l.h were obtained
   which reduced to only 0.19 g/g and 0.17 g/l.h, respectively, at 160 g/l
   glucose-xylose sugar mixture. Fermentation kinetic parameters were also
   estimated and it was found that values of parameters were highly
   dependent on initial sugar concentration. Furthermore, it was observed
   that E. coli FBR16 is capable of producing bioethanol from almost all
   lignocellulosic monomeric sugars, especially glucose and xylose. At 16.4
   g/l lignocellulosic hydrolysate concentration, ethanol yield of 0.32 g/g
   and productivity of 0.24 g/l.h were obtained. In order to see the effect
   of lignocellulosic sugar concentration on ethanol production,
   hydrolysates were concentrated to 50 g/l from the original concentration
   of 16.4 g/l. E. coli FBR16 was able to ferment the increased sugar
   concentration as well; however decreased ethanol yield of 0.29 g/g and
   volumetric ethanol productivity of 0.17 g/l.h were obtained. (C) 2012

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2568-2575}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Cultivating cells and tissues in bioreactors is a critical step in
   forming artificial tissues or organs prior to transplantation. Among
   various bioreactors, the perfusion bioreactor is known for its enhanced
   convection through the cell-scaffold constructs. Knowledge of mass
   transfer is essential for controlling the cell culture process; however,
   obtaining this information remains a challenging task. In this research,
   a novel mathematical model is developed to represent the nutrient
   transport and cell growth in a 3-D scaffold cultivated in a perfusion
   bioreactor. Numerical methods are employed to solve the equations
   involved, with a focus on identifying the effect of factors such as
   porosity, culturing time, and flow rate, which are controllable in the
   scaffold fabrication and culturing process, on cell cultures. To
   validate the new model, the results from the model simulations were
   compared to the experimental results extracted from the literature. With
   the validated model, further simulations were carried out to investigate
   the glucose and oxygen distribution and the cell growth within the
   cell-scaffold construct in a perfusion bioreactor, thus providing
   insight into the cell culture process.}},

Abstract = {{The real and imaginary optical conductivities in disordered
   semiconductors (and metals) do not follow classical Drude's law in the
   near infrared region. We discuss an origin of the anomalous free carrier
   absorption in metallic (and near metallic) states of chalcogenide
   materials (phase-change GST), dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 and
   nanocrystalline silicon films. A series sequence of ``localized{''} and
   ``extended{''} state type behavior of carriers produces a Lorentz-type
   resonance which is caused by ``bound{''} (localized) electrons. The
   analytical expressions were fit to the experimental data and produced
   various important physical parameters such as the numbers of free and
   localized carriers, the scattering time of free carriers, tunneling time
   of localized carriers, and the Drude dc conductivity in the system. We
   also discuss whether the present model has generated reasonable physical

Abstract = {{The pressure dependence of the crystal and molecular structure of the
   bis-1,2,3-thiaselenazolyl radical dimer {[}1b](2) has been investigated
   over the range 0-11 GPa by powder diffraction methods using synchrotron
   radiation and diamond anvil cell techniques. At ambient pressure, the
   dimer consists of a pair of radicals linked by a hypervalent 4-center
   6-electron S-Se-Se-S sigma-bond in an essentially coplanar arrangement.
   The dimers are packed in cross-braced slipped pi-stack arrays running
   along the x-direction of the monoclinic (space group P2(1)/c) unit cell.
   Pressurization to 11 GPa causes the unit cell dimensions a and c to
   undergo a slow but uniform compression, while the b-axis is slightly
   elongated. There is virtually no change in the molecular structure or in
   the slipped g-stack crystal architecture. This behavior is in marked
   contrast to that of the isostructural radical dimer {[}1a]2, where the
   basal fluorine is replaced by hydrogen. Pressurization of this latter
   material induces a phase change near 4-5 GPa, characterized by a sharp
   contraction in a and c, and a correspondingly large increase in b. At
   the molecular level, the transition is associated with a buckling of the
   a-bonded dimer to a more conventional pi-bonded arrangement. Geometry
   optimized DFT band structure calculations on {[}1b](2) replicate the
   observed structural changes and indicate that compression widens both
   the valence and conduction bands but does not induce band gap closure
   until >13 GPa. This result is consistent with the measured thermal
   activation energy for conduction E-act, which indicates that a metallic
   state requires pressures > 10 GPa.}},

Abstract = {{The hysteretic behavior of a plant with a non-negative input, referred
   to as one-sided hysteresis, is characterized by an initial ascending
   curve and hysteresis loops. It is observed that the widely-used
   classical Preisach hysteresis model and its modifications cannot
   represent such one-sided hysteresis due to the limitation of the
   Preisach hysteresis operator. To address this issue, a novel hysteresis
   operator modified from the Preisach hysteresis operator is proposed in
   this study and on this basis, a rate-independent hysteresis model and a
   rate-dependent hysteresis model are developed with methods to estimate
   their parameters. An algorithm to invert the rate-independent hysteresis
   model and its application to tracking control are also presented. The
   models and control schemes developed were verified experimentally on a
   commercially-available piezoelectric actuator. The results obtained show
   that the models developed are promising to represent the one-sided
   hysteresis of the piezoelectric actuator and that the inverting
   algorithm of the rate-independent hysteresis model is effective as
   applied to the tracking control of piezoelectric actuators. (c) 2012

   various published FIAs are classified and compared in terms of their

   practice, delay-dependent stability of genetic regulatory networks has
   been studied insufficiently. Based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI)
   approach, in this study we will present some delay-dependent stability
   conditions for genetic regulatory networks. Then we extend these results
   to genetic regulatory networks with parameter uncertainties. To
   illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results, gene

Abstract = {{Edge-localized modes (ELMs) are the focus of tokamak edge physics
   studies because the large heat loads associated with ELMs have great
   impact on the divertor design of future reactor-grade tokamaks such as
   ITER. In the experimental advanced superconducting tokamak (EAST), the
   first ELMy high confinement modes (H-modes) were obtained with 1 MW
   lower hybrid wave power in conjunction with wall conditioning by lithium
   (Li) evaporation and real-time Li powder injection. The ELMs in EAST at
   this heating power are mostly type-III ELMs. They were observed close to
   the H-mode threshold power and produced small energy dumps (1-2\% of the
   stored energy). Type-III ELMs produced a time-averaged peak heat flux of
   about 2 MW m(-2) on the target plate, a value which is similar to 10
   times larger than that of ELM-free phases. A few isolated and large
   type-I-like ELM events were also observed in EAST with an energy loss of
   up to 5\% of the stored energy. Statistically, the ELM frequencies are
   several hundred hertz and the frequency appears to decrease with q(95),
   the safety factor at 95\% of the flux surface. When an ion cyclotron
   resonance frequency wave was injected during the H-mode phases, the ELM
   repetition frequency increased immediately. The frequency and amplitude
   of type-III ELMs can be effectively influenced by puffing impurity argon
   gas.}},

   carburization damage is dose-dependent and improved significantly with
   an increasing Al implantation dose from 5 x 10(16) ions/cm(2) to 2 x

Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Very high gravity (VHG) fermentation using medium in excess
   of 250 g/L sugars for more than 15\% (v) ethanol can save energy
   consumption, not only for ethanol distillation, but also for distillage
   treatment; however, stuck fermentation with prolonged fermentation time
   and more sugars unfermented is the biggest challenge. Controlling redox
   potential (ORP) during VHG fermentation benefits biomass accumulation
   and improvement of yeast cell viability that is affected by osmotic
   pressure and ethanol inhibition, enhancing ethanol productivity and
   yield, the most important techno-economic aspect of fuel ethanol
   production.
   Results: Batch fermentation was performed under different ORP conditions
   using the flocculating yeast and media containing glucose of 201 +/-
   3.1, 252 +/- 2.9 and 298 +/- 3.8 g/L. Compared with ethanol fermentation
   by non-flocculating yeast, different ORP profiles were observed with the
   flocculating yeast due to the morphological change associated with the
   flocculation of yeast cells. When ORP was controlled at -100 mV, ethanol
   fermentation with the high gravity (HG) media containing glucose of 201
   +/- 3.1 and 252 +/- 2.9 g/L was completed at 32 and 56 h, respectively,
   producing 93.0 +/- 1.3 and 120.0 +/- 1.8 g/L ethanol, correspondingly.
   In contrast, there were 24.0 +/- 0.4 and 17.0 +/- 0.3 g/L glucose
   remained unfermented without ORP control. As high as 131.0 +/- 1.8 g/L
   ethanol was produced at 72 h when ORP was controlled at -150 mV for the
   VHG fermentation with medium containing 298 +/- 3.8 g/L glucose, since
   yeast cell viability was improved more significantly.
   Conclusions: No lag phase was observed during ethanol fermentation with
   the flocculating yeast, and the implementation of ORP control improved
   ethanol productivity and yield. When ORP was controlled at -150 mV, more
   reducing power was available for yeast cells to survive, which in turn
   improved their viability and VHG ethanol fermentation performance. On
   the other hand, controlling ORP at -100 mV stimulated yeast growth and
   enhanced ethanol production under the HG conditions. Moreover, the ORP
   profile detected during ethanol fermentation with the flocculating yeast
   was less fluctuated, indicating that yeast flocculation could attenuate
   the ORP fluctuation observed during ethanol fermentation with
   non-flocculating yeast.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature observations in the polar mesosphere and lower thermosphere
   are critical for studies of polar mesospheric cloud (PMC) formation and
   variability. The Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment (SOFIE) on NASA's
   Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite has been measuring
   temperatures in the polar atmosphere nearly continuously since 2007. We
   herein present an improved SOFIE temperature data set and validate it
   against a variety of satellite and ground-based observations. We find
   that when taking all comparisons together, SOFIE temperatures are in
   agreement with independent observations to within reported systematic
   uncertainties from 15 to 88 km altitude. Between 88 and 95 km SOFIE
   temperatures have a warm bias that peaks between 10 and 15 K in the
   Arctic summer and 20-30 K in the Antarctic summer. Much of the warm bias
   is likely related to uncertainties in prescribed atomic oxygen densities
   that are required for the SOFIE temperature retrieval.}},

   of sulflded NiMo/SBA-15 catalysts for hydrotreating of light gas oil}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{125}},
Pages = {{67-84}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{SBA-15 supported NiMo hydrotreating catalysts with different EDTA/Ni
   molar ratio were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method.
   Hydrotreating activities of these catalysts were studied with Athabasca
   bitumen derived light gas oil and comparison was done with NiMo/SBA-15
   and NiMo/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts. A beneficial effect of chelating ligand
   was seen in hydrotreating activity and 28\% increase in HDS of LGO was
   found as compared to NiMo/gamma-Al2O3 in the case of EDTA/Ni molar ratio
   4. Detailed mechanistic aspect of interaction between support - EDTA
   (ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid), EDTA-metallic species, support -
   metal, metallic species - metallic species at different reaction
   conditions is studied at different process parameters by using different
   characterization techniques such as X-ray absorption near-edge structure
   (XANES), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), HRTEM, XRD,
   Raman, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), ICP-MS, CO chemisorption
   and N-2 adsorption. A detailed scheme has been developed to explain the
   behavior of chelating agent in mesoporous SBA-15 supported catalysts.
   HRTEM results explain the high dispersion of Ni and MoS2 active phases
   in sulfided state even though big crystallite of MoO3 was seen in oxide
   state characterized by XRD and Raman spectra which explains role of EDTA
   in redistribution of active phases during sulfidation. XANES technique
   is used as predominant method for atomic level study of various
   structural changes in sulfided and oxide catalysts to find out the
   appropriate mechanism of the reaction. Characterization by XANES reveals
   that the presence of chelating agent delayed Ni2+ sulfidation which is
   main cause of improvement in HDS and HDN activity of the catalysts
   prepared in presence of organic chelates. Nickel sulfidation starts only
   when the EDTA-Ni complex decomposes and released nickel atoms move to
   the reactive edges of the MoS2 to form a finely dispersed sulfide
   Ni-Mo-S type II active phase. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Monte Carlo modelling of diode detectors for small field MV photon
   dosimetry: detector model simplification and the sensitivity of
   correction factors to source parameterization}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{57}},

Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{The goal of this work was to examine the use of simplified diode
   detector models within a recently proposed Monte Carlo (MC) based small
   field dosimetry formalism and to investigate the influence of electron
   source parameterization has on MC calculated correction factors. BEAMnrc
   was used to model Varian 6 MV jaw-collimated square field sizes down to
   0.5 cm. The IBA stereotactic field diode (SFD), PTW T60016 (shielded)
   and PTW T60017 (un-shielded) diodes were modelled in DOSRZnrc and
   isocentric output ratios (ORdetMCfclin) calculated at depths of d = 1.5,
   5.0 and 10.0 cm. Simplified detector models were then tested by
   evaluating the percent difference in ORdetMCfclin between the simplified
   and complete detector models. The influence of active volume dimension
   on simulated output ratio and response factor was also investigated. The
   sensitivity of each MC calculated replacement correction factor
   (k(Qclin,Qmsr)(fclin,fmsr)), as a function of electron FWHM between
   0.100 and 0.150 cm and energy between 5.5 and 6.5 MeV, was investigated
   for the same set of small field sizes using the simplified detector
   models. The SFD diode can be approximated simply as a silicon chip in
   water, the T60016 shielded diode can be modelled as a chip in water plus
   the entire shielding geometry and the T60017 unshielded diode as a chip
   in water plus the filter plate located upstream. The detector-specific
   k(Qclin,Qmsr)(fclin,fmsr) required to correct measured output ratios
   using the SFD, T60016 and T60017 diode detectors are insensitive to
   incident electron energy between 5.5 and 6.5 MeV and spot size variation
   between FWHM = 0.100 and 0.150 cm. Three general conclusions come out of
   this work: (1) detector models can be simplified to produce ORdetMCfclin
   to within 1.0\% of those calculated using the complete geometry, where
   typically not only the silicon chip, but also any high density
   components close to the chip, such as scattering plates or shielding
   material is necessary to be included in the model, (2) diode detectors
   of smaller active radius require less of a correction and (3)
   k(Qclin,Qmsr)(fclin,fmsr) is insensitive to the incident the electron
   energy and spot size variations investigated. Therefore, simplified
   detector models can be used with acceptable accuracy within the recently
   proposed small field dosimetry formalism.}},

Abstract = {{Samples of normal, high-amylose, and waxy barleys (NB, HAB, and WB,
   respectively) were tempered and then microwaved using three treatment
   protocols at each of three power levels. Microwave treatment increased
   starch digestibility, as rapidly digestible starch (RDS) concentrations
   were markedly higher and resistant starch (RS) and slowly digestible
   starch (SDS) concentrations were significantly lower, in all microwaved
   samples compared to corresponding unprocessed samples. Levels of RDS, on
   a dry sample basis, were similar in corresponding microwaved samples of
   the three barley types but were higher in WB when expressed on a starch
   basis. Levels of RS were lowest in microwaved WB samples. Microwave
   treatment was most effective in increasing starch digestibility at
   higher microwave power levels and when samples were tempered and then
   stored for 14 days at 4 degrees C prior to microwaving, although the
   magnitude of the increase may not justify the cost of the storage step
   and might be achieved more economically through the use of an even
   higher power level. Increases in starch digestibility were attributed to
   gelatinization of starch. This conclusion was supported by degree of
   starch gelatinization, thermal analysis, and pasting data.}},

Abstract = {{Ozonation of toluene catalyzed by manganese oxides supported on
   gamma-alumina and siliceous MCM-41 was studied at temperatures from 22
   to 100 degrees C. Nitrate and acetate precursors of manganese were used
   to compare structure and activity of dispersed manganese oxides on
   gamma-alumina and MCM-41. Catalysts were characterized by X-ray
   diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, BET and ICP-MS. Catalysts became
   deactivated at room temperature due to accumulation of carbon species. A
   minimum reaction temperature of 65 degrees C was required to achieve
   steady state oxidation of toluene with ozone. Alumina supported
   catalysts prepared from the nitrate and acetate precursors had
   comparable activity. MCM-41 supported catalyst resulted in lower toluene
   and ozone conversion in comparison to gamma-alumina catalysts above 40
   degrees C. CO and CO2 were the main reaction products while oxalic acid,
   acetic acid, benzene and maleic anhydride were also detected as the
   minor reaction byproducts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In the standard picture of cosmology it is predicted that a phase
   transition, associated with chiral symmetry breaking after the
   electroweak transition, has occurred at approximately 10 mu seconds
   after the Big Bang to convert a plasma of free quarks and gluons into
   hadrons. We consider the quark-hadron phase transition in a Dvali,
   Gabadadze and Porrati (DGP) brane world scenario within an effective
   model of QCD. We study the evolution of the physical quantities useful
   for the study of the early universe, namely, the energy density,
   temperature and the scale factor before, during and after the phase
   transition. Also, due to the high energy density in the early universe,
   we consider the quadratic energy density term that appears in the
   Friedmann equation. In DGP brane models such a term corresponds to the
   negative branch (epsilon = -1) of the Friedmann equation when the Hubble
   radius is much smaller than the crossover length in 4D and 5D regimes.
   We show that for different values of the cosmological constant on a
   brane, lambda, phase transition occurs and results in decreasing the
   effective temperature of the quark-gluon plasma and of the hadronic
   fluid. We then consider the quark-hadron transition in the smooth
   crossover regime at high and low temperatures and show that such a
   transition occurs along with decreasing the effective temperature of the
   quark-gluon plasma during the process of the phase transition.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes a novel microfluidic method to generate uniform
   water-in-oil (W/O) microspheres using the phase separation technique.
   Axiomatic design theory (ADT) was employed for the conceptual design of
   microchannel systems, and ADT verified that the proposed microfluidic
   system is a decoupled design. The integration of hydrodynamic flow
   focusing method and crossflow method is realized in a microfluidic
   device with oil phase and aqueous phase. The immiscible fluids are fed
   by continuous air pressure. By the hydrodynamic flow focusing method,
   the width of the dispersed focused aqueous phase is controlled. The
   focused flow enters T-junction geometry downstream, and the crossflow
   interferes with the focused flow. By varying the applied pressure to the
   crossflow, the W/O microspheres are formed at the T-junction. Based on
   this approach, the size of the W/O microspheres can be successfully
   controlled from 16 mu m to 35 mu m in diameter within about 5\% of
   variation. The present method has advantages such as good sphericity,
   few satellite droplets, active control of the microsphere diameter, and
   high throughput with the simple and low cost process. To achieve the
   promising results, this integrating method reveals high potential for
   production of polymer based microspheres. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006771]}},

Abstract = {{Ethanol dehydration was investigated in a fixed-bed packed with canola
   meal biosorbent. Breakthrough curves were used to investigate the
   effects of feed flow rate, column temperature, and ethanol feed
   concentration on water and ethanol adsorption capacity. Experimental
   results demonstrated that fuel grade ethanol (over 99 wt \%) was
   achieved through water adsorption in the fixed bed with ethanol feed
   concentrations of 75 wt \%, and 92 wt \%, respectively, at a feed flow
   rate of 2.9 mL/min and column temperature of 85 degrees C. Both water
   and ethanol were adsorbed on canola meal. Water adsorption isotherm was
   described as type II isotherm. Peudo-equilibrium ethanol adsorption
   isotherm was also discussed in this work. Water selectivity over ethanol
   was higher at the breakthrough point defined at 99 wt \% ethanol than
   that at water adsorption equilibrium. Separation factor can be optimized
   through controlling feed flow rate, ethanol feed concentration, and

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{An examination is made of Antarctic dayside auroras to establish how
   they relate to solar wind strength under the quiet conditions of the
   recent extended solar minimum when the solar wind pressure was weak and
   the interplanetary magnetic field B-z is small. It is found that, during
   the many days of observation, the aurora is detected even with the most
   stable and quiet conditions. On such occasions the 630 nm OI emission
   can be as low as 50 R, but is unambiguously and continuously detectable
   through each noon. This is above an airglow intensity of about 30 R. For
   these quiet conditions there is no evident relation between the solar
   wind dynamic pressure or interplanetary magnetic field B-z and dayside
   auroral intensity. This suggests that there is no effective reconnection
   under these minimal conditions and the particle source for the dayside
   aurora could be within the magnetosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Many Saskatchewan provincial highways exhibit permanent deformation that
   is mostly attributed to reduction in air voids in hot mix asphalt
   concrete surfacing. The Saskatchewan Ministry of Highways and
   Infrastructure (MHI) currently use the Marshall compaction method for
   hot mix asphalt concrete (HMAC) design and placement quality control and
   quality assurance. It has been found that the Marshall compaction method
   does not accurately predict field air voids. Therefore, MHI identified
   the need to evaluate the Superpave (TM) gyratory compaction method to
   predict field air voids of typical Saskatchewan asphalt mixes. This
   paper presents a summary of laboratory and field volumetric as well as
   rapid triaxial mechanistic material properties of typical Saskatchewan
   asphalt mixes. This research considered seven asphalt mixes from the
   Radisson Specific Pavement Study (SPS)-9A test site comprising two
   conventional Saskatchewan Marshall Type 71 mixes, five Superpave (TM)
   mixes, and a Superpave (TM) recycled mix. This research determined that
   Marshall compaction and the gyratory compaction at 1.25 degrees gyration

Abstract = {{The goal of this study is to present a simple model based on the
   ring-resonator technique to measure nondestructively the permittivity
   and loss tangent of dielectric materials. The proposed measurement model
   utilizes a modified ring-resonator technique in one-layer and two-layer
   microstrip configurations. This method eliminates the requirement to
   metalize the samples and enables characterization of permittivity and
   dielectric loss from 2 to 40 GHz. The effects of conductor and radiation
   losses that may introduce significant errors in the calculation of the
   loss tangent, especially at very high frequencies, are minimized. The
   measurement precision is evaluated by comparing the results with those
   obtained by using two well-known standard techniques. Uncertainties
   associated with the proposed model are addressed.}},

Abstract = {{This review article attempts to provide an overall description for the
   texture related issues of degradation of Zr alloys. Experimental
   observations show that the oxide formed on Zr alloys is strongly
   textured. The texture and grain-boundary characteristics of oxide are
   dependent on the texture of metal substrate. Computer simulation and
   thermodynamic modeling were used to explain the influence of metal
   substrate on structure of oxide film, and intrinsic factors affecting
   the oxide microstructure. Models of diffusion process of hydrogen atoms
   and oxygen diffusion through oxide are presented. Both intragranular and
   intergranular hydrides were found following (0001)(alpha-zr)parallel
   to\{111\}(delta-ZrH1.5) relationship under no load, but different
   relationships were observed under stress. The through-thickness texture
   inhomogeneity in fuel cladding tubes, the effects of hoop stress on the
   hydride orientation and the formation of interlinked hydride structure
   were studied. A thermodynamic model was developed to analyze the
   nucleation and the stress-induced reorientation of intergranular
   hydrides. These works provide a framework for understanding the effects
   of texture on the oxidation, the hydrogen ingress and the hydride
   formation in Zr alloys. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Diamond-like carbon (DLC) and N-doped DLC (DLC:N) thin films have been
   synthesized on polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) and silicon wafers using
   ion beam deposition. Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to
   study the structural and morphological properties of the coated surface.
   The results show that the ion beam deposited DLC thin films exhibit high
   hardness and Young's modulus, low coefficient of friction and high
   adhesion to the substrate. Low concentration of nitrogen doping in DLC
   improves the mechanical properties and reduces the surface roughness.
   DLC coating decreases the surface energy and improves the wettability of
   PTFE. The platelet adhesion results show that the haemocompatibility of
   DLC coated PTFE, especially DLC:N coated PTFE, has been significantly
   enhanced as compared with uncoated PTFE. SEM observations show that the
   platelet reaction on the DLC and DLC:N coated PTFE was minimized as the
   platelets were much less aggregated and activated. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The local-spin-density approximation plus Hubbard U (commonly called
   LDA+U) is used in a comprehensive study of the structural, mechanical
   and optical properties of urania. It is shown that using the new LDA+U
   implementation in CASTEP calculations, the symmetry constraints, imposed
   in agreement with both the symmetry of the unit cell and the present
   magnetic interaction, can be used to predict the ground state with the
   occupancy of the orbitals (5f in urania) in agreement with Hund's rules.
   The inclusion of a Hubbard U correction to 5f electrons of uranium
   changes urania from a metal to an insulator and, therefore, has a
   dramatic effect on the localisation of the electron spin and charge
   density on uranium. The value of the adjustable parameter U, which
   predicts the optical band gap in agreement with the experiment, leads to
   a slightly larger lattice constant than experimentally observed. The
   real and imaginary dielectric constants, reflectivity and energy loss
   functions are calculated using independent particle excitation
   approximations. The 5f intraband transitions are described adequately by
   the LDA and the effective U parameter, which is equal to 3.5 eV.
   However, additional corrections are needed to account for the 1-eV shift
   in the 2p-6d transitions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   laser cutting to produce welded square hollow-section T-joints with
   similar or higher fatigue strengths than their conventional mechanical
   cut counterparts. A total of 21 full-scale T-joint samples, typical of
   those found in the agricultural industry, were included in this study.
   Nineteen of these samples were examined with the intention of forming a
   fatigue crack of approximately 3.8 cm (1.5 in.es) in length, and two
   samples with strain gauges attached for strain measurements. The
   experimental results of the full-scale T-joints subjected to cyclic
   loads showed that the fatigue strength of the samples that were
   manufactured with laser cutting were higher than those fabricated with
   mechanical cutting. A finite element analysis (FEA) of the T-joints was
   also performed, and the FEA results were verified with the experimental

Abstract = {{The performance of bit-interleaved coded modulation in multiple-input
   multiple-output (BICM-MIMO) systems using an iterative channel estimator
   is analysed. In a conventional iterative channel estimator, after
   initialisation with the training phase, the channel estimator switches
   to the data phase. However, such a conventional iterative channel
   estimator does not always improve the performance of the receiver. In
   order to guarantee the performance improvement, a condition on when the
   output of the decoder should be used by the estimator is determined.
   Such a condition is related to the reliability of the soft information
   utilised by the channel estimator. The key in establishing this
   relationship is to use the mutual information (MI) that the observation
   vector has about the channel gains given the output of the decoder at
   each iteration. In this switch-augmented conventional iterative channel
   estimator, referred to as SAICE, the condition is theoretically found
   and indicates the needed reliability of the soft information for the
   channel estimator at the switching time. The switch-augmented scheme
   guarantees performance improvement of the iterative receiver with each
   iteration, however, it might need many iterations to converge for
   moderate to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). A less computationally
   intensive approach is to use both the training and data segments of the
   observation. This approach produces a combined iterative channel
   estimator (CICE) for BICM-MIMO systems. The performance behaviour of the
   BICM-MIMO system is illustrated through the extrinsic information
   transfer (EXIT) chart with imperfect channel state information (CSI).
   Analytical results are verified with computer simulations.}},

Title = {{Iteration method for predicting essential proteins based on orthology
   and protein-protein interaction networks}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Identification of essential proteins plays a significant
   role in understanding minimal requirements for the cellular survival and
   development. Many computational methods have been proposed for
   predicting essential proteins by using the topological features of
   protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. However, most of these
   methods ignored intrinsic biological meaning of proteins. Moreover, PPI
   data contains many false positives and false negatives. To overcome
   these limitations, recently many research groups have started to focus
   on identification of essential proteins by integrating PPI networks with
   other biological information. However, none of their methods has widely
   been acknowledged.
   Results: By considering the facts that essential proteins are more
   evolutionarily conserved than nonessential proteins and essential
   proteins frequently bind each other, we propose an iteration method for
   predicting essential proteins by integrating the orthology with PPI
   networks, named by ION. Differently from other methods, ION identifies
   essential proteins depending on not only the connections between
   proteins but also their orthologous properties and features of their
   neighbors. ION is implemented to predict essential proteins in S.
   cerevisiae. Experimental results show that ION can achieve higher
   identification accuracy than eight other existing centrality methods in
   terms of area under the curve (AUC). Moreover, ION identifies a large
   amount of essential proteins which have been ignored by eight other
   existing centrality methods because of their low-connectivity. Many
   proteins ranked in top 100 by ION are both essential and belong to the
   complexes with certain biological functions. Furthermore, no matter how
   many reference organisms were selected, ION outperforms all eight other
   existing centrality methods. While using as many as possible reference
   organisms can improve the performance of ION. Additionally, ION also
   shows good prediction performance in E. coli K-12.
   Conclusions: The accuracy of predicting essential proteins can be
   improved by integrating the orthology with PPI networks.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{Using a recently developed first-principles approach for determining
   indentation strength {[}Z. Pan, H. Sun, and C. Chen, Phys. Rev. Lett.
   98, 135505 (2007); 102, 055503 (2009)], we performed calculations of the
   ideal strength of hexagonal Re, Re3N, Re2N, Re2C, Re2B, and ReB2 in
   various shear deformation directions beneath the Vickers indentor. Our
   results show that the normal compressive pressure beneath the indentor
   weakens the strength of these electron-rich rhenium boride, carbide, and
   nitride compounds that belong to a distinct class of ultraincompressible
   and ultrahard materials. The reduction of indentation strength in these
   materials stems from lateral bond and volume expansions driven by the
   normal compressive pressure mediated by the high-density valence
   electrons in these structures. We compare the calculated indentation
   strength to the Poisson's ratio, which measures the lateral structural
   expansion, for the rhenium boride, carbide, and nitride compounds as
   well as diamond and cubic boron nitride. Our analysis indicates that
   although the normal pressure beneath the indentor generally leads to
   more significant reduction of indentation strength in materials with
   larger Poisson's ratios, crystal and electronic structures also play
   important roles in determining the structural response under
   indentation. The present study reveals structural deformation modes and
   the underlying atomistic mechanisms in transition-metal boride, carbide,
   and nitride compounds under the Vickers indentation. The results are
   distinctive from those of the traditional covalent superhard materials.
   The insights obtained from this work have important implications for
   further exploration and design of ultrahard materials.}},

Abstract = {{Hydride-induced degradation of hoop ductility in Zr-alloy tubular
   components has been studied for many years because of its importance in
   the nuclear industry. In this paper the role of intergranular and
   intragranular delta-hydrides in the degradation of ductility of the
   textured Zr-alloy tubes is investigated. The correlation among hydride
   distribution, orientation and morphology in the tubes is formulated
   based on thermodynamic modeling, and then analyzed. The results show
   that the applied stress, the crystallographic texture of alpha-Zr
   matrix, the grain-boundary structure, and the morphology and size of Zr
   grains simultaneously govern the site preference and the orientation of
   hydrides. A criterion is proposed to determine the threshold stress of
   hydride reorientation. The hoop ductility of the hydrided Zr tubes is
   discussed using the concept of macroscopic fracture strain. It is shown
   that the intergranular hydrides may be more deleterious to ductility
   than the intragranular ones. This work defines a general framework for
   understanding the relation of the microstructure of hydride-forming
   materials to embrittlement. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{We report on experimental results which show that the dark current in
   n-i-p structured, amorphous selenium films is independent of i-layer
   thickness in samples with consistently thick blocking layers. We have
   observed, however, a strong dependence on the n-layer thickness and
   positive contact metal chosen. These results indicate that the dominant
   source of the dark current is carrier injection from the contacts and
   any contribution from carriers thermally generated in the bulk of the
   photoconductive layer is negligible. This conclusion is supported by a
   description of the dark current transients at different applied fields
   by a model which assumes only carrier emission over a Schottky barrier.
   This model also predicts that while hole injection is initially
   dominant, some time after the application of the bias, electron
   injection may become the dominant source of dark current. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In the present work, the adsorption of azo dye acid orange 7 (AO7) onto

   process. As control groups, another azo compound, sulfasalazine (SSZ),
   together with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and sulfapyridine (SPY), was
   also studied for adsorption behavior onto ND surface, respectively. Due
   to strong hydrogen bond interaction, ND shows high affinity with AO7 and
   SSZ while it only exhibits moderate and weak interaction with 5-ASA and
   SPY, respectively. Though the affinity is slightly lower at high pH
   values, the adsorption coefficients of ND with AO7 at neutral to
   alkaline pHs are still of the same orders of magnitude with those at low
   pHs, suggesting that ND could be a desirable candidate for textile
   wastewater treatment not only in acidic conditions but also at neutral

Abstract = {{The problem of decision fusion for cooperative spectrum sensing in
   cognitive radio (CR) networks is studied when fading channels are
   present between the CRs and the fusion center (FC). The CRs perform
   spectrum sensing using energy detection and transmit their binary
   decisions to the FC for a final decision on the absence or presence of
   the primary user activity. Considering the limited resources in CR
   networks, which makes it difficult to acquire the instantaneous
   channel-state information, noncoherent transmission schemes with on-off
   keying (OOK) and binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK) are employed to
   transmit the binary decisions to the FC. For each of the transmission
   schemes considered, energy-and decoding-based fusion rules are developed
   first. Then, the detection threshold at the CR nodes and at the FC, the
   combining weights (in the case of the energy-based fusion rule), and the
   sensing time are optimized to maximize the achievable secondary
   throughput of the CR network. Simulation results verify the theoretical
   analysis. It is also shown that the energy-based fusion rule outperforms
   the decoding-based fusion rule when the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of
   the reporting channels are low, whereas the opposite is true for high
   SNRs. For the simpler energy-based fusion rule, BFSK achieves higher
   secondary throughput than OOK, at the expense of a larger transmission
   bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an optimal training design for an
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relay system, in which the source, relay, and
   destination are all equipped with multiple antennas. Examined is the
   scenario when spatial correlation exists among the multiple antennas
   employed at each node. By properly exploiting the correlation
   information, the training design problem is formulated as a convex
   optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved with the iterative
   bisection procedure. A simpler suboptimal design based on minimizing an
   upper bound on the channel estimation error is also suggested.
   Simulation results demonstrate the performance advantage of the proposed
   training designs for the linear minimum mean-squared-error (LMMSE)
   channel vector estimation over the training design for the LMMSE channel

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The characteristics of the Reynolds stress field in the wake of a stack
   were experimentally studied in a low-speed wind tunnel using thermal
   anemometry. The cross-flow Reynolds number was Re-D = 2.3 x 10(4), and
   the jet-to-crossflow velocity ratio (R) was varied from zero to three.
   The stack was partially immersed in a turbulent flat-plate boundary
   layer, with a boundary layer thickness-to-stack-height ratio of delta/H
   = 0.5 at the location of the stack. In general, the time-averaged
   velocities and Reynolds stresses were both found to be strongly
   influenced by the velocity ratio. For example, the vertical profile of
   the Reynolds shear stress in the wake was strongly influenced by the
   local velocity gradients, especially for lower values of R in the stack
   wake, and for higher values of R in the jet wake. The spanwise
   characteristics of the time-averaged streamwise and wall-normal
   velocities also varied along the stack height (z/H) and with the value
   of R. The behaviour of the shear correlation coefficient indicated that
   there is more turbulent mixing in the vicinity of the free end of the
   stack than at mid-height. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Thermodynamic equilibrium analysis of ring opening of decalin}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{400-410}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were carried out in order to
   understand the effect of temperature and hydrogen-to-hydrocarbon ratio
   on the yield and selectivity of ring opening products that are obtained
   from hydrocracking of decalin. Thermochemical analysis of single
   hydrocracking reactions involving selected alkanes and naphthenes
   indicates that endocyclic cracking of naphthenes is less favored than
   acyclic and exocyclic cracking reactions due to entropy considerations.
   The equilibrium calculations were performed in the temperature range
   298-800 K at a pressure of 1 bar for a mixture of compounds obtained
   from hydrocracking of decalin using the assumption that the reaction
   mixture behaves as an ideal gas. The quantum chemical method G3MP2 was
   used to calculate the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for
   compounds for which thermochemical data are so far unavailable in the
   open literature. The results from equilibrium calculations indicate
   that, as long as cracking (CR) and dehydrogenation (DH) products are
   allowed to form simultaneously, total ring opening (TRO) products cannot
   be present in the reaction mixture in appreciable concentrations. If the
   pathways leading to the formation of CR products are excluded from the
   equilibrium calculations, the yield of TRO products reaches a
   significant value of similar to 0.75 kg/kg decalin fed in the
   temperature range 400-500 K. The highest yield of TRO products, similar
   to 1 kg/kg decalin fed, observed for a hydrogen-to-hydrocarbon ratio of
   4 in the temperature range <500 K could be the maximum achievable yield
   for TRO products of decalin. The TRO products consist mostly of
   saturated ring opening (SRO) products and traces of unsaturated ring
   opening (USRO) products. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiesel was produced by reactive extraction (RE) of castor seed to
   reduce the cost and time associated with conventional method. The
   objective of this study is to determine the relationship between various
   important parameters of the RE process to obtain a high yield of FAME.
   Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to statistically analyze and
   optimize the operating parameters of the process. A central composite
   design (CCD) was adopted to study effects of catalyst concentration,
   methanol to oil molar ratio, reaction temperature and mixing intensity
   on yield of FAME. The results of RSM analysis indicate that catalyst
   concentration and methanol to oil molar ratio have most significant
   effect on the yield of FAME, with R-2 = 0.998 shows fitness of a
   second-order model. The interaction terms of catalyst concentration with
   both methanol to oil molar ratio and reaction temperature exhibited a
   positive effect delivering (P < 0.0001). Based on second-order model,
   optimum condition for this reaction is found to be methanol to oil molar
   ratio of 225:1, catalyst concentration 1.0 wt.\% of oil, reaction
   temperature 55 degrees C and mixing intensity of 350 rpm. The
   mathematical model (a quadratic polynomial equation) has developed
   adequately describing ranges of the experimental parameters studied and
   provides a statistically accurate prediction of the optimum yield of

Abstract = {{Reconstruction of a biological system from its experimental time series
   data is a challenging task in systems biology. The S-system which
   consists of a group of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
   is an effective model to characterize molecular biological systems and
   analyze the system dynamics. However, inference of S-systems without the
   knowledge of system structure is not a trivial task due to its
   nonlinearity and complexity. In this paper, a pruning separable
   parameter estimation algorithm (PSPEA) is proposed for inferring
   S-systems. This novel algorithm combines the separable parameter
   estimation method (SPEM) and a pruning strategy, which includes adding
   an l(1) regularization term to the objective function and pruning the
   solution with a threshold value. Then, this algorithm is combined with
   the continuous genetic algorithm (CGA) to form a hybrid algorithm that
   owns the properties of these two combined algorithms. The performance of
   the pruning strategy in the proposed algorithm is evaluated from two
   aspects: the parameter estimation error and structure identification
   accuracy. The results show that the proposed algorithm with the pruning
   strategy has much lower estimation error and much higher identification
   accuracy than the existing method.}},

Title = {{An unsupervised machine learning method for assessing quality of tandem
   mass spectra}},
Journal = {{PROTEOME SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: In a single proteomic project, tandem mass spectrometers can
   produce hundreds of millions of tandem mass spectra. However, majority
   of tandem mass spectra are of poor quality, it wastes time to search
   them for peptides. Therefore, the quality assessment (before database
   search) is very useful in the pipeline of protein identification via
   tandem mass spectra, especially on the reduction of searching time and
   the decrease of false identifications. Most existing methods for quality
   assessment are supervised machine learning methods based on a number of
   features which describe the quality of tandem mass spectra. These
   methods need the training datasets with knowing the quality of all
   spectra, which are usually unavailable for the new datasets.
   Results: This study proposes an unsupervised machine learning method for
   quality assessment of tandem mass spectra without any training dataset.
   This proposed method estimates the conditional probabilities of spectra
   being high quality from the quality assessments based on individual
   features. The probabilities are estimated through a constraint
   optimization problem. An efficient algorithm is developed to solve the
   constraint optimization problem and is proved to be convergent.
   Experimental results on two datasets illustrate that if we search only
   tandem spectra with the high quality determined by the proposed method,
   we can save about 56\% and 62\% of database searching time while losing
   only a small amount of high-quality spectra.
   Conclusions: Results indicate that the proposed method has a good
   performance for the quality assessment of tandem mass spectra and the
   way we estimate the conditional probabilities is effective.}},

   affords a 2D pi-electronic structure with a large calculated bandwidth.
   The material displays high electrical conductivity for a f = 1/2 system,
   with sigma(300 K) = 2 x 10(-2) S cm(-1). While the conductivity is
   thermally activated at ambient pressure, with E-act, = 0.10 eV at 300 K,
   indicative of a Mott insulating state, E-act is eliminated at 3 GPa,
   suggesting the formation of a metallic state. The onset of metallization
   is supported by infrared measurements, which show closure of the
   Mott-Hubbard gap above 3 GPa.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Identifying gene regulatory network (GRN) from time course
   gene expression data has attracted more and more attentions. Due to the
   computational complexity, most approaches for GRN reconstruction are
   limited on a small number of genes and low connectivity of the
   underlying networks. These approaches can only identify a single network
   for a given set of genes. However, for a large-scale gene network, there
   might exist multiple potential sub-networks, in which genes are only
   functionally related to others in the sub-networks.
   Results: We propose the network and community identification (NCI)
   method for identifying multiple subnetworks from gene expression data by
   incorporating community structure information into GRN inference. The
   proposed algorithm iteratively solves two optimization problems, and can
   promisingly be applied to large-scale GRNs. Furthermore, we present the
   efficient Block PCA method for searching communities in GRNs.
   Conclusions: The NCI method is effective in identifying multiple
   subnetworks in a large-scale GRN. With the splitting algorithm, the
   Block PCA method shows a promosing attempt for exploring communities in
   a large-scale GRN.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the predictive ability of muscle cross-sectional
   area (MCSA) and body mass on bone mineral content, compressive bone
   strength index (BSIc), and the polar stress-strain index (SSIp) of the
   forearms and lower legs of middle-aged adults. Methods: A total of 53
   healthy adults (37 male, 16 female; mean age 50.4; SD 2.1 y) were
   scanned with peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) to
   measure radius and tibia total and cortical bone mineral content, BSIc,
   SSIp, and forearm and lower-leg MCSA (BSIc: 4\% distal; SSIp and MCSA at
   65\% and 66\% radius and tibia shaft sites, respectively). Multiple
   regression models adjusted for sex and height were used to assess the
   relative variance in radius or tibia bone outcomes predicted by body
   mass and/or forearm or lower-leg MCSA. Results: Forearm MCSA
   independently predicted total bone-mineral content, BSIc, and SSIp in
   radius (r(partial) = 0.59, 0.56, 0.42). Body mass was a negative
   predictor of radius BSIc (r(partial) = 0.32) and did not predict other
   radius outcomes when both body mass and MCSA were forced in the models.
   In the lower leg shaft, MCSA, and body mass predicted bone content and
   strength similarly when independently added to the models with sex and
   height. Conclusions: Forearm MCSA was a dominant predictor of radius
   bone content and estimated strength. In the tibia, both body mass and
   lower-leg MCSA contributed to predicting bone content and estimated
   strength.}},

Abstract = {{We have observed and analyzed a universal temperature crossover behavior
   of electrical conductance in a single oligothiophene molecular wire. The
   crossover between the Arrhenius-type temperature dependence at high
   temperature and the temperature-invariant behavior at low temperature is
   found at a critical molecular wire length of 5.6 nm, where we found a
   change from the exponential length dependence to the length-invariant
   behavior. We have derived a scaling function analysis for the origin of
   the crossover behavior. After assuring that the analysis fits the
   explanation of the Keldysh Green's function calculation for the
   temperature dependence, we have applied it to our experimental results
   and found successfully that our scaling function gives a universal
   description of the temperature dependence for all over the temperature

Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{207-216}},

Abstract = {{Sulfur-based autotrophic denitrification and denitritation were
   investigated using an oil reservoir culture. In batch system nitrate up
   to 20 mM was reduced with concomitant sulfate production. With 20 mM
   nitrate, reduction of produced nitrite did not occur which was contrary
   to that under heterotrophic conditions. Reduction of nitrite as the sole
   substrate occurred even at 50 mM. When both sulfur and acetate were
   present, only acetate was used as the electron donor. In the continuous
   biofilm reactor maximum nitrate and nitrite removal rates of 17.3 and
   13.2 mM/h, much higher than literature values, were achieved at
   residence times of 0.4 and 0.6 h, respectively. Bicarbonate functioned
   effectively as carbon source and alkaline, and eliminated the problems
   associated with lime addition. Based on these and our earlier findings
   the highest nitrate and nitrite removal rates are achieved under
   heterotrophic conditions with acetate, followed by autotrophic rates
   with sulfide, and then elemental sulfur. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper develops a detection scheme based on the implicit

   modulation in amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-relay networks. It is
   shown that, at the expense of the low spectral efficiency inherent in
   FSK modulation, every transmitted symbol from the source to the
   destination can be used as a pilot symbol. In the proposed detection
   scheme, the destination combines the signals from the source and the
   relays to perform detection by using the estimated channels obtained
   from the implicit pilot symbols. Using the Gaussian approximation for
   the effective noise at the destination, an upper bound of the
   approximated bit-error-rate (BER) is provided. Simulation results reveal
   that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the BER performance

Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2954-2965}},

Abstract = {{This paper estimates the availability of agricultural crop residue
   feedstocks in Canada for cellulosic ethanol production. Canada's major
   field crops generate 100.6 million dry mega grams (Mg) of crops per year
   while non-forage crops produce 67 million dry Mg, leaving abundant
   agricultural residues for use as second generation feedstock for
   cellulosic ethanol production. This study used crop production and
   livestock data from Statistics Canada for a 10-year period (2001-2010),
   as well as tillage data from Statistics Canada census years 2001 and
   2006, to estimate crop residue availability by province and soil zone.
   Total residue yield from crops is calculated by incorporating straw to
   grain ratios. Total agricultural residues available for ethanol
   production are computed by deducting soil conservation and livestock
   uses. An average of 48 million dry Mg of agricultural residues is
   available per year, with a minimum of 24.5 million dry Mg in drought
   year 2002. This implies an average yearly potential ethanol production
   of 13 billion litres from crop residues over the 2001-2010 period, with
   a minimum of 6.6 billion litres in 2002. Ontario, Manitoba,
   Saskatchewan, and Quebec have enough agricultural residue supply to set
   up ethanol plants using agricultural crop residues as primary
   lignocellulosic feedstocks. There is great variability in agricultural
   residue production between the provinces and by soil zone. Understanding
   variability in feedstock supply is important for the economics and
   operational planning of a cellulosic ethanol biorefinery. Factors such
   as residue yield per hectare and soil zone will influence cellulosic
   ethanol plant establishment in order to exploit the abundance of
   lignocellulosic biomass for an ethanol plant. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

   during cold climate transport. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 92: 109-122. Thermal
   environments within broiler transport vehicles are dependent on ambient
   conditions and, if poorly managed, can be a welfare concern. To
   effectively manage broiler transport, the environmental conditions
   throughout vehicles must be understood. Under standard commercial
   practices, temperature and humidity levels in double-trailer broiler
   vehicles were examined for a range of ambient temperatures (-24 to 11
   degrees C). During warmer ambient conditions (9.8 degrees C) trailer
   roof vents and side curtains were all open, which resulted in a
   narrowing of the on-board temperature range (10.3 to 16.7 degrees C). As
   ambient temperature cooled side curtains and some of the roof vents were
   closed. This resulted in increasingly variable and more extreme thermal
   conditions, with heat and moisture accumulated along the midline of the
   load near the front of the lead trailer and near the back of the rear
   trailer. At an ambient temperature of -22.1 degrees C trailer
   temperatures ranged from -20.7 to 21.7 degrees C with an estimated
   58.6\% of the load volume being exposed to temperatures below 0 degrees
   C. In addition, the trailer humidity ratio rose 14.0 g kg(-1) above
   ambient and conditions approached saturation (RH >80\%) in 55.2\% of the
   load volume. These results support the need to find a means to remove
   moisture and redistribute heat on broiler trailers during cold ambient
   conditions.}},

   standard branch-and-bound algorithms. To reduce computational
   complexity, a greedy solution in the form of a lexicographic bottleneck
   assignment algorithm is proposed. Simulation results obtained for the
   IEEE 802.16j uplink scenarios show that the greedy algorithm performs
   very close to the optimal solution but at a much lower computational
   cost. The proposed greedy solution can also be tailored to provide
   further improvements on other network performance criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed electric field technology (PEF) was applied to Podophyllum
   peltatum as a novel approach to enhance the extraction of
   podophyllotoxin. Podophyllotoxin is a valuable for the treatment of

   A low energy pulse generator was used to perform PEF treatment with
   pulse frequency of 840 Hz and electric field intensity of 17.7 and 19.4
   kV/cm for 5, 6, and 8 min of apparent treatment time. PEF treatment
   significantly changed the color and apparent viscosity of the samples.
   PEF treatment with 840 Hz rectangular pulses of 19.4 kV/cm for 6 min was
   successful in significantly raising the concentration of podophyllotoxin
   by up to 47\%. Although the exact mechanism of electroplasmolysis of

Abstract = {{Recently nonlinear differential equations with time delays have been

   tool for understanding gene regulatory processes in living organisms. In
   this paper we study the stability and bifurcation of a class of genetic
   regulatory networks with ring topology and multiple time delays at its
   equilibrium state. We first present necessary and sufficient conditions
   for delay-independently local stability of such genetic regulatory
   networks in the parameter space. Then we investigate their bifurcation
   when such networks lose their stability. Although such networks may have
   multiple delays and different connection strengths among individual
   nodes, their stability and bifurcation depends on the sum of all time
   delays among all elements (including both mRNAs and proteins) and the
   product of the connection strengths between all elements. An
   autoregulatory network and a repressilatory network are employed to
   illustrate the theorems developed in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional tensile test (CTT) and small punch test (SPT) was carried
   out on a failed ASTM A350 forging flange to study specimen size effect
   on mechanical behavior. Specimens were machined from the failed flange
   along Circumferential and longitudinal directions to study the effect of
   anisotropy on mechanical properties. Our results show that an optimum
   sampling has to be used for correlation between SPT and conventional
   tensile test (CTT). Fractography studies carried out on the failed
   samples indicate that the fracture modes of SPT samples and the CIT
   samples were different with the former showing better toughness than the
   latter. This is attributed to smaller size of the specimen and
   constraints imposed by the experimental setup. Due to the anisotropy of
   the forged material, the sampling plane in the SPT should be
   perpendicular to the load direction for reliable correlation between the
   results of both methods of testing. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A biomass fuel feeding system has been designed, constructed and
   evaluated for a fluidized bed gasifier (FBG) pilot plant at the
   University of Saskatchewan (Saskatoon, SK, Canada). The system was
   designed for meat and bone meal (MBM) to be injected into the gasifier
   at a mass flow-rate range of 1-5 g/s. The designed system consists of
   two stages of screw conveyors, including a metering stage which
   controlled the flow-rate of fuel, a rotary airlock and an injection
   conveyor stage, which delivered that fuel at a consistent rate to the
   FBG. The rotary airlock which was placed between these conveyors, proved
   unable to maintain a pressure seal, thus the entire conveying system was
   sealed and pressurized. A pneumatic injection nozzle was also
   fabricated, tested and fitted to the end of the injection conveyor for
   direct injection and dispersal into the fluidized bed. The 150 mm
   metering screw conveyor was shown to effectively control the mass output
   rate of the system, across a fuel output range of 1-25 g/s, while the
   addition of the 50 mm injection screw conveyor reduced the irregularity
   (error) of the system output rate from 47\% to 15\%. Although material
   plugging was found to be an issue in the inlet hopper to the injection
   conveyor, the addition of air sparging ports and a system to pulse air
   into those ports was found to successfully eliminate this issue. The
   addition of the pneumatic injection nozzle reduced the output
   irregularity further to 13\%, with an air supply of 50 slpm as the
   minimum air supply to drive this injector. After commissioning of this
   final system to the FBG reactor, the injection nozzle was found to plug
   with char however, and was subsequently removed from the system. Final
   operation of the reactor continues satisfactorily with the two screw
   conveyors operating at matching pressure with the fluidized bed, with
   the output rate of the system estimated based on system characteristic
   equations, and confirmed by static weight measurements made before and
   after testing. The error rate by this method is reported to be
   approximately 10\%, which is slightly better than the estimated error
   rate of 15\% for the conveyor system. The reliability of this
   measurement prediction method relies upon the relative consistency of
   the physical properties of MBM with respect to its bulk density and
   feeding characteristics. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   evaluate the elementary functions (e.g. log, exp, sin, cos, tan, etc.)
   and combinations of these functions by an optimized linear approximation
   with the fewest non-uniform segments. Compared with the previous
   evaluation method based on the static bit-width analysis, the proposed
   method is mainly based on a dynamic bit-width analysis and capable of
   reducing the number of segments, which in turn can significantly reduce
   the memory size occupied in hardware. The proposed dynamic method can
   evaluate the function to satisfy accuracy by the linear approximation in
   which the input, coefficients, and intermediate values are rounded to
   fewer bit-width, which cannot be achieved by previous static non-uniform
   segmentation methods. The hardware performance evaluation results on
   FPGA show that the proposed method consumes about 66\% fewer hardware
   resources, 56\% less actual memory usage, and performs 32\% shorter
   delay on average in comparison with the non-uniform segmentation method
   based on static bit-width analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of acute cold exposure was assessed on broiler physiology,
   breast and thigh muscle metabolites, and meat quality. In total, 160
   male birds at ages of 5 and 6 wk were exposed to temperatures of -9 to
   -15 degrees C (cold stressed) and +20 degrees C (control) in a simulated
   transport chamber for 3 h before slaughter followed by 0 or 2 h of
   lairage. Bird physiology parameters, including core body temperature,
   live shrink, blood glucose, and muscle temperature, were assessed. Core
   body temperature was monitored every minute using i-Button data loggers,
   and live shrink and blood glucose were assessed. Total glucose and
   lactate concentrations at 30 h postmortem, as well as ultimate pH
   (pH(u)), color, and water-holding attributes were evaluated on
   pectoralis major muscle of breast and iliotibi-alis muscle of thigh.
   Birds were grouped based on their microclimate temperature to control
   and cold-stressed groups (0 to -8, -8 to -11, and -11 to -14 degrees C).
   Significant (P < 0.05) decreases in core body temperature and breast and
   thigh muscle temperatures were observed at simulated transport
   temperatures below 0 degrees C. In addition, higher (P < 0.05) live
   shrink and lower blood glucose values were observed as a result of 3-h
   exposure to temperatures below 0 degrees C, exacerbated as temperature
   decreased further below -8 degrees C. Thigh muscle was almost depleted
   of glycogen reserve compared with a significant but small reduction in
   breast muscle glycogen when exposure temperature was below -8 degrees C.
   Similarly, much greater effects were observed on thigh pH(u) and quality
   attributes compared with breast. In addition, 84\% incidence of the
   dark, firm, dry quality defect was observed in thigh meat (pH(u) > 6.4,
   L{*} < 44) compared with 42\% incidence of dark, firm, dry in breast
   meat (pH(u) > 6.1, L{*} < 46) when transportation temperature was below
   0 degrees C. Results of this study showed that thigh muscle was affected
   more severely than breast muscle by exposure to cold temperatures before
   slaughter.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated design approach, namely, design for control (DFC), is
   further studied in this paper. Previous work on the DFC approach usually
   takes the proportional-derivative (PD) control algorithm. It is revealed
   in a closed-chain five-bar machine case that the PD-based DFC approach
   can only obtain a desired performance in set-point control task rather
   than tracking control task. In order to improve the robustness of this
   mechatronic system in terms of change of tasks, this paper suggests to
   use a ``PD plus robust term{''} control algorithm in the DFC approach.
   Theoretical analysis shows that a satisfactory performance can be
   achieved by the proposed DFC. And it is also shown that the gain in the
   robust term plays an important role in bridging design of control
   algorithm and design of machine body. The general design principle of
   machine body is to design parameters of machine body to minimize the
   lower bound of this robust gain. Finally, the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach is validated by simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel scalable and runtime dynamically
   reconfigurable FFT architecture for different wireless standards. With
   only 8 butterfly units, a reconfigurable FFT architecture for three
   different FFT points is realized using mixed radix-2(2)/2(3)/2(4) FFT
   algorithm in a modified Single-path Delay Feedback (SDF) pipelined
   architecture. Via a proper data flow reconfiguration it can support 64,
   128 and 256. It can even be extended up to 8192-point transforms and
   uses only 13 butterfly units to realize 8192 points. This paper
   describes the implementation method of 256 and 128 point FFT, which is
   reconfigured partially from 64 point FFT. The whole system is
   implemented on a Xilinx XC2VP30 FPGA device. The implementation design
   addresses area efficiency and flexibility allowing the insertion of the
   partial modules dynamically to realize various FFT sizes. To verify the
   efficacy of this dynamic partial reconfigurable FFT design method, a
   conventional multiplexer based reconfigurable architecture was designed
   and tested on the same platform. Tested FPGA results for the Dynamic
   Partial Reconfigurable (DPR) method show the configuration time
   improvement and good area efficiency as compared to the reconfigurable
   architecture using conventional multiplexer techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Potassium modified molybdenum sulfide catalysts promoted with nickel,
   cobalt, and rhodium were prepared using alumina or activated carbon as
   support to obtain highly dispersed MoS2-based catalysts for higher
   alcohols synthesis. The N-2 adsorption study indicates a fall in
   textural characteristics of the catalysts compared to pure supports and
   this effect is more pronounced in activated carbon-based catalysts. The
   XRD phase analysis indicated the existence of promoted and un-promoted
   MoS2 phases. The addition of rhodium resulted in an enhanced dispersion
   of smaller sized Mo particles. The TPR studies revealed that the
   addition of promoters such as, Ni, Co, and Rh improved the reducibility
   of the catalyst and shifts the reduction temperature of Mo+6 to lower
   temperature. Rh-promoted MoS2 sites were revealed from DRIFT study of
   adsorbed CO over the Rh-promoted catalysts. Raman spectroscopy revealed
   the formation of Ni-Mo-S and Co-Mo-S phases in Ni and Co-promoted MoS2
   catalysts. The performance of these catalysts was tested for higher
   alcohols synthesis under similar conditions at 320 degrees C, 8.3 MPa
   (1200 psi g) and 3.6 m(3) (STP)/(kg of cat./h) and H-2 to CO molar ratio
   of 1. The Ni-promoted catalyst showed activity towards the formation of
   hydrocarbons over that of alcohols. The addition of Co to the
   Ni-Mo-K/Al2O3 catalyst improved the activity towards the formation of
   alcohols and hydrocarbons. The activity of Rh-promoted catalysts for
   higher alcohol synthesis was much higher than that obtained over the
   rhodium-free catalysts. The total alcohols space time yield and higher
   alcohols selectivities are significantly higher over the catalysts
   supported on activated carbon supported catalysts. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{The investigation of kinetic and isotherm of fluoride adsorption onto

Abstract = {{In this research work, pumice that is functionalized by the cationic
   surfactant, hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium (HDTMA), is used as an adsorbent
   for the removal of fluoride from drinking water. This work was carried
   out in two parts. The effects of HDTMA loading, pH (3-10), reaction time
   (5-60 min) and the adsorbent dosage (0.15-2.5 g L-1) were investigated
   on the removal of fluoride as a target contaminate from water through
   the design of different experimental sets in the first part. The results
   from this first part revealed that surfactant-modified pumice (SMP)
   exhibited the best performance at dose 0.5 g L-1, pH 6, and it adsorbs
   over 96\% of fluoride from a solution containing 10 mg L-1 fluoride
   after 30 min of mixing time. The four linear forms of the Langmuir,
   Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms model were applied
   to determine the best fit of equilibrium expressions. Apart from the
   regression coefficient (R-2), four error functions were used to validate
   the isotherm and kinetics data. The experimental adsorption isotherm
   complies with Langmuir equation model type 1. The maximum amount of
   adsorption (Q(max)) was 41 mg g(-1). The kinetic studies indicated that
   the adsorption of fluoride best fitted with the pseudo-second-order
   kinetic type 1. Thermodynamic parameters evaluation of fluoride
   adsorption on SMP showed that the adsorption process under the selected
   conditions was spontaneous and endothermic. The suitability of SMP in
   defluoridation at field condition was investigated with natural
   groundwater samples collected from a nearby fluoride endemic area in the
   second part of this study. Based on this study's results, SMP was shown
   to be an affordable and a promising option for the removal of fluoride
   in drinking water. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Diamond coating on Ti-6Al-4V alloy was carried out using microwave
   plasma enhanced CVD with a super high CH4 concentration, and at a
   moderate deposition temperature close to 500 degrees C. The nucleation,
   growth, adhesion behaviors of the diamond coating and the interfacial
   structures were investigated using Raman, XRD, SEM/TEM, synchrotron
   radiation and indentation test. Nanocrystalline diamond coatings have
   been produced and the nucleation density, nucleation rate and adhesion
   strength of diamond coatings on Ti alloy substrate are significantly
   enhanced. An intermediate layer of TiC is formed between the diamond
   coating and the alloy substrate, while diamond coating debonding occurs
   both at the diamond-TiC interface and TiC-substrate interface. The
   simultaneous hydrogenation and carburization also cause complex
   micro-structural and microhardness changes on the alloy substrates. The
   low deposition temperature and extremely high methane concentration
   demonstrate beneficial to enhance coating adhesion strength and reduce
   substrate damage. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   conversion of starch into bioethanol}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{8-16}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{An industrial strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, NRRL Y-132, was
   genetically engineered to stably secrete barley alpha-amylase by
   introducing an expression cassette containing the a-amylase cDNA and a
   dominant selectable marker into the ribosomal DNA loci of the yeast
   chromosome. Batch fermentation studies with this strain showed that the
   integrated expression cassette was mitotically stable for over 100
   generations of continuous culture. In addition, mutation of cysteine 95
   to alanine in barley alpha-amylase was found to increase the recombinant
   strain's starch hydrolyzing ability. The integrated strain showed higher
   starch hydrolyzing ability and ethanol production on both soluble and
   raw starch than the strain transformed with an episomal-based yeast
   expression plasmid. The results indicate that integration of the gene
   cassette into multiple copy loci should be given consideration when
   designing amylolytic yeast strains. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This study investigated intracellular oxidative stress and its
   underlying mechanisms in a rotary cell culture system used to achieve a
   simulated microgravity (SMG) environment. Experiments were conducted
   with human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (an estrogen receptor (ER)
   alpha positive cell line) and MDA-MB-231 (an ER alpha negative cell
   line) encapsulated in alginate/collagen carriers. After 48 h, SMG led to
   oxidative stress and DNA damage in the MDA-MB-231 cells but a
   significant increase in mitochondrial activity and minimal DNA damage in
   the MCF-7 cells. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD)
   significantly increased in the MCF-7 cells and decreased in MDA-MB-231
   cells in the SMG environment compared with a standard gravity control.
   Moreover, SMG promoted expression of ER alpha and protein kinase C (PKC)
   epsilon in MCF-7 cells treated with PKC inhibitor Go6983. Overall,
   exposure to SMG increased mitochondrial activity in ER alpha positive
   cells but induced cellular oxidative damage in ER alpha negative cells.
   Thus, ER alpha may play an important role in protecting cells from
   oxidative stress damage under simulated microgravity. (C) 2012 COSPAR.

Abstract = {{Mn+-implanted, amorphous SiO2 samples were synthesized using pulsed-ion
   implantation without thermal annealing. The crystal and electronic
   structures have been studied using x-ray diffraction and
   synchrotron-based soft x-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy at the
   Si and Mn L-2,L-3 edges. We find a combination of small MnO clusters and
   Si crystallites at shallow depths while tetrahedral Mn coordination is
   found deeper in the host target. Through a combination of techniques, we
   find that the implantation process simultaneously decreases the
   long-range order in the near-surface region and increases order deeper
   in the SiO2 host. Our results suggest Mn substitution into Si sites at
   deep levels catalyzes the formation of alpha-quartz, providing insight
   into the complex interactions that determine the local structure around
   the impurities as well as the overall changes to the crystallinity of
   implanted SiO2.}},

Abstract = {{The O K-edge x-ray Raman scattering (XRS), Brillouin scattering and

   elucidated in a unified manner using model structures obtained from
   First-Principles molecular dynamics calculations. This study provides a

   The compression mechanism involving the presence of 5- and 6-fold

Abstract = {{The electronic structure of several ternary oxides (Sn2TiO4, PbTiO3,
   Bi2Ti4O11, and Bi4Ti3O12) based on binary lone-pair oxides (SnO, PbO,
   and Bi2O3) and a d(0) oxide (TiO2) is investigated using soft x-ray
   spectroscopy and electronic-structure calculations. We find that the
   valence band of these ternary oxides is bounded by bonding (at the
   bottom of the valence band) and antibonding (at the top of the valence
   band) O 2p lone-pair ns (Sn 5s, Pb 6s, Bi 6s) hybridized states, while
   the conduction band is dominated by unoccupied Ti 3d states. The
   existence of these two features is found to be independent of crystal
   structure or stoichiometry. The calculated hybridization in the bonding
   O 2p lone-pair ns states is in reasonable agreement with the relative
   intensity of this feature in the measured x-ray emission spectra. The
   dominant influence on the conduction and the valence bands in the
   ternary oxides is due to different aspects of the electronic structure
   in the parent binary oxides, and we consequently find that the band gap
   of the ternary oxide is found to be a stoichiometric-weighed addition of
   the band gaps of the parent oxides.}},

Abstract = {{The films of nanodiamond (ND) have been prepared at room temperature by
   Step-by-Step (SbS) assembly of ND particles on glass substrates mainly
   through hydrogen bonding. The ND SbS films have regularly organized
   nanostructures, which could be tuned by the number of steps deposited.
   The ND SbS film growth shows a two-step mode with the first step having
   higher growth rate than that of the second one, which is probably
   attributed to the difference in the film surface coverage as well as the
   size of ND aggregates. This SbS assembly process for the preparation of
   films of ND is simple and economic with controllable film morphology.
   Since high surface curvature of nanostructure is able to help retain the
   structural features of biomolecules, the ND SbS film could be a
   desirable platform for biological applications such as biomolecule
   immobilization. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Synthesis of nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) thin films has been
   investigated using microwave plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition
   (MPCVD) on mirror-polished and scratched silicon wafers in gas mixtures

   bonding of the synthesized films. The results show that substrate stage
   configuration and substrate holder materials significantly affected
   diamond primary nucleation. Both increasing the negative bias voltage
   and methane concentrations decreased the grain size of diamond and
   increased the content of graphite in the formed films. The combination
   of increasing bias voltage and methane concentrations can improve the
   NCD growth more efficiently than single effect alone. The results also

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A classical Stokes' second problem has been known for a long time and
   represents one of the few exact solutions of nonlinear Navier-Stokes
   equations. However, oscillatory flow in a semi-infinite domain of
   Newtonian fluid under harmonic boundary excitation only leads to fluid
   wind-milling back and forth in close wall vicinity. In this study, we
   are presenting the mathematical model and the numerical simulations of
   the Newtonian fluid and the shear-thinning non-Newtonian blood-mimicking
   fluid flow. Positive flow rates were obtained by periodic yet
   nonharmonic oscillatory motion of one or two infinite boundary flat
   walls. The oscillatory flows in semi-infinite or finite 2D geometry with
   sawtooth or periodic rectified-sine boundary conditions are presented.
   Rheological human blood models used were: Power-Law, Sisko, Carreau, and
   Herschel-Bulkley. A one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear coupled
   conservative diffusion-type boundary layer equations for mass, linear
   momentum, and energy were solved using the finite-differences method
   with finite-volume discretization. It was possible to test the accuracy
   of the in-house developed computational programs with the few isothermal
   flow analytical solutions and with the celebrated classical Stokes'
   first and second problems. Positive flow rates were achieved in various
   configurations and in absence of the adverse pressure gradients. Body
   forces, such as gravity, were neglected. The calculations utilizing
   in-phase sawtooth and rectified-sine wall excitations resulted in
   respectable net flow which stabilizes and becomes quasi-steady, starting
   from rest, after three to ten periods depending on the fluid rheology.
   It was assumed that rapid return stroke of the wall actuator resulted in
   total wall slip while forward wall motion existed with no-slip boundary
   condition. Shear ``driving{''} and ``driven{''} fluid regions were
   identified. The shear-thinning fluid rheology delivered many interesting
   results, such as pluglike flow. Constructive interference of diffusive
   penetration layers from multiple flat surfaces could be used as
   practical pumping mechanism in micro-scales. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006362]}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel neural modeling methodology for
   forecasting daily river discharge that makes use of neural units with
   higher-order synaptic operations (NU-HSOs). For hydrologic forecasting,
   conventional rainfall-runoff models based on mechanistic approaches in
   the literature have shown limitations attributable to their
   overparameterization and complexity. With the use of neural units with
   quadratic synaptic operation (NU-QSO) and cubic synaptic operation
   (NU-CSO), as suggested in this paper, the refined neural modeling
   methodology can overcome the intricacy and inefficiency of conventional
   models. In this paper, neural network (NN) models with NU-HSO are
   compared with conventional NNs with neural units with linear synaptic
   operation (NU-LSO) for forecasting river discharge. This study was
   conducted using 1- to 5-day lead time forecasting in the Mahanadi River
   basin at the Naraj gauging site to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   higher-order neural networks (HO-NNs). Performance indices for the
   prediction of daily discharge forecasting indicated that NNs with NU-CSO
   and NNs with NU-QSO achieved better performance than NNs with NU-LSO
   even with a lower number of hidden neurons. Thus, this study shows that
   HO-NNs can be effective in hydrologic forecasting. DOI:

Abstract = {{The non-linear reduced four-field RMHD model in cylindrical geometry was
   extended to include plasma rotation, neoclassical poloidal viscosity and
   two fluid diamagnetic effects. Interaction of the static resonant
   magnetic perturbations (RMPs) with the rotating plasmas in tokamaks was
   studied. The self-consistent evolution of equilibrium electric field due
   to RMP penetration is taken into account in the model. It is
   demonstrated that in the pedestal region with steep pressure gradients,
   mean flows perpendicular to the magnetic field, which includes (E) over
   right arrow x (B) over right arrow and electron diamagnetic components
   plays an essential role in RMP screening by plasma. Generally, the
   screening effect increases for lower resistivity, stronger rotation and
   smaller RMP amplitude. Strong screening of central islands was observed
   limiting RMP penetration to the narrow region near the separatrix.
   However, at certain plasma parameters and due to the non-linear
   evolution of the radial electric field produced by RMPs, the (E) over
   right arrow x (B) over right arrow rotation can be compensated by
   electron diamagnetic rotation locally. In this case, RMPs can penetrate
   and form magnetic islands. Typical plasma parameters and RMPs spectra on
   DIII-D, JET and ITER were used in modelling examples presented in the
   paper.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change and human population growth are expected to have
   substantial impacts on global water resources throughout the
   twenty-first century(1,2). Coastal aquifers are a nexus(3) of the
   world's oceanic and hydrologic ecosystems and provide a water source for
   the more than one billion people living in coastal regions(4,5).
   Saltwater intrusion caused by excessive groundwater extraction is
   already impacting diverse regions of the globe(5-7). Synthesis
   studies(8,9) and detailed simulations(10-13) have predicted that rising
   sea levels could negatively impact coastal aquifers through saltwater
   intrusion and/or inundation of coastal regions. However, the relative
   vulnerability of coastal aquifers to groundwater extraction and
   sea-level rise has not been systematically examined. Here we show that
   coastal aquifers are more vulnerable to groundwater extraction than to
   predicted sea-level rise under a wide range of hydrogeologic conditions
   and population densities. Only aquifers with very low hydraulic
   gradients are more vulnerable to sea-level rise and these regions will
   be impacted by saltwater inundation before saltwater intrusion. Human
   water use is a key driver in the hydrology of coastal aquifers, and
   efforts to adapt to sea-level rise at the expense of better water
   management are misguided.}},

Title = {{Life cycle assessment of densified wheat straw pellets in the Canadian
   Prairies}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{420-431}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Densification, a process used to manufacture pellets in order to
   increase biomass bulk density, plays a crucial role in the economics of
   biomass utilization. The Canadian Prairies produce large quantities of
   agricultural residues each year, in particular wheat straw. This study
   performs life cycle assessment of wheat straw pellets by evaluating
   environmental effects of the entire pellet production system comprising
   feedstock production (on-farm wheat straw production), harvesting,
   baling, transportation, and the industrial processing involving drying,
   grinding, pelletizing, and packing in the densification plant. The
   effects of each process on the environmental performance of wheat straw
   pellets were investigated.
   This study was conducted using LCA software and incorporating the
   Ecoinvent database supplemented with literature data for the Canadian
   Prairies. Wheat straw pellets manufactured from the densification plant
   are evaluated with respect to their use of resources and energy
   consumption. Environmental emissions associated with the agricultural
   processing and manufacturing systems are quantified. Sensitivity
   analysis is conducted to compare allocation methods and investigate the
   environmental impact of pelletizing and drying processes. The functional
   unit is defined as 1 kg wheat straw pellet.
   The study quantified the environmental impact of producing wheat straw
   pellets in terms of global warming potential, acidification,
   eutrophication, ozone layer depletion, abiotic depletion, human
   toxicity, photochemical oxidation, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, and
   terrestrial ecotoxicity. Drying, pelletizing, and fertilizer are the
   main contributors to global warming, acidification, abiotic depletion,
   human toxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation, and
   most of the other environmental impacts. Wheat seed has more impact on
   eutrophication. Transportation has an impact on ozone layer depletion,
   while grinding has an effect on freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity.
   The environmental impact of materials and energy fluxes on producing
   wheat straw pellet in the Canadian Prairies is assessed. The effect of
   each processing step on the entire manufacturing process is described.
   Overall, drying and pelletizing processes contribute the most
   environmental burdens except eutrophication and terrestrial ecotoxicity
   which are dominated by agricultural fertilizer/seed utilization and
   harvesting. In order to mitigate the environmental impact of wheat straw
   pellet production, minimizing energy consumption and machinery burdens
   from the drying and pelletizing processes are the main intervention
   points for wheat straw densification. Fertilizer production and
   utilization are key variables in strategies to lower eutrophication and
   terrestrial ecotoxicity.}},

Abstract = {{A variational principle based on the calculation of the entropy
   production rate is derived, which covers particle, momentum and heat
   transport. This principle is used to define proper thermodynamical
   forces and fluxes. When turbulent parallel wavenumbers are small, and
   fluctuations are ballooned, it is found that the forces are the
   gradients of density, velocity and temperature normalized to canonical
   profiles, which are power laws of the magnetic field. The transport
   matrix is symmetrical for a given background of fluctuations, i.e. if
   the dependence of the turbulence intensity on gradients is ignored.
   Minimization of the entropy production rate implies that the profiles
   tend to relax towards their canonical values, though these values are
   never reached simultaneously since they are linearly stable. Also it
   turns out that parallel and perpendicular canonical temperatures are not
   the same, so that the equilibrium distribution function relaxes towards
   a two-temperature Maxwellian. When finite turbulence parallel
   wavenumbers are accounted for, residual fluxes appear. Forces can be
   redefined to preserve Onsager symmetry but residual heat and momentum
   sources remain, which correspond to turbulent heating and momentum
   transfer.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the algorithm and architecture of the decimal
   floating-point (DFP) logarithmic converter, based on the
   digit-recurrence algorithm with selection by rounding. The proposed
   approach can compute faithful DFP logarithm results for any one of the
   three DFP formats specified in the IEEE 754-2008 standard. In order to
   optimize the latency for the proposed design, we mainly integrate the
   following novel features: 1) using the redundant carry-save
   representation of the data path; 2) reducing the number of iterations by
   determining the number of initial iteration; and 3) retiming and
   balancing the delay of the proposed architecture. The proposed
   architecture is synthesized with STM 90-nm standard cell library and the
   results show that the critical path delay and the number of clock cycles
   of the proposed Decimal64 logarithmic converter are 1.55 ns (34.4 FO4)
   and 19, respectively, and the total hardware complexity is 43,572 NAND2
   gates. The delay estimation results of the proposed architecture show
   that its latency is close to that of the binary radix-16 logarithmic
   converter, and that it has a significant decrease on latency compared
   with a recently published high performance CORDIC implementation.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims at developing a generalized understanding of the
   sensitivity of soil moisture patterns in reconstructed watersheds, in
   northern Alberta, to changes in the projected precipitation in the
   twenty-first century. The GSDW model is applied to three watersheds
   using climate scenarios generated using daily precipitation and air
   temperature output from a global climate model (CGCM3), under A2 and B1
   emission scenarios, to simulate the corresponding soil moisture. CGCM3
   results indicate an increase in the mean annual temperature for Fort
   McMurray, Alberta of 3.3 (A2) and 2.4 degrees C (B1), and an increase in
   the predicted annual precipitation of 34\% (A2) and 8.6\% with A2 and B1
   emission scenarios, respectively. The GSDW model is used, along with
   onsite historical data, to downscale A2 and B1 emission scenarios and to
   evaluate the future hydrological performance of the designated
   watersheds with respect to soil moisture deficit and actual
   evapotranspiration using a probabilistic framework. The forecasted
   maximum soil moisture deficit values based on A2 and B1 emission
   scenarios are expected to decrease compared to those based on the
   current, largely because of the expected increase in precipitation
   rates, associated with an expected increase in evapotranspiration.

Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{We investigated the possible formation and segregation of oxygen
   vacancies near the surface of SnO2 thin films from oxygen K-edge x-ray
   emission and absorption spectra and found that the distribution of O 2p
   unoccupied states for ferromagnetic SnO2 thin films is different from
   that of postannealed SnO2 films under oxygen atmosphere showing
   diamagnetic behavior. This spectroscopic result suggests that oxygen
   vacancies can be the source of the surface-induced magnetism in SnO2
   thin films. This possibility was then explored by calculating the lowest
   energy levels of the structural defects (impurities or neutral
   vacancies) with two localized carriers near the surface of SnO2 film
   using a quantum-mechanical approach combined with the image charge
   method. A magnetic triplet state is found to be the ground state of
   those defects in the vicinity of the SnO2 surface, whereas the
   nonmagnetic singlet is the ground state of bulk SnO2. Surface-induced
   ferromagnetic order can appear at room temperature via 2D magnetic
   percolation once the vacancy concentration is greater than 3 x 10(16)
   m(-2).}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen-rich compounds hold promise as high-temperature superconductors
   under high pressures. Recent theoretical hydride structures on achieving
   high-pressure superconductivity are composed mainly of H-2 fragments.
   Through a systematic investigation of Ca hydrides with different
   hydrogen contents using particle-swam optimization structural search, we
   show that in the stoichiometry CaH6 a body-centered cubic structure with
   hydrogen that forms unusual ``sodalite{''} cages containing enclathrated
   Ca stabilizes above pressure 150 GPa. The stability of this structure is
   derived from the acceptance by two H-2 of electrons donated by Ca
   forming an ``H-4{''} unit as the building block in the construction of
   the three-dimensional sodalite cage. This unique structure has a partial
   occupation of the degenerated orbitals at the zone center. The resultant
   dynamic Jahn-Teller effect helps to enhance electron-phonon coupling and
   leads to superconductivity of CaH6. A superconducting critical
   temperature (T-c) of 220-235 K at 150 GPa obtained from the solution of
   the Eliashberg equations is the highest among all hydrides studied thus
   far.}},

Abstract = {{The macroscopic electromagnetic force on dielectric bodies and the
   related problem of the momentum conservation are discussed. It is argued
   that different forms of the momentum conservation and, respectively,
   different forms of the force density, correspond to the different
   ordering in the macroscopic averaging procedure. Different averaging
   procedures and averaging length scale assumptions result in expressions
   for the force density with vastly different force density profiles which
   can potentially be detected experimentally by measuring the profiles of
   the internal stresses in the medium. The expressions for the Helmholtz
   force is generalized for the dissipative case. It is shown that the net
   (integrated) force on the body in vacuum is the same for Lorentz and
   Helmholtz expressions in all configuration. The case of a semi-infinite
   medium is analyzed and it is shown that explicit assumptions on the
   boundary conditions at infinity remove ambiguity in the force on the
   semi-infinite dielectric.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{Experimental evidences are presented showing unusually large and highly
   anisotropic vibrations in the ``simple cubic'' (SC) unit cell adopted by
   calcium over a broad pressure ranging from 30-90 GPa and at temperature
   as low as 40 K. X-ray diffraction patterns show a preferential
   broadening of the (110) Bragg reflection indicating that the atomic
   displacements are not isotropic but restricted to the {[}110] plane. The
   unusual observation can be rationalized invoking a simple chemical
   perspective. As the result of pressure-induced s -> d transition, Ca
   atoms situated in the octahedral environment of the simple cubic
   structure are subjected to Jahn-Teller distortions. First-principles
   molecular dynamics calculations confirm this suggestion and show that
   the distortion is of dynamical nature as the cubic unit cell undergoes
   large amplitude tetragonal fluctuations. The present results show that,
   even under extreme compression, the atomic configuration is highly
   fluxional as it constantly changes.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a technoeconomic analysis of wheat straw
   densification in Canada's prairie province of Manitoba as an integral
   part of biomass-to-cellulosic-ethanol infrastructure. Costs of wheat
   straw bale and pellet transportation and densification are analysed,
   including densification plant profitability. Wheat straw collection
   radius increases nonlinearly with pellet plant capacity, from 9.2 to 37
   km for a 2-35 tonnes h(-1) plant. Bales are cheaper under 250 km, beyond
   which the cheapest feedstocks are pellets from the largest pellet plant
   that can be built to exploit economies of scale. Feedstocks account for
   the largest percentage of variable costs. Marginal and average cost
   curves suggest Manitoba could support a pellet plant up to 35 tonnes
   h(-1). Operating below capacity (75-50\%) significantly erodes a plant's
   net present value (NPV). Smaller plants require higher NPV break-even
   prices. Very large plants have considerable risk under low pellet prices
   and increased processing costs. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{Failures of structural materials under dynamic mechanical loading at
   high strain rates are commonly initiated by shear strain localisation
   along adiabatic shear bands, which act as preferential sites for crack
   initiation and propagation. We have used synchrotron based X-ray
   photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) to identify chemical elements
   and measure compositional contrast in the shear band in AISI 4340 steel.
   The high spatial resolution of XPEEM combined with near edge X-ray
   absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy is used to study the
   microstructural evolution in transformed shear bands that formed in
   quench hardened and tempered AISI 4340 steel under dynamic impact
   loading. We compared our XPEEM findings with other complementary
   techniques such as energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning
   electron microscopy to get a complete picture. As in the case of optical
   and scanning electron microscopy, XPEEM images show a featureless
   transformed band devoid of the martensite laths found in the parent
   metal. Interestingly, XPEEM images and corresponding Cr 2p -> 3d and Ni
   2p -> 3d NEXAFS spectra confirms a compositional contrast in the
   transformed shear band that resulted in more nickel inside the shear
   band than in the adjacent region.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of equalisation for communication channels with inter symbol
   interference (ISI) is investigated in this study. One practical yet
   challenging constraint for a channel with high transmission rate is
   incorporated into the modelling of the equalisation system: the
   communication channel is subject to uncertainties, which are assumed to
   be within a polytope with finite vertices. By using the augmentation
   method, the filtering error system of the equalisation problem is also
   characterised as a system with polytopic uncertainties. Sufficient
   conditions on the stability and the H-infinity performance for the
   filtering error system are obtained. A design method for the equaliser
   is proposed such that the filtering error system can achieve minimal
   H-infinity performance index even with the channel uncertainties. Two
   illustrative design examples demonstrate the design procedure and the
   effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization problems of beamforming in multiuser amplify-and-forward
   (AF) wireless relay networks are indefinite (nonconvex) quadratic
   programs, which require effective computational solutions. Solutions to
   these problems have often been obtained by relaxing the original
   problems to semi-definite programs (SDPs) of convex optimization. Most
   existing works have claimed that these relaxed SDPs actually provide the
   optimal beamforming solutions. This paper, however, shows that this is
   not the case in many practical scenarios where SDPs fail to provide even
   a feasible beamforming solution. To fill this gap, we develop in this
   paper a nonsmooth optimization algorithm, which provides the optimal
   solution at low computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Solute transport in clay-rich aquitards is characterized as molecular
   diffusion- or advection-dominated based on the Peclet number (P-e).
   However, few field-based measurements of the coefficient of molecular
   diffusion (D-e) exist, and none with a range of advection- or
   diffusion-dominated conditions in the same aquitard. In this long-term
   field experiment, standing water in a recovering well was spiked with
   deuterium (H-2), then water-level recovery and delta H-2 values were
   monitored as the well returned to static conditions over 1054 days.
   After a second 2H spike, water levels and delta H-2 values were
   monitored to day 1644 while under near static conditions. Modeling of
   the second spike was used to define the D-e of H-2 as (3-4) x 10(-10)
   m(2) s(-1) for an accessible porosity of 0.31. Reservoir concentrations
   from the initial spike were modeled to define the transition from
   advection- to diffusion-dominated transport. This occurred after 200
   days, consistent with a transition in P-e from < 1 to > 1 when the
   length term is taken as the radial extent of the tracer plume
   (normalized concentration <0.05). This study verifies plume extent as
   the characteristic length term in the calculation of P-e and
   demonstrates the transition from advection- to diffusion-dominated
   transport as the value of P-e decreases below unity. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   using a partitioning technique, a design method for the H-infinity

   spectroscopy. Results on mechanical property of all the scaffolds
   displayed no significant difference in the percentage elongation at

Abstract = {{The capability of the Multiphase Particle in Cell (MP-PIC) approach for
   modeling a bubbling fluidized bed of Geldart A particles has been
   investigated. Four different simulation cases, which include three
   different mesh sizes and two drag models with a realistic particle size
   distribution, have been designed and tested. Bubble properties have been
   extracted from the model predictions and compared with the predictions
   of empirical correlations as well as experimental data. The results show
   a promising predictive capability of the MP-PIC approach without the
   need to modify the drag force or other constitutive relationships in the
   model. This is in contrast to other studies by our group and others
   using the two-fluid model (TFM) approach. The use of the commercial code
   Barracuda to solve the MP-PIC system of equations limits our ability to
   understand the physical or numerical reasons behind this and therefore

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a laboratory testing program
   involving consolidated undrained triaxial tests and direct shear tests
   on remoulded peat, remoulded peat fibre, and Shelby specimens of peat
   obtained from a field site located in the Edson subdivision of the
   Canadian National railway in Alberta, Canada. These results were
   analyzed within the frameworks of elastic behaviour of cross-anisotropic
   materials and shear strength of fibre-reinforced soil. Shelby specimens
   were found to be inherently cross-anisotropic, whereas the remoulded
   peat and peat fibre specimens showed a transition from isotropic to
   cross-anisotropic with increasing vertical strain and effective
   confining pressure. The horizontal stiffness of Shelby specimens was
   found to be 2.6 to 2.9 times their vertical stiffness. The shear
   strength of intact peat is made up of interparticle friction as well as
   tension in the peat fibres. A novel procedure for estimating the
   interparticle frictional strength of fibrous peat from CU triaxial test
   results is proposed. It involves extrapolating the linear
   strain-hardening portion of the stress-strain curve to obtain the
   deviatoric stress at zero axial strain and plotting the deviatoric
   stress values thus obtained against initial mean effective confining
   pressure to obtain the frictional strength. Using this procedure, a
   value of 31 was obtained for the interparticle friction, which compares
   favourably with a value of 31 obtained from direct shear tests. It is
   recommended that further studies be undertaken to assess if
   interparticle frictional strength is an appropriate strength parameter
   for evaluation of the stability of structures founded on fibrous peat.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient method is presented to determine the mechanical properties
   of thick metal layers using the pull-in voltage of electrostatically
   actuated structures. To fabricate these high aspect ratio beams without
   severe deformations, additional features were added, which made existing
   pull-in voltage equations inaccurate and therefore corrections were
   necessary. ANSYS Multiphysics was used to analyze the differences
   between ideal beams and the fabricated beams. To demonstrate the
   proposed approach, both nickel and gold devices were fabricated. To
   extract the material property values, a sum of least squares fitting
   scheme was used. A Young's modulus of 186.2 and 60.8 GPa was obtained
   for nickel and gold structures respectively. Both values are
   significantly smaller than values reported for bulk material, but fall
   within the range of values reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of leachate recycling and bed mixing on the removal rate of

   effect of increasing elimination capacity (EC) up to 21 g S m(-3) bed
   h(-1) at recycling rates of 75 ml d(-1), but in the bed mixing period EC
   declined to 8 g S m(-3) bed h(-1). Pressure drop had a range of zero to
   18 mm H2O m(-1) in the course of leachate recycling. Accumulation of
   sulfur reduced removal efficiency and increased pressure drop up to 110
   mm H2O m(-1) filter during the bed mixing stage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In the present study, the accumulative roll bonding (ARB) process was
   used as a technique for manufacturing aluminium-alumina composites.
   Textural evolution during the ARB process of composites was evaluated
   using X-ray diffraction. After the first ARB cycle, copper \{112\}< 111
   > and brass \{011\}< 211 > were the major texture components. However,
   with the progress of deformation after 5 cycles, the components
   transformed completely, and the rotated cube \{001\}< 110 > component
   became dominant, which remained as the major component in higher cycles
   (ninth and thirteenth). This shear texture was developed due to the
   shear deformation induced by the high level of friction between the
   rolls and the strips. Generally, the intensity of all the texture
   components, except that of the rotated cube, was very weak. This result
   is attributed to the presence of second phase particles.}},

Title = {{A novel approach to probability distribution aggregation}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{188}},
Pages = {{269-275}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Today's business world is highly competitive and unpredictable, so
   effective decision-making is of primary importance. However, it is
   difficult to make effective decisions when sufficient information is not
   available, and decision-making in such situations involves a high risk
   of error. Conventional statistics based approaches to such problems are
   riot effective, because in such situations decision-making is usually in
   the hands of a small panel of experts. However, the expert opinions can
   be represented by probability distribution functions. Thus, such a
   problem reduces to the aggregation of a set of probability distribution
   functions to an aggregated or consensus distribution. In this paper, we
   propose a new approach to address this problem. The novelties of the
   proposed approach include: (1) the problem is formulated as an
   optimization problem and (2) the overlapping area between an individual
   expert's distribution and an aggregated distribution is taken to measure
   the expertise level of that expert and subsequently to determine the
   weight of the expert. The proposed approach in this paper is illustrated
   by an example reported in literature handled with the Delphi method,
   which also shows the effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{TiSBA-15 with high surface area and large pore diameter with variable
   Si/Ti molar ratios of 20, 40, and 80 were synthesized and used as
   supports for NiMo catalysts. TiSBA-15 supports and NiMo/TiSBA-15
   catalysts were extensively characterized by using XRD, N-2 adsorption
   analysis, FT-IR, Py-FTIR, Raman, TPR, SEM and TEM techniques. Results
   from XRD and IR measurements confirm the hexagonally ordered mesoporous
   structure and incorporation of Ti into the framework of SBA-15 support,
   respectively. TPR analysis confirmed that Ti incorporation resulted in
   better dispersion and more homogeneous distribution of octahedral Ni and
   Mo species on the support compared to NiMo/SBA-15. Hydrotreating
   experiments were conducted using coker light gas oil (KLGO) under
   industrial conditions of temperature, pressure, LHSV, and gas to oil
   ratio of 330-370 degrees C, 8.8 MPa, 2 h(-1), and 600 mL/mL,
   respectively. NiMo/TiSBA-15 catalysts showed very high catalytic
   activities of hydrodesulfurization and hydrodenitrogenation of KLGO than
   the NiMo catalysts prepared by using SBA-15 and gamma-Al2O3 as support.

Abstract = {{Mesostructured alumino-silcate (MAS) materials were synthesized from
   ZSM-5 nano-clusters and used as catalysts supports for the
   hydrotreatment of a model compound and real feed stock. Supports and
   catalysts were thoroughly characterized by using XRD, N-2 adsorption
   analysis, FT-IR, Al-27 MAS NMR, Raman, EXAFS and HRTEM techniques. The
   alumino-silicate materials exhibited different acid strength and
   textural properties depending on the duration of hydrothermal treatment
   of the zeolite seeds. Materials synthesized with low seeding time of 4 h
   showed properties similar to Al-SBA-15 prepared using the direct
   synthesis route, whereas material with high seeding time (t(seed) = 24
   h) resembled ZSM-5. The EXAFS study of the sulfided catalysts revealed
   that sulfidation was highest in the NiMo catalyst supported on
   mesoporous alumino-silicate synthesized from ZSM-5 seeds with 16 h of
   hydrothermal treatment (MAS-16). Hydrotreating experiments were
   conducted using model compound (DBT) at 325 degrees C and 600 psi as
   well as real feed stock (Coker light gas oil) at industrial conditions.
   Catalytic activity in the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of dibenzothiophene
   (DBT) was found to be maximum for this particular catalyst (MAS-16). The
   same catalyst also gave higher hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and
   hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) conversion than Nimo/gamma Al2O3 in the
   hydrotreating of Light Gas Oil. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We study the extremal rotating spacetimes with a NUT twist in the
   context of recently proposed Kerr/CFT correspondence. The Kerr/CFT
   correspondence states that the near-horizon states of an extremal four
   (or higher) dimensional Hack hole could be identified with a certain
   chiral conformal field theory. The corresponding Virasoro algebra is
   generated with a class of diffeomorphism which preserves an appropriate
   boundary condition on the near-horizon geometry. We combine the
   calculated central charges with the expected form of the temperature,
   using the Cardy formula to obtain the microscopically entropy of the
   extremal rotating spacetimes with a NUT twist. All results are in
   agreement with the macroscopic entropy of the extremal spacetimes.}},

Title = {{Instanton effect in QCD sum rules for the 0(++) hybrid}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 12}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we study instanton contributions to the correlator of the
   hybrid current g (q) over bar sigma(mu nu)G(nu mu mu)(a)T(q)(a). These
   contributions are then included in a QCD sum-rule analysis of the
   isoscalar 0(++) hybrid mass. We find a mass at 1.83 GeV for the ((u)
   over bar ug + (d) over bar dg)/root 2 p hybrid. However, for the (s)
   over bar sg hybrid, we find the sum rules are unstable. We also study
   nonzero width effects, which affect the mass prediction. The mixing
   effects between these two states are studied and we find QCD sum rules
   support the existence of a flavor singlet hybrid with mass at around 1.9
   GeV. Finally, we study the mixing effects between hybrid and glueball
   currents. The mixing between the ((u) over bar ug + (d) over bar
   dg)/root 2((s) over bar sg) and the glueball causes two states, one in
   the region 1.4-1.8 GeV (1.4-2.2 GeV), and the other in the range 1.8-2.2

Abstract = {{Cobalt oxalate hydrate micro/nano structures have been successfully
   obtained using ultrasonic irradiation. The as-prepared Cobalt oxalate
   hydrate structures were calcinated at different temperatures to convert
   them into Co3O4 rods. XRD, Thermo gravimetric analysis and FTIR
   spectroscopy were used to confirm the chemical composition and the phase
   purity. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals the formation of
   Co3O4 microrod structure with aggregated nanoparticles which later get
   transformed in to nanospheres having a diameter of about similar to 100
   nm at a higher calcination temperatures. Thus two different
   nanostructures have been obtained and this provoked the interest to
   apply them to sensitivity measurements as they would differ in their
   surface areas, which forms the basic essentiality for semiconducting
   metal oxide gas sensors. BET analysis has been taken to study the
   surface area and its effect on sensitivity has been discussed for both
   the rods and nanospheres. The nanorods with larger surface area were
   found to exhibit the highest sensitivity towards acetone.}},

Abstract = {{The utilization of Unified power flow controller (UPFC) can result in
   significant reliability benefits in modern power systems. This paper
   proposes a novel reliability network model for a UPFC, which
   incorporates the logical structure and the distinct operating modes of a
   UPFC. The proposed model divides the UPFC operating modes into seven
   states, in order to improve the accuracy of the model by recognizing the
   practical operating states of a UPFC. The new model also incorporates an
   AC flow-based optimal load shedding approach to assess the impact of bus
   voltages and reactive power flow on UPFC in order to decide appropriate
   load curtailment in the reliability evaluation process. The performance
   of the proposed model is verified using a test system. Various operating
   schemes, such as different placement locations of UPFC, and different
   capacities of UPFC are used to examine the impacts of UPFC on the system
   reliability. Copyright (C) 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights

Abstract = {{Fracturing and fault reactivation induced by pore pressure change during
   fluid production or injection may threaten the hydraulic integrity of
   hydrocarbon reservoirs and CO2 storage projects. This paper uses
   probabilistic analysis to investigate the possibility of these risks.
   Ehselby's theory of inhomogeneities is used to develop closed-form
   solutions for determination of poroelastic induced stress change as a
   result of pressure change within reservoirs with idealized geometry.
   This solution is used with a Coulomb failure criterion to determine
   critical pressure changes required for induced fracturing and fault
   reactivation within the reservoir and in the surrounding rock.
   Uncertainties in the input data are addressed by implementing the
   probabilistic analysis within the framework of a Monte Carlo simulation.
   The developed approach is applied to study the potential for fracturing
   and fault reactivation induced by pressure changes due to historical oil
   production and planned acid gas injection operations, respectively, in a
   pinnacle reef. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the influence of nickel incorporation on the mechanical
   properties and the in vitro bioactivity of hydrogenated carbon thin
   films were investigated in detail. Amorphous hydrogenated carbon (a-C :
   H) and nickel-incorporated hydrogenated carbon (Ni/a-C : H) thin films
   were deposited onto the Si substrates by using reactive biased target
   ion beam deposition technique. The films' chemical composition, surface
   roughness, microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated by
   using XPS, AFM, TEM, nanoindentation and nanoscratch test, respectively.
   XPS results have shown that the film surface is mainly composed of
   nickel, nickel oxide and nickel hydroxide, whereas at the core is nickel
   carbide (Ni3C) only. The presence of Ni3C has increased the sp(2) carbon
   content and as a result, the mechanical hardness of the film was
   decreased. However, Ni/a-C : H films shows very low friction coefficient
   with higher scratch-resistance behavior than that of pure a-C : H film.
   In addition, in vitro bioactivity study has confirmed that it is
   possible to grow dense bone-like apatite layer on Ni/a-C : H films.
   Thus, the results have indicated the suitability of the films for
   bone-related implant coating applications. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley

   incorporation of tungsten led to increase the formation of C-sp(2)

Abstract = {{Accounting for light that is diffusely scattered from a surface is one
   of the practical challenges in reflectance measurement. Integrating
   spheres are commonly used for this purpose in point measurements of

   measurements are desired. In this paper, an imaging spectrophotometer
   design is presented that employs a uniform light source to provide
   diffuse illumination. This creates the inverse measurement geometry to
   the directional illumination/diffuse reflectance mode typically used for
   point measurements. The final system had a spectral range between 400
   and 1000 nm with a 5.2 nm resolution, a field of view of approximately
   0.5 m by 0.5 m, and millimeter spatial resolution. Testing results

Title = {{Selective Response of Mesoporous Silicon to Adsorbants with Nitro Groups}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that the electronic structure of mesoporous silicon is
   affected by adsorption of nitro-based explosive molecules in a
   compound-selective manner. This selective response is demonstrated by
   probing the adsorption of two nitro-based molecular explosives
   (trinitrotoluene and cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine) and a nonexplosive
   nitro-based aromatic molecule (nitrotoluene) on mesoporous silicon using
   soft X-ray spectroscopy. The Si atoms strongly interact with adsorbed
   molecules to form Si-O and Si-N bonds, as evident from the large shifts
   in emission energy present in the Si L2,3 X-ray emission spectroscopy
   (XES) measurements. Furthermore, we find that the energy gap (band gap)
   of mesoporous silicon changes depending on the adsorbant, as estimated
   from the Si L2,3 XES and 2p X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
   measurements. Our ab initio molecular dynamics calculations of model
   compounds suggest that these changes are due to spontaneous breaking of
   the nitro groups upon contacting surface Si atoms. This
   compound-selective change in electronic structure may provide a powerful
   tool for the detection and identification of trace quantities of
   airborne explosive molecules.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the accumulative roll bonding (ARB) process was used for
   manufacturing nanostructured aluminum/15 vol.\% alumina composites.
   Microstructural characterization by transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM) identified the severe shear deformation, however, the grain growth
   was restrained by particles of oxide film and recrystallization produced
   the nanograins with an average size <100 nm after the 13th cycle of
   composite strip. The findings also indicated that the presence of large
   particles and deformation structure in the vicinity of the particles
   made the particle stimulated nucleation (PSN) of recrystallization
   possible. The Williamson-Hall method was used to calculate the grain
   size from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, which were 150 nm for
   pure aluminum and 63 nm for aluminum/alumina composite after 13 cycles
   of the ARB process. The findings also revealed that after the first
   cycle, hardness rapidly increased, then dwindled, and finally reached
   saturation as the number of ARB cycles increased. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

   comparison of commonly used and novel electronic techniques for
   evaluating cattle temperament. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 92: 21-31. The
   temperament of steers (n = 28) was assessed using five quantitative
   techniques including: flight time, flight distance, electronic
   (strain-gauge and accelerometer) tests, and three visual scores (VS)
   made during entry, restraint and exit from a squeeze chute. The
   objective of this study was to determine the most important predictive
   parameters based on those measurements and evaluate the relationship
   between the techniques. Flight time and distance were correlated with
   exit VS (r = -0.51, and 0.41, P < 0.05; n = 56), but were not related to
   restraint VS. Data from strain-gauge and accelerometer sensors were used
   to generate parameters such as peak response and area under the curve
   that were correlated with all three VS. Regression models using VS as
   the dependent variable and a combination of 2 to 5 parameters from the
   strain-gauge and accelerometer tests as independent variables predicted
   temperament with values of 29 to 65 or 41 to 57\%, respectively. When
   all techniques, excluding VS, were used as independent variables, model
   accuracy increased to 72, 81 and 77\% for restraint, exit and the sum of
   all VS, respectively. These findings suggest the objective measures of
   temperament assessed in this study could be used to identify highly
   reactive animals.}},

Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{An important potential benefit of a jurisdiction developing an
   upper-level traffic safety policy statement, such as a strategic highway
   safety plan (SHSP) or a traffic safety action plan, is the creation of a
   manageable number of focus areas, known as emphasis areas. The
   responsible agencies in the jurisdiction can then direct their finite
   resources in a systematic and strategic way designed to maximize the
   effort to reduce the number and severity of roadway collisions. In the
   United States, the federal government through AASHTO has suggested 22
   potential emphasis areas. In Canada, CCMTA's 10 potential emphasis areas
   have been listed for consideration. This study reviewed the SHSP and
   traffic safety action plan of 53 jurisdictions in North America, and
   conducted descriptive data analyses to clarify the issues that currently
   affect the selection and prioritization process of jurisdiction-specific
   emphasis areas. We found that the current process relies heavily on
   high-level collision data analysis and communication among the SHSP
   stakeholders, but may not be the most efficient and effective way of
   selecting and prioritizing the emphasis areas and allocating safety
   improvement resources. This study then formulated a formal collision
   diagnosis test, known as the beta-binomial test, to clarify and
   illuminate the selection and the prioritization of jurisdiction-specific
   emphasis areas. We developed numerical examples to demonstrate how
   engineers can apply the proposed diagnosis test to improve the selection
   and prioritization of individual jurisdictions' emphasis areas. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Pore pressures within saturated subsurface formations respond to stress
   changes due to loading as well as to changes in pore pressure at the
   boundaries of the formation. The pore-pressure dynamics within a thick
   aquitard in response to water table fluctuations and mechanical loading
   due to soil moisture changes have been simulated using a coupled
   stress-strain and groundwater flow finite element formulation. This
   modelling approach isolates the component of pore-pressure response of
   soil moisture loading from that caused by water table fluctuations, by
   using a method of superposition. In this manner, the contributions to
   pore-pressure fluctuations that occur as a result of surface moisture
   loading (e. g., precipitation, evapotranspiration) can be isolated from
   the pore-pressure record. The required elastic stress-strain properties
   of the aquitard were obtained from the measured pore-pressure response
   to barometric pressure changes. Subsequently, the numerical simulations
   could be calibrated to the measured response by adjusting only the
   hydraulic conductivity. This paper highlights the significance of
   moisture loading effects in pore-pressure observations and describes an
   efficient technique for obtaining in situ stress-strain and hydraulic
   properties of near-surface aquitards.}},

Abstract = {{When Saccharomyces cerevisiae was cultivated under similar to 200 g
   glucose/l condition, the time point at which glucose was completely
   utilized coincided with the moment at which the slope of a redox
   potential profile changed from negative or zero to positive. Based on
   this feature, a redox potential-driven glucose-feeding fermentation
   operation was developed, and resulted in a self-cycling period of 14.25
   +/- 0.4 h. The corresponding ethanol concentration was maintained at
   88.4 +/- 1.0 g/I with complete glucose conversion, and the cell
   viabilities increased from 80\% in the transition period to 97.2 +/-
   1.1\%, implying the occurrence of yeast acclimatization. In contrast, a
   pre-determined 36-h manually adjusted period was chosen to oscillate
   yeast cells under similar to 250 gglucose/l conditions, which resulted
   in 106.76 +/- 0.7 g ethanol/l and 15.19 +/- 1.3 g glucose/I remaining at
   the end of each cycle. Compared to the equivalent batch and continuous
   ethanol fermentation processes, the annual ethanol productivity of the
   reported fermentation operation is 2.4\% and 13.2\% greater,
   respectively in similar to 200g feeding glucose/I conditions. (C) 2011

   establishment of the relationship between electronic structure and

   found to be dominant in the ferromagnetic film, while after being
   annealed at 400 degrees C for 1 h, Mn atoms diffuse out of the ZnO
   lattice and accumulate in Mn-related secondary phases with high valence
   (+3 and/or +4) Mn ions. The formation of the secondary phases is
   correlated with the suppressed ferromagnetism (FM). The present results

Title = {{Evaluation of heterotrophic nitrite removal by a sulphide and acetate

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Shortcut biological nitrogen removal (SBNR) has attracted
   much attention in recent years due to lower aeration and chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) requirements, shorter residence time and smaller biomass
   production. In this work an oil reservoir denitrifying culture, with the
   ability to function under autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions was
   used for heterotrophic denitritation. Using freely suspended cells,
   effects of nitrite concentration (10-50 mmol L-1) and temperature (15-35
   degrees C) on the kinetics of denitritation were investigated and a
   kinetic model was developed. Potential for enhancement of nitrite
   removal rate, and impacts of nitrite concentration and loading rate were
   investigated in a continuous biofilm reactor.
   RESULTS: Nitrite did not impose any inhibitory effect, even at the
   highest applied concentration of 50 mmol L-1. Increase of temperature in
   the range 15-35 degrees C enhanced the reduction rate significantly.
   Fitting the experimental data into the model developed, values of
   biokinetic coefficients (mu(max-NO2), KS-NO2, YX-NO2, YX-Ace-NO2 and E
   mu-(NO2)) were determined. In the biofilm reactor increases in nitrite
   loading rate (through flow rate or feed nitrite concentration) led to a
   linear increase of nitrite removal rate, with the highest removal rate
   of 140.6 mmol L-1 h(-1) achieved with a residence time of 0.19 h.
   CONCLUSION: The enrichment culture used in this study is not only a
   superior biocatalyst for simultaneous removal of sulphide, nitrate and
   BOD, it could also be used effectively in the denitritation step of an
   SBNR process. The kinetic model developed would certainly have
   beneficial applications in the design, operation and control of the SBNR
   process. (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication of keratincollagen (KC) 3D scaffold with improved thermal
   denaturation rate is reported. In vitro application of (KC) scaffold
   stimulates basic extra cellular matrix constituents. KC Scaffold
   considerably reduced undesirable properties of both collagen and keratin
   while collagen incorporation reduces the fragility with increases of
   strength and flexibility in the scaffold. In addition to this, the
   scaffold showed homogenous well-interconnected pores in the range of
   10-100 mu m when observed in scanning electron microscope. Usage of
   keratin in KC scaffold offers increased biodegradation rate and higher
   denaturation rate in addition to its rapid cell growth with normal
   morphology ultimately reaching cell population of 3.9-9.7 million per
   cm3 after 48hr in KC scaffold. Circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier
   transform spectroscopy (FT-IR) of KC showed presence of helical
   structure of collagen and beta-turns of keratin confirming retention of
   native structures of both the proteins KC scaffold showed good swelling
   behavior and water uptake. Our study strongly supports the superidity of
   KC scaffold over the collagen or keratin when they are independently
   used for tissue engineering applications. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel technique integrating bulk-sensitive and
   surface-sensitive XANES methods to distinguish between physisorption and
   chemisorption for phosphate adsorption onto ferrihydrite-modified
   diatomite (FHMD). XANES P K-edge, L-edge, and Fe M-edge spectra were
   obtained for reference samples (K2HPO4 and FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O) and
   test samples (phosphate adsorbed onto FHMD (FHMD-Ps) and Sicontaining
   ferrihydrite (FHYD-Ps)). A resolvable pre-edge peak in the P K-edge
   spectra of FHMD-Ps and FHYD-Ps provided direct evidence for the
   formation of P-O-Fe(III) coordination and the occurrence of
   chemisorption. The resemblance between the P L-edge spectra of K2HPO4
   and FHMD-Ps and the marked difference between the spectra of FHMD-Ps and
   FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O indicated the intact existence of the adsorbate
   and the adsorbent. The similarity between Fe M-edge spectra of FHMD and
   FHMD-Ps and the difference between the spectra of FHMD-Ps and FePO4
   center dot 2H(2)O confirmed the findings from P Ledge analyses.
   Therefore, chemisorption and physisorption coexisted during phosphate
   adsorption onto FHMD. Phosphate chemisorption occurred in the deeper
   zone of FHMD (from 50 nm to 5 pm): whereas physisorption occurred in the
   zone of FHMD shallower than 50 nm since the probing depth of XANES P
   Kedge method is 51.1m and that of P L-edge and Fe M-edge methods is 50
   nm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The overwhelming growth in the struggle between economy and ecology has
   led managerial research to promote methodologies to reap profits
   ensuring sustainability of the ecosystem thus venturing into the novel
   domain incorporating sustainability with supply chain management and
   coordination. In this paper, we look for a synergetic alliance between
   the environmental and commercial benefits by establishing coordination
   between I he producer and the retailer to adjudicate their strategies to
   trigger green practices with the focus on maximizing economic profits by
   leveraging upon the product's greenness. A two player game has been
   developed to stand synonymous to the situation considered. Special
   considerations have been devised to augment the analysis with the
   consumer psychology towards the green products to establish a practical
   outlook involving the greenness and economic returns. Evolutionary
   dynamics has been adopted extensively to locate the optimal and the most
   stable point offering the best economic gains. The economically suitable
   solutions are then substantiated on an existing sustainability metric
   and hence we aim to offer a holistic view into supply chain dynamics
   from the perspective of environmental management. The insights drawn
   provide managerial implications and advantages of having environment as
   a key focus along with business motives. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Measured and calculated K-fluorescence effects on the MTF of an
   amorphous-selenium based CCD x-ray detector}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{608-622}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Theoretical reasoning suggests that direct conversion digital
   x-ray detectors based upon photoconductive amorphous-selenium (a-Se)
   could attain very high values of the MTF (modulation transfer function)
   at spatial frequencies well beyond 20 cycles mm(-1). One of the
   fundamental factors affecting resolution loss, particularly at x-ray
   energies just above the K-edge of selenium (12.66 keV), is the
   K-fluorescence reabsorption mechanism, wherein energy can be deposited
   in the detector at locations laterally displaced from the initial x-ray
   interaction site. This paper compares measured MTF changes above and
   below the Se K-edge of a CCD based a-Se x-ray detector with theoretical
   expectations.
   Methods: A prototype 25 mu m sampling pitch (Nyquist frequency = 20
   cycles mm(-1), 200 mu m thick a-Se layer based x-ray detector, utilizing
   a specialized CCD readout device (200 x 400 area array), was used to
   make edge images with monochromatic x-rays above and below the K-edge of
   Se. A vacuum double crystal monochromator, exposed to polychromatic
   x-rays from a synchrotron, formed the monochromatic x-ray source. The
   monochromaticity of the x-rays was 99\% or better. The presampling MTF
   was determined using the slanted edge method. The theory modeling the
   MTF performance of the detector includes the basic x-ray interaction
   physics in the a-Se layer as well as effects related to the operation of
   the CCD and charge trapping at a blocking layer present at the CCD/a-Se
   interface.
   Results: The MTF performance of the prototype a-Se CCD was reduced from
   the theoretical value prescribed by the basic Se x-ray interaction
   physics, principally by the presence of a blocking layer. Nevertheless,
   the K-fluorescence reduction in the MTF was observed, approximately as
   predicted by theory. For the CCD prototype detector, at five cycles
   mm(-1), there was a 14\% reduction of the MTF, from a value of 0.7 below
   the K-edge of Se, to 0.6 just above the K-edge.
   Conclusions: The MTF of an a-Se x-ray detector has been measured using
   monochromatic x-rays above and below the K-edge of selenium. The MTF is
   poorer above the K-edge by an amount consistent with theoretical
   expectations. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Abstract = {{Power allocations in an interference-limited wireless network for global
   maximization of the weighted sum throughput or global optimization of
   the minimum weighted rate among network links are not only important but
   also very hard optimization problems due to their nonconvexity nature.
   Recently developed methods are either unable to locate the global
   optimal solutions or prohibitively complex for practical applications.
   This paper exploits the d.c. (difference of two convex functions/sets)
   structure of either the objective function or constraints of these
   global optimization problems to develop efficient iterative algorithms
   with very low complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that the
   developed algorithms are able to locate the global optimal solutions by
   only a few iterations and they are superior to the previously-proposed
   methods in both performance and computation complexity.}},

Abstract = {{MeV electron irradiation via high voltage electron microscopy can lead
   to amorphous-to-crystal transition (i.e., crystallization) as well as
   crystal-to-amorphous transition (i.e., solid-state amorphization).
   Irradiation-induced crystallization can be observed in various alloy
   systems such as Co-, Fe-, Ni-, Pd-, and Zr-based metallic glasses,
   indicating that this phenomenon has wide generality in metallic
   materials. Irradiation-induced crystallization mechanism was discussed
   based on the following factors; (1) an increase in free energy for an
   amorphous phase, (2) the formation of crystalline clusters through
   modification of the atomic configuration near radiation induced defects,
   and (3) enhanced diffusion. The stability of an amorphous phase against
   irradiation-induced crystallization can be estimated from the thermal
   crystallization temperature (T-x), and Ni-Nb based metallic glasses have
   a tendency for high stability against irradiation because of high T-x.

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Square hollow tubes with T-joint connections subjected to out-of-plane
   loading conditions are examined numerically. Finite element analysis
   (FEA) using 2D shell and 3D solid elements of relatively high density
   are used to determine the stresses in the joint and the joint's
   stiffness. The parameters describing the joint's stress concentration
   and the bending stiffness reduction are defined in terms of the
   thin-wall ratio (the ratio of side length to thickness of the tubes'
   cross-section) and the length of the longitudinal member and the
   geometric asymmetry of the T-joint connection. These parameters permit
   modelling accurately the tubes and the T-connection by simple one
   dimensional beam elements with certain modifications. The FEA of beam
   elements are significantly easier to prepare and analyze. To illustrate
   the correctness of the approach, a structure with a T-connection and
   dimensions typical for the agricultural industry is considered. It is
   shown that the modified beam models provide accurately all important
   information of the structural analysis (i.e. the stresses,
   displacements, reaction forces, and the natural frequencies) at
   substantially reduced computational effort in comparison with the
   complicated FE models built of shell or solid elements. This can be
   considered the main contribution of this research paper. Using a
   simplified FE analysis for design has always been attractive to
   practicing engineers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling the performance characteristics of thermal systems has been a
   research interest for many decades with moisture transfer systems
   experiencing a resurgence over the last decade, especially in heating,
   ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) applications. In this study, a
   neural network (NN) model is developed to predict the heat and moisture
   transfer performances (i.e., the sensible and latent effectivenesses) of
   a novel HVAC energy exchanger called the Run-Around Membrane Energy
   Exchanger (RAMEE) which is able to transfer both heat and moisture
   between exhaust and supply air streams. The training data set for the NN
   model covers a wide range of design and operating parameters and is
   produced using an experimentally validated finite difference (FD) model.
   Two separate NNs (one for sensible and one for latent energy transfer)
   each with five inputs and one output, are selected to represent the
   RAMEE. The results from NN models are numerically and experimentally
   validated. The root mean squared error (RMSE) between the FD and NN
   models are 0.05 degrees C and 2 x 10(-5) kg(v)/kg(a), indicating
   satisfactory agreement for energy exchange calculations. The paper
   reports the weights and biases to make the results of this study
   reproducible. These NN models are very fast and easy to use therefore,
   they might be used for design and for estimating the annual energy
   savings in different buildings which use the RAMEE in their HVAC system.
   Additionally, the NN models can be used with optimization algorithms to
   maximize energy savings and minimize life-cycle costs for a given
   system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rotary cell culture systems (RCCS) have been shown to be promising for

   cells were constructed by encapsulating the cells in the
   collagen-alginate hydrogel, and then cultured in a RCCS to investigate
   the proliferation of MCF-7 cells. The results from the MTT assay showed
   that the proliferation rate of MCF-7 cells cultured in the RCCS was
   higher than that of the static culture control group, and the results
   from the flow cytometry revealed that the cells in S and G2/M phase were
   significantly increased compared to the control group. The expression of
   cell proliferation antigen PCNA and cyclin D1 was also examined with the
   results further supporting the enhanced proliferation of MCF-7 cells by
   the RCCS. The results from indirect immunofluorescence revealed that the
   rotary culture altered neither the cytoskeleton distribution nor the
   assembly of mitotic spindle. By examination, it was also shown that the

Title = {{A New Method for Dynamic Modeling of Flexible-Link Flexible-Joint
   Manipulators}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},

Abstract = {{In this article, by combining the assumed mode shape method and the
   Lagrange's equations, a new and efficient method is introduced to obtain
   a closed-form finite dimensional dynamic model for planar Flexible-link
   Flexible-joint Manipulators (FFs). To derive the dynamic model, this new
   method separates (disassembles) a FF into two subsystems. The first
   subsystem is the counterpart of the FF but without joints' flexibilities
   and rotors' mass moment of inertias; this subsystem is referred to as a
   Flexible-link Rigid-joint manipulator (FR). The second subsystem has the
   joints' flexibilities and rotors' mass moment of inertias, which are
   excluded from the FR; this subsystem is called Flexible-Inertia entities
   (FI). While the method proposed here employs the Lagrange's equations,
   it neither requires the derivation of the lengthy Lagrangian function
   nor its complex derivative calculations. This new method only requires
   the Lagrangain function evaluation and its derivative calculations for a
   Single Flexible link manipulator on a Moving base (SFM). By using the
   dynamic model of a SFM and the Lagrange multipliers, the dynamic model
   of the FR is first obtained in terms of the dependent generalized
   coordinates. This dynamic model is then projected into the tangent space
   of the constraint manifold by the use of the natural orthogonal
   complement of the Jacobian constraint matrix. Therefore, the dynamic
   model of the FR is obtained in terms of the independent generalized
   coordinates and without the Lagrange multipliers. Finally, the joints'
   flexibilities and rotors' mass moment of inertias, which are included in
   the FI, are added to the dynamic model of the FR and a closed-form
   dynamic model for the FF is derived. To verify this new method, the
   results of simulation examples, which are obtained from the proposed
   method, are compared with those of a full-nonlinear finite element
   analysis, where the comparisons indicate sound agreement {[}DOI:

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{The existence of interdependence among environmental variables has been
   qualitatively known for centuries. Recent studies have shown that copula
   modelling can provide a simple, yet powerful framework for modelling
   interdependence among hydrological data; however, still there are
   several studies which use outdated and superficial methods to perform
   this task. By considering the current state of knowledge, this study
   tries to introduce a pragmatic procedure to perform copula modelling in
   real-world problems. Our study uses copula modelling to find a notion
   for conditional quantities of the maximum annual water deficit with
   respect to the annual cumulative evapotranspiration. Therefore, by
   having an estimate for the annual cumulative evapotranspiration, the
   hydrological performance of the reconstructed watershed can be assessed
   even in nearby ungauged reconstructed watersheds with similar physical
   characteristics and reclamation strategy. Several competitive models are
   developed for joint description of these variables in a prototype
   reclaimed oil-sands mining site in northern Alberta, Canada. The
   developed joint models are compared and analyzed according to their
   convergence feasibility, overall accuracy, tail behaviour and a
   goodness-of-fit test. Our study concludes that copula modelling can be
   considered as a powerful option in practitioners' toolkit. For the case
   under consideration, the Gumbel-Houguaard structure provides the most
   credible model of dependence. Moreover, our study provides some initial
   supports for the application of minimum distance methods for copula
   parameter estimation.}},

Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles have received attention as novel antimicrobial
   agents. In order to study the effects of silver nanoparticles on both
   Gram positive and negative bacteria, the nanoparticles were synthesized
   via chemical reduction method using different concentrations (0.3, 0.6
   and 0.9 mM) of poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) and TritonX-100 (TX). Also,
   mixed PEG/TX systems with equimolar concentrations capped silver
   nanoparticles were synthesized and confirmed by UV-vis, fluorescence
   spectroscopy and particle size analysis. These coated silver
   nanoparticles were incorporated into collagen, lyophilized to form
   scaffolds and characterized by SEM, XRD, ATR-FTIR, DSC, TGA and zeta
   potential. Results on mechanical property of all the scaffolds displayed
   no significant difference in the percentage elongation at break.
   However, the maximum percentage of 46.67\% was observed with the
   combinations (0.9 mM PEG + 0.9 mM TX). This implies that the
   combinations of surfactants increase the elasticity, which is useful for
   biomedical applications, e.g., heart-valve preparations. Furthermore,
   the antimicrobial activities of these capped silver nanoparticles
   homogenized with collagen were tested against both Gram positive and
   negative bacteria. Minimum inhibitory concentration values obtained for
   the combination (0.9 mM PEG + 0.9 mM TX) were found to be better than
   others and thus provide strong antibacterial property to the collagen
   scaffolds prepared for tissue regeneration applications. (C) 2011

Journal = {{FUEL}},

Volume = {{92}},

Pages = {{369-372}},

Abstract = {{A major drawback of renewable gasification technologies is contamination
   of the syngas produced with ``tar{''}, which can induce fouling in
   downstream equipment. The effect of continuous injection of acetylene
   and hydrogen high-temperature flames into the blend of gases containing
   a tar model compound toluene in order to decompose the latter has been
   studied. The experimental results indicate that treatment of the
   reaction mixture with the acetylene and hydrogen oxy-flames promotes
   reforming of toluene into H(2) and CO. The same heating values of the
   flames result in different ratios between H(2) and CO; this points out
   on a difference in mechanism of that reforming implying an interaction
   between toluene and combustion products which include a large specter of
   intermediate species (radicals). A better understanding of these
   mechanisms will help to obtain an optimal ratio between external
   oxy-flame and internal combustion regularly employed to increase the
   temperature of the producer gas in order to decompose volatile organics
   and tars in it. Utilization of oxy-flames for high-temperature clean-up
   of producer gas (gasification products) is very similar to the
   application of plasma steam tested with positive results in
   semi-industrial gasification units. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published

Abstract = {{Generation of process waters contaminated by naphthenic acids is a
   serious environmental concern associated with processing of the oil
   sands. This together with the necessity for sustainable use of water
   highlights the need for development of effective technologies such as
   bioremediation for treatment of these contaminated waters. In this work,
   a circulating packed bed bioreactor and a culture developed in our
   laboratory were used to study batch and continuous biodegradation of
   trans-4-methylcyclohexane carboxylic acid (trans-4MCHCA), a mixture of
   cis- and trans-4-methyl-cyclohexane acetic acid (4-MCHAA), and mixture
   of these three naphthenic acids. Experimental results revealed that the
   biodegradability of the naphthenic acids was influenced by both carbon
   number and the spatial arrangement of the alkyl side branch. The maximum
   biodegradation rate of trans-4MCHCA observed during the continuous
   operation (209 mg/Lh at a residence time of 0.15 h) was significantly
   higher than those reported for CSTR and packed-bed bioreactors. The
   biodegradation rates of cis- and trans-4-MCHAA were much lower than
   trans-4MCHCA, with the maximum biodegradation rates determined for the
   two isomers being 4.2 and 7.8 mg/Lh, respectively (residence time: 3.3

Abstract = {{Under high pressure, simple molecular solids transform into nonmolecular
   (extended) solids as compression energies approach the energies of
   strong covalent bonds in constituent chemical species. Unlike molecular
   and extended phase transitions, these exhibit path dependent phases,
   phase boundaries, phase metastabilities, and structural distortions that
   lead to large uncertainties in both experimental and theoretical phase
   diagrams. Here we present experimental and theoretical evidence that
   carbon dioxide polymerizes to extended phase V at 20 GPa, indicating a
   substantially lower equilibrium phase boundary than previously
   suggested. Clearly, these results indicate extended structures are
   inherently more stable above 20 GPa and the presence of a strong
   activation barrier hindering the polymerization in the intermediate
   pressure region between 20 and 40 GPa. Further, the present results
   advocate a chemistry view of molecular to nonmolecular phase transitions
   governed by constraints to kinetics and local energy minima that go
   beyond thermodynamics and are analogous to the graphite-diamond
   transition.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the design problem of PID controllers for
   networked control systems (NCSs) with polyhedral uncertainties. The load
   disturbance and measurement noise are both taken into account in the
   modeling to better reflect the practical scenario. By using a novel
   technique, the design problem of PID controllers is converted into a
   design problem of output feedback controllers. Our goal of this paper is
   two-fold: (1) To design the robust PID tracking controllers for
   practical models; (2) To develop the robust H-infinity PID control such
   that load and reference disturbances can be attenuated with a prescribed
   level. Sufficient conditions are derived by employing advanced
   techniques for achieving delay dependence. The proposed controller can
   be readily designed based on iterative suboptimal algorithms. Finally,
   four examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed
   methods. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The first Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) program in North America was recently
   implemented in Ontario, Canada to stimulate the generation of
   electricity from renewable sources. The life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions and economics of electricity generation through anaerobic
   digestion (AD) of household source-separated organic waste (HSSOW) are
   investigated within the FiT program. AD can potentially provide
   considerable GHG emission reductions (up to 1 t CO(2)eq/t HSSOW) at
   relatively low to moderate cost (-\$35 to 160/t CO(2)eq) by displacing
   fossil electricity and preventing the emission of landfill gas. It is a
   cost-effective GHG mitigation option compared to some other FiT
   technologies (e.g., wind, solar :photovoltaic) and provides unique
   additional benefits (waste diversion, nutrient recycling). The
   combination of electricity sales at a premium rate, savings in waste
   management costs, and economies of scale allow AD facilities processing
   >30,000 t/yr to be cost-competitive against landfilling. However, the
   FIT does not sufficiently support smaller-scale facilities that are
   needed as a transition to larger, more economically viable facilities.
   Refocusing of the FiT program and waste policies are needed to support
   the adoption of AD of HSSOW, which has not yet been developed in the
   Province, while more costly technologies (e.g., photovoltaic) have been
   deployed.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafine grained (UFG) commercially pure titanium was fabricated by 8
   successive passes of equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) via route
   B-C. The deformed structure was studied by transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). The material was then annealed at a range of
   temperature (450-600 degrees C) for up to 6h. The microstructure
   evolution and the grain growth behaviour were investigated by electron
   back scattered diffraction (EBSD) technique. The UFG titanium was found
   to be thermally stable up to 450 degrees C. Based on the experimental
   results, the grain growth kinetics was characterized by calculating the
   grain growth activation energy (Q) and the time exponent (n). The value
   of Q was found to be close to the self diffusion activation energy of
   titanium, while n was found to be lower than the time exponent reported
   for grain growth in coarse grained pure titanium. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The effects of strain rates, microstructure and geometry on the
   occurrence of adiabatic shear bands in AISI 1340 steel during impact
   loading were investigated. Cylindrical and cuboidal specimens of the
   steel were heat treated to have microstructure consisting of tempered
   martensite, ferrite + martensite (dual-phase) or ferrite + pearlite.
   Depending on the applied impact momentum, both deformed and transformed
   shear bands were observed in the specimens with martensitic and
   dual-phase structures. Deformed bands first formed and then
   metamorphosed into transformed bands as the intensity of localized shear
   strain increased. The tendency for formation of a transformed band is
   higher in the martensitic steel specimens. Within the range of the
   applied impact momentum of between 30 and 42 kg m/s, which generated
   strain-rates of between 630 and 3400/s, only deformed bands were
   observed in the normalized steel specimens containing ferrite and
   pearlite. The width of these deformed bands increased as the applied
   impact momentum was raised. Whereas circular shear bands were observed
   on the transverse section of the impacted cylindrical specimens, the
   shape of shear bands in the same section of the cuboidal specimens was
   rectangular. The hardness of the shear bands, which was measured to be
   higher than that of the bulk material, increased as the impact momentum
   was raised. Fractographic study of fractured specimens showed ductile
   shear failure and knobby fracture modes along the transformed bands. (C)

Abstract = {{Light intensity manipulation is an important management tool affecting
   broiler behaviour and physiology but still there is a debate regarding
   the optimum level to be used in confinement barns. Two experiments were
   completed to study the impact of light intensity (1, 10, 20 and 40 lx)
   on behaviour and diurnal rhythms of broilers raised to 35d of age. For
   each experiment, 950 Ross x Ross 308 chicks were housed per room with
   replication of individual light intensity treatment in two
   environmentally controlled rooms. Within each large room, a small pen
   with 25 male and 25 female chicks was used for recording behaviour. Data
   were analyzed as a randomized complete block design with experiment
   acting as a block. All chicks were provided with 40 lx intensity and 23
   h light until shifting to treatment light intensity and 17 h daylength
   at 7d of age. For each replicate, behaviour was recorded for a 24h
   period, starting at 16 or 17d of age. At 23d of age, three birds per
   room were bled at the start, middle and end of light and dark periods
   for melatonin estimation using RIA. When summarized over the 24 and 17h
   observation periods, birds exposed to a light intensity of 1 lx rested
   more (P = 0.01) and preened (P < 0.05) and foraged (P < 0.05) less in
   comparison to other light intensities. Birds from all treatments
   exhibited diurnal rhythms for feeding, resting, drinking, walking,
   standing, foraging and preening behaviours with little or no activity
   during the 7 h dark phase. The serum melatonin levels at the start,
   middle and end of light and dark phases were unaffected by light
   intensity (P > 0.1). In conclusion, light intensity ranges from 1 to 40
   lx did not affect melatonin levels or behavioural diurnal rhythms, but
   birds exposed to a light intensity of 1 lx rested more and preened less,
   potentially indicating a reduced welfare state. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Natural 12CaO center dot 7Al(2)O(3) (C12A7) is a wide band gap
   insulator, but conductivity can be realized by introducing oxygen
   deficiency. Currently, there are two competing models explaining
   conductivity in oxygen-deficient C12A7, one involving the electron
   transfer via a ``cage conduction band{''} inside the nominal band gap,
   the other involving electron hopping along framework lattice sites. To
   help resolve this debate, we probe insulating and conducting C12A7 with
   x-ray emission, x-ray absorption, and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy,
   which provide a full picture of both the valence and conduction band
   edges in these materials. These measurements suggest the existence of a
   narrow conduction band between the main conduction and valence bands
   common in both conducting and insulating C12A7 and support the theory
   that free electrons in oxygen-deficient C12A7 occupy the low-energy
   states of this narrow band. Our measurements are corroborated with
   density functional theory calculations.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first results from the NCAR
   thermosphere/ionosphere/electrodynamics general circulation model
   (TIE-GCM) coupled to a weather forecast/assimilation system of the lower
   and middle atmosphere. Our results emphasize the importance of a proper
   representation of the latitudinal temperature variation at the base of
   the thermosphere for calculating zonal mean zonal winds in the
   thermosphere. The inclusion of a realistic cold summer mesopause yields
   significantly improved agreement with climatology in the calculated
   thermospheric winds in the summer hemisphere. Having established this
   link between the temperature structure of the mesosphere and the
   thermospheric circulation, we next present observational evidence that
   the year-to-year variability of thermospheric winds can be linked to
   analogous variations in the onset of the cold summer mesopause season.
   Since these mesopause variations have previously been ascribed to
   stratospheric weather variability, by extension, our results suggest a
   new mode of coupling between the stratosphere and thermosphere.

Abstract = {{Bone strain is the governing stimuli for the remodeling process
   necessary in the maintenance of bone's structure and mechanical
   strength. Strain gages are the gold standard and workhorses of human
   bone experimental strain analysis in vivo. The objective of this
   systematic literature review is to provide an overview for direct in
   vivo human bone strain measurement studies and place the strain results
   within context of current theories of bone remodeling (i.e. mechanostat
   theory). We employed a standardized search strategy without imposing any
   time restriction to find English language studies indexed in PubMed and
   Web of Science databases that measured human bone strain in vivo.
   Twenty-four studies met our final inclusion criteria. Seven human bones
   were subjected to strain measurements in vivo including medial tibia,
   second metatarsal, calcaneus, proximal femur, distal radius, lamina of
   vertebra and dental alveolar. Peak strain magnitude recorded was 9096 mu
   epsilon on the medial tibia during basketball rebounding and the peak
   strain rate magnitude was -85,500 mu epsilon/s recorded at the distal
   radius during forward fall from standing, landing on extended hands. The
   tibia was the most exposed site for in vivo strain measurements due to
   accessibility and being a common pathologic site of stress fracture in
   the lower extremity. This systematic review revealed that most of the
   strains measured in vivo in different bones were generally within the
   physiological loading zone defined by the mechanostat theory, which
   implies stimulation of functional adaptation necessary to maintain bone
   mechanical integrity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{During the service life of firefighters' protective clothing, individual
   aspects of its performance change due to factors such as thermal
   exposure. Although there are some standards for the inspection of
   firefighters' protective clothing, test methods that could be used to
   completely determine the level of damage and the remaining service life
   of such clothing have not yet been developed. In order to develop these
   test methods, it is necessary to understand how individual aspects of
   the performance of protective clothing deteriorate after exposure to
   fireground conditions. In this project, specimens consisting of an outer
   shell, a moisture barrier, and a thermal liner were thermally aged and
   tested using 20 kW/m(2) exposures in a cone calorimeter. Two different
   outer shell fabrics, one undyed (light brown in color) and one dyed
   (black), were tested. Changes in the tensile strength of the outer shell
   resulting from single and multiple exposures were measured. Changes in
   the color of the outer shell were also measured using digital image
   analysis. The study demonstrates that multiple exposures to this heat
   flux level were less destructive than a single exposure of the same
   total duration. Color measurements showed good potential as a possible
   non-destructive means of evaluating the condition of the outer shell
   fabric, as these color measurements could be correlated to the loss in
   tensile strength of the outer shell. Possible future work to evaluate
   other aspects of the performance of these materials is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The flow around a surface-mounted square prism of finite height was
   investigated experimentally using a low-speed wind tunnel. Of interest
   were the effects of aspect ratio and incidence angle on the mean
   aerodynamic forces and vortex shedding. Compared to the case of the
   ``infinite{''} (or two-dimensional) square prism, the flow around the
   finite square prism has not been extensively studied. The experiments
   were conducted at a Reynolds number of Re = 7.2x10(4) for aspect ratios
   of AR = 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 and incidence angles of alpha = 0 degrees, 15
   degrees, 30 degrees and 45 degrees. The thickness of the boundary layer
   on the ground plane relative to the side length was (delta/D = 1.5.
   Measurements of the vortex shedding frequency were made with a
   single-component hot-wire probe in the wake, and measurements of the
   mean drag and lift forces were obtained with a force balance.
   For all aspect ratios and incidence angles, the Strouhal number and the
   mean drag coefficient were lower than those of an infinite prism, while
   the mean lift coefficient was of nearly similar magnitude. As the aspect
   ratio was increased from AR = 3 to 11, the force coefficients and
   Strouhal number slowly approached the infinite-square-prism data. The
   behaviours of the mean drag coefficient and Strouhal number with
   incidence angle were less sensitive compared to the case of the infinite
   square prism, although a minimum mean drag coefficient, minimum (most
   negative) mean lift coefficient, and maximum Strouhal number were found
   at alpha = 15 degrees. The reduced sensitivity to incidence angle is
   attributed to the complex three-dimensional flow over the free end of
   the prism and the downwash flow that enters the near wake. The behaviour
   of the force coefficients and Strouhal number for the prism of AR = 3
   was distinct from the other prisms (with lower values of drag
   coefficient and lift coefficient magnitude, and a different Strouhal
   number trend), suggesting the critical aspect ratio was between AR = 5
   and AR = 3 in these experiments. In the wall-normal direction, the power
   spectra for AR = 11 and 9 tended to have weaker and/or more broad-banded
   vortex shedding peaks near the ground plane and near the free end at
   alpha = 0 degrees and 15 degrees. For AR = 7 to 3, well-defined vortex
   shedding peaks were detected along the entire height of the prisms. For
   AR = 11 and 9, at alpha = 30 degrees and 45 degrees, vortex shedding
   peaks were absent in the power spectra in the upper part of the wake.}},

Abstract = {{The flow around surface-mounted finite-height bluff bodies is more
   complex than the flow around a two-dimensional or ``infinite{''}
   cylinder. The flow over the free end and the boundary layer flow around
   the body-wall junction strongly influence the near-wake flow pattern.
   Streamwise tip vortex structures interact in a complex manner with
   Karman vortex shedding from the sides of the body, and are responsible
   for a downward-directed local velocity field in the upper part of the
   wake known as ``downwash.{''} A second pair of streamwise vortex
   structures, known as the base vortices, is found close to the ground
   plane. Upstream of the body the familiar horseshoe vortex is found. The
   interactions between the tip vortices, base vortices, and Karman vortex
   shedding are strongly influenced by the aspect ratio, AR = H/D (for
   height, H, and width, D), the Reynolds number, Re, and the relative
   thickness of the boundary layer, delta/D.
   The flow above the free ends of surface-mounted finite-height circular
   cylinders and square prisms was studied in a low-speed wind tunnel using
   particle image velocimetry (Ply). Cylinders and prisms of AR = 9, 7, 5,
   and 3 were tested at Re = 4.2x10(4). The bodies were mounted normal to a
   ground plane and were partially immersed in a turbulent flat-plate
   boundary layer with delta/D = 1.7. PIV measurements were made above the
   free ends in three vertical planes at different cross-stream locations
   (y/D = 0, 0.25, and 0.375). The ensemble-averaged streamlines,
   turbulence intensity and Reynolds shear stress fields were obtained in
   these planes.
   The PIV results provide insight into the separated flow above the free
   ends, including the effects of AR and body shape. For the finite square
   prism, the large, separated, recirculating flow region extends into the
   near-wake. For the finite circular cylinder, this region is smaller and
   the separated flow reattaches onto the free-end surface. For the square
   prism of AR = 3, considerable difference is seen in the free-end flow
   pattern compared to the more slender prisms of AR = 9, 7 and 5. In
   particular, a cross-stream vortex is formed due to interaction between
   the separated flow from the leading edge of the prism and the reverse
   flow over the free end. This vortex is seen in all three planes for AR =
   3 but only in the symmetry plane for AR = 9, while for the finite
   circular cylinder the flow pattern above the free end seems to be the
   same in all three planes for all aspect ratios, consisting of a
   cross-stream vortex at approximately x/D = 0.}},

Abstract = {{Connecting different Intellectual Property (IP) cores with Network on
   Chip (NoC) router using Network Interface (NI) is a challenging task due
   to its asynchronous nature and data width. In this paper, a generic
   high-speed Network Interface for Network on Chip using Ping Pong Buffers
   is proposed in order to ensure the seamless high throughput between the
   router and processing core. The proposed scheme uses simple control
   logic to handle the read and write operations simultaneously in the
   memory modules. This proposed method is analyzed with the existing
   Asynchronous First in First Out (FIFO) based NIs with different encoding
   schemes like One-Hot encoding and Johnson encoding. The optimal depth of
   the asynchronous FIFOs is calculated based on router frequency,
   processing element frequency, packet size and flit size at router and
   processing element using Practical Extraction and Report Language (PERL)
   and the required Register Transfer Level (RTL) Verilog Hardware
   Description Language (HDL) and timing constrain is created by Perl
   scripting itself. The NI is implemented using the asynchronous FIFOs and
   ping pong - double buffering scheme using Altera Stratix III FPGA. The
   synthesis results show that the proposed architecture enhances the speed
   of NI by 30 \% when memory depth is 8 and enhances speed by 11\% when
   memory depth is 256.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an all-weather remote sensing
   technology and occupies a great position in disaster observation and
   geological mapping. The main challenge for SAR processing is the huge

   the utilization of SAR, especially for real-time applications. On the
   other hand, recent developments in Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
   technology, which obtain general processing capability, high parallel

   method for computationally intensive applications. This work proposes a
   parallel implementation of SAR imaging on GPU via Compute Unified Device

Abstract = {{Improvements of the Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC) point
   multiplication processor is presented in this paper. The main
   contributions of this paper are the improved finite field multiplier,
   which uses a 2-stage Karatsuba-Ofman multiplier architecture.
   Furthermore, a revised algorithm is proposed for the projective to
   affine coordinate conversion, which computes 2 inversion operations
   simultaneously with the numerator portion, in order to make better use
   of parallel cores implemented in the ECC processor.
   The design is implemented on a Virtex 4 XC4VLX80 FPGA and the
   implementation results show that the ECC processor can compute a point
   multiplication in 6.72 us. This time is the fastest to the authors' best
   knowledge. Thus, the ECC processor proposed in this paper is suitable
   for applications where high-throughput is required, such as network
   servers.}},

Abstract = {{A temporal planning algorithm that is implemented on a wheeled mobile
   robot is presented. This algorithm has two parts: the first part is
   developed to control the motion of the mobile robot, and the second part
   is designed to control a 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOE) arm attached to the
   robot. In most robotic applications, it is necessary for the mobile
   robot to plan and follow a desired path. It may also be necessary for
   the robot to follow a given velocity profile, which is known as temporal
   planning. The advantage of temporal planning method in this paper is in
   its simplicity and its computational efficiency. A rudimentary
   trajectory is first created by assigning an arbitrary time to each
   segment of the path. This trajectory is made feasible by applying a
   number of constraints and using a linear scaling technique. When a
   velocity profile is given, a nonlinear time scaling technique is used to
   fit the mobile robot's linear velocity to the given velocity profile. A
   method for avoiding moving obstacles is also implemented. Simulation and
   experimental results showed good agreement with each other. A novelty of
   this paper is in developing and implementing a new method for control of
   a 6-DOF arm attached to the mobile robot. Two methods have been proposed
   and tested for position control of the robot arm; i) linear end-effector
   increment (LEI), and ii) linear joints increment (LJI). It is shown that
   LEI is more precise than LJI in trajectory tracking of robot arm;
   however, the singularity of Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) transformations
   matrix limits the application of this method for specific trajectories.
   The LJI is developed to avoid the singularity in DH transformation
   matrix. The experimental results for four different paths show the
   effectiveness of the LH approach. The successful experimental results of
   path and temporal planning of a wheeled mobile robot and motion control
   of its industrial arm is reported.}},

Abstract = {{Peptide identification is a critical step to understand the proteome in
   cells and tissue. Typically, high-throughput peptide spectra generated
   in the MSIMS procedure are searched against real protein sequences by
   peptide matching. Although a number of automated algorithms have been
   developed to help identifying those high quality of peptide spectrum
   matches (PSMs), lack of trustworthy target PSMs remains an open problem.
   In this paper, we design the FC-Ranker algorithm to calculate the score
   of each target PSM. A nonnegative weight is assigned to each target PSM
   to indicate its likelihood of being correct. Particularly, we proposed a
   fuzzy SVM classification model and a fuzzy silhouette index for
   iteratively updating the scores of target PSMs. Furthermore, FC-Ranker
   provides a framework for tackling the problem of uncertainty of target
   PSMs, and it can be easily adjusted to adapt new datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable channel estimation is necessary for orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems employing coherent
   detection to achieve high data rates. Pilot-aided detection algorithms
   benefit from rapid convergence, but suffer from non-efficient bandwidth
   usage. The idea of superimposed data transmission can be enabled for
   channel estimation without sacrificing the data rate. In this paper, we
   first derive the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) for channel
   impulse response and then, we propose an iterative joint channel
   estimator and data detector to improve the performance of both the
   estimator and the detector. Furthermore, we derive the variance of the
   proposed estimator and show that the equispace and equipower conditions
   hold for the superimposed pilots to attain the minimum variance of the
   estimator. Simulations show that the performance with perfect knowledge
   of the channel impulse response can be achieved closely by the proposed
   iterative data detector.}},

Abstract = {{Two designs of un-uniformed constellations for wireless relay networks
   are considered. The first design is concerned with the unequal error
   protection issue, in which two data streams to be transmitted from a
   source to a destination are protected at two different levels. Based on
   a simple approximation of the average bit-error-rate (BER), a design
   parameter is obtained in a closed form. The second design focuses on
   minimizing the average BER of the combined data stream at the
   destination. Developed are two near optimal designs for 4/16-QAM and
   4/64-QAM hierarchical modulation schemes. Simulation results confirm the
   superiority of the proposed designs as well as the advantages of the
   relay-assisted transmission with a hierarchical modulation over the
   conventional point-to-point transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive Radio is an application in which Spectrum utilization can be
   improved by allowing secondary users to use the spectrum when it is not
   used by licensed primary users. An adaptive OFDM system for Cognitive
   radio has the ability to nullify unnecessary individual carriers and
   avoid interference to licensed primary users. A Fast Fourier Transform
   (FFT) block forms the core of OFDM design. But, the zero valued inputs
   outnumber the non-zero valued inputs in the FFT block making the
   standard FFT algorithms computationally inefficient due to wasted
   operation on zero values. To overcome this problem, several pruning
   algorithms have been developed. But many of them are architecturally
   inefficient for FPGA implementation due to complexity of the overhead
   operations. Moreover, these algorithms are not suitable for applications
   like Cognitive radio which has zero inputs in arbitrary distributions
   making hardware implementation to be complex. This paper presents a
   novel and efficient dynamically partial reconfigurable (DPR) Transform
   Decomposition (TD) FFT and Radix 2 based IFFT pruning for OFDM based
   Cognitive Radio on FPGA. Tested FPGA results on XC2VP30 for the DPR
   method show the configuration time improvement, good area and power

Abstract = {{Multiplication, as one of the four basic operations embedded in
   arithmetic processors, is nowadays experiencing being spotlighted by the
   hardware designers involved in the revived decimal arithmetic. The
   decimal hardware units usually employ the sequential implementation for
   this operation, due to the high area cost of the parallel decimal
   multipliers. However, the main drawback of this iterative method is in
   regard to its high latency. This paper, with the intention of
   ameliorating this problem, proposes a high-frequency sequential decimal
   multiplier. The cycle time of the proposed multiplier is determined by a
   decimal carry-save adder which is about 22\% less than that of the
   fastest previous design.}},

Abstract = {{Motor plays an important role in the dynamic property of the
   rotary-screw-driven dispensing system. Dynamic model of the motor was
   developed and validated in this paper. The output angle displacement and
   input voltage were measured from photoelectric digital encoder which is
   used to measure the angle displacement of the motor. In order to realize
   data smooth processing, Alpha-Beta filter was used. Discrete model of
   the motor was developed based on the Least Square Method and Model
   Selection criterion. Computational studies show that the system is
   equivalent to second order system. Moreover, the model was validated
   based on the experiment results under the different applied pressure and
   angular speed of motor. It is revealed that there is a good fit between
   experiment data and model simulation.}},

Pages = {{121-126}},
Abstract = {{Challenges in finding high-quality sources of natural aggregate have led
   Saskatchewan, Canada, road agencies to explore alternative solutions to
   meet aggregate demands. The use of recycled materials, such as recycled
   portland cement concrete (PCC), though traditionally limited to
   low-quality applications such as subbase or backfill materials, shows
   promise as a technically viable solution that also offers economic and
   environmental advantages. In this study, mechanistic material testing
   was used to examine the effects of cement stabilization on traditional
   granular base and on two impact-crushed recycled PCC materials from
   different locations. The unstabilized PCC materials had substantially
   better mechanistic material properties than the unstabilized
   conventional granular base material; this result indicates that PCC
   materials could be suitable for use in high-quality applications, such
   as base course layers, rather than being limited to use in low-quality
   applications, such as utility and embankment fills. This study also
   showed that cement stabilization substantially improved the mechanistic
   properties of conventional granular base material, yet had a much less
   pronounced effect on the material properties of the PCC materials. This
   result may be attributable to poor absorption of the cement by the PCC
   or a lack of rehydration of the PCC. There was minimal variability in
   the mechanical behavior of the PCC specimens despite a difference in
   stockpile location. Both types of PCC material were processed and
   crushed with the same technique and equipment.}},

Abstract = {{The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a new and promising modality for
   biometric recognition. This signal is typically collected within welfare
   monitoring environments along with other vital signals. As opposed to
   static biometric modalities like the iris or the fingerprints, ECG is
   time-dependent thereby presenting the opportunity of continuously
   authenticating subjects in such environments. However, ECG is affected
   by both physical and psychological activities, which have to be taken
   into consideration for successful deployment of this biometric. This
   paper demonstrates the effects of psychology on the performance of ECG

   spectral efficiency can be upgraded within the orthogonal transmission
   of each source node to an assigned subset of all available relays while
   their information throughput can be improved through optimized power
   allocation. We consider the joint optimization in both relay assignment
   for each source-destination pair and power allocation, which is in fact
   among the hardest problems in optimization. This is the minimization of
   a nonconvex objective function subject to mixed integer constraints. The
   existing numerical algorithms could rarely address to its solutions
   through computationally affordable procedures. Even the conventional
   relaxation of the integer constraints by linear constraints does not
   lead to convex optimization, so the standard convexification does not
   work either. Nevertheless, we show that it can be effectively solved in
   the d.c. (difference of two convex) programming context. Numerical
   simulation confirms the effectiveness of our setting.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a driver-automation system for providing brake
   assistance to the driver using the concepts of various levels of
   intervention. The system offers potential for further development and
   integration into main stream cars using by-wire technology, both from
   passenger safety and system usability perspectives. The criticality of
   the situation of a potential crash is estimated using a Bayesian
   framework from literature which considers not only the vehicle's
   situational need for braking but also the driver's intent to apply
   brakes. The novel idea of our work is a well-defined dictionary for
   critical zone segmentation is incorporated into the system to decide the
   appropriate intervention level by the automation system for each
   situation, and appropriate assistance is provided to the driver, in
   terms of not only communicating auditory messages to the driver but also
   applying automatic brakes if need be to shift the criticality from a
   high/very high to a low zone. The second idea of our work is the
   feedback control of the amount of automatic braking necessary to be
   applied by the system. Results from sample runs of simulated testing of
   the system have been reported and future scope of work towards
   improvement is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In a companion paper published elsewhere {[}1], we proposed a design
   approach based on the general redundancy concept to improve the dynamic
   performance of a mechanism, especially shaking moment and driving
   torque, while fulfilling the required task. The approach was based on a
   partial redundancy function of the servomotor, so the approach is called
   partial redundancy servomotor (PRSM). In this paper, we apply the PRSM
   to the path generator problem in robot design, in particular closed-loop
   multi-degrees of freedom robots or mechanisms. We demonstrate how the
   path generator design problem is solved and dynamic performance is
   improved in an integrated manner with the PRSM approach and how
   mechanism design and robot design are combined to design a better path
   generator. The contribution of this paper is the proposed PRSM design
   procedure. The other contribution is an integrated mechanism design and
   robot design approach that has implication to other general design
   problems such as function generator and posture generator.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, performance requirements aimed at making synchronized
   phasor measurement solutions interoperable focused on the equipment
   performance during a steady state, perfectly balanced operation of the
   power system. Performance requirements during transients were
   specifically excluded, and left to equipment manufacturers to optimize
   as needed. On the other hand, many applications identified to benefit
   from the availability of synchrophasor measurements are in the realm of
   transient disturbances. Building on recent developments in operational
   high speed communications systems used by electric power utilities, the
   paper proposes a holistic approach to provisioning and managing data
   acquisition solutions capable of providing actionable quality
   information regarding voltage and current measurements at remote
   locations during transient events. The paper also proposes that a
   standard frequency measurement technique could solve challenges caused
   by frequency deviations in phasor measurement systems.}},

Abstract = {{The state of the art video standard H.264/AVC is very popular worldwide
   for its efficient coding techniques. But recently the ITU-T Video Coding
   Experts Group (VCEG) and ISO/IEC Moving Picture Expert Group (MPEG) have
   been jointly developing the next generation video standard, called High
   Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) which is expected to be more efficient in
   coding video. In this paper, we present a shared architecture which can
   compute the 8x8 Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) of the HEVC
   from that of the H.264/AVC using a new mapping technique. The hardware
   share approach ensures the maximum circuits reuse during the
   computation. The architecture is designed with only adders and shifters
   to reduce the hardware cost significantly. The design is implemented on
   FPGA and later synthesized in CMOS 0.18um technology. The results show
   that the proposed design has the maximum decoding capability of 67fps
   for 1080p full HD video.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a low power, high linearity wideband cascode low
   noise amplifier (LNA) targeting the GSM/LTE standards and RFID reader
   applications. The common source (CS) stage is considered to be the
   dominated nonlinearity source for cascode LNA and the modified
   derivative superposition (MDS) technology is adopted to improve the
   linearity of this stage. However, with the operating frequency
   increases, the nonlinearity influence coming from the common gate (CG)
   stage increases also. The nonlinearity effect of the CG stage on the
   cascode amplifier is investigated and an improving method is proposed.
   This design combines the MDS technique with the proposed method to
   increase gain and linearity while maintaining a low NF of the LNA. The
   proposed LNA is implemented in the IBM 0.13um CMOS technology. The NF is
   1.4/2.0/2.1dB at 700/900/950 MHz bands, respectively. The LNA has a

Abstract = {{Computed Tomograhpy (CT) is a technology that takes projection data
   along a trajectory and reconstructs an image of the objects. But it
   exposes patients to significant radiation. Therefore, lower radiation
   dose has been constantly pursued. The amount of radiation dose is a
   function of the number of projections. However, in traditional
   reconstruction algorithms, for example, filtered back projection (FBP)
   method, the number of projections must satisfy the Shannon/Nyquist
   sampling theorem so as to avoid streaking artifacts. In this paper, we
   apply compressed sensing for CT reconstruction. The algorithm minimizes
   the l(1) of the wavelet transform coefficient and total variantion of
   the image. It employs FBP to calculate the intermediate results of
   derivative of the object function in each compressed sensing iteration.
   Our simulation experiments show that this method can reconstruct CT
   images from substantially fewer number of projections than the
   requirement of Shannon/Nyquist limit. Hence the associated radiation
   dose can be reduced without noticeable aliasing artifacts and streaking
   artifacts.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies on the migration strategies to enable the realization of
   various visions of Smart Grids (SGs) from the existing legacy power
   systems are on the anvil. A subjective treatment of `reliability' as
   encountered in the several existing working definitions on SGs leaves
   much to be desired. Only a quantification of envisioned reliability
   benefits and impacts can justify the rationale for embracing the SG
   philosophy that relies on anticipated improvement in power system
   reliability as one of its foundations. Identifying the scope and means
   to extend/revamp traditional reliability studies in light of the
   increasing functional interdependencies brought on by inter disciplinary
   technologies is a key beginning step. Towards this goal, the paper puts
   forward an architectural composition of SGs from a reliability
   perspective. Based on this, a qualitative discussion is initiated to
   identify the foreseeable challenges in quantitative reliability
   estimation. There is also an imminent need to evolve an integrated
   framework that can accommodate realistic reliability appraisals that
   will be useful in decision making processes. A proposal for a potential
   framework that can be expanded upon in due course of time for a
   comprehensive reliability evaluation of SGs is then outlined.}},

Abstract = {{In the presence of turbulence, magnetic field lines lose their dynamical
   identity and particles entrained on field lines diffuse through space at
   a rate determined by the amplitude of the turbulence. In previous work
   (Lazarian and Vishniac, 1999; Kowal et al., 2009; Eyink et al., 2011) we
   showed that this leads to reconnection speeds which are independent of
   resistivity. In particular, in Kowal et al. (2009) we showed that
   numerical simulations were consistent with the predictions of this
   model. Here we examine the structure of the current sheet in simulations
   of turbulent reconnection. Laminar flows consistent with the
   Sweet-Parker reconnection model produce very thin and well ordered
   currents sheets. On the other hand, the simulations of Kowal et al.
   (2009) show a strongly disordered state even for relatively low levels
   of turbulence. Comparing data cubes with and without reconnection, we
   find that large scale field reversals are the cumulative effect of many
   individual eddies, each of which has magnetic properties which are not
   very different from turbulent eddies in a homogeneous background. This
   implies that the properties of stationary and homogeneous MHD turbulence
   are a reasonable guide to understanding turbulence during large scale
   magnetic reconnection events. In addition, dissipation and high energy
   particle acceleration during reconnection events take place over a
   macroscopic volume, rather than being confined to a narrow zone whose
   properties depend on microscopic transport coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{The Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System (OSIRIS) on the
   Odin satellite is currently in its 12th year of observing the Earth's
   limb. For the first time, continuous temperature profiles extending from
   the stratopause to the upper mesosphere have been derived from OSIRIS
   measurements of Rayleigh-scattered sunlight. Through most of the
   mesosphere, OSIRIS temperatures are in good agreement with coincident
   temperature profiles derived from other satellite and ground-based
   measurements. In the altitude region of 55-80 km, OSIRIS temperatures
   are typically within 4-5 K of those from the SABER, ACE-FTS, and SOFIE
   instruments on the TIMED, SciSat-I, and AIM satellites, respectively.
   The mean differences between individual OSIRIS profiles and those of the
   other satellite instruments are typically within the combined
   uncertainties and previously reported biases. OSIRIS temperatures are
   typically within 2 K of those from the University of Western Ontario's
   Purple Crow Lidar in the altitude region of 52-79 km, where the mean
   differences are within combined uncertainties. Near 84 km, OSIRIS
   temperatures exhibit a cold bias of 10-15 K, which is due to a cold bias
   in OSIRIS O-2 A-band temperatures at 85 km, the upper boundary of the
   Rayleigh-scatter derived temperatures; and near 48 km OSIRIS
   temperatures exhibit a cold bias of 5-15 K, which is likely due to
   multiple-scatter effects that are not taken into account in the
   retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{Hysteresis is an important nonlinear effect exhibited by the
   piezoelectric actuators (PEA) and its control has been drawing
   considerable attention. This paper presents the development of a novel
   control scheme for the PEA, by integrating the inversion feedforward
   control and proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-based sliding mode
   control (SMC). The resultant scheme allows for the compensation for the
   nonlinear hysteresis, meanwhile eliminating the chattering problem and
   achieving the zero steady state error. To verify its effectiveness,
   experiments were performed on a commercially-available PEA, as compared
   to the use of PID-based SMC alone. It shows that by integrating the
   inversion feedforward control, the hysteresis of the piezoelectric
   actuator can be compensated more effectively and thus a better tracking
   performance can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{The assumed mode shape method has been widely used to derive finite
   degree-of-freedom dynamic models for flexible-link manipulators, which
   theoretically have infinite degree-of-freedom dynamics. For a single
   flexible manipulator, this approximation changes locations of the zeros
   of transfer functions between base torque and end-effector displacement.
   The change in locations of zeros considerably affects accuracy of the
   model and therefore the performance of model-based controllers. This
   article presents a comprehensive study on the change in locations of
   zeros due to the truncation associated with assumed mode shape method.
   It is shown that the locations of approximate zeros depend on four
   non-dimensional parameters, whereas the locations of analytical zeros
   depend on only two non-dimensional parameters. Approximate zeros are
   obtained from assumed mode shape method models, whereas analytical zeros
   are derived from infinite order models. A thorough study of the
   differences between approximate zeros and analytical zeros versus the
   number of mode shapes as well as all the physical parameters is
   performed. Moreover, guidelines are provided to select the numbers of
   mode shapes such that the approximate zeros become close to the
   analytical zeros. These guidelines can easily be used by control and
   modeling engineers, making them valuable for modeling and control of
   flexible robot manipulators.}},

Abstract = {{The colonoscope is an important tool in the diagnosis and management of
   diseases of the colon; yet its design has not changed appreciably since
   it was first introduced to clinical practice 40 years ago. One of the
   ongoing challenges with this device is that the natural shape of the
   colon predisposes to loop formation by the scope during the examination.
   The result of this looping is that further insertion of the scope
   results in a larger loop size without any advancement of the tip of the
   scope. Looping thus causes pain in the patient, risks perforation of the
   colon, and results in incomplete examinations. In this article, loop
   formation is analyzed in terms of frictional force state and Kirchhoff's
   slender rod model in order to better understand the generic principle of
   loop formation. Next, a mathematical model of deformation of the colon
   with respect to external manipulation involving a number of variables
   involved in loop formation is constructed. Finally, a model of the
   motion of the scope relative to the colon when looping occurs is
   presented. The model has clinical significance for prediction of
   advancement of the tip of the scope when looping occurs. The
   mathematical model was then validated and verified using data available
   from the literature. Our models are an important starting point in the
   development of a novel device to overcome loop formation and result in
   increased patient comfort and an improved completion rate for
   colonoscopy procedures.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of microstructure and strain rate on the
   occurrence and failure of adiabatic shear bands in AISI 4340 steel under
   high velocity impact loads are investigated using finite element
   analysis and experimental tests. The shear band generated due to impact
   load was divided into some set of elements separated by nodes using
   finite element method in ABAQUS environment with initial and boundary
   conditions specified. The material properties were assumed to be lower
   at the second element set in order to initialize the adiabatic shear
   bands. The strain energy density for each successive node was calculated
   successively starting from the first element where initial boundary
   condition, initial strain hardening constant, and stress resistance had
   been specified. As the load time is increased, its corresponding effect
   on the localized shear deformation and width of the adiabatic shear band
   was also determined. The finite element model was used to determine the
   maximum stress, the strain hardening, the thermal softening, and the
   time to reach critical strain for formation of adiabatic shear bands.
   Experimental results show that deformed bands were formed at low strain
   rates and there was a minimum strain rate required for formation of
   transformed band in the alloy. The experimental results also show that
   cracks were initiated and propagated along transformed bands leading to
   fragmentation under the impact loading. The susceptibility of the
   adiabatic shear bands to cracking was markedly influenced by
   strain-rates and the initial material microstructures. The numerical
   results obtained were compared with the experimental results obtained
   for the AISI 4340 steel under high strain-rate loading in compression
   using split impact Hopkinson bars. A good agreement between the
   experimental and simulation results are also obtained.}},

   precipitation, and poor surface drainage have caused increased moisture
   infiltration in road structures. Further deterioration of these aged
   pavements is attributable to heavy year-round loadings in urban traffic.
   To address these issues, COS piloted subsurface drainage and strain
   dissipation layers in some roads. These drainage systems were
   constructed with crushed portland cement concrete (PCC) rock and
   conventional virgin crushed rock. Given the empirical nature of
   conventional road design methods currently used by COS, the structural
   benefits of drainage systems are difficult to quantify. Therefore, a
   reliable method that directly incorporates recycled materials,
   substructure drainage systems, and diverse field conditions is needed. A
   mechanistic analysis of the drainage systems was piloted in
   rehabilitated COS pavement structures with a three-dimensional (3-D)
   nonlinear orthotropic computational road structural model. The 3-D
   mechanistic model was used to predict peak surface deflections and
   normal and shear strains in the structure. Modeling results showed that
   constructing pavement structures with a substructure drainage layer of
   crushed PCC rock improved the structural performance of the road system
   in terms of strains under applied traffic loads. The road model provided
   primary response predictions that correlated with deflections measured
   by a heavy weight deflectometer, before and after construction.
   Therefore, the road model used is a reliable pavement engineering
   analysis tool able to predict the in-field structural behavior of
   various road structures under diverse field state conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The primary objective was to develop a repeatable
   radiographic technique for assessment of cranial tibial subluxation
   (CTS) and test the intra-observer and inter-observer repeatability of
   the chosen landmarks. A secondary objective was to determine the effects
   of digital radiographic magnification on CTS measurement repeatability.
   Methods: Twenty-three normal canine pelvic limbs were used to determine
   the magnitude of CTS before and after transection of the cranial
   cruciate ligament. Mediolateral radiographs were taken with and without
   fiduciary markers in place. Three investigators measured the CTS using
   radiographically visible anatomic landmarks at two different
   magnifications. The total observed variabilities were assessed by
   inter-observer and intra-observer differences. Paired t-tests were used
   to determine the effect of magnification and marker presence on CTS
   measures.
   Results: Measurement of the CTS from the caudal margin of the
   intercondylar fossa on the femur to the intercondylar eminence was the
   most repeatable. Poor correlation between the anatomic landmarks and the
   fiduciary bone markers was observed. We found no effect of magnification
   or presence or absence of bone markers on measurement of CTS.
   Clinical significance:,Cranial tibial subluxation can be detected with
   the most repeatability by measuring between the caudal margin of the
   intercondylar fossa and the intercondylar eminence. Magnification of the
   digitized radiographic image had minimal effect on repeatability. This
   technique can be used for in vivo analysis of the canine cruciate
   ligament deficient stifle joint.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the application of hierarchical wireless sensor networks
   in water quality monitoring is investigated. Adopting a hierarchical
   structure, the set of sensors is divided into multiple clusters where
   the value of the sensing parameter is almost constant in each cluster.
   The members of each cluster transmit their sensing information to the
   local fusion center (LFC) of their corresponding cluster, where using
   some fusion rule, the received information is combined, and then
   possibly sent to a higher-level central fusion center (CFC). A two-phase
   processing scheme is also envisioned, in which the first phase is
   dedicated to detection in the LFC, and the second phase is dedicated to
   estimation in both the LFC and the CFC. The focus of the present paper
   is on the problem of decision fusion at the LFC: we propose hard-and
   soft-decision maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithms, which exhibit
   flexibility in minimizing the total cost imposed by incorrect detections
   in the first phase. The proposed algorithms are simulated and compared
   with conventional fusion techniques. It is shown that the proposed
   techniques result in lower cost. Furthermore, when the number of sensors
   or the amount of contamination increases, the performance gap between
   the proposed algorithms and the existing methods also widens.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a noncoherent detection scheme for a fixed-gain
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network, in which the source is equipped
   with two transmit antennas, while the multiple relays and destination
   are equipped with a single antenna. An Alamouti space-time block code is
   employed together with M-ary frequency-shift-keying (FSK). Detection at
   the destination is performed in two steps. First, the destination
   estimates the overall channels based on the pilot symbol inherent in FSK
   transmission. Then it performs the maximal ratio combining (MRC) to make
   a final decision. An upper bound on the error performance is derived in
   a closed-form expression and it is shown that the investigated scheme
   achieves the full diversity order. Simulation results are also presented
   to confirm the analysis in a temporally-correlated fading environment.}},

Abstract = {{Smart antennas offer a broad range of ways to improve wireless system
   performance. They provide enhanced coverage through range extension,
   hole filling, and better building penetration. Smart antennas use an
   array of low gain antenna elements which are connected by a network.
   Fractal concepts have been used in antenna arrays recently. The
   important properties of fractal arrays are frequency independent
   multiband characteristics, schemes for realizing low side lobe designs,
   systematic approaches to thinning, and the ability to develop rapid beam
   forming algorithms. In this paper, an attempt has been made to apply
   assignment of usage time and location tag algorithm for smart antennas
   combined with the fractal concepts to reduce the computational
   complexity and enhance resource allocation for rapid beam forming
   algorithms. Furthermore, two combinational approach algorithms are
   proposed for peer users within single base station and peer users
   between different base stations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the features of the edge localized modes (ELMs)
   observed in the 2010 experimental campaign on the Experimental Advanced
   Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). The first high-confinement mode (H-mode)
   at an H-factor of H-IPB98(y,H-2) similar to 1 has been obtained with
   about 1 MW lower hybrid wave (LHW) heating power on the EAST tokamak.
   The ELMs in EAST are Type III ELMs with high frequency (several hundred
   Hertz) and low amplitude. ELM features for the following two types of
   EAST discharges are investigated: discharges with only LHW and those
   with both LHW and ion cyclotron resonance frequency (ICRF) wave. The
   ELMs are observed in a wide q(95) window ranging from 2.6 to 5.0, and
   the ELM frequencies decrease with the safety factor, q(95). In contrast
   to most observations, the ELM frequency in EAST appears to be weakly
   proportional to the power through the separatrix. When the ICRF wave is
   injected, the ELM frequency increases. The control of the ELM frequency
   and amplitude has been achieved by puffing impure argon gas into the
   EAST discharge.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid actuation robots are mechanisms that are driven by at least one
   constant velocity motor and one servo motor. Such a robot or mechanism
   has found a growing number of applications. In designing such a
   mechanism there is a need to perform inverse kinematics due to presence
   of the servo motor. Inverse kinematics of a hybrid actuation mechanism
   is significantly different from that of a mechanism that is driven by
   the servo motor only. In literature, there is a lack of a general
   approach to inverse kinematics for general hybrid actuation machines.
   Ad-hoc treatments of inverse kinematics are prone to error. In this
   paper, we present a general approach to inverse kinematics for hybrid
   actuation mechanisms. The approach is primarily based on the group
   technique. In particular, we propose a set of groups as well as their
   inverse kinematics. Then, a hybrid actuation mechanism is decomposed
   against these groups and inverse kinematics can then proceed in a way by
   assembling the inverse kinematics of these groups. Several examples are
   presented to show the effectiveness of this general approach.}},

Abstract = {{1. A study was designed to characterise dark, firm, dry (DFD) breast
   meat resulting from cold exposure of broilers and compare its properties
   with normal breast meat from cold-stressed and control birds.
   2. A total of 140 broilers were selected from 5- and 6-week-old birds
   exposed to cold temperatures ranging from -18 to -4 degrees C, or a
   control temperature of +20 degrees C for 3 h in an environmental
   chamber. Half of these birds were slaughtered immediately following the
   cold exposure and the other half were given 2 h of lairage.
   3. Breast meat samples were categorised based on ultimate pH (pH(u)) and
   colour L{*} (lightness) values into normal (5.7 <= pH(u) <= 6.1; 46 <=
   L{*} <= 53) breast meat from control (control-normal) or cold-stressed
   (cold-normal) birds, and DFD (pH(u) > 6.1; L{*} < 46) breast meat, which
   only occurred in cold-stressed birds (cold-DFD).
   4. Residual glycogen was not different between cold-DFD and
   control-normal breast meat. Lactate concentration was lower in cold-DFD
   compared with control-normal breast meat. Lactate concentration almost
   tripled for all the samples by 30 h post-mortem, which resulted in a
   drop in pH of normal meat, but did not have any effect on pH of DFD
   breast meat. Glycolytic potential at both 5 min and 30 h postmortem was
   lower in DFD breast meat compared with the normal breast meat from both
   cold-stressed and control birds.
   5. Cold-DFD breast meat was significantly darker, with higher pH(u),
   lower cook loss, higher water-binding capacity and processing cook yield
   than cold-normal and control-normal breast meat, which were not
   different from each other.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra fine grained (UFG) pure titanium fabricated by severe plastic
   deformation techniques has been recently considered for biomedical
   applications. In this study, the effects of grain size and
   crystallographic orientation on the biocompatibility of commercially
   pure titanium have been evaluated. Samples having significant
   differences in terms of average grain size (from 0.4 to 20 mu m) and
   crystallographic textures have been produced using equal channel angular
   pressing (ECAP) and compared. X-ray diffraction and electron back
   scattered diffraction (EBSD) were used to document the texture and
   microstructural properties. Cell attachment tests were done to study the
   biocompatibility of the samples using MC3T3 pre-osteoblast cells. The
   number of attached cells was found to be higher on the samples having
   more (0002) plane parallel to the surface regardless of their grain
   sizes. It was concluded that the texture plays a more significant role
   than the grain size in the biocompatibility of pure titanium.}},

   above 100 GPa is examined with semi-local, Tran-Blaha modified
   Becke-Johnson local density approximation (TB-mBJLDA), screened hybrid
   density functionals and GW methods. The shift of the conduction band to
   higher energy with increasing pressure is predicted by all methods.
   However, there are significant differences in detail band structure. In
   the pressure range from 90 to160 GPa, semi-local, hybrid functional and
   TB-mBJLDA calculations predicted that AlH3 is a poor metal. In
   comparison, GW calculations show a gap opening at 160 GPa and AlH3
   becomes a small gap semi-conductor. From the trends of the calculated
   band shifts, it can be concluded that the favourable conditions leading
   to the nesting of Fermi surfaces predicted by semi-local calculation
   have disappeared if the exchange term is included. The results highlight
   the importance of the correction to the exchange energy on the band
   structure of hydrogen dominant dense metal hydrides at high pressure
   hydrides and may help to rationalize the absence of superconductivity in
   AlH3 from experimental measurements.}},

Pages = {{2159-2168}},
Abstract = {{Hydrogeology is now taught in a broad spectrum of departments and
   institutions to students with diverse backgrounds. Successful
   instruction in hydrogeology thus requires a variety of pedagogical
   approaches depending on desired learning outcomes and the background of
   students. We review the pedagogical literature in hydrogeology to
   highlight recent advances and analyze a 2005 survey among 68
   hydrogeology instructors. The literature and survey results suggest
   there are only similar to 15 topics that are considered crucial by most
   hydrogeologists and > 100 other topics that are considered crucial by
   some hydrogeologists. The crucial topics focus on properties of aquifers
   and fundamentals of groundwater flow, and should likely be part of all
   undergraduate hydrogeology courses. Other topics can supplement and
   support these crucial topics, depending on desired learning outcomes.
   Classroom settings continue to provide a venue for emphasizing
   fundamental knowledge. However, recent pedagogical advances are biased
   towards field and laboratory instruction with a goal of bolstering
   experiential learning. Field methods build on the fundamentals taught in
   the classroom and emphasize the collection of data, data uncertainty,
   and the development of vocational skills. Laboratory and computer-based
   exercises similarly build on theory, and offer an opportunity for data
   analysis and integration. The literature suggests curricula at all
   levels should ideally balance field, laboratory, and classroom pedagogy
   into an iterative and integrative whole. An integrated, iterative and
   balanced approach leads to greater student motivation and advancement of
   theoretical and vocational knowledge.}},

Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{In order to improve bandwidth efficiency and error performance, a new
   training scheme is proposed for bit-interleaved-coded modulation in
   multiple-input multiple-output (BICM-MIMO) systems. Typically, in a
   block-fading channel, the training overhead used for obtaining channel
   knowledge is proportional to a power of 2 of the number of transmit
   antennas. However, this overhead can be reduced by embedding pilot
   symbols within data symbols before precoding. The values, positions, and
   the number of pilot symbols are found by minimizing the Cramer-Rao bound
   on the channel estimation error. Computer simulations are presented to
   demonstrate the advantage of the proposed scheme over other training
   methods, in terms of both the mean-square-error of the channel
   estimation and the system's frame-error-rate.}},

Abstract = {{The Athabasca Oil Sands of Northeastern Alberta, Canada, are primarily
   recovered by surface mining operations. These areas are required by
   regulation to be reclaimed at mine closure. Recent cuts in the proposed
   borrow areas for cover material have revealed unusual deposits of
   hydrocarbons at quantities exceeding clean soil guidelines in the
   surficial materials. This article outlines recent work in characterising
   the hydrocarbon composition and groundwater leaching potential of this
   surficial bitumen. Characterisation consisted of field sampling with
   analysis by standard Canadian chromatographic methods. An initial
   investigation of contaminant mobility and biodegradability was conducted
   using a custom unsaturated soil column leaching experiment. Hydrocarbons
   were found to be primarily above C30. Concentrations greater than C60
   were approximately 10 times those below C60. As expected, minimal
   leaching occurred, suggesting a minimal risk to groundwater. This result
   provides meaningful evidence that the material can be directly placed
   for reclamation. This option in turn represents a meaningful saving in
   terms of cost, effort and energy for the mine operators.}},

Abstract = {{Today, manufacturing operates as a global network, which has created
   more awareness of the quality of products and services. A systematic and
   rational way of managing quality assurance is currently lacking. This
   can cause serious problems in sectors such as the medical industry, as
   product failure may not only cause time delays, but also create risks
   for the health and safety of patients and users. This paper proposes a
   quality assurance approach that incorporates risk analysis (based on
   ISO14971) and failure analysis (based on FMEA) into the product design
   phase to assure product quality in the short term and facilitate global
   manufacturing practices in the long run. The proposed approach includes
   a Markov model to predict product failure from a customer perspective,
   which serves as a checkpoint for feedback to provide a basis for quality
   assurance. A medical equipment firm is used as a test-bed to illustrate
   how the proposed approach works and to verify its effectiveness.}},

Title = {{A BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED CONTROLLER FOR TRAJECTORY TRACKING OF
   FLEXIBLE-JOINT MANIPULATORS}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS \& AUTOMATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{151-162}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new biologically inspired control strategy for
   trajectory tracking of flexible-joint manipulators. The social
   behavioural pattern of swarms such as bird flocks and fish schools is
   the inspiration to develop a new controller for flexible-joint
   manipulators in this study. This controller, referred to as swarm
   control, is a self-organized robust technique which is able to control
   simultaneously the rotations of the joints and the position of the robot
   end-effector (tip of the robot which interacts with environment).
   Therefore, in contrast to other studies in which the joints are
   individually controlled, and the performance of the controller is
   independent of the position of the end-effector, the swarm control takes
   into account the errors in the positions of the end-effector and the
   joints at the same time. In this control scheme, the parameters of the
   controller are updated every time-step based on their values at the
   previous time-step and also the feedbacks of the positions of the links
   and the end-effector. Along with the swarm control, a friction
   compensating torque which is based on the LuGre method is employed to
   counterbalance the effect of the friction in the joints. Verification of
   the proposed controller is performed using the experimental setup of a
   two-rigid-link flexible-joint. The experimental results show that the
   controller is successful in tip trajectory tracking at several different
   desired trajectories and at several different speeds, such that the
   tracking and the steady-state errors are almost zero during the
   manoeuvre of the manipulator and after reaching to the final desired
   position. Furthermore, comparison of swarm control with other
   controllers (e.g., the computed torque scheme) demonstrates the
   superiority of the swarm control strategy in reducing the trajectory
   tracking error during robot manoeuvre.}},

Journal = {{NUMERICAL HEAT TRANSFER PART A-APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{569-593}},
Abstract = {{A finite volume model was developed to simulate transient heat transfer
   in firefighters' protective clothing during flash fire exposure. The
   model domain consists of three layers of fire-resistant fabrics (outer
   shell, moisture barrier, and thermal liner) with two air gaps between
   the clothing layers, the human skin, and the air gap between the
   clothing and the skin. The model accounts for the combined
   conduction-radiation heat transfer in the air gaps entrapped between the
   clothing layers, and between the clothing and the skin. The variation in
   the air gap properties and energy content during both the exposure and
   the cool down periods was accounted for. Predictions were obtained for
   the temperature and heat flux distributions in the fabric layers, skin,
   and air gaps as a function of time. The influence of each air gap on the
   clothing performance was investigated as well. This article demonstrates
   the importance of accurately modeling the contributions of the air gaps
   in order to predict the protective clothing performance.}},

Abstract = {{Using a laboratory-scale mixed reactor, the performance of alumina in
   degrading 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid with ozone in the presence of
   tert-butyl alcohol radical scavenger was studied. The operating
   variables investigated were the dose of alumina catalyst and solution
   pH. Results showed that using ozone and alumina leads to a significant
   increase in 2,4-D removal in comparison to non-catalytic ozonation and
   adsorption processes. The observed reaction rate constants (k(obs)) for
   2,4-D during ozonation were found to increase linearly with increasing
   catalyst dose. At pH 5, the kobs value increased from 19.3 to 26 M-1
   s(-1) and 67 M-1 s(-1) when varying the alumina dose from 1 to 2 and 4 g
   L-1, respectively. As pH was increased, higher reaction rates were
   observed for both non-catalytic ozonation and catalytic ozonation
   processes. Thus, at pH 3 and using a catalyst dose of 8 g L-1, the
   k(obs) values for noncatalytic ozonation and catalytic ozonation
   processes were 3.4 and 58.9 M-1 s(-1), respectively, whereas at pH 5
   reaction rate constants of 6.5 and 128.5 M-1 s(-1) were observed,
   respectively. Analysis of total organic carbon suggested that catalytic
   ozonation with alumina achieved a considerable level of mineralization
   of 2,4-D. Adsorption of 2,4-D on alumina was found to play an important
   role in the catalytic ozonation process.}},

Pages = {{399-413}},
Abstract = {{Growing environmental concerns associated with electric power
   generation, and the awareness toward the use of renewable energy has
   caused widespread and rapid increase in the installation of wind-power
   systems. The uncertain and intermittent nature of wind power has led to
   growing problems in integrating wind power in power systems as the
   wind-power penetration continues to increase. One of the prime
   requirements of operating a power system with wind power is maintaining
   the system reliability by committing an appropriate amount of power from
   available generation sources in the lead time considered. Commitment of
   wind power is a very crucial task that requires accurate wind-power
   forecasting. This article presents a time series model to recognize the
   variability in wind and presents a conditional probabilistic method to
   quantify the wind-power commitment risk during system operation. The
   method is applied to assess the short-term operational risks with wind
   power and the operating capacity credits of a wind farm using the Roy
   Billinton Test System test system.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty of performance is an obstacle for greater uptake of many

   Use of geostatistical information on aquifer properties and analysis of
   previous projects in a region show some promise in assessing the risk in
   these projects. An example of a possible methodology is given here for
   open loop heat pump and other groundwater-source heating and cooling
   projects in Manitoba, Canada. Stochastic modeling of open loop heat
   pumps was able to explain the number of wells unable to produce or
   inject sufficient water from the aquifer, demonstrating the efficacy of
   this technique. This type of approach also provides insight into the
   viability of possible mitigation options to successfully finish projects
   where conditions would not have supported the original design of such

   design, consisting of a chemostat vessel connected to several
   equal-sized ageing vessels configured in parallel, was developed. The
   objective of the developed process is to have complete glucose
   utilization during fermentation stage. The process design integrates the
   conservation of mass principle and the experimental data of collected
   residual glucose profiles measured under VHG conditions. An ageing
   vessel involves three consecutive time periods: filling, ageing and
   operating. The ageing time is biological relevance, and is affected by
   the initial glucose concentration, the ethanol concentration, and the
   yeast viability in an ageing vessel. The operating time period is
   adjustable; a short operating time means a high discharge rate in order
   to empty an ageing vessel. The filling time links to the selection of
   the number of equal-sized ageing vessels that are installed downstream
   to a chemostat device. The developed process features the use of equal
   sized fermenters for all chemostat and ageing vessels so that the vessel
   exchangeability and the flexibility of fermentation operation are
   increased. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of submerged arc welding (SAW) process parameters on the
   microstructure of SA516 grade 70 steel weld metal (WM) was investigated
   in the present work. Steel plates of 17 mm thickness were submerged arc
   welded using welding currents of 700-850 A and welding speeds of
   5.3-15.3 mm s(-1). The morphologies and volume fractions of the various
   ferrites in the WM were studied using optical microscopy and the
   morphologies and chemical compositions of the WM inclusions were
   examined using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive Xray
   spectrometry. The results showed that the WM grain structure coarsened
   but the grain width of prior austenite grains decreased with increasing
   heat input. Also, the proportion of acicular ferrite (AF) in the WM
   increased initially, while the volume fractions of grain boundary
   ferrite and Widmanstatten ferrite decreased with increasing welding
   current. However, with further increasing the welding current above 800
   A, less AF was produced. The weld nugget area decreased with increasing
   welding speed at all currents, but did not affect the amount of AF
   produced.}},

Abstract = {{Although colonoscopy is a very commonly carried out procedure, it is not
   without its problems, including a risk of perforation and significant
   patient discomfort, especially associated with looping formation.
   Furthermore, looping formation may prevent a complete colonoscopy from
   being carried out in certain patients. The conventional colonoscope has
   not changed very much since its original introduction. We review
   promising technologies that are being promoted as a way to address the
   problems with current colonoscopy. There are some methods to prevent
   looping formation, including overtube, variable stiffness,
   computer-guided scopes, Aer-O-Scope(TM), magnetic endoscopic imaging and
   the capsule endoscope. In recent years, with the progress of
   microelectromechanical and microelectronic technologies, many biomedical
   and robotic researchers are developing autonomous endoscopes with
   miniaturization of size and integration functionality that represent
   state of the art of the micro-robotic endoscope. The initial results by
   using aforementioned methods seem promising; however, there are some
   conflicting reports of clinical trials with the overtube colonoscope,
   the computer-guided scope and the variable stiffness colonoscope. There
   are also some limitations in the use of the Aer-o-scope and the capsule
   endoscope. The autonomous endoscope is based on a self-propelling
   property that is able to avoid looping completely. This novel technology
   could potentially become the next generation endoscope; however, there
   are still critical techniques to be approached in order to develop the
   effective and efficient novel endoscope.}},

Abstract = {{The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of stir cast Al-Mg alloy A535
   and its composites reinforced with a mixture of 5 wt.\% fly ash and 5
   wt.\% silicon carbide, 10 wt.\% and 15 wt.\% fly ash particles was
   investigated using thermomechanical analysis (TMA). Micromechnical
   models proposed by Turner, Kerner and Schapery as well as the rule of
   mixture (ROM) were employed to compute the CTEs of the composites within
   the same temperature range. Experimental results showed that the CTE of
   A535 decreased with the addition of fly ash and SiC particles.
   Subjecting the test samples to a second re-heat cycle also affected
   their CTE response. The CTE obtained for A535 during the first heating
   cycle was higher than that obtained during the re-heat cycle whereas the
   reverse result was obtained for the fly ash composites. Furthermore, the
   analytical models could not predict the experimental CTEs the composites
   due to complexities arising from the presence of porosities, reaction
   products and other defects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A series of measurements was carried out on specimens of submerged arc

   reinforcement, bead width, penetration depth, contact angle, heat
   affected zone (HAZ) size, deposition area, penetration area and total
   molten area. The level of dilution and different melting efficiencies
   were calculated and their variation with heat input was analyzed based
   on the acquired measurements. The cooling time from 800 to 500 degrees C
   was also related to various weld bead characteristics (e.g., total
   nugget area, heat transfer boundary lengths, bead width-to-depth ratio,
   and nugget parameter). The bead reinforcement, bead width, penetration
   depth, HAZ size, deposition area and penetration area increased with
   increasing heat input, but the bead contact angle decreased with it. The
   electrode melting efficiency increased initially and then decreased with
   increasing heat input, but the plate melting efficiency and percentage
   dilution changed only slightly with it. Cooling time exhibited a very
   good linear relationship with the total nugget area, heat transfer

Abstract = {{Realization of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for residential use
   depends on, among other things, minimizing leakages. However, very
   airtight houses may have a negative impact on indoor air quality, indoor
   humidity and thermal comfort. Focusing on ventilation systems becomes a
   requirement in this situation.
   In cold climates mechanical ventilation systems are the state of the art
   solution. In order to achieve further energy use reduction, the effort
   must be set on efficient energy recovery from ventilation systems.
   In this paper, the focus is set on quasi-counter flow membrane-based
   heat and mass recovery system for cold climates such as the Norwegian.
   Their effectiveness crucially depends on the heat and mass transfer
   process through the membrane and therefore the characteristics of
   membranes have to be deeply analyzed. To investigate this process, this
   paper starts with a theoretical study of moisture transfer process
   through membranes based on a review of available literature. Following
   to it, and to validate the results of the theoretical analysis; selected
   types of membranes will be analyzed. The present paper concludes on the
   selection of the most suitable membrane solution among the tested.}},

   degrees C. The deformed microstructure follows a normal grain growth at
   the higher temperatures having no evidence of abnormal growth. The
   annealing behavior was characterized by calculating the grain growth
   activation energy (Q) and the time exponent (n). The value of Q (similar
   to 180 kJ/mole) was found to be close to the self diffusion activation
   energy of titanium (169.1 kJ/mole).}},

Abstract = {{The effect of high-power ultrasound pretreatment on the extraction of

   sonication by an ultrasound probe horn was applied at 24 kHz and a
   number of factors were investigated: particle size (0.18-0.6 mm), type
   of solvent (0-100\% aqueous ethanol), ultrasonic treatment time (2-40
   min), and power of ultrasound (0-100\% power intensity, maximum power:
   78W). The optimal condition of ultrasound was achieved with 0.425-0.6 mm
   particle size, 10 min sonication time, 35 W ultrasound power, and water
   as the medium. There was no obvious degradation of podophyllotoxin with
   ultrasound under the applied conditions, and an improvement in
   extractability was observed. The SEM microscopic structure change of
   treated samples disclosed the effect of ultrasound on the tissue cells.
   The increased pore volume and surface area after ultrasonic treatment
   also confirmed the positive effect of ultrasound pretreatment on the
   extraction yield of podophyllotoxin from the plant cells. (C) 2011
