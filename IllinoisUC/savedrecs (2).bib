Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a generation control architecture for
   microgrids that ensures stable and synchronized operation at a specific
   frequency. We also propose a distributed implementation of this
   architecture that relies on two distributed algorithms that adhere to a
   communication network interconnecting the controllers present at each
   bus. The first algorithm enables the generators to determine set-points
   that result in stable and synchronized operation given a known set of
   load bus power demands, whereas the second one enables the generators to
   drive their commands to the aforementioned set- points. We demonstrate
   our proposed controller and its distributed implementation via numerical
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a collision prediction and avoidance algorithm based
   on piecewise Bezier curves. Upon detection of an obstacle, the algorithm
   checks for a possible collision and modifies the vehicle's planned
   trajectory, if needed. Under mild assumptions, the replanned trajectory
   is guaranteed to avoid the collision and satisfy mission-specific
   constraints. The bounds on changes in position, velocity and
   acceleration caused by trajectory replanning are computable a priori.
   These bounds can be used during the mission-planning phase to guarantee
   satisfaction of vehicle dynamic constraints by the replanned trajectory.
   The algorithm presented here can be used to avoid multiple collisions
   under weaker assumptions as compared to previous results.}},

Abstract = {{We consider in this paper a networked system of opinion dynamics in
   continuous time, where the agents are able to evaluate their
   self-appraisals in a distributed way. In the model we formulate, the
   underlying network topology is described by a strongly connected graph.
   For each ordered pair of adjacent agents (i, j), we assign a function of
   self-appraisal to agent i, which measures the level of importance of
   agent i to agent j. Thus by communicating only with his neighbors, each
   agent is able to calculate the difference between his level of
   importance to others and others' level of importance to him. The
   dynamical system of self-appraisals is then designed to drive these
   differences to zero. We show that for almost all initial conditions, the
   trajectory of the dynamical system asymptotically converges to an
   equilibrium which is exponentially stable.}},

   of the weights of the outgoing edges. Weight-balanced digraphs play an
   important role in a variety of cooperative control problems and, in this
   work, we propose an iterative distributed algorithm which solves the
   integer weight balancing problem in a given strongly connected digraph,
   in the presence of arbitrary (time-varying, inhomogeneous, but) bounded
   time delays that might affect communication transmissions. The algorithm
   is shown to converge after a finite number of iterations that we

   balanced digraph is unique regardless of the specific delays that links

Abstract = {{In the set of stochastic, indecomposable, aperiodic (SIA) matrices, the
   class of stochastic Sarymsakov matrices is the largest known subset (i)
   that is closed under matrix multiplication and (ii) the infinitely long
   left-product of the elements from a compact subset converges to a
   rank-one matrix. In this paper, we show that a larger subset with these
   two properties can be derived by generalizing the standard definition
   for Sarymsakov matrices. The generalization is achieved either by
   introducing an ``SIA index{''}, whose value is one for Sarymsakov
   matrices, and then looking at those stochastic matrices with larger SIA
   indices, or by considering matrices that are not even SIA. Besides
   constructing a larger set, we give sufficient conditions for generalized
   Sarymsakov matrices so that their products converge to rank-one
   matrices. The new insight gained through studying generalized Sarymsakov
   matrices and their products has led to a new understanding of the
   existing results on consensus algorithms and will be helpful for the
   design of network coordination algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we are interested in the stability and L-2-gain of hybrid
   systems with linear flow dynamics, periodic time-triggered jumps and
   nonlinear possibly set-valued jump maps. This class of hybrid systems
   includes various interesting applications such as periodic
   event-triggered control. In this paper we also show that sampled-data
   systems with arbitrarily switching controllers can be captured in this
   framework by requiring the jump map to be set-valued. We provide novel
   conditions for the internal stability and L-2-gain analysis of these
   systems adopting a lifting-based approach. In particular, we establish
   that the internal stability and contractivity in terms of an L-2-gain
   smaller than 1 are equivalent to the internal stability and
   contractivity of a particular discretetime set-valued nonlinear system.
   Despite earlier works in this direction, these novel characterisations
   are the first necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability and
   the contractivity of this class of hybrid systems. The results are
   illustrated through multiple new examples.}},

Abstract = {{We present a scheme for estimating the minimum achievable decay rate of
   a switched linear system via path-dependent feedback control, when the
   switching signal belongs to a language generated by a strongly connected
   graph. This growth rate is characterized by the constrained joint
   spectral radius (CJSR) of the system, a generalization of the joint
   spectral radius to account for the switching constraint. Our key tool in
   analyizing the CJSR is the multinorm, a collection of mode-indexed norms
   which demonstrate contractiveness along admissible modal trajectories.
   We may approximate the CJSR to any desired accuracy by computing
   quadratic multinorms as solutions to a system of LMIs, using an
   estimation scheme presented in {[}15]. These LMIs are of similar form to
   those which characterize the stability of the switched system in {[}6].
   The feasiblity of any one of these LMIs allows the construction of a
   suitable controller; we use the infeasibility of such an LMI to provide
   a lower bound on the closed-loop decay rate achieved by any
   path-dependent controller.}},

Abstract = {{We present an event-triggered controller for stabilizing a
   continuous-time linear time-invariant system subject to communication
   constraints. We model the communication constraints as a noiseless
   finite-capacity communication channel between the process sensors and
   the controller/actuator. An encoder converts the process state into
   symbols to send across the channel to the controller/actuator, which
   converts the symbols into a state estimate to be used in a simple
   emulation-based state-feedback control law. We derive a sufficient
   condition for this scheme to stabilize the process. The condition
   depends on the encoder's average bit-rate, its average consumption of
   communication resources, and the eigenvalues of the process. The
   proposed encoding scheme is order-optimal in the sense that its
   stability condition is within a constant factor of the optimal bound
   from previous work.}},

Abstract = {{The growing share of renewables in the grid power supply has led to the
   increased agility requirement for the fossil-fired power plants in
   following the dispatch demand. This has resulted in the increased power
   plant robust tracking performance requirements characterized by reduced
   sensitivity to fuel variations and component wear and tear. The
   H-infinity output tracking control could potentially help in addressing
   this problem, however the standard H-infinity synthesis produces a
   tracking error in the plant outputs, thereby degrading the system
   performance. This error arises due to the fact that in boiler/turbine
   units, the turbine valve position actuation for manipulating steam flow
   rate is typically characterized by a dead zone causing small mismatch
   between the turbine valve command and the actual valve position. To
   address this deficiency as well as other similar ones arising in control
   systems due to the actuator nonideality, the generic nonsmooth
   H-infinity output tracking synthesis is developed and applied to a
   coal-fired boiler/turbine unit with input dead zone. The simulation
   results presented support the proposed synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Quickest outlier detection and isolation is studied in universal

   according to a ``typical{''} distribution. At the change time, an
   outlier stream emerges and starts to be distributed according to the
   ``outlier{''} distribution, while the rest of the streams remain to be
   distributed according to the typical one. Two tests are proposed to
   quickly isolate the outlier. The first test is shown to be
   asymptotically optimal universally when only the typical distribution is
   known, and in the limit of the large number of streams when neither the
   outlier nor typical distribution is known. The performance of the second
   test, which is more practical, is also characterized.}},

Abstract = {{In the nervous system, sensory neurons encode signals as a sequence of
   action potentials (spikes). However, spike generation is metabolically
   expensive. Achieving high coding fidelity may require a high spike rate.
   Here we propose that neurons achieve a trade-off by optimally timing
   spikes so that maximum fidelity is achieved for a given spike rate. The
   proposed neural encoder generates spikes which are reconstructed by a
   linear filter, with energy modeled as a constraint proportional to the
   average spike-rate. We develop expressions for the encoding error and
   derive the optimal parameters in the limit of high spike-firing rates.
   The energy-constrained neural encoder is compared with experimental
   spike-times from two sensory neurons, one cortical and one peripheral.
   The proposed energy-constrained neural encoder closely approximates the
   experimentally recorded spike-times, and the decoded experimental inputs
   are within 2dB of the predicted distortion-energy curve for both
   neurons.}},

Abstract = {{Two parties observing correlated data seek to exchange their data using
   interactive communication. How many bits must they communicate? We
   derive a lower bound on the minimum number of bits that is based on
   relating the data exchange problem to the secret key agreement problem.
   Furthermore, we propose an interactive protocol for data exchange which
   increases the communication size in steps until the task is done and
   matches the performance of our lower bound. Our single-shot analysis
   applies to all discrete random variables and yields upper and lower
   bound of a similar form. In fact, the bounds are asymptotically tight
   and lead to a characterization of the optimal rate of communication
   needed for data exchange for a general sequence such as mixture of IID
   random variables as well as the optimal second-order asymptotic term in
   the length of communication needed for data exchange for the IID random
   variables, when the probability of error is fixed. This gives a precise
   characterization of the asymptotic reduction in the length of optimal
   communication due to interaction; in particular, two-sided Slepian-Wolf
   compression is strictly suboptimal.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of distributed estimation, where local
   processors observe independent samples conditioned on a common random
   parameter of interest, map the observations to a finite number of hits,
   and send these bits to a remote estimator over independent noisy
   channels. We derive converse results for this problem, such as lower
   bounds on Bayes risk. The main technical tools include a lower bound on
   the Bayes risk via mutual information and small ball probability, as
   well as strong data processing inequalities for the relative entropy.
   Our results can recover and improve some existing results on distributed
   estimation with noiseless channels, and also capture the effect of noisy
   channels on the estimation performance.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel interference management framework for the cellular
   downlink through cooperative transmission. A sectored cellular network
   is studied where the interference is only due to sectors in neighboring
   cells and intra cell interference is ignored. We first explore the
   potential degrees of freedom (DoF) gain in a scenario where mobile
   receivers can be associated to any neighboring cell but no cooperative
   transmission is allowed. We show that the maximum achievable per user
   DoF for orthogonal schemes is between 1/3 and 3/7. On the other hand, if
   cooperative transmission is combined with flexible message assignment to
   the transmitters, we show that it is possible to achieve a per user DoF
   of 7/15. In addition, the proposed cooperative transmission scheme does
   not require extra backhaul capacity, as it uses a smart assignment of
   messages to transmitters to meet an average backhaul load constraint of
   one message per transmitter.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of universal search and stop using an adaptive search policy
   is considered. When the target location is searched, the observation is
   distributed according to the target distribution, otherwise it is
   distributed according to the absence distribution. A universal
   sequential scheme for search and stop is proposed using only the
   knowledge of the absence distribution, and its asymptotic performance is
   analyzed. The universal test is shown to yield a vanishing error
   probability, and to achieve the optimal reliability when the target is
   present, universally for every target distribution. Consequently, it is
   established that the knowledge of the target distribution is only useful
   for improving the reliability for detecting a missing target. It is also
   shown that a multiplicative gain for the search reliability equal to the
   number of searched locations is achieved by allowing adaptivity in the
   search.}},

Abstract = {{Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for photovoltaic (PV) panels is
   primarily implemented at the panel level in presently-installed PV
   systems. Each panel typically consists of three subpanel strings with a
   bypass diode connected over each subpanel. When a panel becomes
   partially-shaded, the MPPT control may bypass a substring to optimize
   power, however, bypassing increases hot spotting risk. This paper
   introduces a voltage-threshold control that works with existing MPPT to
   mitigate hot spotting. The control imposes a lower voltage limit that
   prevents a compromised subpanel string from being bypassed. Simulation
   results show that voltage-threshold control is effective in limiting hot
   spotting for both typical Type A and Type B PV cells, with only minimal
   reduction in energy output.}},

Abstract = {{High level synthesis (HLS) quality improvements have led to its
   increased adoption in hardware design. In the design flow, IP reuse is
   critical for achieving quality of results, yet current HLS tools allow
   only a small set of tool-provided IPs integrated during HLS. General IP
   integration is then handled as an additional step either manually or
   using other system level tools. Performing post-HLS integration of IPs
   requires a clear separation of IPs from HLS-generated cores, requiring
   significant partitioning effort. In contrast, behavioral-level IP
   integration during HLS can simplify the design flow while still
   supporting HLS-based optimization and design space exploration. In this
   paper, we develop a general IP integration framework for HLS that
   supports fixed-and variable-latency IPs without requiring application
   partitioning. Using this framework that allows user-specified
   function/instruction-to-IP mapping, we demonstrate integration of both
   synthesizable and non-synthesizable IPs.}},

Abstract = {{High level synthesis (HLS) tools are increasingly adopted for hardware
   design as the quality of tools consistently improves. Concerted
   development effort on HLS tools represents significant software
   development effort, and debugging and validation represents a
   significant portion of that effort. However, HLS tools are different
   from typical large-scale software systems; HLS tool output must be
   subsequently verified through functional verification of the generated
   RTL implementation. Debugging machine-generated functionally incorrect
   RTL is time-consuming and cumbersome requiring back-tracing through
   hundreds of signals and simulation cycles to determine the underlying
   error. This challenging process requires support framework in the HLS
   flow to enable fast and efficient pinpointing of the incorrectness in
   the tool. In this paper, we present a debug framework that uses
   just-in-time (JIT) traces and automated insertion of verification code
   into the generated RTL to assist in debugging an HLS tool. This
   framework aids the user by quickly pinpointing the earliest instance of
   execution mismatch, paired with detailed information on the faulty
   signal, and the corresponding instruction from the application source.
   Using CHStone benchmarks, we demonstrate that this technique can
   significantly reduce bug detection latency: often with zero cycle
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time MRI has become an increasingly useful tool in articulatory
   studies, especially in examining posterior regions of the vocal tract.
   Previous work on Brazilian Portugese has shown the emergence of coda
   consonants following word-final nasal vowels, though this has been
   limited to the discussion of front vowels and coda emergence in anterior
   regions of the vocal tract. We present rt-MRI evidence showing a narrow
   constriction between the tongue dorsum and velum emerging at the end of
   back nasal vowels, patterning similarly with velar stop consonants.
   Though our present subject does not show evidence of complete occlusion,
   we believe the small distance between the tongue dorsum and velum makes
   the emergence of a velar consonant highly likely. The emergence of these
   consonants is a result of sound change that further distinguishes oral
   and nasal vowel pairs. We also show the utility of advanced image
   processing methodologies to give a more accurate and computationally
   economical way to do speech articulation research.}},

   The hidden layers of a deep neural network (DNN) are then initialized

   where the training is performed in a sequential manner - source language
   followed by the target language. Experiments conducted using varying

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new permanent deformation model proposed from a
   research study recently conducted at the University of Illinois aimed at
   characterizing the deformation behavior of unbound aggregate materials
   used in pavement base/subbase applications. Sixteen different aggregate
   materials, commonly used for base/subbase applications in the state of
   North Carolina were tested in the laboratory for shear strength and
   permanent deformation behavior. An analysis framework was established to
   consider the strong correlation that commonly exists between permanent
   deformation and shear strength characteristics. Accordingly, the trends
   of permanent strain accumulations from repeated load triaxial tests were
   captured in a new rutting model developed by taking into account the
   shear stresses applied at certain fractions, i.e., 25\%, 50\% and 75\%,
   of the shear strength properties of these materials under similar
   loading conditions. Finally, justification has been provided to
   highlight how this model would present an improvement over the unbound
   aggregate rutting damage model currently used in AASHTO's
   mechanistic-empirical pavement design approach. Physical significance of
   individual model parameters has also been analyzed in this paper, and
   inferences regarding expected values of these parameters have been
   drawn. It is concluded that the proposed model has the ability to
   predict deformation characteristics of aggregate materials by
   incorporating number of load cycles, shear strength and stress state
   components.}},

Abstract = {{Ballast, typically comprising large sized aggregate particles with
   uniform gradation, is an essential layer in the railroad track
   substructure. Functions of ballast include facilitating load
   distribution and drainage, maintaining track geometry and track
   stability, and providing track resilience and noise absorption.
   Throughout its service life, ballast goes through changes in gradation
   and particle shape properties due to aggregate breakdown/degradation. In
   United States freight lines, mineral aggregate breakdown/degradation has
   been reported as the main mechanism causing ballast fouling, which
   covers up to 76\% of all the fouling cases. To investigate the effects
   of ballast aggregate breakdown and degradation on the mechanical
   behavior, a series of Los Angeles (LA) abrasion tests were performed to
   generate fouled materials caused by particle degradation under a
   controlled laboratory environment. In what follows, large-scale triaxial
   tests were performed on both clean and heavily fouled ballast specimens
   using a triaxial test device recently developed at the University of
   Illinois specifically for testing ballast size aggregate materials. The
   triaxial testing efforts also focused on (a) the effects of gradation
   considering those finer materials or fines, i.e. particles less than 9.5
   mm (3/8 in.), generated through ballast degradation and (b) the effects
   of aggregate shape properties, such as angularity and flatness and
   elongation, for particles larger than 9.5 mm (3/8 in.). Accordingly,
   triaxial tests were also performed only on those aggregate particles
   still kept after the LA abrasion tests larger than 9.5 mm (3/8 in.) in
   size, which would constitute the skeleton of the fouled ballast layer in
   the field. The experimental study results indicated that ballast
   degradation did not necessarily result in significant strength loss from
   the monotonic compression tests on dry specimens. On the contrary, in
   most cases, the dry degraded ballast with or without fines yielded
   higher strength properties than those observed in the new ballast
   specimens. Smaller particles provided a ``stabilizing{''} effect that
   caused a strengthening of the aggregate matrix and accordingly, fines
   served as a ``stabilizer{''} to fill the voids and increase density in
   the ballast aggregate matrix.}},

   on Monte Carlo techniques to emulate the transmission-constrained hourly
   day ahead markets (DAMs) over longer term periods. Salient
   characteristics of the approach are the ability to represent the spatial
   and temporal correlation of the loads and the renewable resources, the
   ability to explicitly represent the payback characteristics of DRRs and
   the deployment of effective strategies to provide computational
   tractability for large-scale grids. We illustrate the application of the
   approach to a modified version of the WECC 240 bus-system to perform
   various study cases to evaluate the economics, emissions and reliability
   metrics. The studies illustrate the strong capabilities of the approach
   and provide insights into the impacts of deepening penetration of DRRs
   under different intensity levels.}},

Abstract = {{The use of LC filters between inverter and motor terminals results in
   undesirable resonant oscillations in motor voltages and currents.
   Because passive damping methods employ physical resistors to suppress
   these oscillations, they contribute to additional losses. Lossless
   active damping methods with virtual resistors have been explored in the
   literature as a viable alternative. In a typical active damping
   implementation, current flow in a virtual resistor across the filter
   capacitor is emulated in a control loop using motor voltage feedback.
   Conventionally, the virtual resistance value is fixed based on empirical
   rules and left unchanged for all operating conditions. Choosing the
   resistance value is important, because high values may provide
   insufficient damping, whereas low values can lead to excessive damping
   and cause degraded dynamic response. A small-signal transfer
   function-based approach is developed in this paper for active damping
   design, based on operating conditions and dynamic tuning of the virtual
   resistance. With the control scheme implemented in a d-q frame, it
   provides the flexibility of using a differential damping approach in
   which the d and q axis resistance values need not be equal. Simulations
   and experimental results are provided for an active-damped,
   field-oriented-control based induction motor drive. Results confirm the
   effectiveness of active damping in mitigating resonance effects. This
   adds new degrees of freedom to the design of inverter output filters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper assesses short-term induction motor torque capabilities and
   investigates field-weakening strategies to provide high momentary torque
   via vector controllers. Scalar controllers reduce voltage below the base
   speed to avoid magnetic saturation and do not completely utilize the
   available dc bus voltage. Vector controllers achieve decoupled control
   of torque and flux, and can use available dc bus voltage below the base
   speed without saturating the machine. Compared to maximum
   torque-per-ampere control, the study aimed to maximize momentary torque
   limited only by the dc bus voltage. Results for vector controllers show
   that field-oriented-controlled induction motor drives provide the
   highest peak torque capability at low speeds, whereas direct
   torque-controlled drives provide higher peak torque at high speeds. For
   the test machine, these controllers are shown to support up to 2.5 times

Abstract = {{An important challenge in the design of air-core superconducting
   machines is the containment of the magnetic fields within the electric
   machine. Current solutions result in large reductions of the high power
   density achievable through the use of superconducting windings. To
   address this challenge, an actively shielded electromagnet design, an
   approach commonly used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) magnet
   designs, is considered. This topology utilizes a set of main coils to
   produce the armature flux density, while including another set of
   oppositely excited compensating coils to mitigate the fields radiating
   outside the machine. This approach eliminates or reduces the use of
   steel in a passive magnetic shield, allowing for very high power density
   machines. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization scheme is
   introduced to minimize two competing objectives, superconducting coil
   usage and machine volume. Results show a 74\% decrease in volume with a
   104\% increase in superconductor usage.}},

Abstract = {{Applications of motor drives, ranging from automotive traction to
   more-electric aircraft, have widely varying speed and torque demands.
   With extensive use of inverter-fed drives, loss minimization techniques
   for such applications have evolved over the past few decades. Previous
   work on loss minimization has mainly focused on specific drive
   components. Component-level loss minimization, however, will not
   guarantee minimum total loss in the drive system. In this paper, a
   system-level loss minimization method is developed using a comprehensive
   loss model, to achieve true minimum total loss in the system. The total
   loss obtained is lower for the proposed system-based minimization than
   the component-based methods such as machine loss minimization, torque
   maximization per stator ampere and dc-link loss minimization. Simulation
   and experimental results for a sample drive cycle are presented to
   verify the benefits of the proposed scheme for an induction motor drive.
   Results suggest system loss reduction of about 7\%, when compared to
   machine-based optimization, in high-variability applications.}},

Abstract = {{To avoid unresponsiveness, a core part of mobile development is
   asynchronous programming. Android provides several async constructs that
   developers can use. However, developers can still use the inappropriate
   async constructs, which result in memory leaks, lost results, and wasted
   energy. Fortunately, refactoring tools can eliminate these problems by
   transforming async code to use the appropriate constructs.
   In this paper we conducted a formative study on a corpus of 611
   widely-used Android apps to map the asynchronous landscape of Android
   apps, understand how developers retrofit asynchrony, and learn about
   barriers encountered by developers. Based on this study, we designed,
   implemented, and evaluated ASYNCDROID, a refactoring tool which enables
   Android developers to transform existing improperly-used async
   constructs into correct constructs. Our empirical evaluation shows that
   ASYNCDROID is applicable, accurate, and saves developers effort. We
   submitted 45 refactoring patches, and developers consider that the
   refactorings are useful.}},

Abstract = {{Running compute-intensive or blocking I/O operations in the UI event
   thread of smartphone apps can severely degrade responsiveness. Despite
   the fact that Android provides several async constructs that developers
   can use, developers can still miss opportunities to encapsulate
   long-running operations in async constructs. On the other hand, they can
   use the inappropriate async constructs, which result in memory leaks,
   lost results, and wasted energy. Fortunately, refactoring tools can
   eliminate these problems by retrofitting asynchrony to sequential code
   and transforming async code to use the appropriate constructs. This demo
   presents two refactoring tools for Android apps: (i) ASYNCHRONIZER, a
   refactoring tool that enables developers to extract long-running
   operations into Android AsyncTask. (ii) ASYNCDROID, a refactoring tool
   which enables developers to transform existing improperly-used AsyncTask
   into Android IntentService.}},

Abstract = {{In a wireless network, users share a limited resource in bandwidth. To
   improve spectral efficiency, the network dynamically allocates channel
   resources and, to avoid collisions, has its users cooperate with each
   other using a medium access control (MAC) protocol. In a MAC protocol,
   the users exchange control messages to establish more efficient data
   communication, but such MAC assumes user compliance and can be
   detrimental when a user misbehaves. An attacker who compromised the
   network can launch a two-pronged denial-of-service (DoS) attack that is
   more devastating than an outsider attack: first, it can send excessive
   reservation requests to waste bandwidth, and second, it can focus its
   power on jamming those channels that it has not reserved. Furthermore,
   the attacker can falsify information to skew the network control
   decisions to its favor.
   To defend against such insider threats, we propose a resource-based
   channel access scheme that holds the attacker accountable for its
   channel reservation. Building on the randomization technology of spread
   spectrum to thwart outsider jamming, our solution comprises of a
   bandwidth allocation component to nullify excessive reservations,
   bandwidth coordination to resolve over-reserved and under-reserved
   spectrum, and power attribution to determine each node's contribution to
   the received power. We analyze our scheme theoretically and validate it
   with WARP-based testbed implementation and MATLAB simulations. Our
   results demonstrate superior performance over the typical solutions that
   bypass MAC control when faced against insider adversary, and our scheme
   effectively nullifies the insider attacker threats while retaining the
   MAC benefits between the collaborative users.}},

Abstract = {{Maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) inference on Markov random fields
   (MRF) is the basis of many computer vision applications. Sequential
   tree-reweighted belief propagation (TRW-S) has been shown to provide
   very good inference quality and strong convergence properties. However,
   software TRW-S solvers are slow due to the algorithm's high
   computational requirements. A state-of-the-art FPGA implementation has
   been developed recently, which delivers substantial speedup over
   software.
   In this paper, we improve upon the TRW-S algorithm by using a
   multi-level hierarchical MRF formulation. We demonstrate the benefits of
   Hierarchical-TRW-S over TRW-S, and incorporate the proposed improvements
   on a Convey HC-1 CPU-FPGA hybrid platform. Results using four Middlebury
   stereo vision benchmarks show a 21\% to 53\% reduction in inference time
   compared with the state-of-the-art TRW-S FPGA implementation. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the fastest hardware implementation of
   TRW-S reported so far.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating sparse
   communication channels in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
   systems with phase noise and carrier frequency offset. We consider the
   utilization of the l(q)-norm of the channel as a sparsity-promoting
   regularization term. The corresponding regularized likelihood cost
   function is expressed in a Bayesian fashion as a Maximum a Posteriori
   problem, from which the regularization term is expressed as an a priori
   distribution for the channel. Given the presence of hidden variables
   (i.e. the phase noise), the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is
   utilized. We show that the E-step in the proposed algorithm has a
   closed-form solution for the channel impulse response. In addition, this
   approach is an extension of previous work of the authors, which covers
   the popular Lasso.}},

Abstract = {{Network congestion is one of the primary causes of performance
   degradation, performance variability and poor scaling in
   communication-heavy parallel applications. However, the causes and
   mechanisms of network congestion on modern interconnection networks are
   not well understood. We need new approaches to analyze, model and
   predict this critical behavior in order to improve the performance of
   large-scale parallel applications. This paper applies supervised
   learning algorithms, such as forests of extremely randomized trees and
   gradient boosted regression trees, to perform regression analysis on
   communication data and application execution time. Using data derived
   from multiple executions, we create models to predict the execution time
   of communication-heavy parallel applications. This analysis also
   identifies the features and associated hardware components that have the
   most impact on network congestion and in turn, on execution time. The
   ideas presented in this paper have wide applicability: predicting the
   execution time on a different number of nodes, or different input
   datasets, or even for an unknown code, identifying the best
   configuration parameters for an application, and finding the root causes
   of network congestion on different architectures.}},

Abstract = {{There are several classes of operators on graphs to consider in deciding
   on a collection of building blocks for graph algorithms. One class
   involves traditional graph operations such as breadth first or depth
   first search, finding connected components, spanning trees, cliques and
   other subgraphs, operations for editing graphs and so on. Another class
   consists of linear algebra operators where the matrices somehow depend
   on a graph. It is the latter class of operators that this paper
   addresses. We describe a least squares formulation on graphs that arises
   naturally in problems of ranking, distributed clock synchronization,
   social choice, arbitrage detection, and many other applications. The
   resulting linear systems are analogous to Poisson's equations. We show
   experimental evidence that some iterative methods that work very well
   for continuous domains do not perform well on graphs whereas some such
   methods continue to work well. By studying graph problems that are
   analogous to discretizations of partial differential equations (PDEs)
   one can hope to isolate the specific computational obstacles that graph
   algorithms present due to absence of spatial locality. In contrast, such
   locality is inherent in PDE problems on continuous domains. There is
   also evidence that PDE based methods may suggest improvements suitable
   for implementation on graphs.}},

Abstract = {{Predictive trace analysis (PTA) is an effective approach for detecting
   subtle bugs in concurrent programs. Existing PTA techniques, however,
   are typically based on adhoc algorithms tailored to low-level errors
   such as data races or atomicity violations, and are not applicable to
   high-level properties such as ``a resource must be authenticated before
   use{''} and ``a collection cannot be modified when being iterated
   over{''}. In addition, most techniques assume as input a globally
   ordered trace of events, which is expensive to collect in practice as it
   requires synchronizing all threads. In this paper, we present GPredict:
   a new technique that realizes PTA for generic concurrency properties.
   Moreover, GPredict does not require a global trace but only the local
   traces of each thread, which incurs much less runtime overhead than
   existing techniques. Our key idea is to uniformly model violations of
   concurrency properties and the thread causality as constraints over
   events. With an existing SMT solver, GPredict is able to precisely
   predict property violations allowed by the causal model. Through our
   evaluation using both benchmarks and real world applications, we show
   that GPredict is effective in expressing and predicting generic property
   violations. Moreover, it reduces the runtime overhead of existing
   techniques by 54\% on DaCapo benchmarks on average.}},

Abstract = {{A combinatorial channel specifies a set of possible channel outputs for
   each channel input. A ranked partially ordered set, or ranked poset,
   gives us a notion of up errors and down errors. This allows us to define
   a variety of combinatorial channels. There is a family of channels that
   have the rank-n elements of the poset as the input, and introduce s
   total errors, each performing a different mixture of up errors and down
   errors. If a ranked poset has the ``parallelogram property,{''} the
   family of channels all have the same confusion graph and thus the same
   codes. Furthermore, there is a natural metric on each rank of the poset.
   In the common confusion graph of the channel, vertices are adjacent if
   and only if their distance in this metric is at most 2 s. Although all
   of the channels in the family have the same set of codes, each channel
   corresponds to a different integer linear program that characterizes the
   set of codes. Because each integer linear program has a different
   fractional relaxation, each leads to a different sphere-packing upper
   bound for the codes. We take advantage of this phenomenon by optimizing
   across the family of channels to obtain the best bound. This formulation
   includes many of classical error models, including erasures and
   substitutions in q-ary vectors, Hamming errors in constant weight binary
   codes, insertions and deletions in q-ary strings, the error model of
   subspace codes, the natural error model for compositions, and various
   errors models for permutations.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in computing hardware and novel multimedia applications have
   urged the development of handheld mobile devices such as smartphones and
   PDAs. Video content is increasingly consumed daily in mobile devices as
   well as in first response emergency services. With this significant
   increase of cloud-based video delivery, one of the challenges is how to
   efficiently transmit the bulky videos to resource-constrained mobile
   devices. Despite the attractive features of the widely-used approaches
   on the bitrate adaptation such as DASH standard, video delivery impose
   significant demands on the limited battery capacity of mobile devices.
   Thus the development of efficient approaches to decrease the amount of
   streamed data while maintaining maximum possible quality with the aim of
   increasing the battery lifetime has become a key research topic.
   In this pilot work, we run an offline study towards energy-aware
   delivery of cloud video segments to mobile devices with limited energy
   budget over wireless networks, with the aim of integrating into DASH
   standard. Our results show that our proposed adaptation significantly
   improves the quality of information per unit of energy consumed to
   deliver videos to mobile devices.}},

Abstract = {{Induction motor drives are conventionally operated with a fixed inverter
   dc-link bus voltage. However, low drive speeds will result in low
   modulation index and poor dc bus utilization of the inverter. Aperiodic
   current controllers, such as hysteresis controllers, exhibit increased
   switching frequencies and losses for higher dc-link voltages. These high
   switching frequencies can be avoided by dynamically varying the dc-link
   voltage according to drive operating conditions. In addition to reducing
   inverter switching losses, varying the dc-link voltage also reduces the
   switched voltage magnitude across inverter semiconductor switches,
   potentially increasing inverter reliability. In the proposed work, the
   link voltage is varied by using a front-end dc-dc buck converter. The
   link voltage command is derived using a loss minimization technique that
   uses flux and rotor speed commands to the drive. The effect of
   additional loss from the front-end converter on the total loss is also
   investigated. Simulation and experimental results indicate that a
   variable dc-link voltage supports substantial power electronics loss
   reduction in applications with highly varying speed conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Compressed sensing exploits the sparsity of images or image patches in a
   transform domain or synthesis dictionary to reconstruct images from
   undersampled measurements. In this work, we focus on blind compressed
   sensing, where the underlying sparsifying transform is a priori unknown,
   and propose a framework to simultaneously reconstruct both the image and
   the transform from highly undersampled measurements. The proposed block
   coordinate descent type algorithm involves efficient updates.
   Importantly, we prove that although the proposed formulation is highly
   nonconvex, our algorithm converges to the set of critical points of the
   objective defining the formulation. We illustrate the promise of the
   proposed framework for magnetic resonance image reconstruction from
   highly undersampled k-space measurements. As compared to previous
   methods involving fixed sparsifying transforms, or adaptive synthesis
   dictionaries, our approach is much faster, while also providing
   promising image reconstructions.}},

Abstract = {{Bilinear inverse problems (BIPs), the resolution of two vectors given
   their image under a bilinear mapping, arise in many applications, such
   as blind deconvolution and dictionary learning. However, there are few
   results on the uniqueness of solutions to BIPs. For example, blind gain
   and phase calibration (BGPC) is a structured bilinear inverse problem,
   which arises in inverse rendering in computational relighting, in blind
   gain and phase calibration in sensor array processing, in multichannel
   blind deconvolution (MBD), etc. It is interesting to study the
   uniqueness of solutions to such problems.
   In this paper, we define identifiability of a bilinear inverse problem
   up to a group of transformations. We derive conditions under which the
   solutions can be uniquely determined up to the transformation group.
   Then we apply these results to BGPC and give sufficient conditions for
   unique recovery under subspace or joint sparsity constraints. For BGPC
   with joint sparsity constraints, we develop a procedure to determine the
   relevant transformation groups. We also give necessary conditions in the
   form of tight lower bounds on sample complexities, and demonstrate the
   tightness by numerical experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider event-driven systems, modeled by Petri nets
   (PNs) that are prone to livelocks when left unsupervised. There are
   well-known conditions for the existence of supervisory policies that can
   regulate the sequence of task-executions in such a manner that there are
   no livelocks in the supervised system. We consider the problem of
   modifying a supervisory policy that ensures livelock-freedom for a given
   event-driven system into a similar policy for another event-driven
   system.
   The formal concept of simulation was introduced in the Petri net (PN)
   literature to capture the notion of ``similarity{''} among PNs. In this
   paper we generalize this concept to controlled PNs.
   The set of transitions in a controlled PN are partitioned into
   controllable-and uncontrollable-subsets. The supervisory policy
   determines which of a subset of controllable transitions are permitted
   to fire at any marking of the PN. A transition in a controlled PN can
   fire if and only if (1) there are sufficient tokens in its input places,
   and (2) the supervisory policy permits it to fire. A transition in a
   supervised PN is live if it can be fired, not necessarily immediately,
   from every marking that is reachable under supervision. The synthesis of
   a liveness enforcing supervisory policy (LESP) for a subset of
   transitions in a PN serves as the motivating problem for this work.
   We consider two PNs that in a simulation relationship under supervision,
   and we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of
   a LESP for a subset of transitions in these PNs. Using an illustrative
   example, we show how this observation can be used to synthesize LESPs in
   a PN that simulates another PN. Further investigations into formalizing
   this synthesis procedure is suggested as a future research topic.}},

Abstract = {{Radial distortion for ordinary (non-fisheye) camera lenses has
   traditionally been modeled as an infinite series function of radial
   location of an image pixel from the image center. While there has been
   enough empirical evidence to show that such a model is accurate and
   sufficient for radial distortion calibration, there has not been much
   analysis on the geometric/physical understanding of radial distortion
   from a camera calibration perspective. In this paper, we show using a
   thick-lens imaging model, that the variation of entrance pupil location
   as a function of incident image ray angle is directly responsible for
   radial distortion in captured images. Thus, unlike as proposed in the
   current state-of-the-art in camera calibration, radial distortion and
   entrance pupil movement are equivalent and need not be modeled together.
   By modeling only entrance pupil motion instead of radial distortion, we
   achieve two main benefits; first, we obtain comparable if not better
   pixel re-projection error than traditional methods; second, and more
   importantly, we directly back-project a radially distorted image pixel
   along the true image ray which formed it. Using a thick-lens setting, we
   show that such a back-projection is more accurate than the two-step
   method of undistorting an image pixel and then back-projecting it. We
   have applied this calibration method to the problem of generative
   depth-from-focus using focal stack to get accurate depth estimates.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel approach for jointly estimating targets' head, body
   orientations and conversational groups called F-formations from a
   distant social scene (e.g., a cocktail party captured by surveillance
   cameras). Differing from related works that have (i) coupled head and
   body pose learning by exploiting the limited range of orientations that
   the two can jointly take, or (ii) determined F-formations based on the
   mutual head (but not body) orientations of interactors, we present a
   unified framework to jointly infer both (i) and (ii). Apart from
   exploiting spatial and orientation relationships, we also integrate cues
   pertaining to temporal consistency and occlusions, which are beneficial
   while handling low-resolution data under surveillance settings. Efficacy
   of the joint inference framework reflects via increased head, body pose
   and F-formation estimation accuracy over the state-of-the-art, as
   confirmed by extensive experiments on two social datasets.}},

Abstract = {{A major event often has repercussions on both news media and
   microblogging sites such as Twitter. Reports from mainstream news
   agencies and discussions from Twitter complement each other to form a
   complete picture. An event can have multiple aspects (sub-events)
   describing it from multiple angles, each of which attracts
   opinions/comments posted on Twitter. Mining such reflections is
   interesting to both policy makers and ordinary people seeking
   information. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to mine
   multi-aspect reflections of news events in Twitter. We propose a novel
   and efficient dynamic hierarchical entity-aware event discovery model to
   learn news events and their multiple aspects. The aspects of an event
   are linked to their reflections in Twitter by a bootstrapped dataless
   classification scheme, which elegantly handles the challenges of
   selecting informative tweets under overwhelming noise and bridging the
   vocabularies of news and tweets. In addition, we demonstrate that our
   framework naturally generates an informative presentation of each event
   with entity graphs, time spans, news summaries and tweet highlights to
   facilitate user digestion.}},

   developed based on the augmented electric field integral equation. This
   method rigorously models dielectrics and conductors to solve circuit

   rigorously and solving both the internal and external problems with the
   augmented electric field integral equation, accurate results for
   dielectrics are obtained efficiently. The conductors, however, are
   modeled as highly lossy dielectrics. A novel integration technique is
   analyzed and adopted to capture the wave properties inside the
   conductors. A strategy of integrating this method with the mixed-form
   fast multipole algorithm is presented. With the fast algorithm, more
   complicated, multi-scale structures with a large number of unknowns can
   be solved. Some numerical results show the capability of this method to

Abstract = {{The flow of returned products is becoming a significant concern for many
   manufacturers. The total value of commercial returns, which is defined
   as products returned by customers for any reasons within a specified
   warranty period, is estimated at about \$100 billion a year in the
   United States. Therefore, these returns need to be remanufactured,
   recycled, and reused in order to utilize their value and reduce the
   environmental impact and disposal costs. In this research, various
   aspects influencing the efficiency of the remanufacturing activities
   have been studied with the main objective of maximizing the net profit
   for the manufacturer. Two key decision policies affecting the
   performance of such systems are the target quality for components used
   in the primary product and duration of the time returned products are
   accumulated before they are remanufactured. The major contribution of
   this research is the incorporation of a customer quality tolerance
   function to estimate product return rate. Since with a given level of
   product deficiency some customers may decide to return a product while
   others would be happy to keep it, inclusion this function reflects a
   more realistic approach for estimation of the return rate. The
   application of the proposed model has been demonstrated by several

Abstract = {{We propose a clean-slate, holistic approach to the design of secure
   protocols for wireless ad-hoc networks. We design a protocol that
   enables a collection of distributed nodes to emerge from a primordial
   birth and form a functioning network. We consider the case when nodes
   are synchronized and the network is closed, in that no other nodes can
   join. We define a game between protocols and adversarial nodes, and
   describe a protocol that is guaranteed to achieve the max-min payoff
   regardless of what the adversarial nodes do. Moreover, even though the
   adversarial nodes always know the protocol a priori, we show an even
   stronger result; the protocol is guaranteed to achieve the min-max
   payoff. Hence there is a saddle point in the game between protocols and
   adversarial strategies. Finally, we show that the adversarial nodes are
   in effect, strategically confined to either jamming or conforming to the
   protocol. These guarantees are contingent on a set of underlying model
   assumptions, and cease to be valid if the assumptions are violated.}},

   protocols for wireless ad-hoc networks proposed in part one. We consider
   the case when the nodes are not synchronized, but instead have local
   clocks that are relatively affine. In addition, the network is open in
   that nodes can enter at arbitrary times. To account for this new
   behavior, we make substantial revisions to the protocol in part one. We
   define a game between protocols for open, unsynchronized nodes and the
   strategies of adversarial nodes. We show that the same guarantees in
   part one also apply in this game: the protocol not only achieves the
   max-min utility, but the min-max utility as well. That is, there is a
   saddle point in the game, and furthermore, the adversarial nodes are
   effectively limited to either jamming or conforming with the protocol.}},

   transit. Many researchers have been working on how to control congestion
   in end-to-end communication network. Yet, much progress was not achieved

   either delay or packet loss. Combination of these two parameters rarely
   exists. This paper considers Queuing Delay (QD), Processing Delay
   (Dproc) and Loss Rate Per Second (LRPS) as input parameters at Fuzzy
   Logic Controller. Making use of ternary valued and penta valued logics

Abstract = {{Triple patterning lithography (TPL) has been recognized as one of the
   most promising techniques for 14/10nm technology node. In this paper, we
   applied triple patterning lithography on standard cell based designs,
   and proposed a novel algorithm to solve the problem. The algorithm
   guarantees to find a legal TPL decomposition with optimal number of
   stitches if one exists. A graph model is proposed to reduce the number
   of vertices in the solution graph, and a fast approach is developed to
   achieve simultaneous runtime and memory improvement. An efficient
   approach to limit the number of stitches is also proposed, which greatly
   reduces the total number of stitch candidates and enables an incremental
   implementation of the algorithm. Experimental results shows that the
   proposed algorithm is very efficient, which achieves 39.1\% runtime
   improvement and 18.4\% memory reduction compared with the
   state-of-the-art TPL algorithm on the same problem.}},

Abstract = {{Electron beam lithography (EBL) is a very promising candidate for
   integrated circuit (IC) fabrication beyond the 10 nm technology node. To
   address its throughput issue, the Character Projection (CP) technique
   has been proposed, and its stencil planning can be optimized with aware
   of overlapping characters. However, the top level 2D stencil planning
   problem has been proved to be an NP-hard problem. As its most essential
   step, the 1D row ordering is believed hard as well, and no polynomial
   time optimal solution has been provided so far. In this paper, we
   propose a polynomial time optimal algorithm to solve the row ordering
   problem, which serves as the major subroutine for the entire stencil
   planning problem. Proof and experimental results are also provided to
   verify the correctness and efficiency of our algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The A-Phi formulation with generalized Lorenz gauge is free of
   catastrophic breakdown at low frequencies. In the formulation, A and Phi
   are completely separated and Maxwell's equations are reduced into two
   independent equations pertinent to A and Phi, respectively. This,
   however, leads to more complicated equations in contrast to the
   traditional A-Phi formulation, which makes the numerical representation
   of the physical quantities challenging, especially for A. By virtue of
   the differential forms theory and Whitney elements, both A and Phi are
   appropriately represented. The condition of the resultant matrix system
   is well-controlled as frequency becomes low, even approaches to 0. The
   generalized-Lorenz gauged A-Phi formulation is applied to model
   low-frequency circuits at mu m lengthscale.}},

Abstract = {{Change-point detection is of great interest in applications such as
   target tracking, anomaly detection and trend filtering. In many cases,
   it is also desirable to localize the change-point, if it exists.
   Motivated by the unprecedented scale and rate of modern high-dimensional
   streaming data, we propose a change-point detection and estimation
   procedure based on data sketching, which only requires a single sketch
   per high-dimensional data vector, by cyclically applying a small set of
   Gaussian sketching vectors. We demonstrate that when the underlying
   changes exhibit certain low-dimensional structures, such as sparsity,
   and the signal-to-noise ratio is not too small, the change-points can be
   reliably detected and located with a small number of sketching vectors
   based on filtering via convex optimization. Our procedure can be
   implemented in an online fashion to handle multiple change-points, since
   it sequentially operates on small windows of observations.}},

Abstract = {{Real time non-contact heart rate detection is performed by using
   different methods for periodic signal detection in noise. Heart rate is
   estimated from a scalar signal formed from the average color values of
   the observed skin from videos recorded previously at first, and then
   captured in real time with a built-in laptop webcam. Cramer-Rao lower
   bounds are calculated as a function of SNR for an assumed parametric
   model, and heart rate is detected via autocorrelation, maximum
   likelihood and Fourier-based methods. The performance is evaluated by
   comparing the error rates for different detection techniques in each
   case.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive loading is commonly applied to monopole and dipole antennas to
   maintain desirable electrical characteristics as the size of the antenna
   is reduced. Studies relying on parametric techniques have yielded design
   guidelines for optimal load placement. The use of characteristic mode
   theory, however, provides an alternative method to understand the
   currents on the antenna structure and offers insight for optimal load
   placement. In this work an electrically small dipole antenna is
   investigated using characteristic mode theory. Although in the
   electrically small regime the total antenna current is composed
   primarily of a single characteristic mode, higher order modes contribute
   strongly to the change in the dominant mode as the loading magnitude is
   increased. Understanding the effect of higher order characteristic modes
   in loaded antenna structures provides insight for load placement
   strategies.}},

   project, there is little opportunity to leverage ongoing research work
   to reduce curation costs or conversely, to leverage curation efforts to
   improve research productivity. In the Sustainable Environment Actionable
   Data (SEAD) project, we have envisioned a more active approach to data
   curation and preservation in which these processes occur in parallel
   with research and generate sufficient short and long-term return on
   researcher investments for self-interest to drive their adoption. In
   this paper, we describe the conceptual framework motivating the SEAD
   project and the suite of data services we have developed and deployed as
   an initial implementation of this approach. Use cases in which these
   services can reduce curation effort and aid ongoing research are
   highlighted and, based on our experience to date, we identify some key
   architectural features of our approach as well as open challenges to

Abstract = {{The correlation between disease pathology and tissue stiffness can be
   exploited to detect and potentially diagnose abnormal tissue states.
   Elastography is an imaging modality that attempts to image tissue
   stiffness by measuring local displacements caused by an applied force
   and calculating a strain map. Some elasticity imaging techniques attempt
   to assign a material parameter, such as Young's or shear modulus, to the
   imaged region in an effort to increase specificity. Unfortunately, the
   inversion techniques require many simplifying assumptions which lead to
   errors in the parameter estimates. One possible solution to increase
   accuracy in estimation is to first build an empirical model of the
   tissue using measured force-displacement data, thus eliminating the need
   for a priori assumptions. We propose the use of informational models for
   this purpose.}},

   proposed to solve the resulting optimization problem. Representative
   results demonstrate that compared to the conventional MRF
   reconstruction, the proposed method yields improved accuracy and/or
   reduced acquisition time. Moreover, the proposed formulation enables
   theoretical analysis of MRF. For example, we show that with the gridding
   reconstruction as an initialization, the first iteration of the proposed
   method exactly produces the conventional MRF reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the long-standing spectral quantitation problem in
   magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Although a large body
   of work has been done to develop robust solutions to the problem for
   practical MRSI applications, the problem remains challenging due to low
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and model nonlinearity. Building on the
   existing work on the use of prior knowledge (in the form of spectral
   basis) for spectral estimation, this paper reformulates spectral
   quantitation as a joint estimation problem, and utilizes a
   regularization framework to enforce spatial constraints (e.g., spatial
   smoothness or transform sparsity) on the spectral parameters. Simulation
   and experimental results show that the proposed method, by exploiting
   both the spatial and spectral characteristics of the underlying signals,
   can significantly improve the estimation accuracy of the spectral
   parameters over state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{A modeling and simulation based methodology is proposed to study the
   power flow dynamics of commercial aircraft electrical systems in the
   context of increasing aircraft electrification. The crucial elements of
   the aircraft electrical system are power sources (synchronous generators
   and batteries), power converters (transformers, rectifiers and
   inverters), and electrical loads (ac and dc). Individual components are
   modeled to incorporate their dynamic behavior and to interface with
   other components. These component models are assembled into a
   representative aircraft electrical system for simulation and then trade
   studies are performed to analyze component sizing, design architecture,
   fault conditions, and efficiency calculations. The developed models
   enable components to be scaled to various power levels. A major
   challenge involved in simulating extensive systems is to achieve an
   optimum balance between simulation time and the desired level of detail
   associated with the results. This work makes use of a combination of
   dynamical models and steady state average models based on their levels
   of criticality. The current modeling approach on a sample 5.3 hour
   flight mission has been shown to execute at a speed 4x faster than real

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a series-stacked partial power processing
   architecture and the associated control scheme for double-line-frequency
   power pulsation decoupling in single phase inverter/rectifier
   applications. The proposed architecture exploits series stacking of the
   energy storage capacitors and a buffer converter across the DC bus such
   that the buffer converter only experiences low voltage stress and
   processes only a fraction of the total buffer power, while still
   maintaining a close to ripple free DC bus voltage. Such arrangement
   results in improved efficiency and higher energy density compared to
   conventional active decoupling solutions. A control scheme is proposed
   to exploit the small remaining bus ripple to compensate the power loss
   in the buffer converter and balance the power cycle of the architecture.
   A 2 kW hardware prototype has been built to demonstrate the benefit of
   the proposed solution. The hardware prototype achieves significant
   volume reduction compared to the conventional passive decoupling
   solution. An energy density of 611 W/in(3) ( by component volume) for
   the hardware prototype and an efficiency above 97.9\% across a wide
   range of power and voltage levels has been experimentally verified.}},

Abstract = {{In a data stream management system (DSMS), users register continuous
   queries, and receive result updates as data arrive and expire. We focus
   on applications with real-time constraints, in which the user must
   receive each result update within a given period after the update
   occurs. To handle fast data, the DSMS is commonly placed on top of a
   cloud infrastructure. Because stream properties such as arrival rates
   can fluctuate unpredictably, cloud resources must be dynamically
   provisioned and scheduled accordingly to ensure real-time response. It
   is essential, for the existing systems or future developments, to
   possess the ability of scheduling resources dynamically according to the
   current workload, in order to avoid wasting resources, or failing in
   delivering correct results on time.
   Motivated by this, we propose DRS, a novel dynamic resource scheduler
   for cloud-based DSMSs. DRS overcomes three fundamental challenges: (a)
   how to model the relationship between the provisioned resources and
   query response time (b) where to best place resources; and (c) how to
   measure system load with minimal overhead. In particular, DRS includes
   an accurate performance model based on the theory of Jackson open
   queueing networks and is capable of handling arbitrary operator
   topologies, possibly with loops, splits and joins. Extensive experiments
   with real data confirm that DRS achieves real-time response with close
   to optimal resource consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Today's industry emphasize greatly on data-driven and data engineering
   technologies, triggering a tremendous amount of structured and
   unstructured data across different domains. As a result of which,
   semantic information is implicitly available in the knowledge base,
   mainly in the form of data descriptions, and needs to be extracted
   automatically to better serve the users' need. But how to deliver the
   data to the end-users in an effective and efficient way, has posed a new
   challenge, particularly in the context of big data and mobile computing.
   Traditional search-based approach may suffer from the degraded user
   experience or scalability. It is very essential to understand meaning
   (i.e., semantics) rather than pure keywords matching, that might lead to
   entirely spurious results of no relevance. In this paper, we present the
   usage of an Augmented Reality (AR) solution to bridge the existing
   semantic data and information with the real-world physical objects. The
   AR solution - HD4AR (Hybrid 4-Dimensional Augmented Reality) has been
   commercialized as a startup company to provide AR service to industry
   patterns to associate valuable semantic information with the objects in
   specific contexts, so that users can easily retrieve the data by
   snapping a photo and having the semantic information rendered on the
   photo accurately and quickly. Followed by a brief overview of the
   technology, we present a few use cases as well as the lessons learned
   from the industry collaboration experience.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated architectures such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and
   MICs (Many Integrated Cores) have been proven to increase the
   performance of many algorithms compared to their CPU counterparts and
   are widely available in local, campus-wide and national infrastructures,
   however, their utilization is not following the same pace as their
   deployment. Reasons for the underutilization lay partly on the software
   side with proprietary and complex interfaces for development and usage.
   A common API providing an extra layer to abstract the differences and
   specific characteristics of those architectures would deliver a far more
   portable interface for application developers. This cloud challenge
   proposal presents such an API that addresses these issues using a
   container-based approach. The resulting environment provides
   Docker-based containers for deploying accelerator libraries, such as
   CUDA Toolkit, OpenCL and OpenACC, onto a wide variety of different
   platforms and operating systems. By leveraging the container approach,
   we can overlay accelerator libraries onto the host without needing to be
   concerned about the intricacies of underlying operating system of the
   host. Docker therefore provides the advantage of being easily applicable
   on diverse architectures, virtualizing the necessary environment and
   including libraries as well as applications in a standardized way. The
   novelty of our approach is the extra layer for utilization and device
   discovery in this layer improving the usability and uniform development
   of accelerated methods with direct access to resources.}},

   that include people and machines, requires understanding their
   respective behavioral properties. The task of decision fusion is
   considered and the performance of people is compared to the optimal

   decision fusion in a stochastic manner dependent on various factors,
   whereas optimal rule is deterministic. A Bayesian hierarchical model is
   developed to characterize the observed human behavior. This model
   captures the differences observed in people at individual level, crowd
   level, and population level. The implications of such a model on
   developing large-scale human-machine systems are presented by developing
   optimal decision fusion trees with both human and machine agents.}},

Abstract = {{Wide-area situational awareness of grid operators and regional
   reliability coordinators for large-scale interconnected power systems
   are essential to prevent broad cascading outages. The need to enhance
   the power system situational awareness has been increasingly acute over
   the last decade as the grid evolves dramatically. The fast installation
   of phasor measurement units ( PMUs) over the world generates large
   amounts of data available for event detection and feature extraction
   applications. As such, we devote this work to present a methodology for
   analyzing volumes of PMU measurement data and extracting information for
   effective event detection and decision making in a real-time fashion. To
   do so, we apply the principal component analysis ( PCA) to process the
   obtained measurements in order to detect abnormal system behavior and
   adopt some visualizations to better present the extracted information
   related to the event. This PCA-based method is capable to directly show
   the location, magnitude, type and some other information related to the
   event to help the system operator produce better informed decisions. It
   can also show the similarity of bus dynamic behavior information hidden
   in the time-varying data. We illustrate the application of the PCA-based
   method using the Illinois 42-bus and the WECC 1,511-generator system
   models. To address the heavier computational burdens as the system size
   increases, we further propose a partitional PCA ( PPCA) based method
   with improvement in computation time compared to the PCA-based method.
   Case studies are carried out on a large-sacle system to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the PPCA-based method for real-time event detection.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control algorithm works
   well for the wired networks where most of the timeouts and 3-dupacks are
   the result of congestion. In the wireless networks, where random segment
   loss due to bit errors is a dominant concern, the arrival of duplicate
   acknowledgements or even the retransmission timeouts do not necessarily
   denote congestion. In those cases, throttling transmission rate is not
   necessary rather detrimental. For this reason, existing TCP congestion
   control algorithms fail to perform well in wireless networks. In this
   paper, we propose a new TCP congestion control algorithm TCP NewReno+
   that performs better in wireless networks. We tested our proposed
   algorithm using the network simulator (ns-2) and it shows better
   performance than many other TCP variants in the wired, wireless and the
   mixed networks.}},

Abstract = {{High performance motion systems play an important role in modern
   technology especially in the area of metrology and process equipment
   related to the field of micro- and nanotechnology. The purpose of this
   study is to show how to properly design and fabricate prototyped
   mechanisms that integrate metal-polymer flexural pivots for precision
   motion applications. Finite element simulations are used to understand
   the mechanical behavior of these components leading to dimensions that
   minimize the work done by the polymer structures. Simulations indicate
   that, the penetration distance of the metallic inserts into the polymer
   structures should be around one half of the total insert length and that
   the profile of the pressure interference can be modified to enhance the
   performance of the composite structure. A cantilever beam with a
   flexural pivot is used to test the performance of the design and a
   piezoelectric-actuated four bar mechanism is prototyped and studied as a
   general application of these types of structures to the precision motion
   field. The methodology implemented in this work poses a simple and
   affordable way to fabricate, assemble and customize low-cost devices for

Abstract = {{Based on the invention and operation of the transistor, the alloy diode
   laser, the quantum-well diode laser and the high-speed heterojunction
   bipolar transistor (HBT), we have invented and realized now a transistor
   laser (TL). The transistor laser is a three-terminal technology
   providing coupling and the coherent light emission in the transistor.
   The quantum-well (QW) heterojunction bipolar transistor laser,
   inherently a fast switching device, operates by transporting a small
   minority base charge density similar to 10(16) cm(-3) over a nanoscale
   base thickness (< 900 A) in picoseconds. The TL, owing to its fast
   recombination speed, its unique three-terminal configuration, and
   complementary nature of its optical and electrical collector output
   signals, enables resonance-free base current and collector voltage
   modulation. It is a compact source of electro-optical applications such
   as nonlinear signal mixing, frequency multiplication, negative feedback,
   and optoelectronics logic gates. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2015}},

Abstract = {{The objective of soft tissue quantitative ultrasound (QUS) is to improve
   diagnostic ultrasound imaging capabilities via quantitative outcomes.
   Over the past three or so decades, there have been an increasing number
   of QUS successes. A temporal view moves us back in history almost six
   decades when techniques and theoretical developments were in their
   earliest stages that impacted modern QUS successes. The earliest
   theoretical developments and techniques some six decades ago can be
   attributed to Lev Chernov, Philip Morse, Herman Feshbach, Uno Ingard,
   John Wild and Jack Reid. Later, Floyd Dunn developed important views as
   to how connective tissue affected the interaction between ultrasound and
   soft tissue. Then, as the theory of wave propagation in soft tissues
   with random inhomogeneities was extended and applied by Fred Lizzi, Jim
   Zagzebski and Mike Insana (and their colleagues), contemporary QUS
   successes started to emerge. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

   balances the need to dissipate entropy with the redundancy of the code
   employed. A bound from the entropy dissipation capability of noisy logic

Abstract = {{In this paper, a solution to the double curl equation with generalized
   Coulomb gauge is proposed based on the vectorial representation of the
   magnetic vector potential. Coulomb gauge is applied to remove the null
   space of the curl operator and hence the uniqueness of the solution is
   guaranteed. However, as the divergence operator cannot act on the
   curl-conforming edge basis functions directly, the magnetic vector
   potential is used to be represented by nodal finite elements. Inspired
   by the mapping of Whitney forms by mathematical operators and Hodge
   operators, the divergence of the magnetic vector potential, as a whole,
   can be approximated by scalar basis functions. Hence, the magnetic
   vector potential can be expanded by vector basis functions, and the
   original equation can be rewritten in a generalized form and solved in a
   more natural and accurate way.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes a 1D adaptation (Hall et al., Math Mech Solids,
   2014) of the reactive fluid-solid mixture theory of Hall and Rajagopal
   (Math Mech Solids 17(2): 131-164, 2012), which considers an anisotropic
   viscous fluid diffusing and chemically reacting with an anisotropic
   elastic solid. The present implementation introduces a stabilized mixed
   finite element method for advection-diffusion-reaction phenomena, which
   is applied to 1D isothermal problems involving Fickian diffusion,
   oxidation of PMR-15 polyimide resin, and slurry infiltration. The energy
   and entropy production relations are captured via a Lagrange multiplier
   that results from imposing the constraint of maximum rate of entropy
   production, reducing the primary PDEs to the balance equations of mass
   and linear momentum for the fluid and the solid, together with an
   equation for the Lagrange multiplier. The Fickian diffusion application
   considers a hyperbolic firstorder system with a boundary discontinuity
   and stable approach to the usual parabolic model. Results of the
   oxidation modeling of Tandon et al. (Polym Degrad Stab 91(8): 1861-1869,
   2006) are recovered by employing the reaction kinetics model and
   properties assumed there, while providing in addition the individual
   constituent kinematic and kinetic behaviors, thus adding rich
   interpretive detail in comparison to the original treatment (Tandon et
   al., Polym Degrad Stab 91 (8): 1861-1869, 2006); two adjustable
   parameters describing coupled chemomechanical and purely chemical
   dissipation are added. The slurry infiltration application simulates the
   imposed mass deposition process and consequent effects on the kinematic
   and kinetic behaviors of the constituents.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of deformable capsules in flow can require representation of
   a challengingly broad range of length scales. This is especially true
   for red blood cells, because they deform so significantly under
   physiological flow conditions. We discuss requisite simulation fidelity
   from the perspective of resolution, which we distinguish from the
   often-cited convergence order of a method. Resolution measures error at
   the finite discretization (e.g. mesh density) of actual simulations, and
   can therefore be a valuable metric in assessing methods for practical
   simulations. This is especially the case in chaotic multi-body cellular
   flow, for which the pertinent measures of convergence are statistical.
   Two model configurations are presented and analyzed using a particular
   high-resolution boundary integral solver: relaxation of a perturbed
   spherical capsule and the finite-deformation of a flowing red blood cell
   in a narrow round tube. Resolution needs depend strongly on the
   observable of interest. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency-domain analysis has been successfully used to (i) predict the
   amplification of traffic oscillations along a platoon of vehicles with
   nonlinear car-following laws and (ii) measure traffic oscillation
   properties (e.g., periodicity, magnitude) from field data. This paper
   proposes a new method to calibrate nonlinear car-following laws based on
   real-world vehicle trajectories, such that oscillation prediction (based
   on the calibrated car-following laws) and measurement from the same data
   can be compared and validated. This calibration method, for the first
   time, takes into account not only the driver's car-following behavior
   but also the vehicle trajectory's time-domain (e.g., location, speed)
   and frequency-domain properties (e.g., peak oscillation amplitude). We
   use Newell's car-following model (1961) as an example and calibrate its
   parameters based on a penalty-based maximum likelihood estimation
   procedure. A series of experiments using Next Generation Simulation
   (NGSIM) data are conducted to illustrate the applicability and
   performance of the proposed approach. Results show that the calibrated
   car-following models are able to simultaneously reproduce observed
   driver behavior, time-domain trajectories, and oscillation propagation
   along the platoon with reasonable accuracy. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{A significant body of research demonstrates strong connections between
   social connectedness, stress, and health. However, to date it is unclear
   whether the beneficial aspects of social connectedness are due to
   quantity, quality, stability, or role within the network. Here we
   describe a Bluetooth LE proximity sensor based on the Intel Edison that
   allows us to track interpersonal distances as function of time while
   triangulating absolute position. This enables us not only to identify
   the duration and frequency of social contacts, but also to determine who
   approaches whom-a feature that is necessary in order to establish social
   hierarchy structures within the group.}},

Abstract = {{Through silicon via (TSV) is a critical element for three-dimensional
   (3D) integration of devices in vertically multilevel stack-die
   microelectronic packages. In this paper, the microstructure evolution of
   TSV-Cu under thermal cycling was studied and the topography of TSVs
   under thermal cycling tests was examined by white light interferometer.
   It was found that the Cu was intrude inside the Si die during the test,
   and the intrusion height increased with cycle time and leveled off at
   0.72 mu m and 0.53 mu m for upside and backside after 210 cycles,
   respectively. Besides, the Cu intrusion height at the CU/Si interface is
   greater than that in the middle of Cu bar. in addition, cracks were
   observed at SiO2/Ta barrier interface and between BEOL line and Cu vias.
   It suggests that diffusional creep of the interface is the key for Cu
   via intrusion, the residual stress and thermal stress drive the
   interfacial sliding at interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Incremental path-based timing analysis (PBA) is a pivotal step in the
   timing optimization flow. A core building block analyzes the timing
   path-by-path subject to a critical amount of incremental changes on the
   design. However, this process in nature demands an extremely high
   computational complexity and has been a major bottleneck in accelerating
   timing closure. Therefore, we introduce in this paper a fast and
   scalable algorithm of incremental PBA with MapReduce - a recently
   popular programming paradigm in big-data era. Inspired by the spirit of
   MapReduce, we formulate our problem into tasks that are associated with
   keys and values and perform massively-parallel map and reduce operations
   on a distributed system. Experimental results demonstrated that our
   approach can not only easily analyze huge deisgns in a few minutes, but
   also quickly revalidate the timing after the incremental changes. Our
   results are beneficial for speeding up the lengthy design cycle of
   timing closure.}},

Abstract = {{Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been successfully used to
   accelerate scientific applications due to their computation power and
   the availability of programming languages that make more approachable
   writing scientific applications for GPUs. However, since the programming
   model of GPUs requires offloading all the data to the GPU memory, the
   memory footprint of the application is limited to the size of the GPU
   memory. Multi-GPU systems can make memory limited problems tractable by
   parallelizing the computation and data among the available GPUs.
   Parallelizing applications written for running on single-GPU systems can
   be done (i) at runtime through an environment that captures the memory
   operations and kernel calls and distributes among the available GPUs,
   and (ii) at compile time through a pre-compiler that transforms the
   application for decomposing the data and computation among the available
   GPUs. In this paper we propose a framework and implement a tool that
   transforms an OpenCL application written to run on single-GPU systems
   into one that runs on multi-GPU systems. Based on data dependencies and
   data usage analysis, the application is transformed to decompose data
   and computation among the available GPUs. To reduce the data transfer
   overhead, computation-communication overlapping techniques are utilized.
   We tested our tool using two applications with different data transfer
   requirements, for the application with no data transfer requirements, a
   linear speedup is achieved, while for the application with data
   transfers, the computation-communication overlapping reduces the
   communication overhead by 40\%.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining the resilience of a large-scale system requires an accurate
   view of the system's cyber and physical state. The ability to collect,
   organize, and analyze state central to a system's operation is thus
   important in today's environment, in which the number and sophistication
   of security attacks are increasing. Although a variety of ``sensors{''}
   (e.g., Intrusion Detection Systems, log files, and physical sensors) are
   available to collect system state information, it's difficult for
   administrators to maintain and analyze the diversity of information
   needed to understand a system's security state. Therefore, we have
   developed the Cyber-Physical Topology Language (CPTL) to represent and
   reason about system security. CPTL combines ideas from graph theory and
   formal logics, and provides a framework to capture relationships among
   the diverse types of sensor information. In this paper, we formally
   define CPTL as well as operations on CPTL models that can be used to
   infer a system's security state. We then illustrate the use of CPTL in
   both the enterprise and electrical power domains and provide
   experimental results that illustrate the practicality of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, Bayesian parameter estimation through the consideration
   of the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) criterion is revisited under the prism
   of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. By incorporating a
   sparsity-promoting penalty term in the cost function of the estimation
   problem through the use of an appropriate prior distribution, we show
   how the EM algorithm can be used to efficiently solve the corresponding
   optimization problem. To this end, we rely on variance-mean Gaussian
   mixtures (VMGM) to describe the prior distribution, while we incorporate
   many nice features of these mixtures to our estimation problem. The
   corresponding MAP estimation problem is completely expressed in terms of
   the EM algorithm, which allows for handling nonlinearities and hidden
   variables that cannot be easily handled with traditional methods. For
   comparison purposes, we also develop a Coordinate Descent algorithm for
   the l(q)-norm penalized problem and present the performance results via
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of any solar array is to maximize energy production by
   increasing irradiance absorption and mitigating losses. In large-scale
   arrays, parallel rows of solar panels can shade adjacent rows, reducing
   production owing to effects known as self-shading and diffuse masking.
   For this work, the influence of row spacing and panel tilt angle on
   trade-offs between shading impact and irradiance capture is evaluated. A
   model that takes into account sub-module level mismatch is developed and
   can be applied to a wide range of geographic regions. Additionally, a
   method for simulating large arrays, which utilizes a lookup table of IV
   curves, is proposed. The table circumvents the tedious process of
   generating curves in real-time and allows fast power output

Abstract = {{An important challenge in the design of air-core superconducting
   machines is the containment of the magnetic fields within the electric
   machine. Current solutions result in large reductions of the high power
   density achievable through the use of superconducting windings. To
   address this challenge, an actively shielded electromagnet design, an
   approach commonly used in MRI magnet designs, is considered. This
   topology utilizes a set of main coils to produce armature MMF, while
   including another set of oppositely excited compensating coils to
   mitigate the fields radiating outside the machine. This approach
   eliminates or reduces the use of steel in a passive magnetic shield,
   allowing for very high power density machines. Furthermore, a
   multi-objective optimization scheme is introduced to minimize two
   competing objectives, superconducting coil usage and machine radius.
   Results show a 32\% decrease in machine radius with a 33\% increase in
   coil size.}},

Abstract = {{Nigeria has a population of over 160 million, and just over 50\% have
   electricity access. Many initiatives promote solar energy development to
   mitigate Nigeria's power challenges. This work shows an economic
   valuation of the solar photovoltaic (PV) potential in Nigeria. Assuming
   a 100 megawatts (MW) capacity upgrade, this paper compares distributed
   residential-scale and centralized utility-scale PV configurations.
   Metrics such as levelized cost of energy (LCOE), benefit-cost ratio
   (BCR), net present value (NPV), and payback period, are assessed.
   Results show no possibility of payback under 2013 PV panel cost
   assumptions in either case. However, assuming analysts' expected 2016
   panel prices, payback opportunities as early as 9 years arise in both
   cases. Using Monte Carlo simulation, average values for LCOE and BCR
   were \$0.2109 kWh(-1) and 2.164, respectively, for residential PV and
   \$0.1888 kWh(-1) and 2.345, respectively, for utility PV. It is
   recommended that government provide PV implementation incentives that
   directly tackle initial solar project costs. Future work includes the
   application of optimization theory to find conditions for which LCOE and
   payback period are minimized while BCR and NPV are maximized.}},

Abstract = {{Discussion of the future of the Smart Grid brings with it issues
   regarding the current level of distribution system visibility. Phasor
   Measurement Units (PMU) have been proliferating throughout the electric
   power grid in order to support future distribution system analysis. One
   type of PMU is the Frequency Disturbance Recorder (FDR); it records
   voltage magnitude, frequency, and phase angle at the 120 V outlet level.
   Previous work has introduced ways in which distribution system events
   can be read from this voltage data, but this paper focuses on defining
   similarity measures for comparing detected events. Discrete Signal
   Processing (DSP) techniques such as correlation and convolution can be
   used to determine how similar events are, even in the presence of a time
   delay. Euclidean distance and mean-squared error are used as similarity
   measurements to help confirm the correctness of the time-delay
   estimation. Beyond detecting positively and negatively correlated
   events, the similarity measures support the correlation results by
   determining that some events aren't correlated at all.}},

Abstract = {{Phasor measurement units (PMUs) installed in the power grid are
   currently positioned mainly on the transmission system or in

   consumer voltage level, called mu PMUs, could provide new insight into
   modern power systems. These units can be created more cheaply, an order
   of magnitude less, than current commercial PMUs. For this reason, many
   more PMUs could be deployed and provide a much higher resolution of the
   distribution grid. There are many new applications for such a visible
   grid in post-mortem event analysis and identification, as well as near
   real-time monitoring. This paper describes the hardware limitations
   impact on developing an accurate synchrophasor along with considerations

Abstract = {{Geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) caused by solar storms give rise to
   geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) in the power grid. GICs may
   affect transformers by hot-spot heating and damage, and increase
   reactive power losses in them. They may also cause harmonics, protection
   device misoperation, and loss of reactive power resources, potentially
   leading to a voltage collapse. This paper presents GMD analysis results
   of a large-scale power system, using the recent NERC GMD benchmark
   scenarios of non-uniform peak electric fields, to highlight the
   differences in results compared to the hitherto-conventional approach of
   using uniform electric fields for planning-type GMD studies. In
   addition, two types of parametric analyses to study the impact on steady
   state voltage stability are presented, 1) including transformer reactive
   losses from neighboring regions around a certain footprint to analyze
   the impact of study-system size 2) varying substation grounding
   resistances to understand the effects of their uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{The frequency regulation is an essential part of ancillary services in
   power systems to mitigate the impacts of uncertainty of load and
   variable energy resources (VERs) on system frequency. The battery energy
   storage systems (BESSs), typically with fast response rates, are one of
   the promising technologies to provide the frequency regulation service.
   However, the BESS along is not capable to restore frequency due to its
   limited capacity. As such, a hybrid frequency regulation system
   consisting of BESS and generators is usually more preferred. In this
   study, we first propose an optimal allocation method for regulation
   tasks to minimize the overall regulation cost of the hybrid system. We
   then optimize the regulation capacity of BESS and generators based on
   the optimal allocation method. The application of the proposed methods
   is illustrated with real regulation data from PJM. Simulation results
   indicate that the hybrid regulation system can better reduce frequency
   deviations at a lower cost.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces various electrical and thermal energy generation,
   consumption, and storage components in solar powered low-energy
   buildings. Dynamic management of such energy components is essential
   given the stochastic solar resources. Emphasis is put on power
   electronic HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) drives,
   which can act as an effective electric swing bus to mitigate solar power
   variability. In doing so, grid power flows become substantially more
   constant, reducing the need for fast grid resources or dedicated energy
   storage such as batteries. The concept is equivalent to using building
   thermal energy as virtual dynamic storage in support of power grid
   operation. The paper defines a bandwidth over which such HVAC drives can
   operate. A practical band-pass filter is realized that provides 1) lower
   frequency bounds such that the building maintains consistent room
   temperature via the HVAC system as demonstrated by a thermal modeling
   study, and 2) upper frequency bounds that ensure commanded HVAC fan
   speeds do not update arbitrarily fast. The latter primarily avoids
   acoustic discomfort to users. The combination is illustrated by
   experimental results based on various update rates of a variable
   frequency fan drive over a sample of actual stochastic solar data.
   Building electrical and thermal energy systems modeling by MATLAB is
   addressed throughout the paper, including solar and HVAC systems as well
   as batteries and water tanks.}},

Abstract = {{Procedural learning is the process of skill acquisition that is
   regulated by the basal ganglia, and this learning becomes automated over
   time through cortico-striatal and cortico-cortical connectivity. In the
   current study, we use a common machine learning regression technique to
   investigate how fMRI network connectivity in the subcortical and motor
   networks are able to predict initial performance and training-induced
   improvement in a skill-based cognitive training game, Space Fortress,
   and how these predictions interact with the strategy the trainees were
   given during training. To explore the reliability and validity of our
   findings, we use a range of regression lambda values, sizes of model
   complexity, and connectivity measurements.}},

Abstract = {{In congested urban areas, it remains a pressing challenge to reduce
   unnecessary vehicle circling for parking while at the same time maximize
   parking space utilization. In observance of new information technologies
   that have become readily accessible to drivers and parking agencies, we
   develop a dynamic non-cooperative bi-level model (i.e. Stackelberg
   leader-follower game) to set parking prices in real-time for effective
   parking access and space utilization. The model is expected to fit into
   an integrated parking pricing and management system, where parking
   reservations and transactions are facilitated by sensing and informatics
   infrastructures, that ensures the availability of convenient spaces at
   equilibrium market prices. It is shown with numerical examples that the
   proposed dynamic parking pricing model has the potential to virtually
   eliminate vehicle circling for parking, which results in significant
   reduction in adverse socioeconomic externalities such as traffic
   congestion and emissions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Real-time estimation of the fatigue usage factor of nuclear reactor
   components are helpful tools for on-demand assessment of component
   structural integrity. Real-time measurements of field variables, such as
   stress and strain, along with the use of historic/available
   stress/strain versus fatigue life data and a Bayesian-probabilistic
   framework can not only help to estimate the fatigue usage factor of
   reactor components in real time but also can help to estimate the
   associated confidence bounds. In this paper, a Gaussian Process based
   Bayesian-probabilistic framework is proposed for real-time estimation of
   mean fatigue usages factor and associated probabilistic bounds. The
   preliminary proof of concept was demonstrated through fatigue
   experiments with 316 stainless steel specimens under different
   conditions: a) under 300 degrees C and pressurized water reactor (PWR)
   water chemistry, and b) room temperature and in-air condition. At
   present the proposed probabilistic monitoring approach is not part of
   any code requirements, however the proposed framework is output of a
   futuristic basic research work, which requires more advancement. Also
   the results discussed in the paper are part of very preliminary basic
   research and requires advance validation such as under realistic nuclear

Abstract = {{Personal GeoServices are emerging as an interaction paradigm linking
   users to information rich environments like a university campus or to
   Big Data sources like the Internet of Things by delivering spatially
   intelligent web-services. OpenStreetMap (OSM) constitutes a valuable
   source of spatial base-data that can be extracted, integrated, and
   utilised with such heterogeneous data sources for free. In this paper,
   we present a Personal GeoServices application built on OSM spatial data
   and university-specific business data for staff, faculty, and students.
   While generic products such as Google Maps and Google Earth enable basic
   forms of spatial exploration, the domain of a university campus presents
   specific business information needs, such as ``What classes are
   scheduled in that room over there?{''} and ``How can I get to Prof.
   Murray's office from here?{''} Within the framework of the StratAG
   project (www.StratAG.ie), an eCampus Demonstrator was developed for the
   National University of Ireland Maynooth (NUIM) to assist university
   users in exploring and analysing their surroundings within a detailed
   data environment. This work describes this system in detail, discussing
   the usage of OSM vector data, and providing insights for developers of
   spatial information systems for personalised visual exploration of an

Abstract = {{We describe SYNTACTICDIFF, a novel, general, and efficient edit-based
   method for transforming sequences of words given a reference text
   collection. These transformations can be used directly or can be
   employed as features to represent text data in a wide variety of text
   mining applications. As case studies, we apply SYNTACTICDIFF to three
   quite different tasks, including grammatical error correction, student
   essay clustering and analysis, and native language identification,
   showing its benefit in each case. SYNTACTICDIFF is completely general
   and can thus be potentially applied to any text data in any natural
   language. It is highly efficient, customizable, and able to capture
   syntactic differences from a reference text collection at the sentence,
   document, and subcollection levels. This enables both a rich translation
   method and feature representation for many text mining tasks that deal
   with word usage and syntax beyond bag-of-words.}},

Abstract = {{In-place data manipulation is very desirable in many-core architectures
   with limited on-board memory. This paper deals with the in-place
   implementation of a class of primitives that perform data movements in
   one direction. We call these primitives Data Sliding (DS) algorithms.
   Notable among them are relational algebra primitives (such as select and
   unique), padding to insert empty elements in a data structure, and
   stream compaction to reduce memory requirements. Their in-place
   implementation in a bulk synchronous parallel model, such as GPUs, is
   specially challenging due to the difficulties in synchronizing threads
   executing on different compute units. Using a novel adjacent work-group
   synchronization technique, we propose two algorithmic schemes for
   regular and irregular DS algorithms. With a set of 5 benchmarks, we
   validate our approaches and compare them to the state-of-the-art
   implementations of these benchmarks. Our regular DS algorithms
   demonstrate up to 9.11x and 73.25x on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, respectively,
   the throughput of their competitors. Our irregular DS algorithms
   outperform NVIDIA Thrust library by up to 3.24x on the three most recent

Abstract = {{A high-efficiency high-energy-density buffer architecture is proposed
   for power pulsation decoupling in power conversion between DC and single
   phase AC. We present an active decoupling solution that yields improved
   efficiency and reduced circuit complexity compared to existing
   solutions. By connecting a buffer converter in series with the main
   decoupling capacitor, the main capacitor is allowed larger ripple for
   improved energy utilization (and thus much reduced volume), while the DC
   bus voltage is maintain close to ripple free. The buffer converter has
   low voltage stress and is only processing a small fraction of the total
   power of the entire architecture, allowing a very small active circuit
   volume and very high system efficiency. A control scheme is proposed to
   exploit the small remaining bus ripple to compensate the power loss in
   the power converter and balance the power cycle of the buffer
   architecture. A 2 kW hardware prototype has been built to demonstrate
   the benefit of the proposed solution. The hardware prototype achieves 20
   times capacitance reduction and 2 times overall volume reduction
   compared to the conventional passive decoupling solution. An energy
   density of 110 W/inch(3) and an efficiency above 98.7\% across a wide

Abstract = {{Current data center power delivery architectures consist of many
   cascaded power stages, where the system-level efficiency is dependent on
   the efficiency of the power elements. Recently, series-stacked power
   delivery architectures eliminated this dependency and reported more than
   99\% system-level power conversion efficiencies for data centers. In
   this paper, we address the important start-up and hot-swapping challenge
   of the series-stacked power delivery architectures without sacrificing
   the high power delivery efficiency. We experimentally validate the
   hot-swapping operation on a testbed that includes four series-connected
   12 V, 65 W servers and four differential converters. The results show
   that the continuous operation of the series-stacked servers can be
   maintained, while one of the servers is hot-swapped.}},

Abstract = {{This paper defines a bandwidth over which power electronic HVAC
   (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) drives can operate such
   that when integrated with stochastic solar power they act as an
   effective electric swing bus to mitigate solar power variability. In
   doing so, grid power is shown to be substantially more constant,
   reducing the need for fast grid resources or dedicated energy storage.
   The concept is equivalent to using building thermal energy as virtual
   dynamic storage in support of power grid operation. Two years of solar
   data have been collected on sub-millisecond time scales to test the
   results. Here a three-day sample is used to evaluate efficacy, determine
   solar frequency-domain content, and test a low-pass filtering concept
   introduced to model ideal power compensation. A more practical band-pass
   filter is realized that provides 1) lower frequency bounds such that the
   building maintains consistent room temperature via the HVAC system as
   demonstrated by a thermal modeling study, and 2) upper frequency bounds
   that ensure commanded HVAC fan speeds do not update arbitrarily fast.
   The latter primarily avoids acoustic discomfort to users. The
   combination is illustrated by experimental results based on various
   update rates of a variable frequency fan drive over a sample of actual
   stochastic solar data.}},

   In addition, matched filter and robust ceptral coefficients are applied

Abstract = {{Mapping environmental noise with high resolution on a large scale (such
   as a city) is prohibitively expensive with current approaches, which use
   a large, dense array spanning the entire region of interest, or
   sequential noise measurements at thousands of locations on a dense grid.
   We propose instead a new acoustic measurement scheme using a small
   movable array (for example, mounted on a vehicle driving along the
   streets of a city) to rapidly acquire measurements at many different
   locations. A multiple-point sparse constrained deconvolution approach
   for the mapping of acoustic sources (MPSC-DAMAS) and a multiple-point
   covariance matrix fitting (MP-CMF) approach are developed to accurately
   estimate the locations and powers of stationary noise sources across the
   region of interest. Computer simulations of large region acoustic
   mapping demonstrate that superior resolution and much lower power
   estimation errors are achieved by the proposed approaches compared to
   the state-of-the-art SC-DAMAS approach and CMF approach.}},

Abstract = {{There has been growing evidence recently for the view that social
   networks can be divided into a well connected core, and a sparse
   periphery. This paper describes how such a global description can be
   obtained from local ``dominance{''} relationships between vertices, to
   naturally yield a distributed algorithm for such a decomposition. It is
   shown that the resulting core describes the global structure of the
   network, while also preserving shortest paths, and displaying
   ``expander-like{''} properties. Moreover, the periphery obtained from
   this decomposition consists of a large number of connected components,
   which can be used to identify communities in the network. These are used
   for a `divide-and-conquer' strategy for community detection, where the
   peripheral components are obtained as a pre-processing step to identify
   the small sets most likely to contain communities. The method is
   illustrated using a real world network (DBLP co-authorship network),

Abstract = {{This paper deals with important issue of the aging and deterioration of
   concrete structures: a problem at the forefront of civil engrineering
   research that has profound impact on our society and our way of living.
   Despite the recognized importance of such issue, entrenched practice and
   remediation approaches are, for the most part, empirical and
   fundamentally related only to the lifetime experience of few capable
   professionals. We all need to thank the work of these people but this
   paper argues that such ``modus operandi{''} is only slightly better than
   predicting the future of infrastructure by looking into a crystal ball -
   it is more magic than science. On the contrary, this paper presents a
   different vision in which ``predictions{''} are based on a rigourous
   structural reliability framework equipped with physically-sound
   computational models that are rigorously validated and continually
   updated on the basis of reliable experimental data obtained from both
   destructuve and non-destructuve techniques.}},

   applications such as analysis of electromagnetic interference for a

   the bottleneck of electromagnetic numerical solvers. This stems from the
   fact that to capture objects with different scales, disparate and
   nonuniform meshing is unavoidable. This disparate meshing leads into
   different physics coexistence and consequently results in slow
   convergence of iterative solvers. To remedy this problem, in here, we
   suggest using equivalence principle algorithm which is an efficient

Abstract = {{Post-Hydrothermal Liquefaction Wastewater (PHWW) has a very high
   concentration of ammonium (6200 +/- 106 mg/L), which is an inhibitor for
   the traditional sewage treatment process. The major objectives of this
   study were to: (1) evaluate the capacity of ammonium adsorption from
   PHWW using two zeolites (natural clinoptilolite and activated
   clinoptilolite) as the absorbent; (2) investigate the effects of zeolite
   particle size (0.18 similar to 0.90 mm) and dosage (0.1 similar to 0.5
   g/mL) on ammonium adsorption efficiency; (3) study the regeneration
   methods of the natural clinoptilolite. Results obtained from the
   experiments showed that the optimized particle size and dosage of the
   natural and the activated clinoptilolite were 0.18 similar to 0.30 mm,
   and 0.5 g/mL, corresponding to a highest ammonium adsorption efficiency
   of 51 +/-2\% and 79 +/- 1\%; the ammonium adsorption efficiency of
   zeolite was positively related to the dosage; the smaller the particle
   size, generally the higher the ammonium adsorption efficiency; in
   addition, the activated clinoptilolite had a stronger activity and a
   larger capacity of ammonium ion exchange; when the natural
   clinoptilolite was regenerated with 4 mol/L NaOH and 0.1 mol/L HCl, the
   former was better. Application of zeolite on ammonium-rich PHWW is an
   alternative solution for reducing the concentration of toxic ammonium
   for subsequent utilization of PHWW.}},

   fact common and non-negligible. In this paper, we significantly improve
   the voiced modeling of PAT with a probabilistic model of AM/FM effect,

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a distributed optimal load frequency control (OLFC)
   scheme that replicates the behavior of the economic dispatch process in
   a multi-area power system. Power systems are divided in balancing
   authority (BA) areas that exercise their own load frequency control to
   restore the system frequency and real power interchange to desired
   values. In this paper, we use a simplified model to describe the power
   system dynamic behavior and propose a coordination scheme between BA
   areas in an interconnected power system that decreases the regulation
   amount needed as well as the associated costs by formulating a
   distributed OLFC system. The proposed control scheme is compared with
   traditional automatic generation control (AGC) systems, as well as the
   economic dispatch process. The proposed distributed OLFC system is
   illustrated through the Western Electricity Coordination Council (WECC)
   9-bus 3-machine system.}},

Abstract = {{The open access transmission regime has pushed toward an increase in the
   number of bilateral transactions and to a more intensive use of the
   transmission system. When the transaction can be accommodated with no
   line flow limits being violated for all possible values of the net load,
   the transaction is referred to as worst-case feasible. The ability to
   identify bilateral transactions that are feasible even under the
   worst-case assumed scenario, is of high importance to system operators
   since they can make better decisions about whether to schedule a set of
   bilateral transactions or not. In this study we propose an approach to
   evaluate the impacts of the uncertainties introduced by the network
   structure and the net load in the accommodation of bilateral
   transactions. To this end, we bound the net load uncertainty with a
   convex polytope and deploy a Markov chain model to represent the
   uncertainty in the network structure resulting from component outages.
   We condition on each network configuration and make use of the DC power
   flow to evaluate the uncertainty propagated from the net load to the
   line flows. We also apply a node-connection detection algorithm to avoid
   unnecessary computation of the line flow uncertainty. The proposed
   approach is applied to a benchmark 3-bus test system where the impacts
   of load and network uncertainty on the feasibility of a bilateral
   transaction are analyzed separately. The proposed methodology provides
   physically reasonable results and is applicable to large-scale networks.}},

Abstract = {{This work is a reliability assessment of Nigeria's existing power
   system. A probabilistic framework involving Markov reliability models is
   used to evaluate the ability of available generation to serve Nigeria's
   existing power demand. Resource planning indices, such as reserve margin
   and loss of load probability (LOLP), were evaluated. This study also
   investigates the sensitivity of LOLP to three base load levels (2900,
   3100, 3225 MW) and unit availability assumptions (65\%, 80\%, and 95\%).
   Results show that loss of load probability is extremely sensitive to
   generation availability. For the 2900 MW base load case, LOLP is reduced
   from 83.26\% to 20.50\% moving from 65\% to 95\% unit availability.
   Conclusively, in efforts to improve Nigeria's overall system
   reliability, it behooves resource planners to focus on improving the
   unit availability levels of existing generation even as new reliable
   power resources are installed. Such an energy development strategy is
   likely to be more effective at improving Nigeria's ability to serve its
   ever-increasing load demand. This work can be improved by considering
   transmission line effects and evaluating the economic value of
   reliability in Nigeria.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to the computation of
   line outage angle factors (LOAFs), which relies on the use of angle
   factors (AFs) and power transfer distribution factors (PTDFs). A LOAF
   provides the sensitivity of the voltage angle difference between the
   terminal buses of a transmission line in the event the line is outaged
   to the pre-outage active power flow on the line. Large angle differences
   between the terminal buses of an outaged line can prevent the successful
   reclosure of the line-such an event was a significant contributing
   factor to the 2011 San Diego blackout. The proposed model-based LOAFs,
   along with the AFs and injection shift factors (ISFs), enable the fast
   computation of the impact on the angle across lines of line outages and
   active power injections, and provide system operators a systematic mean
   by which to assess line outage angles and undertake the appropriate
   dispatch actions necessary to alleviate large phase angle differences.
   We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LOAFs with a case study
   carried out on the IEEE 14-bus test system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the effects of vehicle detection (coverage and
   accuracy) on the performance of an oversaturated network with traffic
   signals controlled by a next-generation multi-agent-based system that
   reacts to demands in real time. Several scenarios on a realistic
   simulated network are used to illustrate changes in performance when
   detector inputs are inaccurate and generate discrepancies in the
   estimation of link demands. Then, these results are compared to the
   network with accurate detection but a reduced number of sensors.
   Equivalent system performance from comprehensive sensor coverage but
   with inaccuracies and reduced number of sensors with increased accuracy
   can be found. This approach is proposed to be used for detection design,
   where tradeoffs between performance and coverage are taken into account.
   Results from different patterns of sensor inaccuracies are also
   discussed, providing insights on patterns that may have less impact than
   others. Future work on the effects of demand levels and turning

Abstract = {{Train delay is a critical problem in railroad operations, which has led
   to the development of analytical and simulation based approaches to
   estimate it. With the recent advances in sensing and communication
   technologies, train positioning information is now available to support
   new data driven methods for train delay estimation. In this work, two
   data driven approaches are proposed to estimate train delays based on
   historical and real time information. A historical regression model is
   proposed to estimate future train delays at each station using only past
   performance of the train along the route. Next, several variations of an
   online regression model are proposed to estimate delay using delay
   information of the trains at earlier stations along the current trip, as
   well as delay information of other trains that share the same corridor.
   The proposed methods are tested with data collected on 282 Amtrak trains
   (the largest US passenger railroad service) from 2011 to 2013, which
   consists of more than 100,000 train trips. Compared to prediction based
   on the scheduled time table, the proposed historical regression model
   improves the RMSE estimate of delay by 12\%, while the online proposed
   model improves the RMSE estimate of delay by 60\%.}},

   describe a sensor fusion structure which uses the measurements from

   an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to fuse information from the GPS
   receivers, the monocular camera, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and
   the motor tachometers. In the filter we use pseudoranges and carrier
   phases from the GPS receivers, as opposed to directly using the position
   updates. Experiments were conducted outdoors with an Ascending

   resolution by our tightly coupled initialization, and the robust sensor

Abstract = {{The recent surge in the MAV industry has brought many new prospective
   commercial applications for MAVs. Due to their versatile flight
   capabilities, MAVs are capable of operating in urban and human centric
   environments. However navigating in these environments becomes an
   increasingly difficult task as they are commonly GPS challenged
   environments as well. Low satellite visibility, multipath, and Non-Line
   of Sight (NLOS) errors degrade the GPS-derived navigation solution
   preventing fully autonomous flight. Before widespread commercial
   adoption of MAVs can occur, navigation within GPS-challenged
   environments needs to be safe and reliable.
   In this paper we present a sensor fusion graph augmented by m-estimators
   for MAV trajectory estimation in a GPS-challenged environment. We take a
   probabilistic approach to tight coupling of GPS and IMU sensor data. We
   then apply m-estimation to our sensor fusion graph in order to mitigate
   the multipath and NLOS errors that would otherwise skew our navigation
   solution. Finally we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by
   flight test of an As-cTec Firefly MAV, navigating from an open-skied
   environment into a GPS-challenged environment and estimating its
   trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{The identification and selection of a small set of models that are able
   to well describe and predict the error signals coming from inertial
   sensors is of utmost importance to improve the navigation precision of

   implementation of the WVIC model selection criterion by improving the
   computational efficiency of its associated algorithm. This criterion is
   based on the Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments that was recently
   proposed to estimate the parameters of inertial sensor error models.
   Using this approach, the model selection procedure is included within an
   algorithm that allows it to be executed more efficiently and is
   implemented within a new package in the open-source statistical platform
   R. The efficient implementation of this model selection procedure
   enables engineers and researchers to rapidly identify a restricted set

   of each individual receiver to a single reference state vector and
   attitude of the rigid body comprising the multi-receiver network, offers
   increased information redundancy which brings about increased accuracy,

Abstract = {{Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) provide time-synchronized, accurate and
   precise measurements of instantaneous voltages and currents at many
   locations across the electrical power system. The current
   state-of-the-art time transfer architecture for PMUs uses GPS time
   synchronization. The dependence on GPS for time synchronization
   introduces new vulnerabilities to a power system utilizing PMUs. Thus,
   in our prior work, we proposed and verified with experimental data the
   concept of using multi-receiver position-information-aided vector
   tracking (MRPIAVT) to provide accurate, robust and reliable GPS time
   transfer for PMUs {[}1].
   The MRPIAVT architecture is improved upon in this paper, leading to
   Advanced MRPIAVT. Improvements include modification of the state
   estimation equations such that the state vector contains only the clock
   bias and clock drift states. Updated clock dependent process noise
   covariance matrix used in the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Increased
   pre-detection coherent integration timing. Hardware timing
   synchronization, additional sub-sample software timing synchronization
   and an increased sampling rate. We demonstrate with further experiments,
   the enhanced performance of Advanced MRPIAVT with respect to timing
   accuracy, jamming, multipath and data-level spoofing.}},

Abstract = {{In nature, plants use transpiration to transport water against gravity
   from the soil to their leaves, powering the flow of nutrients throughout
   the plant. During transpiration, water evaporates from the leaves (i.e.
   porous network) and is replenished by the xylem (i.e. vascular channels)
   from the water stored in the soil (i.e. reservoir). In our synthetic
   system, autonomic cooling of a structural composite is accomplished
   using a leaf inspired vascularized coating. In response to an external
   heat load, evaporation occurs from pores in the coating to remove heat.
   The fluid is then replaced by capillary action from an externally
   located reservoir, allowing for continuous operation. Experiments
   demonstrate the cooling performance of the system, its ability to
   self-start and stop, and the ability to remotely locate the reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method for human activity classification in home
   based monitoring. The proposed approach is based on minimum jerk
   (MinJerk), a primary model for smooth path planning employed by human
   motor control in upper-extremity motion. Based on new evidences that
   show common control strategies in lower and upper extremity, MinJerk is
   adapted in our study to estimate the foot motion with fifth order
   polynomial functions. Experimental data are recorded during walking and
   going up and down the stairs using a single inertial measurement unit.
   Features of interest in this study are the optimized curve fitting
   coefficients. Using a structured support vector machine with radial
   basis function, an overall accuracy of 98.6\% is achieved for activity
   classification. The proposed method is also capable of detecting the
   transitions between the movements with accuracy of 99.96\%.}},

   Coordinated Train Control Algorithm}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Pages = {{48-56}},
Abstract = {{Algorithms for current automatic train operation (ATO) focus mainly on
   reducing the mechanical energy of motion for a single train within an
   existing timetable. However, the reuse of regenerative energy is another
   factor that contributes to energy consumption and conservation in multi
   train networks. To improve regenerative energy receptivity and energy
   savings in a bidirectional metro transit network, this study formulated
   a coordinated train control algorithm that was based on genetic
   algorithm techniques. The energy saving potential of different station
   departure time intervals between two opposing trains (synchronization
   time) was tested. Simulation on the Visual C++ platform demonstrated
   that the algorithm could provide an optimal train speed profile with
   better energy performance while also satisfying operational constraints.
   Different synchronization times have different optimization ratios. This
   research was another step to facilitate the development of an ATO
   control algorithm that considers overall energy consumption. Increased
   knowledge of the influence of synchronization time at stations on energy
   consumption in regenerative multitrain networks will also aid in the
   design of more energy-efficient timetables.}},

Abstract = {{Exploiting the sparsity of signals in an adaptive dictionary or
   transform domain benefits various applications in image/video
   processing. As opposed to synthesis dictionary learning, transform
   learning allows for cheap computations, and has been demonstrated to
   perform well in applications such as image denoising. Very recently, we
   proposed methods for online sparsifying transform learning, which are
   particularly useful for processing large-scale or streaming data. Online
   transform learning has good convergence guarantees and enjoys a much
   lower computational cost than online synthesis dictionary learning. In
   this work, we present a video denoising framework based on online 3D
   spatio-temporal sparsifying transform learning. The proposed scheme has
   low computational and memory costs, and can potentially handle streaming
   video. Our numerical experiments show promising performance for the
   proposed video denoising method compared to popular prior or

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) is an emerging quantitative
   magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique that simultaneously acquires
   multiple tissue parameters (e.g., spin density, T-1, and T-2) in an

   recently been proposed for MRF reconstruction. Here we present a new
   model-based reconstruction method within this frame-work to enable
   improved parameter estimation from highly under sampled, noisy k-space
   data. It features a novel mathematical formulation that integrates a
   low-rank image model with the Bloch equation based MR physical model.
   The proposed formulation results in a nonconvex optimization problem,
   for which we develop an efficient iterative algorithm based on variable
   splitting, the alternating direction method of multipliers, and the
   variable projection method. Representative results from numerical

Abstract = {{Simulation-based verification algorithms can provide formal safety
   guarantees for nonlinear and hybrid systems. The previous algorithms
   rely on user provided model annotations called discrepancy function,
   which are crucial for computing reachtubes from simulations. In this
   paper, we eliminate this requirement by presenting an algorithm for
   computing piecewise exponential discrepancy functions. The algorithm
   relies on computing local convergence or divergence rates of
   trajectories along a simulation using a coarse over-approximation of the
   reach set and bounding the maximal eigenvalue of the Jacobian over this
   over-approximation. The resulting discrepancy function preserves the
   soundness and the relative completeness of the verification algorithm.
   We also provide a coordinate transformation method to improve the local
   estimates for the convergence or divergence rates in practical examples.
   We extend the method to get the input-to-state discrepancy of nonlinear
   dynamical systems which can be used for compositional analysis. Our
   experiments show that the approach is effective in terms of running time
   for several benchmark problems, scales reasonably to larger dimensional
   systems, and compares favorably with respect to available tools for
   nonlinear models.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic speech magnetic resonance imaging (DS-MRI) is a promising
   technique for visualizing articulatory motion in real time. However,
   many existing applications of DS-MRI have been limited by slow imaging

   present a novel DS-MRI technique to simultaneously estimate dynamic
   image sequence of speech and the associated deformation field. Extending
   on our previous Partial Separability (PS) model-based methods, the
   proposed technique visualizes both speech motion and deformation with a
   spatial resolution of 2.2 x 2.2 mm(2) and a nominal frame rate of 100
   fps. Also, the technique enables direct analysis of articulatory motion
   through the deformation fields. Effectiveness of the method is
   systematically examined via in vivo experiments. Utilizing the obtained
   high-resolution images and deformation fields, we also performed a
   phonetics study on Brazilian Portuguese to show the method's practical
   utility.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel context-aware approach for resource allocation in
   two-tier wireless small cell networks (SCNs) is proposed. In particular,
   the SCN's users are divided into two types: frequent users, who are
   regular users of certain small cells, and occasional users, who are
   one-time or infrequent users of a particular small cell. Given such
   context information, each small cell base station (SCBS) aims to
   maximize the overall performance provided to its frequent users, while
   ensuring that occasional users are also well serviced. We formulate the
   problem as a noncooperative game in which the SCBSs are the players. The
   strategy of each SCBS is to choose a proper power allocation so as to
   optimize a utility function that captures the tradeoff between the
   users' quality-of-service gains and the costs in terms of resource
   expenditures. We provide a sufficient condition for the existence and
   uniqueness of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for the game, and we show
   that this condition is independent of the number of users in the
   network. Simulation results show that the proposed context-aware
   resource allocation game yields significant performance gains, in terms
   of the average utility per SCBS, compared to conventional techniques
   such as proportional fair allocation and sum-rate maximization.}},

Abstract = {{A performance bound on low-pass reconstruction of a finite energy,
   band-limited signal from its corresponding pulse width modulated (PWM)
   signal is given. A finite dimensional input signal structure is proposed
   and its characteristics such as L-infinity norm and convergence rate in
   the tail regions are investigated. The criteria on sampling rate and
   reference signal structure for lossless PWM generation are specified.
   With uniform oversampling, different PWM structures are constructed
   using a generator consisting of an ideal sampler and a comparator. An
   equivalent model for PWM generation and low-pass reconstruction is
   proposed in order to separate infinite energy components in the
   modulated signal from the finite energy information bearing components.
   Using the equivalent model, bounds on distortion energies due to
   low-pass reconstruction and the corresponding signal to distortion
   ratios are given. Characteristics of low-pass reconstruction from
   different PWM signals such as output shifts, blurring effects and
   distortion attenuations are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Mobility of the sensors play an important role in the distributed mobile
   sensor systems (MSS) compared to their fixed counterparts. The mobile ad
   hoc network (MANET) is often adopted in MSS to build up its topology.
   This infrastructure-free underlying network provides flexibility as well
   as vulnerability to the potential applications of MSS. One of the major
   thread is the network disconnections induced by the failure of certain
   mobile sensors. In order to address this problem we proposed an
   Obstacle-avoidance Connectivity Restoration Strategy (OCRS) that fully
   explores the mobility of the sensors to restore the network connectivity
   while avoiding any incoming convex obstacles. OCRS consists of an
   effective backup sensor selection algorithm and a gyroscopic based
   motion controller. To the best of our knowledge, OCRS is the first work
   towards the online connectivity restoration problems in the environment
   with random convex obstacles. The correctness and efficiency of OCRS are
   validated via simulation studies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a Critical Sensor Determination and Substitution (CSDS)
   strategy is proposed to address the important problem of network
   partitions in mobile sensor networks (MSN) due to the failure of
   particular sensors. CSDS utilizes a graph-theoretic method to locally
   identify critical sensors with 2-hop neighboring information. Then, an
   efficient backup sensor selection algorithm is cooperated to monitor the
   critical sensors and, if necessary, substitute it in order to eliminate
   the partitions in MSN. The main contribution of our proposed work is
   that CSDS only requires the relocation of only one sensor in each
   partition elimination process, so that the impacts on the primary
   missions of the MSN is minimized. Experimental simulations are conducted
   to evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of CSDS.}},

Abstract = {{This paper tackles the problem of coordinated vision-based tracking of a
   ground target by a fleet of multiple UAVs that exchange information over
   a supporting time-varying network. The objective of this work is to
   formulate decentralized control algorithms that enable multiple vehicles
   to follow a target while coordinating their phase separation. A typical
   scenario involves multiple aerial surveillance UAVs which are required
   to monitor a moving ground object (target tracking), while maintaining a
   desired inter-vehicle separation (coordination). To solve the tracking
   problem, the yaw rate of each vehicle is used as control input, while
   the ground speeds are adjusted to achieve coordination. It is assumed
   that the UAVs are equipped with an internal autopilot, which is able to
   track yaw rate and ground speed commands. The performance of the
   coordinated vision-based tracking algorithm is evaluated as a function
   of target's velocity, tracking performance of the onboard autopilot, and
   the quality of service of the communication network.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber reinforced elastomeric actuators are popular actuators for soft
   robots because of their inherent safety, energy density and a large
   repertoire of spatial motion patterns. However, a small subset of these
   actuators alone known as McKibben pneumatic muscles with antisymmetric
   fiber orientations have been extensively analyzed in literature. This
   paper analyzes the large deformation kinematics of generalized McKibben
   actuators with asymmetric and arbitrarily varying fiber orientations by
   formulating a simple and accurate isoperimetric problem that involves
   constrained volume maximization problem. This model maximally decouples
   kinematics and kinetostatics thereby significantly reducing the
   numerical complexity involved in analysis. The accuracy of the model is
   verified by benchmarking with existing models for the McKibben actuator
   case, and with experiments for novel designs with no associated prior
   literature. This model is deemed to be useful in the design synthesis of
   fiber reinforced elastomeric actuators for a desired kinematic and
   kinetostatic requirement.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a distributed control policy to achieve
   rendezvous by a set of robots even when some robots in the system do not
   follow the prescribed policy. These nonconforming robots correspond to
   faults in the multi-robot systems, and our control policy is thus a
   fault-tolerant policy. We consider the case in which each robot is an
   autonomous decision maker that is anonymous (i.e., robots are
   indistinguishable to one another), memoryless (i.e., each robot makes
   decisions based upon only its current information), and dimensionless
   (i.e., collision checking is not considered). Each robot has a limited
   sensing range, and is able to directly estimate the state of only those
   robots within that sensing range, which induces a network topology for
   the multi-robot systems. We assume that it is not possible for the
   fault-free robots to identify the faulty robots (e.g., due to the
   anonymous property of the robots).
   Our main result is a practical algorithm that achieves approximate
   rendezvous in the face of faulty robots under a few assumptions on the
   network topology. In simulation results, we show that our algorithm
   performs better in the face of faulty robots than other contemporary
   convergence algorithms, e.g., the circumcenter law, and local coordinate
   averaging.}},

Abstract = {{Studies suggest that students' attitudes toward engineering courses may
   determine whether they persist in engineering, rather than academic
   performance alone. We take a mixed-methods approach to explore gritty
   attitudes and to confirm whether previous research on grit can be
   applied to undergraduate engineering students. We address two main
   research questions: (1) Does the grit scale predict retention among
   first-year undergraduate engineering students? (2) What does grit
   specifically look like for engineering students? To answer the first
   question, we invited all first-year engineering students at one
   university to complete the grit scale during Fall 2014. We will check
   whether the scores on the grit scale correlate positively with retention
   in engineering. To answer the second question, we invited all students
   who were persisting in engineering after having earned a D or an F grade
   in a required technical course to participate in a semi-structured
   interview. We hope to capture how these engineering students respond to
   academic setbacks and what they believe about effort, perseverance, and
   academic success.}},

Abstract = {{The adoption of research-based instruction strategies (RBIS) by faculty
   is generally perceived as being slow. Faculty resist change, reject data
   that demonstrates the effectiveness of RBIS, and prioritize research
   over teaching. Even when faculty attempt to use RBIS, they often do so
   with poor fidelity to the original design of the RBIS. By organizing
   faculty into communities of practice, we are observing a sudden surge in
   the adoption of RBIS across STEM departments. Through this work in
   progress we present preliminary data that we have collected to
   understand exactly why many faculty are now adopting RBIS. While this
   effort has led to the adoption of many RBIS, we focus on the adoption of
   personal response systems (clickers) and Peer Instruction. Preliminary
   data suggests that faculty adoption is being driven by community and
   collaborative instruction.}},

Abstract = {{In core engineering courses, instructors administer multiple
   examinations as major assessments of students' learning. When a student
   is unable to take an exam, the instructor must estimate the missing exam
   score in order to calculate the student's course grade. Using exam score
   data from multiple offerings of two large engineering courses, we
   compared the accuracy of several methods to estimate an exam score,
   including linear regression methods. The standard error of regression of
   the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model was consistently about
   0.5. For final exam scores, the standard errors of linear models with
   equal weights were nearly the same as the standard errors of the OLS
   regression models. For other exam scores, the equal weight model was
   somewhat less accurate. The results of this study provide practical
   guidance to instructors who need to estimate missing exam scores.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid project and service based learning course has been introduced
   in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at the
   University of Illinois. The primary objectives of the course are to
   develop engineering problem solving, professional, and business skills
   earlier in our CEE undergraduate curriculum by having student teams
   identify open-ended, ill-defined campus/community problems or
   opportunities, develop a feasible project scope, and propose sustainable
   solutions.
   The unique features of our course include (1) a blend of service and
   project learning with faculty instructors partnering with the campus
   engineering staff to assist with team project mentoring, campus data
   collection, local field trips, and case studies, (2) formal course
   assessments through pre and post-class survey and student focus group
   interviews, and (3) weekly instructor meetings that consist of faculty,
   teaching assistants, department administrators and engineering staff
   updating the course during the semester and planning major changes for
   the next course offering. In this paper, we describe the course
   organization and its curricular evolution along with evaluation data
   from student surveys and focus groups as well as the impact of routine
   instructor community of practice meetings.}},

Abstract = {{The integral equation-based solvers have difficulty dealing with
   multi-scale problems because of disparate meshing and consequently the
   coexistence of varied physics (i.e., ray physics, wave physics, and
   circuit physics). Equivalence principle algorithm (EPA), as a domain
   decomposition method, has shown a great potential to address some of
   these issues. The EPA initially divides an original large problem into
   smaller ones by defining appropriate enclosing surfaces, and then solves
   each of them independently. Later, it uses the equivalence principle to
   move the solutions to the surface and stitch them together to produce a
   solution for the original problem. This provides parallelization of the
   solution, flexibility for selecting the mesh strategy, its reuse, and
   also improved condition number of the matrix system. Despite these
   advantages, the error source for EPA has not been well-studied which
   will be partially addressed in here.}},

   field integral equation. We present in this paper a combined field

Abstract = {{Dielectric breakdown during high power operation is hazardous to
   electric and electronic devices and systems. During the breakdown
   process, the bound charges break free and are pushed to move under the
   force of high intensity fields. As a result, the dielectric which was a
   good insulator becomes a conductor. Such a process can be described as
   the change of conductivity of the dielectric, which in this case, is a
   nonlinear function of the electric field. In this paper, the nonlinear
   conductivity is incorporated into Maxwell's equations, and the resulting
   nonlinear equation is solved using the time-domain finite element method
   together with Newton's method. A numerical example is presented to
   demonstrate the capability of the proposed algorithm and the nonlinear

Abstract = {{In this paper, the time-domain finite element method (TDFEM) is employed
   to analyze the high power breakdown in air. During the breakdown
   process, the motion of free electrons generates plasma currents, which
   produce secondary fields that couple back into the externally applied
   fields and interact with the free electrons. Such a breakdown process
   can be described by a coupled electromagnetic-plasma system, where the
   electromagnetic fields are governed by Maxwell's equations and the
   plasma current is modeled by a simplified plasma fluid equation. Due to
   the nonlinear characteristics of the breakdown phenomenon, the coupled
   system results in a nonlinear second-order partial differential equation
   that is solved by TDFEM together with the Newton-Raphson method. A
   numerical example is given to demonstrate the nonlinear characteristics
   of the breakdown phenomenon and the self-sustaining property of the

Abstract = {{A novel low-profile dual-band steerable pattern-reconfigurable antenna
   (PRA) is presented in this paper. The antenna consists of two parallel
   fed radiating elements with a pair of varactors acting as a loaded-line
   phase shifter. A DC bias voltage applied to the varactors controls the
   phase delay between the currents feeding each element and the imbalance
   in current flow modulates the pattern. The design and full wave
   simulation of the antenna are presented. The proposed antenna provides
   dual polarized 25 degrees beam steering in the elevation plane in both
   the 3.51-GHz and 3.67-GHz band. Unlike existing PRAs that employ
   multiple PIN diodes to switch through discrete radiation profiles, this
   antenna changes its pattern continuously using a single control signal
   while maintaining a good input response without the need for a
   sophisticated matching network.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a coordination scheme between balancing

   approach aims at mimicking the behavior of the automatic generation
   control (AGC) system in a scenario where the whole interconnected system
   is assumed to be operated by a single BA area. To this end, we modify
   the area control error (ACE), which is fed into the AGC system of each
   BA area, and determine the AGC allocation based on a distributed
   algorithm that identifies the least expensive generators, with the
   mismatch of the total regulation needed being the only information
   exchanged between BA areas. We demonstrate the proposed ideas with the
   3-machine 9-bus Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system,
   and compare the performance of our method with other three existing

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a measurement-based approach to the real-time
   economic dispatch (ED). The real-time ED is a widely used market
   scheduling problem seeking to economically balance electricity system
   supply and demand and provide locational marginal prices (LMPs) while
   respecting system reliability requirements. The ED is a convex
   optimization problem with a linear or quadratic objective, typically the
   minimization of generator costs or the maximization of social surplus.
   The constraints capture power balance and network flow capacity limits
   and are formulated using a linearized power flow model. Our approach
   utilizes power system sensitivities estimated from phasor measurement
   unit (PMU) measurements to reformulate the model-based power flow and
   network flow constraints. The resulting measurement-based real-time ED
   overcomes the vulnerabilities of the model-based real-time ED. The
   dispatch instructions and LMPs calculated with our measurement-based
   real-time ED accurately, and adaptively, reflect real-time system
   conditions. We illustrate the strengths of the proposed approach via
   several case studies.}},

Abstract = {{Preliminary design of low-thrust interplanetary missions is a highly
   complex process. The mission designer must choose discrete parameters
   such as the number of flybys, the bodies at which those flybys are
   performed, and in some cases the final destination. In addition, a
   time-history of control variables must be chosen that defines the
   trajectory. There are often many thousands, if not millions, of possible
   trajectories to be evaluated. The customer who commissions a trajectory
   design is not usually interested in a point solution, but rather the
   exploration of the trade space of trajectories between several different
   objective functions. This can be a very expensive process in terms of
   the number of human analyst hours required. An automated approach is
   therefore very desirable. This work presents such an approach by posing
   the mission design problem as a multi-objective hybrid optimal control
   problem. The method is demonstrated on a hypothetical mission to the

Abstract = {{Solving the global optimization, low-thrust, multiple-flyby
   interplanetary trajectory problem with high-fidelity dynamical models
   requires an unreasonable amount of computational resources. A better
   approach, and one that is demonstrated in this paper, is a multi-step
   process whereby the solution of the aforementioned problem is solved at
   a medium-fidelity and this solution is used as an initial guess for a
   higher-fidelity solver. The framework presented in this work uses two
   tools developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC): the
   Evolutionary Mission Trajectory Generator (EMTG) and the General Mission
   Analysis Tool (GMAT). EMTG is a medium to medium-high fidelity
   low-thrust interplanetary global optimization solver, which now has the
   capability to automatically generate GMAT script files for seeding a
   high-fidelity solution using GMAT's local optimization capabilities. An
   overview of the analysis tools is presented along with a discussion of
   the autonomy of the tool-chain. Current capabilities are highlighted
   with increasingly difficult problems; the final problem being the
   recreation of the interplanetary trajectory for the DAWN mission.}},

Abstract = {{The optimization of low-thrust trajectories is tightly coupled with the
   spacecraft hardware. Trading trajectory characteristics with system
   parameters to identify viable solutions and determine mission
   sensitivities across discrete hardware configurations is labor
   intensive. Local, independent optimization runs can sample the design
   space, but a global exploration that resolves the relationships between
   the system variables across multiple objectives enables a full mapping
   of the optimal solution space. A multi-objective, hybrid optimal control
   algorithm is formulated using a multi-objective genetic algorithm as an
   outer-loop systems optimizer around a global trajectory optimizer. The
   coupled problem is solved simultaneously to generate Pareto-optimal
   solutions in a single execution. The automated approach is demonstrated
   on two interplanetary boulder return missions.}},

Abstract = {{A significant body of work exists showing that providing a nonlinear
   programming (NLP) solver with analytical expressions for the problem
   constraint gradients substantially increases the speed of program
   execution and can also improve the robustness of convergence, especially
   for local optimizers. Calculation of these derivatives is often
   accomplished through the computation of the spacecraft's state
   transition matrix (STM). If the two-body gravitational model is
   employed, as is often done in the context of preliminary design,
   closed-form expressions for these derivatives may be provided. If a
   high-fidelity dynamics model, that might include perturbing forces such
   as the gravitational effects from multiple third bodies and solar
   radiation pressure, is used then these STM's must be computed
   numerically. We present a method for the numerical computation of the
   state transition matrix including analytical expressions for a state
   propagation matrix that incorporate an accurate spacecraft solar
   electric power hardware model and a full ephemeris model. An
   adaptive-step embedded eighth order Dormand-Prince numerical integrator
   is discussed and a method for the computation of the time of flight
   derivatives in this framework is presented. The use of these numerically
   calculated derivatives offer a substantial improvement over finite
   differencing in the context of a global optimizer. Specifically, the
   inclusion of these STM's into the low-thrust mission design tool chain
   in use at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center allows for an increased
   preliminary mission design cadence.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an approach in which visible-wavelength-emitting quantum
   dots (QDs) are integrated within a polymer-based photonic crystal (PC)
   and excited by an ultravioletemitting LED. The PC design incorporates
   two interleaved regions, each with distinct periods in orthogonal
   directions to enable simultaneous resonant coupling of ultraviolet
   excitation photons to the QDs and visible QD emission at two different
   wavelengths to efficiently extract photons normal to the PC surface. The
   combined excitation and extraction enhancements result in a 5.8X
   increase in the QD output intensity. Further, we demonstrate multiple
   QD-doped PCs combined on a single surface to optimally couple with
   distinct populations of QDs, offering a means for blending color output
   and directionality of multiple wavelengths.}},

   estimator defines a boundary of the mowing area with the estimated
   trajectory of the mower. The estimated boundary and the landmark map are
   provided for the estimation of the mowing location and for the
   containment detection. We validate the effectiveness of our system

Abstract = {{Switched-capacitor (SC) converters have generated interest in the
   research community due to the possibility of achieving high power
   densities at high voltage conversion ratios. This work proposes a
   resonant, 1-to-4 voltage conversion ratio Dickson SC converter. A single
   inductor is utilized to achieve zero current switching of all
   transistors, which allows for high switching frequency and high
   conversion efficiency. A split-phase control scheme is used in order to
   eliminate the current transients associated with the Dickson SC
   converter and the resultant power loss. Employing these techniques, a 25
   V to 100 V Dickson SC converter prototype is implemented with GaN
   transistors. The converter achieves a switching frequency of 1.2 MHz and
   a peak efficiency of 92 \%. The power stage of the converter is able to
   achieve a power density of a 1011 W/in(3) at 263 W.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury-thiourea complex ion chromatography is the core of a relatively
   new approach to Hg speciation analysis that is sensitive enough to
   accurately quantitate monomethyl Hg at ultratrace environmental levels.
   In this chapter, a detailed description of an updated system chemistry
   and operating conditions for performing mercury speciation analysis
   using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry are presented. The
   new operating conditions are very stable, highly-sensitive, and free of
   problems that afflicted earlier versions of the system. The potential
   for obtaining accurate results using the system is demonstrated by the
   excellent performance metrics obtained and the close agreement of these
   results with consensus values of monomethyl Hg in water and sediment
   reference materials and inter-lab comparison samples. The ability to
   quantitate mercuric and monoethyl along with monomethyl forms of Hg is a
   feature of this approach that likely will prove useful in future studies
   of environmental systems.}},

Abstract = {{Post-silicon validation and debug challenges of system-on-chips (SoCs)
   are getting increasingly difficult. As we reach the limits of Dennard
   scaling, efforts to improve system performance and energy efficiency
   have resulted in the integration of a wide variety of complex hardware
   accelerators in SoCs. Hence, it is essential to address post-silicon
   validation and debug of hardware accelerators. High-level synthesis
   (HLS) is a promising technique to rapidly create customized hardware
   accelerators. In this paper, we present the Hybrid Quick Error Detection
   (H-QED) approach that overcomes post-silicon validation and debug
   challenges for hardware accelerators by leveraging HLS techniques. H-QED
   improves error detection latencies (time elapsed from when a bug is
   activated to when it manifests as an observable failure) by 2 orders of
   magnitude and bug coverage 3-fold compared to traditional post-silicon
   validation techniques. H-QED also uncovered previously unknown bugs in
   the CHStone benchmark suite, which is widely used by the HLS community.
   H-QED incurs less than 2\% chip-level area overhead with negligible
   performance impact, and we also introduce techniques to minimize any
   possible intrusiveness introduced by H-QED.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the first SPICE model of the transition metal
   dichalcogenide (TMD) field-effect transistor (FET), which is a promising
   candidate for flexible electronics. The model supports different
   transistor design parameters such as width, length, oxide thickness, and
   various channel materials (MoS2, WSe2, etc.), as well as the applied
   strain, which enables the evaluation of transistor-and circuit-level
   behavior under process variation and different levels of bending. We
   performed SPICE simulations on digital logic gates to explore the design
   space of both MoS2- and WSe2-based transistors, and to evaluate the
   projected performance of these circuits under applied strain. Our
   simulations show that WSe2 circuits outperform MoS2 and Si-based CMOS in
   terms of energy-delay product (EDP) by up to 1 order of magnitude,
   depending on applications. Finally, we investigate TMDFET's behavior

Abstract = {{This paper presents: (a) the Data-Theoretic methodology as part of an
   ongoing research which integrates Physics-of-Failure (PoF) theories and
   data analytics to be applied in Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) of
   complex systems and (b) the status of the application of the proposed
   methodology for the estimation of the frequency of the location-specific
   loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), which is a critical initiating event in
   PRA and one of the challenges of the risk-informed resolution for
   Generic Safety Issue 191 (GSI-191) {[}1].
   The proposed methodology has the following unique characteristics: (1)
   it uses predictive causal modeling along with sensitivity and
   uncertainty analysis to find the most important contributing factors in
   the PoF models of failure mechanisms. This model-based approach utilizes
   importance-ranking techniques, scientifically reduces the number of
   factors, and focuses on a detailed quantification strategy for critical
   factors rather than conducting expensive experiments and time-consuming
   simulations for a large number of factors. This adds validity and
   practicality to the proposed methodology. (2) Because of the evolving
   nature of computational power and information-sharing technologies, the
   Data-Theoretic method for PRA expands the classical approach of data
   extraction and implementation for risk analysis. It utilizes advanced
   data analytic techniques (e.g., data mining and text mining) to extract
   risk and reliability information from diverse data sources (academic
   literature, service data, regulatory and laboratory reports, expert
   opinion, maintenance logs, news, etc.) and executes them in theory-based
   PoF networks. (3) The Data-Theoretic approach uses comprehensive
   underlying PoF theory to avoid potentially misleading results from use
   of solely data-oriented approaches, as well as support the completeness
   of the contextual physical factors and the accuracy of their causal
   relationships. (4) When the important factors are identified, the
   Data-Theoretic approach applies all potential theory-based techniques
   (e. g., simulation and experimentation).}},

Abstract = {{A methodology for development of high fidelity control-oriented
   continuous casting mold oscillator software testbed incorporating two

   Nontrivial damped natural frequency calculation is carried out. For a
   finite-difference approximation of analytical model, monotonic
   dependence on spatial approximation accuracy of the resonance frequency
   under the fixed mass and of the mass under the fixed resonance frequency
   is discovered. Based on these findings, a novel beam parameter selection
   procedure for precise attainment of the desired resonance and damped
   natural frequencies by analytical and numerical models under the
   relevant boundary conditions and runtime constraints is developed. Using
   this procedure, fitting of the model parameters to resonance frequencies
   exhibited by thin and thick slab casting mold oscillators at the Nucor
   Decatur and Severstal Dearborn steel mills, respectively, is
   demonstrated. Assessment of controller efficacy in suppression of the
   undesirable oscillations in the software testbed fitted to Severstal

Abstract = {{This paper studies the opinion dynamics that result when individuals
   consecutively discuss a sequence of issues. Specifically, we study how
   individuals' self-confidence levels evolve via a reflected appraisal
   mechanism. Motivated by the DeGroot-Friedkin model, we propose a
   Modified DeGroot-Friedkin model which allows individuals to update their
   self-confidence levels by only interacting with their neighbors and in
   particular, the modified model allows the update of self-confidence
   levels to take place in finite time without waiting for the opinion
   process to reach a consensus on any particular issue. We study
   properties of this Modified DeGroot-Friedkin model and compare the
   associated equilibria and stability with those of the original
   DeGroot-Friedkin model. Specifically, for the case when the interaction
   matrix is doubly stochastic, we show that for the modified model, the
   vector of individuals' self-confidence levels converges to a unique
   nontrivial equilibrium which for each individual is equal to 1/n, where
   n is the number of individuals. This implies that eventually individuals
   reach a democratic state.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we provide a scheme for estimating the minimum achievable
   exponential decay rate of a switched linear system via output feedback
   control. The output feedback stabilization of switched linear systems
   using path-dependent controllers is characterized exactly in {[}8] in
   terms of an increasing family of linear matrix inequalities; the
   feasibility of any one of these inequalities allows for the construction
   of a stabilizing controller, while infeasible conditions are
   disregarded. In this paper we use the infeasibility of these conditions
   to provide a lower bound on the achievable decay rate of the closed-loop
   system. We consider the special case of the discrete linear inclusion -
   e.g., a system with unrestricted switching - and develop a family of
   estimators of the minimum achievable decay rate for the system. For
   controllers of a fixed path-dependence, the resulting bounds provide an
   interval containing the minimum performance level whose length may be
   made as small as desired. The lower bound of these intervals is used as
   a nondecreasing estimation of the achievable decay rate. A simple,
   physically motivated example is provided to demonstrate the practical
   application of this result.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design, programming, and construction of a
   battery operated autonomous Segbot. The Segbot, a two wheeled robot, has
   some similarities to the inverted pendulum cart system in that it is
   underactuated, exhibits non-minimum phase behavior, and requires a
   stabilizing controller to stand upright. The Segbot differs from the
   inverted pendulum cart system in that the dynamics are nonholonomic. The
   National Instruments (R) myRIO microcontroller is used for control
   implementation. The myRIO allows WiFi communication between the Segbot
   and a host computer for supervisory control. The LabView (R) VI used for
   real-time data acquisition and control consists of two main loops. The
   first loop collects state measurements from an accelerometer, rate
   gyros, and wheel position encoders. These measurements are passed to the
   second loop which calculates the desired control law. Included is a
   summary of the system identification procedure used to determine
   parameters that cannot be directly measured and the use of a CAD program
   to estimate inertial values and mass center location. An example of the
   Segbot tracking a figure-8 path with a novel navigation controller,
   derived herein, is presented. Finally, a URL link is included for CAD
   device drawings, a parts list, control programs, wiring diagrams, and a
   video demonstration of the Segbot.}},

Abstract = {{The deterministic annealing (DA) method, used for the solution of
   several nonconvex problems, offers the ability to avoid shallow local
   minima of a given cost surface and the ability to minimize the cost
   function even when there are many local minima. The method is
   established in a probabilistic framework through basic
   information-theoretic techniques such as maximum entropy and random
   coding. It arises naturally in the context of statistical mechanics by
   the emulation of a physical process whereby a solid is slowly cooled and
   at zero temperature assumes its minimum energy configuration. In this
   paper, we first present some background material on the DA method and
   its connections to statistical physics and rate-distortion theory. A
   computational complexity analysis is then presented for a given
   temperature schedule. The case study focuses on the geometric cooling
   law T (t) = rho T (t-1); 0 < rho < 1, where T (t) is the temperature at
   time t.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the cooperative localization problem in sensor
   networks where the objective is to estimate the sensor positions.
   Communications among the sensors can reduce the need for global
   observations (e. g. GPS data), and render the estimation distributed.
   However, these problems usually involve nonlinear models and
   non-Gaussian distributions.
   Two techniques are studied and compared to address nonlinearity and
   non-Gaussianity: the feedback particle filter (FPF) {[}16] and the
   nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) {[}11]. FPF introduces a novel
   feedback and innovation structure, and the computations can be
   approximately localized. On the other hand, NBP reformulates
   localization as an inference problem on spatio-temporal graphical models
   and implements a distributed sample-based message-passing scheme.
   Comparisons between FPF and NBP are provided regarding their structure,
   computational cost and accuracy, and are supported by numerical
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate a decentralized formation control

   formation control problems where only the shape of a configuration
   counts, we emphasize here also its Euclidean embedding. By following
   this decentralized formation control law, the agents will converge to
   certain equilibrium of the control system. In particular, we show that
   there is a quadratic Lyapunov function associated with the formation
   control system whose unique local (global) minimum point is the target
   configuration. In view of the fact that there exist multiple equilibria
   (in fact, a continuum of equilibria) of the formation control system,
   and hence there are solutions of the system which converge to some
   equilibria other than the target configuration, we apply simulated
   annealing, as a heuristic method, to the formation control law to fix
   this problem. Simulation results show that sample paths of the modified
   stochastic system approach the target configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a framework for application-oriented optimal experiment design
   has been introduced. In this context, the distance of the estimated
   system from the true one is measured in terms of a particular
   end-performance metric. This treatment leads to superior unknown system
   estimates to classical experiment designs based on usual pointwise
   functional distances of the estimated system from the true one. The
   separation of the system estimator from the experiment design is done
   within this new framework by choosing and fixing the estimation method
   to either a maximum likelihood (ML) approach or a Bayesian estimator
   such as the minimum mean square error (MMSE). Since the MMSE estimator
   delivers a system estimate with lower mean square error (MSE) than the
   ML estimator for finite-length experiments, it is usually considered the
   best choice in practice in signal processing and control applications.
   Within the application-oriented framework a related meaningful question
   is: Are there end-performance metrics for which the ML estimator
   outperforms the MMSE when the experiment is finite-length? In this
   paper, we affirmatively answer this question based on a simple linear
   Gaussian regression example.}},

   process where a series of optimization problems are solved that provide
   important system insights such as maximum system performance limits,
   controller architecture, actuator selection, etc. at appropriate design
   phases. Each optimization problem thus informs subsequent formulations.
   This methodology is applied to semi-active suspension design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers reliable communication in presence of Byzantine
   faulty nodes, using multiple node-disjoint routes. To tolerate f
   Byzantine faults, at least 2 f + 1 nodedisjoint paths are needed between
   a source and destination node pair. However, often the faulty nodes'
   misbehavior manifests itself as a ``disagreement{''} between information
   provided by the faulty node and its neighbors. This disagreement can be
   captured in the form of a conflict graph. Even though the conflict graph
   does not always allow us to identify faulty nodes precisely, we show
   that it can still be used to reduce the number of paths necessary for
   reliable communication (to smaller than 2 f + 1). We consider two
   strategies for using the node-disjoint paths for reliable delivery of
   messages: replication and coding across different paths. For each
   strategy, we propose iPath, a scheme to identify the optimal set of
   paths that needs to be used to achieve reliable communication for a
   given conflict graph.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports the first observation of parametric excitation in
   geometrically optimized Aluminum Nitride (AlN) contour mode resonators
   (CMRs). The concept of parametric excited AlN CMRs harnesses the fact
   that the resonant frequencies of extensional mode vibrations along
   transverse and longitudinal directions can both be determined by
   resonator dimensions. Therefore, by geometrically optimizing lateral
   dimensions, dual resonances can be engineered at f(0) and 2f(0)
   respectively for inputting parametric excitation and outputting
   fundamental oscillations. In operation, the parametric excitation
   amplifies an orthogonal oscillation at f0 by periodically modulating the
   stiffness constants of AlN piezoelectric thin film via straining the
   structure. The experimental results have shown quality factor (Q)
   enhancement from 50 ot 2708 for a parametrically excited resonance. Upon
   further scaling and optimizations, it is anticipated that this type of
   devices will lead to the development of GHz low noise frequency sources
   and nano-electro-mechanical logic.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, we derive the computational complexity certifications
   of first-order inexact dual methods for solving general smooth
   constrained convex problems which can arise in real-time applications,
   such as model predictive control. When it is difficult to project on the
   primal constraint set described by a collection of general convex
   functions, we use the Lagrangian relaxation to handle the complicated
   constraints and then, we apply dual (fast) gradient algorithms based on
   inexact dual gradient information for solving the corresponding dual
   problem. The iteration complexity analysis is based on two types of
   approximate primal solutions: the primal last iterate and an average of
   primal iterates. We provide sublinear computational complexity estimates
   on the primal suboptimality and constraint (feasibility) violation of
   the generated approximate primal solutions. In the final part of the
   chapter, we present an open-source quadratic optimization solver,
   referred to as DuQuad, for convex quadratic programs and for evaluation
   of its behavior. The solver contains the C-language implementations of
   the analyzed algorithms.}},

   this study, Mo thin films were deposited on SLG substrates using
   direct-current (DC) magnetron sputtering to observe the influence of
   substrate temperature on Na diffusion and films smoothness. The working
   gas (Ar) was maintained at 10 mTorr while substrate temperature was
   varied from room temperature (RT) to 200 degrees C. In this study, Mo
   films were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Real time
   in-situ and ex-situ measurements by spectroscopic ellipsometry were also
   performed, allowing for the analysis of the growth processes as a
   function of temperature. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analysis
   was carried out to obtain the Na depth profile in the Mo films. In
   addition, a grain boundary diffusion model was developed to reveal the
   Na diffusion mechanism in Mo films at various substrate temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most fundamental processes in the Universe, nucleosynthesis
   of elements drives energy production in stars as well as the creation of
   all atoms heavier than hydrogen. To harness this process and open new
   ways for energy production, we must recreate some of the extreme
   conditions in which it occurs. We present results of experiments using a
   pulsed power facility to induce collective nuclear interactions
   producing stable nuclei of virtually every element in the periodic
   table. A high-power electron beam pulse striking a small metallic target
   is used to create the extreme dynamic environment. Material analysis
   studies detect an anomalously high presence of new chemical elements in
   the remnants of the exploded target supporting theoretical conjectures
   of the experiment. These results provide strong motivation to continue
   our research looking for additional proofs that heavy element
   nucleosynthesis is possible in pulsed power laboratory. (C) 2015 The

   Life-Cycle Assessment Approach}},

Pages = {{11-18}},
Abstract = {{This paper quantifies the environmental improvements in current versus
   past pavement materials and construction practices employed by the
   Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (tollway authority). Improvements
   in sustainability performance were measured with a life-cycle assessment
   (LCA) approach. Three scenarios were generated to evaluate tollway
   authority practices on the basis of eight 2013 Interstate reconstruction
   and rehabilitation projects. The first scenario, 2013 projects, analyzed
   the actual pavement material and designs of the 2013 projects. The
   second scenario, materials baseline, was based on the 2013 projects but
   modified to include mix designs with less-sustainable materials used by
   the tollway authority circa 2000. The third scenario, design and
   materials baseline, considered both mix designs and pavement design
   practices used circa 2000. To improve the spatial and temporal relevance
   of the analyses, two regional databases of life-cycle inventories
   representing processes from 2013 and 2000 were developed and applied to
   the 2013 projects and 2000 baselines. A tool developed by the Illinois

Title = {{Performance Evaluations of Unbound Aggregate Permanent Deformation
   Models for Various Aggregate Physical Properties}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2525}},
Pages = {{20-30}},
Abstract = {{Permanent deformation or rutting is the main performance indicator of
   unbound aggregate layers used in flexible pavements. This paper
   evaluates the prediction abilities of unbound aggregate base or subbase
   permanent deformation models in use or proposed for use in the
   Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) approach. Repeated
   load triaxial-type permanent deformation tests were conducted on three
   unbound aggregate materials limestone, dolomite, and uncrushed gravel
   commonly used for pavement base and subbase and subgrade replacement
   applications in Illinois. The test matrix was designed to evaluate
   effects of aggregate physical properties, including moisture content,
   gradation, types and amounts of fines, aggregate mineralogy, and
   particle shape, texture, and angularity. The laboratory-measured
   permanent deformations were compared with those predicted by four
   rutting models evaluated in this study. The permanent deformations
   predicted by the original 1989 Tseng-Lytton model and the 2006 El-Badawy
   model were generally in good agreement with the measured values. The
   current MEPDG rutting model and its enhanced version proposed in 2013 by
   Hashem and Zapata tended to overpredict permanent deformations and have
   a low sensitivity to changes in aggregate physical properties. In
   addition to enhancements recommended for the four evaluated models, a
   unified rutting model was developed; it used a shear stress ratio
   concept and imaging-based aggregate morphological indexes. With a single
   set of calibrated model parameters, the unified rutting model produced
   reasonably accurate permanent strain predictions for all unbound
   aggregate materials used in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Design automation (DA) is at a historical moment where it has a chance -
   after mathematics, statistics, and computer science - to establish
   itself as the fourth universal approach with widespread applications in
   a variety of scientific, engineering, and economic domains. We start by
   outlining some of the most important research contributions and
   industrial applications of the design automation; we identify key
   conceptual DA techniques and describe how they interact to form
   synthesis and analysis flows. Next, we discuss the most attractive
   emerging and pending DA domains by analyzing several recent
   technologies, applications, and conceptual trends. Our emphasis is not
   just on the most challenging research or the most lucrative application
   areas but also on the technological trends relevant to DA. Furthermore,
   we elaborate on the types of new DA techniques and tools that are
   required for further fundamental progress and improved practical
   relevance. In order to provide a balanced picture of DA, we also
   identify the most pronounced dangers in false starts and false research
   in DA. Finally, we briefly discuss the need for a DA educational reform
   and community social reorganization that are beneficial for rapid and
   impactful research and development contributions.}},

Abstract = {{With the prevalence of System-on-Chips there is a growing need for
   automation and acceleration of the design process. A classical approach
   is to take a C/C++ specification of the application, convert it to a
   SystemC (or equivalent) description of hardware implementing this
   application, and perform successive refinement of the description to
   improve various design metrics. In this work, we present an automated
   SystemC generation and design space exploration flow alleviating several
   productivity and design time issues encountered in the current design
   process. We first automatically convert a subset of C/C++, namely affine
   program regions, into a full SystemC description through polyhedral
   model-based techniques while performing powerful data locality and
   parallelism transformations. We then leverage key properties of affine
   computations to design a fast and accurate latency and power
   characterization flow. Using this flow, we build analytical models of
   power and performance that can effectively prune away a large amount of
   inferior design points very fast and generate Pareto-optimal solution
   points. Experimental results show that (1) our SystemC models can
   evaluate system performance and power that is only 0.57\% and 5.04\%
   away from gate-level evaluation results, respectively; (2) our latency
   and power analytical models are 3.24\% and 5.31\% away from the actual
   Pareto points generated by SystemC simulation, with 2091x faster
   design-space exploration time on average. The generated Pareto-optimal
   points provide effective low-power design solutions given different
   latency constraints.}},

Title = {{Global Carbon Budget 2015}},
Journal = {{EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{349-396}},
Abstract = {{Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and
   their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial
   biosphere is important to better understand the global carbon cycle,
   support the development of climate policies, and project future climate
   change. Here we describe data sets and a methodology to quantify all
   major components of the global carbon budget, including their
   uncertainties, based on the combination of a range of data, algorithms,
   statistics, and model estimates and their interpretation by a broad
   scientific community. We discuss changes compared to previous estimates
   as well as consistency within and among components, alongside
   methodology and data limitations. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and
   industry (E-FF) are based on energy statistics and cement production
   data, while emissions from land-use change (E-LUC), mainly
   deforestation, are based on combined evidence from land-cover-change
   data, fire activity associated with deforestation, and models. The
   global atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its rate
   of growth (G(ATM)) is computed from the annual changes in concentration.
   The mean ocean CO2 sink (S-OCEAN) is based on observations from the
   1990s, while the annual anomalies and trends are estimated with ocean
   models. The variability in S-OCEAN is evaluated with data products based
   on surveys of ocean CO2 measurements. The global residual terrestrial
   CO2 sink (S-LAND) is estimated by the difference of the other terms of
   the global carbon budget and compared to results of independent dynamic
   global vegetation models forced by observed climate, CO2, and land-cover
   change (some including nitrogen-carbon interactions). We compare the
   mean land and ocean fluxes and their variability to estimates from three
   atmospheric inverse methods for three broad latitude bands. All
   uncertainties are reported as +/- 1 sigma, reflecting the current
   capacity to characterise the annual estimates of each component of the
   global carbon budget. For the last decade available (20052014), E-FF was
   9.0 +/- 0.5 GtC yr(-1) E-LUC was 0.9 +/- 0.5 GtC yr(-1), GATM was 4.4
   +/- 0.1 GtC yr(-1), S-OCEAN was 2.6 +/- 0.5 GtC yr(-1), and S LAND was
   3.0 +/- 0.8 GtC yr(-1). For the year 2014 alone, E FF grew to 9.8 +/-
   0.5 GtC yr(-1), 0.6\% above 2013, continuing the growth trend in these
   emissions, albeit at a slower rate compared to the average growth of
   2.2\% yr(-1) that took place during 2005-2014. Also, for 2014, E-LUC was
   1.1 +/- 0.5 GtC yr(-1), G(ATM) was 3.9 +/- 0.2 GtC yr(-1), S-OCEAN was
   2.9 +/- 0.5 GtC yr(-1), and S-LAND was 4.1 +/- 0.9 GtC yr(-1). G(ATM)
   was lower in 2014 compared to the past decade (2005-2014), reflecting a
   larger S-LAND for that year. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration
   reached 397.15 +/- 0.10 ppm averaged over 2014. For 2015, preliminary
   data indicate that the growth in E-FF will be near or slightly below
   zero, with a projection of 0.6 {[} range of 1.6 to C 0.5] \%, based on
   national emissions projections for China and the USA, and projections of
   gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon
   intensity of the global economy for the rest of the world.
   From this projection of E-FF and assumed constant E LUC for 2015,
   cumulative emissions of CO2 will reach about 555 +/- 55 GtC (2035 +/-
   205 GtCO(2)) for 1870-2015, about 75\% from E FF and 25\% from E LUC.
   This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets
   used in this new carbon budget compared with previous publications of
   this data set (Le Quere et al., 2015, 2014, 2013). All observations
   presented here can be downloaded from the Carbon Dioxide Information
   Analysis Center (doi: 10.3334/CDIAC/GCP\_2015).}},

Abstract = {{We propose an efficient technique to learn probabilistic hierarchical
   topic models that are designed to preserve the manifold structure of
   audio data. The consideration of the data manifold is important, as it
   has been shown to provide superior performance in certain audio
   applications such as source separation. However, the high computational
   cost of a sparse encoding step due to the requirement of a large
   dictionary prevents it from being used in real-world applications such
   as real-time speech enhancement and the analysis of big audio data. In
   order to achieve a substantial speed-up of this step, while still
   respecting the data manifold, we propose to harmonize a particular type
   of locality sensitive hashing with the hierarchical topic model. The
   proposed use of hashing can reduce the computational complexity of the
   sparse encoding by providing candidates of non-zero activations, where
   the candidate set is built based on Hamming distance. The hashing step
   is followed by comprehensive sparse coding that considers those
   candidates only, rather than the entire dictionary. Experimental results
   show that the proposed hashing technique can provide audio source
   separation results comparable to the similar system without hashing, but
   with significantly less and cheaper computation.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic and water quality models are used to help manage water
   resources by investigating the effects of climate, land use, land
   management, and water management on water resources. Water-related
   issues are investigated over a range of scales, i.e., the extent and
   resolution of the spatial and temporal contexts, which can vary
   spatially from point to watershed and temporally from seconds to
   centuries. In addition, models' formulations may place scale
   restrictions on their use. In 2012, ASABE published a collection of 22
   articles on the calibration, validation, and use of 25 hydrologic and
   water quality models. Each article detailed the process to follow and
   the issues that could arise during calibration or application of a
   specific model. The objective of this article is to synthesize those
   articles with regard to common spatial and temporal scale principles
   that should guide selecting, parameterizing, and calibrating a
   hydrologic model. This article describes how the spatio-temporal extent
   and resolution of a model application should relate to the modeling
   objectives, the processes simulated, the parameterization and
   calibration process, data available for parameterization and
   calibration, and interpretation of results. Overall, the intended scale
   of the model should match the scale of the processes that need to be
   simulated given the modeling objectives, the scale of input and
   calibration data should be compatible with the scale of the model and
   with the objectives of the study, and the model should be calibrated at
   the scale at which the results will be analyzed and interpreted.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic and water quality models (HWQMs) are increasingly used to
   support decisions on various environmental issues and policy directions
   for present and future scenarios, at scales varying from watershed to
   continental levels. Uncertainty associated with such models may affect
   the ability of the models to accurately evaluate the response of complex
   systems, leading to misguided assessments and risk management decisions.
   Current well-known HWQMs contain numerous input parameters, many of
   which are not known with certainty, and in other cases model users can
   hardly recognize the genesis of uncertainty. Uncertainty in data, model
   structure, and model parameters can propagate throughout model runs,
   causing the model output to substantially deviate from the expected
   response of the natural system. Various uncertainty assessment methods
   have been used with different HWQMs, creating concerns about an adequate
   approach for handling uncertainty in these models and how such an
   approach can be implemented across various discretization complexities
   and scales. In this article, our primary intention is to review
   uncertainty in the currently used HWQMs and to provide guidance and
   useful information for researchers and investigators. In this regard, we
   explore the genesis of uncertainty in hydrologic and water quality
   modeling (i.e., spatiotemporal scales, model representation, model
   discretization, model parameterization) and provide strategies for
   assessing uncertainty in hydrologic and water quality modeling on local
   and global scales when interpreting the model output.}},

Title = {{A NOVEL RUMINANT EMISSION MEASUREMENT SYSTEM: PART II. COMMISSIONING}},
Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},

Volume = {{58}},

Pages = {{1801-1815}},
Abstract = {{The Ruminant Emission Measurement System (REMS) supports research on the
   relationships between bovine nutrition, genetics, and management
   strategies by measuring eructated CH4 emissions from ruminal activity.
   Part I of this series provides the description and design evaluation of
   the newly developed REMS using uncertainty analysis tools. Part II of
   this series describes REMS commissioning and documents the whole system
   and subsystem performance. Subsystem assessments included verification
   of chamber positive pressurization, thermal environmental control
   performance, and integrity of the gas sampling system. Integrity of the
   entire system was verified through a steady-state mass recovery percent
   (SSMRP) analysis, which compared the total mass measured by REMS (mass
   recovered) to the total mas injected from a certified reference (mass
   injected) during steady-state operation. Uncertainty analysis conducted
   as a part of commissioning included propagation of instrument
   uncertainties, quantification of the variability in repeated tests, and
   identification of systematic errors. Results from the subsystem
   evaluation verified that chambers were positively pressurized,
   maintained thermal environmental comfort, and resulted in no measurable
   leakage along the sampling path from the chamber to the gas analyzer.
   The mean SSMRP for the six chambers ranged from 92.0\% to 96.6\% with
   absolute expanded uncertainties (similar to 95\% confidence interval)
   ranging from 10.4\% to 13.0\%. Mass recovered uncertainty contributed
   from 70.1\% to 90.7\% to SSMRP uncertainty, mass injected uncertainty
   contributed from 2.5\% to 4.0\%, and reproducibility contributed from
   5.6\% to 27.3\%. Significant (p < 0.05) SSMRP systematic bias was found
   for most chambers; therefore, correction for bias following the methods
   developed here is recommended. Example measurements from REMS research
   demonstrate how to incorporate a documented standard uncertainty for
   emissions.}},

Title = {{Using Empirical Data to Find the Best Measure of Travel Time Reliability}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2530}},
Pages = {{93-100}},
Abstract = {{The value of travel time savings is often the largest benefit from
   transportation projects and has been studied extensively. Recently,
   additional attention has been paid to the fact that travelers also
   benefit from reliable travel times. The value of reliability (VOR) has
   usually been estimated through stated-preference data or survey-based
   revealed. preference data. In this research, empirical data were used to
   estimate VOR. One concern about estimating VOR from empirical data was
   the lack of a definitive measurement for reliability. Should it be the
   standard deviation (SD) of travel time, the 95th percentile, or another
   measure? Data from Katy Freeway in Texas, where travelers chose between
   tolled but generally more-reliable lanes and free but generally
   less-reliable lanes, were used in an attempt to find the best
   measurement of reliability that could lead to the best explanation of
   travelers' lane choice. Multinomial logit models were used to estimate
   travelers' lane choice on the basis of trip attributes, including travel
   time, many measures of travel time reliability, and tolls. Models
   including only travel time and tolls yielded reasonable results and
   values of time (\$2.78/h, \$9.09/h, and \$10.52/h for off-peak,
   shoulder, and peak periods, respectively). However, adding reliability
   to the models caused many of them to have counterintuitive results, and
   concluding which measure was the best was impossible. In addition, the
   results of this research suggested that reliability might not be an
   influential factor in the lane choice decision on managed lanes, at
   least when travelers had reasonable knowledge of their potential travel
   time.}},

   Our approach to achieving finite-time approximate consensus builds upon
   ratio consensus, a distributed iterative algorithm in which each node
   maintains two state variables where the ratio of the states converges
   asymptotically to a constant that is equal for all the nodes. Simulation
   results illustrating the operation of our proposed algorithm for two

Pages = {{14041-14053}},
Abstract = {{The impacts of environmental moisture on the intensification of a
   tropical cyclone (TC) are investigated in the Weather Research and
   Forecasting (WRF) model, with a focus on the azimuthal asymmetry of the
   moisture impacts relative to the storm path. A series of sensitivity
   experiments with varying moisture perturbations in the environment are
   conducted and the Marsupial Paradigm framework is employed to understand
   the different moisture impacts. We find that modification of
   environmental moisture has insignificant impacts on the storm in this
   case unless it leads to convective activity that deforms the
   quasi-Lagrangian boundary of the storm and changes the moisture
   transport into the storm. By facilitating convection and precipitation
   outside the storm, enhanced environmental moisture ahead of the
   northwestward-moving storm induces a dry air intrusion to the inner core
   and limits TC intensification. In contrast, increased moisture in the
   rear quadrants favors intensification by providing more moisture to the
   inner core and promoting storm symmetry, with primary contributions
   coming from moisture increase in the boundary layer. The different
   impacts of environmental moisture on TC intensification are governed by
   the relative locations of moisture perturbations and their interactions
   with the storm Lagrangian structure.}},

Abstract = {{Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) is the framework for assessing the
   environmental impact of a product over its entire lifecycle. There have
   been numerous LCIA studies in the past conducted on stand-alone
   heavy-duty machines, but the usefulness of the methods in these studies
   is limited when the goal is to compare the environmental impact of two
   cotton stripper designs. Cotton strippers do not operate in isolation -
   they always operate in unison with supporting machinery such as
   tractors, or tractor-powered machinery, which means any meaningful
   comparison of cotton stripper designs must also account for the close
   coupling between cotton strippers and their supporting machinery. This
   paper proposes a new framework for comparing the environmental impact
   generated by two cotton harvesting systems. The proposed framework is
   task-based in the sense that a series of common tasks defined on a given
   field serve as a standard unit of work in a fair comparison of the two
   cotton harvesting systems. A simulation model is used in the proposed
   framework to simulate the movements and interactions of the machines on
   the field.}},

Abstract = {{For a successful remanufacturing, it is important to ensure in advance
   that a product is suitable for remanufacturing and that a remanufactured
   product will provide greater economic and environmental value than a
   brand-new product. This paper provides an approach to estimate the
   economic and environmental advantages of remanufacturing. Focusing on
   the fact that advantages are greatly influenced by the nature of a
   product, i.e., its design and lifetime characteristics, as well as the
   timing of remanufacturing, this paper proposes a model for assessing the
   time-varying advantages of remanufacturing. The model provides an
   objective, quantitative method to compare a remanufactured product with
   an equivalent brand-new version from three perspectives: unit production
   cost, environmental impact, and net profit. It also defines a set of
   conditions under which a remanufactured product will be more profitable
   than a brand-new product. The model is expected to help remanufacturers
   make informed and effective decisions concerning product design and
   remanufacturing strategies. To illustrate, the developed model is
   demonstrated with an example of a desktop computer.}},

Abstract = {{Horizontal gene transfer allows antibiotic resistance and other genetic
   traits to spread among bacteria in the aquatic environment. Despite this
   important role, quantitative models are lacking for one mechanism of
   horizontal gene transfer, which is natural transformation. The rates of
   horizontal gene transfer of a tetracycline resistance gene through
   natural transformation were experimentally determined for motile and
   non-motile strains of Azotobacter vinelandii. We developed a
   mathematical model adapted from the mass action law that successfully
   described the experimentally determined rates of natural transformation
   of a tetracycline resistance gene for motile and non-motile strains of
   Azotobacter vinelandii. Transformation rates showed a rapid initial
   increase, followed by a decrease in the first 30 minutes of the
   experiment, and then a constant rate was maintained at a given cell and
   DNA concentration. The proposed model also described the relationship
   between transformation frequency and varied DNA or cell concentrations.
   The modeling results revealed that under the given experimental
   conditions, the gene transformation rate was limited both by the
   abundance of the tetracycline resistance gene and by cellular activities
   associated with cell-DNA interactions. This work establishes a
   quantitative model of natural transformation, suggests a need to further
   investigate the cell properties affecting transformation rates, and
   provides a basis for development of comprehensive models of horizontal
   gene transfer and quantitative risk assessment of antibiotic resistance
   gene dissemination in the aquatic environment.}},

Title = {{Differences in microbial communities and performance between suspended
   and attached growth anaerobic membrane bioreactors treating synthetic
   municipal wastewater}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{800-813}},
Abstract = {{Two lab-scale anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs), one up-flow
   attached-growth (UA) and another continuously stirred (CSTR), were
   operated under mesophilic conditions (35 degrees C) while treating
   synthetic municipal wastewater (800 mg L-1 COD). Each reactor was
   attached to both polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyethersulfone
   (PES) microfiltration (MF) membranes in an external cross-flow
   configuration. Both reactors were started up and run under the same
   operating conditions for multiple steady-state experiments. Chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) removal rates were similar for both reactors
   (90-96\%), but captured methane was found to be 11-18\% higher for the
   CSTR than the UA reactor. Ion Torrent sequencing targeting 16S rRNA
   genes showed that several operational taxonomic units (OTUs) most
   closely related to fermentative bacteria (e.g., Microbacter margulisiae)
   were dominant in the suspended biomass of the CSTR, accounting for 30\%
   of the microbial community. Conversely, methanogenic archaea (e.g.,
   Methanosaeta) and syntrophic bacteria (e.g., Smithella propionica) were
   found in significantly higher relative abundances in the UA AnMBR as
   compared to the CSTR due to their affinity for surface attachment. Of
   the methanogens that were present in the CSTR sludge, hydrogenotrophic
   methanogens dominated (e.g., Methanobacterium). Measured EPS (both
   proteins and carbohydrates), which has been broadly linked to fouling,
   was determined to be consistently lower in the UA AnMBR membrane samples
   than in CSTR AnMBR membrane samples. Principal component analysis (PCA)
   based on HPLC profiles of soluble microbial products (SMPs) further
   demonstrated these differences between reactor types in replicate runs.
   The results of this study showed that reactor configuration can
   significantly impact the development of the microbial communities of
   AnMBRs that are responsible for both membrane and reactor performance.}},

   characteristics}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{913-921}},
Abstract = {{Biocatalytic reduction of perchlorate can minimize the effects of
   competitive electron acceptors and completely reduce perchlorate into
   chloride and oxygen, but to date has only been demonstrated under
   idealized laboratory conditions. This work investigated biocatalytic
   perchlorate reduction in two groundwater drinking water sources, under a
   range of conditions and with a variety of electron donors. The
   biocatalysts, perchlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase from Azospira
   oryzae, had a maximum activity of 162.5 +/- 8.4 U (mu g Mo)(-1) in
   buffered solution and retained 82-94\% of their activity in groundwater
   samples. The half saturation concentration for perchlorate was 92.0 mu
   M. Perchlorate reduction rates were higher than nitrate reduction rates,
   with nitrate as the sole electron acceptor having reduction rates 7.5 to
   9.7\% of the maximum perchlorate reduction rates in groundwater.
   Activity was consistent from pH 6.5 to 9.0. The temperature dependence
   of biocatalytic perchlorate reduction was well defined by the Arrhenius
   equation. No significant difference in biocatalytic activity was
   observed with calcium and magnesium concentrations over the tested range
   of 0 to 400 mg L-1 or with natural organic matter up to 6 mg L-1.
   Ascorbic acid with addition of an electron shuttle resulted in reduction
   of more than 99\% of perchlorate in less than 6 hours, an order of
   magnitude loss in activity compared to methyl viologen. These results
   suggest the potential of the biocatalysts for treating perchlorate over
   a range of concentrations and conditions representative of industrial
   and groundwater perchlorate contamination.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{4607-4613}},
Abstract = {{In a microfluidic environment, the presence of bubbles is often
   detrimental to the functionality of the device, leading to clogging or
   cavitation, but microbubbles can also be an indispensable asset in other
   applications such as microstreaming. In either case, it is crucial to
   understand and control the growth or shrinkage of these bodies of air,
   in particular in common soft-lithography devices based on
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is highly permeable to gases. In this
   work, we study the gas transport into and out of a bubble positioned in
   a microfluidic device, taking into account the direct gas exchange
   through PDMS as well as the transport of gas through the liquid in the
   device. Hydrostatic pressure regulation allows for the quantitative
   control of growth, shrinkage, or the attainment of a stable equilibrium
   bubble size. We find that the vapor pressure of the liquid plays an
   important role for the balance of gas transport, accounting for
   variability in experimental conditions and suggesting additional means
   of bubble size control in applications.}},

Abstract = {{Employee stock options (ESOs) are American-style call options that can
   be terminated early in the case of employment shock. This paper studies
   an ESO valuation framework that accounts for job termination risk and
   jumps in the company stock price. Under general Levy stock price
   dynamics, we show that a higher job termination risk induces the ESO
   holder to voluntarily accelerate exercise, which in turn reduces the
   cost to the company. The holder's optimal exercise boundary and ESO cost
   are determined by solving an inhomogeneous partial integro-differential
   variational inequality. We apply the Fourier transform to simplify the
   variational inequality and develop accurate numerical methods.
   Furthermore, when the stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion,
   we provide closed-form formulas for both the vested and unvested
   perpetual ESOs. Our model is also applied to evaluate the probabilities
   of understating ESO expenses and contract termination.}},

Title = {{Efficient Blind Compressed Sensing Using Sparsifying Transforms with
   Convergence Guarantees and Application to Magnetic Resonance Imaging}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2519-2557}},
Abstract = {{Natural signals and images are well known to be approximately sparse in
   transform domains such as wavelets and discrete cosine transform. This
   property has been heavily exploited in various applications in image
   processing and medical imaging. Compressed sensing exploits the sparsity
   of images or image patches in a transform domain or synthesis dictionary
   to reconstruct images from undersampled measurements. In this work, we
   focus on blind compressed sensing, where the underlying sparsifying
   transform is a priori unknown, and propose a framework to simultaneously
   reconstruct the underlying image as well as the sparsifying transform
   from highly undersampled measurements. The proposed block coordinate
   descent-type algorithms involve highly efficient optimal updates.
   Importantly, we prove that although the proposed blind compressed
   sensing formulations are highly nonconvex, our algorithms are globally
   convergent (i.e., they converge from any initialization) to the set of
   critical points of the objectives defining the formulations. These
   critical points are guaranteed to be at least partial global and partial
   local minimizers. The exact point(s) of convergence may depend on
   initialization. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework
   for magnetic resonance image reconstruction from highly undersampled
   k-space measurements. As compared to previous methods involving the
   synthesis dictionary model, our approach is much faster, while also
   providing promising reconstruction quality.}},

Title = {{Rheological and Chemical Characterization of Biobinders from Different
   Biomass Resources}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2505}},
Pages = {{121-129}},
Abstract = {{The increasing costs and strong worldwide demand for petroleum and the
   adverse enviromnental impact of the consumption of nonrenewable energy
   sources have encouraged the development of alternative sources of
   renewable energy. One source of renewable energy can be developed in
   biorefineries, where biomass feedstocks can be converted to biocrude oil
   through thermochemical processes. Biocrude oil can replace
   petroleum-based transportation fuels and can be used to build and
   maintain transportation infrastructure, which requires an
   energy-intensive process that consumes natural resources, including
   mineral aggregates, steel, cement, and petroleum-based binder. This
   study aimed to characterize biocrude oil as an alternative binder
   material, which is referred to here as biobinder. The hydrothermal
   liquefaction technique was used to produce biobinder from spirulina
   algae (microalgae), swine manure, and nanoalgae. A chemical analysis was
   performed with the saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes
   technique to characterize the percentage of different components present
   in the biobinder. A theological characterization of biobinders was
   conducted to evaluate their feasibility for use in pavement construction
   and to predict their performance during the service life of a pavement.
   Surface free energy properties of biobinders also were determined with
   the use of a sessile drop device to characterize adhesion properties.
   The results indicated that biobinder had significantly different
   rheological and chemical properties than conventional asphalt binder.
   When blended with conventional binder, biobinder showed the potential to
   reduce the stiffness of original binder. As a result, it might be used
   to rejuvenate mixes with recycled asphalt materials or find an
   application under low-temperature conditions.}},

Title = {{A Pre-Trade Algorithmic Trading Model Under Given Volume Measures and
   Generic Price Dynamics}},
Journal = {{APPLIED MATHEMATICS RESEARCH EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{64-98}},
Abstract = {{We make several improvements to the mean-variance framework for optimal
   pre-trade algorithmic execution, by working with volume measures and
   generic price dynamics. Volume measures are the continuum analogies for
   discrete volume profiles commonly implemented in the execution industry.
   Execution then becomes an absolutely continuous measure over such a
   measure space, and its Radon-Nikodym derivative is commonly known as the
   participation of volume (PoV) function. The four impact cost components
   are all consistently built upon the PoV function. Some novel efforts are
   made for these linear impact models by having market signals more
   properly expressed. For the opportunistic cost, we go beyond the
   conventional Brownian-type motions. By working directly with the
   auto-covariances of the price dynamics, we remove the Markovian
   restriction associated with Brownians and thus allow potential memory
   effects. In combination, the final execution model becomes a constrained
   quadratic programming problem in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
   Important linear constraints such as participation capping are all
   permissible. Uniqueness and existence of optimal solutions are
   established via the theory of positive compact operators in Hilbert
   spaces. Several typical numerical examples explain both the behavior and
   versatility of the model.}},

Title = {{Inactivation mechanisms of cryptosporidium parvum oocysts by solar
   ultraviolet irradiation}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{188-198}},
Abstract = {{Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts have been known to cause adverse health
   effects worldwide, and processes that contribute to their inactivation
   have gained wide attention in recent years. Solar inactivation is an
   important process that can improve surface water quality. Solar
   disinfection (SODIS) can be used to disinfect water as a point-of-use
   alternative, and disinfect wastewater in waste stabilization ponds.
   However, a clear understanding of the oocyst solar inactivation
   mechanisms is lacking. This study systematically investigated the oocyst
   solar inactivation mechanisms in the presence of a wide range of
   environmental factors and also provided an insight on the metabolic
   response of oocysts using the microarray analysis. The result revealed
   that oocyst inactivation by solar UVA/visible light was dominated by
   UVA-induced internal radical damages and was sensitive to both the
   temperature and the oocyst source. External radical producing
   sensitizers did not enhance the UVA/visible light inactivation of
   oocysts due to the protection by the oocyst wall. In contrast, UVB was
   found to directly damage the oocyst genome, ensuring an effective
   inactivation that correlated only with UV fluence after being corrected
   for light screening regardless of the oocyst source, temperature, and
   the presence of external sensitizers. Further microarray analysis
   suggested that the effective UVB inactivation could be explained by the
   down-regulation of most of the genes responsible for cellular metabolic
   activities and the lack of expression of stress protection mechanisms in
   oocysts after 30 minutes of UVB exposure. These results facilitate the
   understanding and design of water and wastewater treatment processes
   that involve natural sunlight exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Cells' ability to sense and interpret mechanical signals from the

   cells detect such signals and activate downstream signaling at the

   (TGT) platform to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of cell
   spreading. Our data from both differentiated cells of cancerous and
   non-cancerous origin show that for the same stiff underlying glass
   substrates and for same ligand density it is the molecular forces across
   single integrins that ultimately determine cell spreading responses.
   Furthermore, by decoupling molecular stiffness and molecular tension we
   demonstrate that molecular stiffness has little influence on cell
   spreading. Our data provide strong evidence that links molecular forces
   at the cell-substrate interface to the degree of cell spreading.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},

Abstract = {{Much of the existing research on engineering students' conceptual
   understanding focuses on identifying difficult concepts in specific
   courses and curricula. Although there are a great number of findings
   from which engineering educators may be able to draw, few are directly
   transferable from their original context and few inform instructors
   about how to improve learning. This paper seeks to fill the gap by
   investigating conceptual understanding across four engineering
   disciplines. Specifically, the present study seeks to answer the
   following overarching research question: What are the patterns in
   engineering students' conceptual understanding across four engineering
   content areas? We used an amplified secondary qualitative data analysis
   to examine over 250 interviews with engineering students that were
   initially conducted to understand students' conceptual understanding in
   different disciplines of engineering. The engineering topics represented
   in the data set included mechanics of materials, transportation
   engineering, fluid mechanics, and digital logic. Two themes emerged from
   our analysis that apply to students' understanding across four diverse
   content areas within engineering: (1) students inappropriately group
   dissimilar phenomena, processes, or features, and (2) students reason
   using simplified causal relationships. These themes lend themselves to
   suggestions for instructional practice across disciplines and for future
   research areas.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have numerous algorithms to learn a sparse synthesis or
   analysis model from data. Recently, a generalized analysis model called
   the `transform model' has been proposed. Data following the transform
   model is approximately sparsified when acted on by a linear operator
   called a sparsifying transform. While existing transform learning
   algorithms can learn a transform for any vectorized data, they are most
   often used to learn a model for overlapping image patches. However,
   these approaches do not exploit the redundant nature of this data and
   scale poorly with the dimensionality of the data and size of patches.
   We propose a new sparsifying transform learning framework where the
   transform acts on entire images rather than on patches. We illustrate
   the connection between existing patch-based transform learning
   approaches and the theory of block transforms, then develop a new
   transform learning framework where the transforms have the structure of
   an undecimated filter bank with short filters. Unlike previous work on
   transform learning, the filter length can be chosen independently of the
   number of filter bank channels.
   We apply our framework to accelerating magnetic resonance imaging. We
   simultaneously learn a sparsifying filter bank while reconstructing an
   image from undersampled Fourier measurements. Numerical experiments show
   our new model yields higher quality images than previous patch based
   sparsifying transform approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Compressed Sensing has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where it enables accurate recovery of
   images from highly undersampled k-space measurements by exploiting the
   sparsity of the images or image patches in a transform domain or
   dictionary. In this work, we focus on blind compressed sensing, where
   the underlying sparse signal model is a priori unknown, and propose a
   framework to simultaneously reconstruct the underlying image as well as
   the unknown model from highly undersampled measurements. Specifically,
   our model is that the patches of the underlying MR image(s) are
   approximately sparse in a transform domain. We also extend this model to
   a union of transforms model that is better suited to capture the
   diversity of features in MR images. The proposed block coordinate
   descent type algorithms for blind compressed sensing are highly
   efficient. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the superior
   performance of the proposed framework for MRI compared to several recent
   image reconstruction methods. Importantly, the learning of a union of
   sparsifying transforms leads to better image reconstructions than a
   single transform.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic scattering is determined by not only the properties of
   individual scatterers, but also the correlation among scatterer
   positions. The role of scatterer spatial correlation is significant for
   dense medium, but has not been fully understood. The effect of scatterer
   spatial correlation may be modeled by a structure function
   (three-dimensional Fourier transform of the scatterer positions) as a
   frequency-dependent factor in the backscatter coefficient (BSC)
   expression. To study the structure function, we have performed three
   steps: 1) we developed theoretical structure function models that take
   into account the polydispersity of spherical scatterers; 2) we developed
   the cell pellet biophantom technique to estimate the structure function
   from ultrasound backscattered data (11 - 105 MHz); 3) we developed
   algorithms for estimating the structure function from histology,
   independent of the acoustic measurements. The acoustically estimated and
   histologically estimated structure functions show consistent frequency
   dependency, which demonstrates the correlation between acoustically
   estimated structure function and scatterer position distribution
   observed in histology. Furthermore, fitting the theoretical polydisperse
   structure function model to the experimental structure functions yielded
   relatively accurate cell radius estimates (error < 16\%). Our results
   suggest that the structure function is required for accurately modeling
   the acoustic scattering in dense medium.}},

Abstract = {{High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) can provide a means of
   noninvasive ablation of tissues such as tumors. However, currently the
   gold standard for monitoring HIFU is MRI temperature mapping. Because of
   the expense, lack of portability and slow update of temperature maps
   from MRI, ultrasonic solutions to monitoring of HIFU remain an important
   clinical goal. Real-time visualization of the field distribution of the
   HIFU source during treatment would allow the localization of the
   intersection of the beam with the tissue. Real-time visualization of the
   beam in the context of the tissue is important for proper placement of
   therapy especially during tissue motion. To visualize the HIFU field in
   a tissue, a reconstruction technique was employed using a Fourier-domain
   f-k migration approach with a linear array system co-aligned with the
   HIFU source. The reconstruction technique used the scattered signal from
   the medium to reconstruct the intensity field pattern of the HIFU field
   in situ and superimpose the intensity field image on a B-mode of the
   scattering medium. A 6-MHz single-element transducer (f/3) was used as
   the HIFU source and aligned perpendicular to the field of a linear array
   (L14-5) operated by a SonixRP system equipped with a Sonix-DAQ. The
   array had 128 elements and a measured center frequency of 6.5 MHz. The
   6-MHz HIFU source was pulse excited and the fields scattered from a
   sample, i.e., a homogeneous tissue-mimicking phantom or a chicken
   breast, were received by each element of the linear array. Beam forming
   based on Fourier-domain f-k migration techniques were applied to the
   channel data to reconstruct the intensity field pattern from the HIFU
   source. For comparison, a wire target was placed in the field and the
   intensity field pattern was reconstructed by moving the wire throughout
   the focal region. The intensity field pattern reconstructed from the
   sample was compared to the field characteristics of the 6-MHz source
   characterized by the wire technique. The intensity field pattern was
   then superimposed on a registered B-mode image of the sample acquired
   using conventional B-mode imaging with the linear array and the SonixRP
   to provide context to the therapy beam placement. The beam width
   estimates at the HIFU focus using the in situ reconstruction technique
   and the wire technique were 1.7 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively. The depth
   of field estimates for the in situ reconstruction technique and the wire
   technique were 20.1 mm and 19.0 mm, respectively. Therefore, the novel
   reconstruction technique was able to accurately visualize the field of a
   focused source in the context of the interrogated medium. The
   visualization technique would allow real-time adjustment of the HIFU
   beam location in tissues during therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Reduction of lateral sidelobes results in improved ultrasonic imaging.
   In general, apodization is used to lower sidelobes in exchange for
   increasing the width of the mainlobe and thus decreasing lateral
   resolution. Null Subtraction Imaging (NSI) is a technique that uses
   different on-receive apodizations on copies of the same image to to
   reduce sidelobe levels while also improving lateral resolution. In the
   NSI technique, several apodization functions are applied on receive. The
   first apodization weight is applied having a zero mean value when summed
   across the aperture. This places a null at the broadside of the receive
   pattern. The second apodization is the same as the first apodization
   except that a constant offset in weight is applied (non-zero mean). The
   third apodization is the transpose of the second. The images created
   with the different weighting schemes are then added to form a new image
   with improved sidelobe performance and dramatically better lateral
   resolution compared to conventional apodization. To evaluate the
   performance of this technique, experiments were performed with an ATS539
   phantom containing wire targets to assess lateral resolution and
   cylinder targets to assess contrast. A 9L4 array was used in the
   measurements connected to an Ultrasonix RP system with a SonixDAQ. Plane
   waves were emitted from the array and ultrasound echoes were received by
   each array element. Image reconstruction involved using Delay and Sum
   beamforming with apodization. Images were constructed using NSI and
   compared with rectangular weighted apertures. In experiments, the
   lateral resolution was observed to improve by a factor of five or better
   when compared to rectangular apodization. Image quality was assessed by
   estimation of lateral resolution (-3-dB receive beamwidth), the mainlobe
   to sidelobe ratio (MSR) in dB and estimation of the contrast-to-noise
   ratio (CNR). At f/\# = 1 focusing with NSI, the -6-dB beamwidth on
   receive as measured from a small wire target in the ATS phantom was
   0.414 lambda. Sidelobes were observed to decrease at each f/\# by an
   average of 17 dB with NSI compared to rectangular apodization. However,
   contrast of hyperechoic targets were lost when utilizing the NSI scheme.}},

Abstract = {{The production of integrated electronic circuits provides examples of
   the most advanced fabrication and assembly approaches that are generally
   characterized by large-scale integration of high-performance compact
   semiconductor elements that rely on rigid and essentially planar form
   factors. New methods of fabricating semiconductor membranes of nanoscale
   thickness with intrinsic mechanical flexible features are beginning to
   provide a set of means to lift these constraints by engendering
   deformable, three-dimensional device configurations that are difficult
   to achieve with bulk-scale materials while retaining capacities for high
   (or altogether new forms of) electronic and/or optoelectronic
   performance. Together with enabling means of deterministic assembly
   realized via the advancing technology of transfer-printing, these
   light-weight nanomembrane elements can be distributed over large areas
   on a soft, bendable, and even biocompatible secondary substrates with
   high throughput and yields to realize interesting new functionalities in
   technology. Exemplary cases include: large-area integrated
   electro-optical systems laminated onto curvilinear or other 3-D surfaces
   for use in sensing and imaging with capacities for accommodating
   demanding forms of mechanical flexure; and unconventional hybrid systems
   for lighting and photovoltaic energy conversion that provide a
   potentially transformational approach to supplant current technologies
   with high performance, low cost alternatives. Taken together, the
   results of recent research efforts illustrate important opportunities
   for exploiting advances in materials in synergy with physical means of
   patterning, fabrication and assembly. In this review, we explore several
   exemplary applications taken from this work, and specifically highlight
   scalable approaches to high performance integrated systems for low cost

Abstract = {{Architectural structures suffer from the impact of design loads and
   various kinds of external factors on their complex service conditions,
   which may lead to the accumulation of structural damage. This damage may
   give rise to the changes in structural dimension and material property,
   decrease structural security and degree of reliability, as well as bring
   potential safety hazard to building structures. Usually, the traditional
   damage identification method has great limitation in practical
   application because it requires accurate load information which is
   sometimes too complicated to be precisely measured. In order to solve
   this problem, the vibration transmissibility method is used. The
   vibration transmissibility is adopted as the damage index because it can
   not only reflect the characteristics of the structure itself, but also
   does not require external load information, which is of great importance
   in practical application. This article discusses the use of vibration
   transmissibility based method for detecting, locating and qualifying
   structural damage. For studying the feasibility of the damage
   identification method based on vibration transmissibility, various
   numerical simulations of an 8 degree of freedom structure and
   experiments on a cantilever beam were conducted. The main focus was to
   study the repeatability, sensitivity to damage and sensitivity to the
   damage location of this method In the experimental verification, the
   external load is simulated by hammer, the different extend of damage is
   simulated by varying degrees of loosened bolts and varying notch length.
   The results of the simulations and the experiments showed that the
   vibration transmissibility method was a promising method because it was
   independent of the external load, strongly sensitive to damage, and can
   identify the damage locations.}},

Abstract = {{Inland navigation locks are vital to the U.S. economy and due to their
   advanced age are expensive to maintain for proper operation. The U.S.
   Army Corps of Engineers is developing structural health monitoring
   technologies to provide decision support information that will be used
   to prioritize maintenance and assist in operational decisions. The
   Structural Monitoring and Analysis in Real Time of Lock Gates (SMART
   Gate) system will provide a suite of structural health monitoring
   capabilities for miter lock gates.
   Miter gates are the most common gate type in U.S. locks and are impacted
   by barges frequently and damage can accumulate over time from even minor
   impacts. Barge impacts into opened (recessed) gates often go unnoticed,
   especially for mild to moderate impacts.
   In this paper, an application of statistical process control to detect
   barge impacts to lock miter gates is described. As part of the SMART
   Gate project, the downstream miter gates at Lock 27 on the Mississippi
   River, near St. Louis, were instrumented with accelerometers and water
   pressure gages in 2014. Measurements were taken over the course of
   several lockage events to monitor dynamic gate response from door swing
   and wave action. Measurements included data taken during a barge impact
   event. These measurements were subsequently used to train and validate a
   barge impact detection algorithm. This algorithm consists of an
   autoregressive time series model and an x-bar chart to measure anomalies
   of model prediction error. After calibrating the algorithm to mitigate
   false-positives, it was found that barge impact was positively
   identified. This algorithm was programmed directly into affordable field
   data acquisition hardware for real-time detection and alerting the lock
   operator. Upon one final validation exercise, the algorithm will be
   employed on all future SMART Gate systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on structural health monitoring of the downstream
   miter gates on the main channel of Lock and Dam 27 just north of St.
   Louis, Missouri. Miter gates are the most prolific gate type employed by
   the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), used at more than
   75\% of all lock and dam sites throughout the United States. Structural
   health monitoring of these gates is important, because it provides a
   method for detecting damage, including degradation of boundary
   conditions, fatigue cracking, dragging of debris, or discrete
   occurrences of damage, such as barge impact, which may otherwise go
   unnoticed until the damage propagates and costly repairs become
   necessary. By knowing in real time the extent and location of damage, a
   better informed decision can be made as to whether or not the gate is in
   immediate need of repair. The initial Structural Monitoring and Analysis
   in Real Time of Lock Gates (SMART Gate) study of Lock and Dam 27 is
   focused on achieving several specific condition monitoring targets. The
   target that will be addressed in this paper is the ability to detect
   contact degradation between the lateral edge of the lock gate and the
   wall of the lock chamber. Preliminary results from finite element models
   show that contact degradation is a localized phenomenon, which is
   empirically known to occur over time. Initial field results have
   revealed seasonal changes in strain readings as well as non-linear
   strain behavior during the beginning of a chamber fill event. This paper
   presents initial efforts to combine these findings synergistically to
   detect contact degradation between the quoin and wall boundary on the
   downstream miter lock gates at Lock and Dam 27.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2507}},
Pages = {{50-56}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated the characterization of interface shear behavior
   in asphalt concrete through the estimation of the stress ratio (SR).
   This parameter, originally identified as the ratio between predicted
   interface stress from a finite element model (FEM) and interface shear
   strength at the corresponding normal stress, was assumed to be dynamic.
   As part of the experimental plan, monotonic tests on double-layered
   asphalt specimens were performed. Dynamic evaluations of the number of
   repetitions to failure under several stress conditions, equal to or
   higher than stresses computed from an FEM of the pavement structure,
   were also performed. The failure curves of the two testing modalities
   show similar patterns on the Mohr plane. The Hoek-Brown shear strength
   failure criterion and the three-dimensional surface that best fits the
   dynamic outcomes were considered. In this scenario, the SR referred to
   the proportion between the applied shear stress conditions in the
   dynamic modality and the maximum stress from monotonic tests. For the
   same predicted failure repetitions, SR assumed a constant value.
   Correlating monotonic and dynamic results could be an important approach
   both in furthering knowledge of interface shear strength and in
   predicting information about failure under repetitive loading
   applications based on simple monotonic tests.}},

Abstract = {{Among the remarkable variety of semiconducting nanomaterials that have
   been discovered over the past two decades, single-walled carbon
   nanotubes remain uniquely well suited for applications in
   high-performance electronics, sensors and other technologies. The most
   advanced opportunities demand the ability to form perfectly aligned,
   horizontal arrays of purely semiconducting, chemically pristine carbon
   nanotubes. Here, we present strategies that offer this capability.
   Nanoscale thermos-capillary flows in thin-film organic coatings followed
   by reactive ion etching serve as highly efficient means for selectively
   removing metallic carbon nanotubes from electronically heterogeneous
   aligned arrays grown on quartz substrates. The low temperatures and
   unusual physics associated with this process enable robust, scalable
   operation, with clear potential for practical use. Especially for the
   purpose of selective joule heating over only metallic nanotubes, two
   representative platforms are proposed and confirmed. One is achieved by
   selective joule heating associated with thin film transistors with
   partial gate structure. The other is based on a simple, scalable,
   large-area scheme through microwave irradiation by using micro-strip
   dipole antennas of low work-function metals. In this study, based on
   purified semiconducting SWNTs, we demonstrated field effect transistors
   with mobility (> 1,000 cm(2)/Vsec) and on/off switching ratio (similar
   to 10,000) with current outputs in the milliamp range. Furthermore, as
   one demonstration of the effectiveness over large area-scalability and
   simplicity, implementing the micro-wave based purification, on large
   arrays consisting of similar to 20,000 SWNTs completely removes all of
   the m-SWNTs (similar to 7,000) to yield a purity of s-SWNTs that
   corresponds, quantitatively, to at least to 99.9925\% and likely
   significantly higher.}},

Title = {{Examination of the Effect of Concrete Crosstie Rail Seat Deterioration
   on Rail Seat Load Distribution}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2476}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Abstract = {{One of the more critical failure modes of concrete crossties in North
   America is the degradation of the concrete surface at the crosstie rail
   seat, also known as rail seat deterioration (RSD). Loss of material
   beneath the rail can lead to wide gage, cant deficiency, reduced
   clamping force of the fastening system, and an increased risk of rail
   rollover. Previous research conducted at the University of Illinois at
   Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) identified five primary failure mechanisms
   associated with RSD: abrasion, crushing, freeze-thaw damage,
   hydroabrasive erosion, and hydraulic pressure cracking. Because the
   magnitude and distribution of load applied to the rail seat affects four
   of these five failure mechanisms, effectively addressing RSD requires an
   understanding of the factors affecting rail seat load distribution. As
   part of a larger study aimed at improving concrete crossties and
   fastening systems, UIUC researchers are attempting to characterize the
   loading environment at the rail seat by using matrix-based tactile
   surface sensors (MBTSS). This instrumentation technology has been
   implemented in both laboratory and field environments and has provided
   valuable insight into the distribution of a single load over consecutive
   crossties. This paper focuses on the analysis of data gathered from
   MBTSS experiments designed to explore the effect of manufactured RSD on
   the load distribution and pressure magnitude at the rail seat. The
   knowledge gained from these experiments will be integrated with
   associated research conducted at UIUC to form the framework for a
   mechanistic design approach for concrete crossties and fastening
   systems.}},

Title = {{Cost and Delay of Railroad Timber and Concrete Crosstie Maintenance and
   Replacement}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2476}},
Pages = {{37-44}},
Abstract = {{Because railroad crossties are the second most valuable railroad asset,
   it is critical that they be maintained and managed in a cost-effective
   manner. The direct expenses of track maintenance cost railroads billions
   of dollars each year, and additional millions are spent on recovery from
   track-caused derailments. Train delay costs further increase the
   consequences of unplanned track outages. Additionally, maintenance
   activities often result in traffic disruptions and congestion that can
   propagate throughout the rail network; this effect is a concern
   especially on higher-density lines that are vulnerable to cascading
   train delay and longer postincident recovery times. Compared with timber
   crossties, concrete crossties offer several potential benefits but also
   have a greater initial cost. Economic analysis can show instances in
   which extra capital investment in premium components is justified. Such
   analysis can also aid in planning general tie maintenance by balancing
   the costs of added maintenance with the associated benefit of reduced
   accident risk. This paper presents a model for evaluating the life-cycle
   economics of tie types by comparing concrete and timber crossties. A
   sensitivity analysis demonstrates how various inputs affect the cost
   comparison between timber and concrete ties.}},

Title = {{Ballast Settlement Ramp to Mitigate Differential Settlement in a Bridge
   Transition Zone}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2476}},
Pages = {{45-52}},
Abstract = {{Differential settlement in railroad track transitions, often associated
   with differences in track stiffness, may apply considerable impact load
   and may cause rapid deterioration of track geometry. Such differential
   settlement commonly seen in bridge approaches may lead to problems in
   ride comfort, track safety, and reliability. Ballast and subballast
   layers have been identified as a major cause of differential settlement
   related to the particulate nature of the aggregate deformation behavior
   causing degradation and breakdown associated with increased track usage.
   This paper describes an innovative field approach that successfully
   demonstrated the use of engineered ballast materials for reducing or
   mitigating the differential settlement problem in a bridge transition
   zone. Discrete element method (DEM) simulations were used to predict
   full-scale track deformations of four ballast materials having different
   gradations and aggregate shape properties. An imaging device was used to
   create accurate particle size distributions and shapes for measuring and
   quantifying by indexes the ballast aggregate shape properties, that is,
   particle flatness and elongation and angularity. On the basis of the
   results of the DEM modeling study, a bridge approach settlement ramp was
   constructed and tested at the Transportation Technology Center's
   Facility for Accelerated Service Testing. The results showed that the
   settlement ramp approach could be achieved by constructing ballasted
   track with proper selection of materials in each section of track
   transition zone. This study also demonstrated that the DEM simulation
   approach combined with image analysis could be used as a quantitative
   tool for predicting the ballast performance and providing help in design
   of track transitions.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of Tie Support at Transition Zones}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2476}},
Pages = {{53-58}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses two instrumentation techniques, linear variable
   differential transformers (LVDTs) and accelerometers, used to monitor
   and evaluate track structure behavior with the goal of nondestructively
   and quickly identifying track structural problems that eventually cause
   track geometry problems. LVDT results at a poorly performing bridge
   approach and corresponding open track site are used to show a
   relationship between poor tie support and the observed permanent
   vertical displacements. The existence of a gap between the bottom of the
   tie and the top of the ballast is expected to increase permanent ballast
   vertical displacements because of increased loads and vibration applied
   to the underlying ballast. Similarly, accelerometers show larger peak
   tie accelerations at ties with tie-ballast gaps and suggest that poor
   tie support increases applied loads to underlying ballast. Collected
   field data show that the tie-ballast gap can increase with time, which
   results in progressive loss of tie support at that tie and an increasing
   load on adjacent ties because of redistribution of wheel loads. The
   results show the need for a nondestructive monitoring system to be used
   with existing track geometry detection systems to improve identification
   of poorly supported ties. This system will guide maintenance to reduce
   the gap, because even a small gap can decrease tie and ballast
   performance and thus require remediation of a track section rather than
   a single tie.}},

Title = {{Sensitivity of Freight and Passenger Rail Fuel Efficiency to
   Infrastructure, Equipment, and Operating Factors}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2476}},
Pages = {{59-66}},
Abstract = {{After labor expenses, the cost of fuel is the largest operating budget
   expense item for freight and passenger rail operations in the United
   States. Because fuel is such a costly component of operations, the
   railroad industry is constantly researching and testing new methods
   either to reduce the volume of fuel consumed or to switch to
   less-expensive fuels and sources of energy. An understanding of the
   factors that affect fuel consumption and their interactions is valuable
   for analyzing the feasibility of a given technology. Such knowledge
   allows for more intelligent extrapolation of simulation and laboratory
   results across a range of routes and in-service operating conditions.
   This research investigates the relative effects of infrastructure,
   equipment, and operating parameters on fuel efficiency for freight and
   passenger railroads on a mixed-use corridor. Partial factorial
   experiments investigate the effects of multiple factors on freight and
   passenger train fuel efficiency. Rail simulation software is used to run
   trial cases of single-track lines with heterogeneous traffic and to
   calculate energy-efficiency metrics. Results from the simulations are
   used to create two multivariate regression models for freight and
   passenger rail fuel efficiency. A sensitivity analysis identifies the
   relative effects of these factors on freight and passenger train fuel
   efficiency. By understanding the relative influence of various
   parameters on fuel efficiency, practitioners can focus data collection,
   modeling, and other fuel-saving efforts on the most significant factors.}},

Title = {{Macroscopic Models for Accident Prediction at Railroad Grade Crossings:
   Comparisons with US Department of Transportation Accident Prediction
   Formula}},

Abstract = {{Accident prediction and ranking of high-accident locations at railroad
   grade crossings is often performed with the U.S. Department of
   Transportation (DOT) accident prediction formula, as described in the
   FHWA Railroad Highway Grade Crossing Handbook. However, the current
   version of the model was developed in the 1980s, and all model
   coefficients remain unchanged except for a normalizing constant that FRA
   updates every few years to reflect recent nationwide accident trends.
   This paper presents accident prediction models for the same warning
   device categories defined in the U.S. DOT model, but it uses a
   zero-inflated negative binomial form. Ten years of data from the state
   of Illinois were used to compare the accuracy of one of the models with
   the U.S. DOT accident prediction formula. Five years of data were used
   to create the model and estimate predictions, and the following 5 years
   were used to evaluate the predictions. Prediction accuracy is measured
   in terms of the cumulative accident frequency and the accuracy for
   ranking high-accident locations. Results highlight advantages of a model
   built with recent data to predict the overall accident trends and the
   absolute accident frequencies, as well as the benefits that the U.S. DOT
   prediction formula still may provide for ranking high-accident
   locations.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method of using atomized dielectric spray in EDM to reduce the
   consumption of dielectric is developed in this study. The atomized
   dielectric droplets form a moving dielectric film up on impinging the
   work surface that penetrates the inter-electrode gap and acts as a
   single phase dielectric medium between the electrodes and also
   effectively removes the debris particles from the discharge zone. EDM
   experiments are performed using three different dielectric supply
   methods, viz., conventional wet-EDM (electrodes submerged in dielectric
   medium), dry-EDM and spray-EDM in order to compare the processes based
   on material removal, tool electrode wear and flushing of debris from the
   inter-electrode gap across a range of discharge energies. It is observed
   that spray-EDM produces higher material removal compared to the other
   two methods for all combinations of discharge parameters used in the
   study. The tool electrode wear using atomized dielectric is
   significantly better than dry-EDM and comparable to that observed in
   conventional wet-EDM. The percentage of debris particles deposited
   within a distance of 100 mu m from the center of EDM crater is also
   significantly reduced using the atomized dielectric spray EDM technique.}},

Pages = {{95682-95689}},
Abstract = {{In supramolecular wrapping chemistry, polysaccharides are widely used as
   wrapping agents for the dissolution, dispersion and functionalization of
   carbon nanotubes. It is, therefore, of paramount importance to
   understand the effect of the topology - specifically the linkage - of
   the polymer chain on its spatial arrangement around the hollow tubular
   structure, and, hence, on the configuration and the nature of the
   supramolecular complex. To this end, the beta-1,4, alpha-1,4 and
   beta-1,3-glucans were chosen to wrap a single-walled carbon nanotube
   (SWCNT) as three prototypical assemblies. Molecular simulations reveal
   that alpha-1,4-glucan has the ability to wrap SWCNTs very tightly,
   whereas beta-1,3-glucans can only form irregular helices. The calculated
   binding affinity of the polysaccharide to the tubular surface follows
   the order alpha-1,4 > beta-1,4 > beta-1,3-glucan. The differences
   between the three hybrids can be generally described in terms of the
   inherent propensity of glucans to fold into helices, the hydrophobic
   interaction of the polysaccharide with the SWCNT, and the formation of
   intramolecular hydrogen bonds within the polymer chain. The wrapping
   mode of the glucan chain is mainly determined by its inherent helicity.
   The hydrophobic interaction is the driving force for helical wrapping.
   Moreover, the intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction can stabilize
   ideal, compact helical scaffolds. These factors determine the
   conformation and the binding affinity of the polysaccharide to the
   SWCNT. The present results can be generalized to other polymers like
   DNA, and shed new light on the universal principles that underlie the
   formation of supramolecular complexes using wrapping agents.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{46}},
Pages = {{8920-8929}},
Abstract = {{We develop an analytical model to predict equilibrium shapes of
   two-component heterogeneous vesicles or capsules. Using a free energy
   functional including the bending energies of the two components and line
   tension contributions, the model describes shape transitions between
   spherical and polyhedral (faceted) states, complementing and extending
   results of previous numerical simulations. In the parameter space of
   relative area fraction, bending modulus ratio, and line tension, a
   region of polyhedral shapes occurs for weak line tension and large
   bending modulus ratio and is very robust towards changes in the modeling
   assumptions. At large enough line tension, the spherical shape fragments
   into two components. Within the polyhedral region, we compare the
   energies of all regular and semiregular polyhedra, as well as those of
   arbitrary prismatic shapes. We find that the largest bending modulus
   contrasts together with larger line tension favor polyhedra with small
   face number as optimal shapes. In this region, we also demonstrate the
   counter-intuitive result that the most symmetric polyhedra are not
   energetically optimal, with specific Archimedean solids and specific
   prismatic shapes beating more isotropic (e.g. Platonic) polyhedra.
   Furthermore, all polyhedra of lowest energy are found to be three-fold
   coordinated. The shape transition boundary for polyhedra can be computed
   analytically. The model can be utilized to predict heterogeneous vesicle
   shapes and to estimate physical properties of the components
   constituting observed vesicles.}},

Abstract = {{Graph regularization-based methods have achieved great success for
   network classification by making the label-link consistency assumption,
   i.e., if two nodes are linked together, they are likely to belong to the
   same class. However, in a real-world network, there exist links that
   connect nodes of different classes. These inconsistent links raise a big
   challenge for graph regularization and deteriorate the classification
   performance significantly. To address this problem, we propose a novel
   algorithm, namely Consistent Graph Learning, which is robust to the
   inconsistent links of a network. In particular, given a network and a
   small number of labeled nodes, we aim at learning a consistent network
   with more consistent and fewer inconsistent links than the original
   network. Since the link information of a network is naturally
   represented by a set of relation matrices, the learning of a consistent
   network is reduced to learning consistent relation matrices under some
   constraints. More specifically, we achieve it by joint graph
   regularization on the nuclear norm minimization of consistent relation
   matrices together with l(1)-norm minimization on the difference matrices
   between the original relation matrices and the learned consistent ones
   subject to certain constraints. Experiments on both homogeneous and
   heterogeneous network datasets show that the proposed method outperforms
   the state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Lignin represents an untapped resource in lignocellulosic biomass,
   primarily due to its recalcitrance to depolymerization and its intrinsic
   heterogeneity. In Nature, microorganisms have evolved mechanisms to both
   depolymerize lignin using extracellular oxidative enzymes and to uptake
   the aromatic species generated during depolymerization for carbon and
   energy sources. The ability of microbes to conduct both of these
   processes simultaneously could enable a Consolidated Bioprocessing
   concept to be applied to lignin, similar to what is done today with
   polysaccharide conversion to ethanol via ethanologenic, cellulolytic
   microbes. To that end, here we examine the ability of 14 bacteria to
   secrete ligninolytic enzymes, depolymerize lignin, uptake aromatic and
   other compounds present in a biomass-derived, lignin-enriched stream,
   and, under nitrogen-limiting conditions, accumulate intracellular carbon
   storage compounds that can be used as fuel, chemical, or material
   precursors. In shake flask conditions using a substrate produced during
   alkaline pretreatment, we demonstrate that up to nearly 30\% of the
   initial lignin can be depolymerized and catabolized by a subset of
   bacteria. In particular, Amycolatopsis sp., two Pseudomonas putida
   strains, Acinetobacter ADP1, and Rhodococcus jostii are able to
   depolymerize high molecular weight lignin species and catabolize a
   significant portion of the low molecular weight aromatics, thus
   representing good starting hosts for metabolic engineering. This study
   also provides a comprehensive set of experimental tools to
   simultaneously study lignin depolymerization and aromatic catabolism in
   bacteria, and provides a foundation towards the concept of Lignin
   Consolidated Bioprocessing, which may eventually be an important route
   for biological lignin valorization.}},

Title = {{Methods of Analyzing and Comparing Energy Efficiency of passenger Rail
   Systems}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2475}},
Pages = {{54-62}},
Abstract = {{Because of growing concerns about the future environmental impact of
   passenger travel, modal energy efficiency is becoming increasingly
   important when benefits and costs of transportation system investment
   are evaluated. Because passenger rail systems are often cited as being
   relatively more energy efficient than other modes, reduced environmental
   impact is one justification for investment in new commuter rail
   projects. It is important that studies of purported environmental
   benefits analyze the energy efficiency of passenger rail systems and
   competing modes accurately and fairly by clearly defining the flow of
   energy through each transportation system. Furthermore, operational
   practices and constraints of the railway environment can complicate the
   analysis of energy efficiency; this complication makes it important to
   choose metrics that accurately describe the situation. This research
   identifies and describes four methods for analyzing the energy
   efficiency of passenger rail systems. Each method applies to a different
   system within the energy flow path. The combined methods are used to
   analyze the energy efficiency of 25 commuter rail systems in the United
   States. The results of each energy efficiency calculation method are
   then compared to illustrate how the relative attractiveness of each
   system can change on the basis of the selected analysis approach. By
   better understanding the challenges of conducting energy efficiency
   analyses involving different energy sources and fair comparison methods,
   researchers and policy makers can make informed decisions concerning the
   most appropriate method of analysis for drawing accurate comparisons
   between rail technologies and competing modes.}},

Title = {{Impact of Passenger Train Capacity and Level of Service on Shared Rail
   Corridors With Multiple Types of Freight Trains}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2475}},
Pages = {{63-71}},
Abstract = {{The North American rail network is experiencing capacity constraints
   because of traffic growth and increases in traffic heterogeneity.
   Further increases in speed and frequency of passenger service will
   combine with record levels of crude oil carload and intermodal traffic
   to demand even more network capacity. Understanding the interaction
   between passenger trains and this mix of freight traffic can help
   railroads develop effective strategies to improve network capacity and
   mitigate delay. Although previous research has focused on heterogeneity
   between two train types, actual rail lines are subject to multiple
   classes of trains such as passenger, priority intermodal, manifest, and
   bulk freight trains. To understand this environment better, this study
   presents a capacity evaluation process to analyze the performance of
   lines serving three train types. Although any combination of three train
   types can be considered, this study focuses on the interaction of
   passenger, intermodal, and bulk freight trains. The presented process
   can estimate the maximum train throughput for a particular corridor
   based on the unique characteristics and required level of service for
   each train type. A case study demonstrates three potential uses of the
   capacity evaluation process: the impact of additional passenger trains
   on lines with multiple types of freight trains, the sensitivity of
   capacity to the required level of service of each train type, and the
   effect of train speed heterogeneity between three types of trains. The
   results of this study provide better insight into the interaction of
   multiple train types and will aid railroads in maximizing the utility of
   their network.}},

Title = {{Capacity of Single-track Railway Lines with Short Sidings to Support
   Operation of Long Freight Trains}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2475}},
Pages = {{95-101}},
Abstract = {{Use of distributed-power locomotives in heavy-haul service has allowed
   for greater efficiencies through operation of longer freight trains. In
   North America, where the majority of main-line routes are single track,
   the potential economic and operational advantages offered by long trains
   are constrained by the inadequate length of many existing passing
   sidings. To implement longer trains, railroad operators may run long
   trains in a single direction or fleet trains or extend sidings enough to
   facilitate bidirectional operation of long trains. This research seeks
   to characterize the interaction between passing siding and train lengths
   and the subsequent effect on train delay. The operation of a
   single-track line is simulated under different combinations of freight
   throughput, percent of long sidings, percent of railcars in long trains,
   and directional distribution of long trains. The experiment design
   scenarios are simulated by using Rail Traffic Controller software.
   Results indicate that routes with roughly 50\% of long sidings eliminate
   any delay-based consequences of running long trains on the route. Thus,
   to operate with a high percentage of long trains, only half of the
   sidings on a route need to be extended to maintain the baseline level of
   service. These results are expanded through discussion of their
   practical application in planning programs to either extend existing
   sidings or construct new longer-length sidings. The findings can
   streamline the decision-making process associated with capital expansion
   projects and further the understanding of relationships between siding
   and train lengths, thereby facilitating the sustainable expansion of
   existing rail corridors in anticipation of future demand.}},

Abstract = {{Electric utilities are in the process of installing millions of smart
   meters around the world, to help improve their power delivery service.
   Although many of these meters come equipped with encrypted
   communications, they may potentially be vulnerable to cyber intrusion
   attempts. These attempts may be aimed at stealing electricity, or
   destabilizing the electricity market system. Therefore, there is a need
   for an additional layer of verification to detect these intrusion
   attempts. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection method that
   uniquely combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Density-Based
   Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to verify the
   integrity of the smart meter measurements. Anomalies are deviations from
   the normal electricity consumption behavior. This behavior is modeled
   using a large, open database of smart meter readings obtained from a
   real deployment. We provide quantitative arguments that describe design
   choices for this method and use false-data injections to quantitatively
   compare this method with another method described in related work.}},

Title = {{Oxygen reduction reaction induced pH-responsive chemo-mechanical
   hydrogel actuators}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{40}},
Pages = {{7953-7959}},
Abstract = {{We describe and characterize elementary designs for electrochemical
   micro- and macro-scale chemomechanical hydrogel actuators. The actuation
   of a pH-sensitive cross-linked polyacrylic acid (PAA) hydrogel is driven
   in the model devices through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
   occurring at the electrodes of an embedded Au mesh micro-electrochemical
   array. Proton consumption by the ORR at the cathode of the embedded
   electrochemical cell leads to the formation of a localized pH gradient
   that in turn drives the strain response in the composite actuators. The
   dynamics result from the ionization of the carboxylic acid moieties of
   the PAA network in the high pH region, yielding an osmotic pressure that
   drives a volumetric expansion due to water imbibition. This system
   actuates both stably and reversibly; when the electrochemically-induced
   ORR is halted, the localized pH gradient dissipates due to diffusive
   mixing, which in turn relaxes the induced strains. Two approaches to the
   fabrication of hydrogel actuators were examined in this work. The first
   method adopted a design based on small flagella (similar to 0.2 mm x 1.5
   mm x 60 mm, width x length x height) in which the actuating PAA
   structures are molded atop a set of fixed electrodes mounted on a
   supporting substrate. These hydrogel actuators show fast,
   large-amplitude, and largely reversible responses in the ORR mediated
   chemomechanical dynamics. We also investigated larger hydrogel actuators
   (similar to 4.5 mm x 11 mm x 1 mm, width x length x height), based on an
   autonomous design that embeds an open mesh stretchable micro-electrode
   array within the hydrogel. The significant and design-dependent impacts
   of mass transfer on the chemomechanical dynamics are evidenced in each
   case, a feature examined to elucidate more efficient mesoscopic design
   rules for actuators of this form.}},

   we apply nonlinear machine learning to experimental particle tracking
   data to infer low-dimensional assembly landscapes mapping the
   morphology, stability, and assembly pathways of accessible aggregates as
   a function of experimental conditions. To the best of our knowledge,
   this represents the first time that collective order parameters and
   assembly landscapes have been inferred directly from experimental data.
   We apply this technique to the nonequilibrium self-assembly of
   metallodielectric Janus colloids in an oscillating electric field, and
   quantify the impact of field strength, oscillation frequency, and salt
   concentration on the dominant assembly pathways and terminal aggregates.
   This combined computational and experimental framework furnishes new
   understanding of self-assembling systems, and quantitatively informs
   rational engineering of experimental conditions to drive assembly along
   desired aggregation pathways.}},

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{1423-1438}},
Abstract = {{Carbon monoxide (CO) is recognized as one of the most important gas
   signaling molecules involved in governing various therapeutic responses.
   Intracellular generation of CO is spatiotemporally controlled by
   catalytic reactions of heme oxygenases (HOs). Thus, the ability to
   control intracellular CO delivery with modulation of the CO-release rate
   in specific amounts and locations is expected to improve our fundamental
   understanding of the functions of CO and the development of clinical
   applications. For this purpose, CO-releasing molecules (CORMs) have been
   developed and investigated in vitro and in vivo. Most CORMs are based on
   transition metal carbonyl complexes. Recently, various biomaterials
   consisting of metal carbonyls with biomacromolecular scaffolds have been
   reported to improve the properties of bare metal carbonyls. In this
   mini-review, current progress in CO delivery, recent strategies for the
   development of CORMs, and future directions in this field are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The development of highly efficient As(III) adsorbents is critical to
   largely simplify the arsenic treatment process and lower its cost. For
   the first time, SnO2 nanospheres were demonstrated to possess a highly
   efficient As(III) adsorption capability from water in a near neutral pH
   environment as predicted by the material criterion we recently developed
   for the selection of highly efficient arsenic adsorbents. These SnO2
   nanospheres were synthesized by a simple and cost-effective hydrolysis
   process with the assistance of ethyl acetate under ambient conditions,
   which had a good dispersity, a narrow size distribution, a relatively
   large specific surface area, and a porous structure. A fast As(III)
   adsorption was observed in the kinetics study on these SnO2 nanospheres,
   and their Langmuir adsorption capacity was determined to be similar to
   112.7 mg g(-1) at pH similar to 7. The As(III) adsorption mechanism on
   SnO2 nanospheres was examined by both macroscopic and microscopic
   techniques, which demonstrated that it followed the inner-sphere complex
   model. These SnO2 nanospheres demonstrated effective As(III) adsorption
   even with exceptionally high concentrations of co-existing ions, and a
   good regeneration capability by washing with NaOH solution.}},

Title = {{van der Waals force-induced loading of proangiogenic nanoparticles on
   microbubbles for enhanced neovascularization}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{40}},
Pages = {{17139-17147}},
Abstract = {{Nanoparticles emerged as carriers of promising diagnostic and
   therapeutic molecules due to their unique size, injectability, and
   potential to sustainably release molecular cargos. However, with local
   injection of particles into target tissue, the significant particle loss
   caused by external biomechanical forces is a great challenge yet to be
   resolved to date. We hypothesized that nanoparticles associated with
   tissue-adherent microbubbles in the form of core shell particles due to
   van der Waals attractive forces would stably remain on an implanted site
   and significantly increase therapeutic efficacy of drug cargos. To
   examine this hypothesis, we used 100 nm diameter nanoparticles made of
   poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) as a model nanoparticle and 50 mu
   m diameter microbubbles made of poly(2-hydroxyethyl aspartamide) (PHEA)
   grafted with octadecyl chains, PHEA-g-C-18, as a model microbubble.
   Simple mixing of PLGA nanoparticles and PHEA-g-C-18 microbubbles
   resulted in the core shell particles. Following implantation, the
   PHEA-g-C18 microbubbles acted as glue to minimize the displacement of
   PLGA nanoparticles, because of the association between the octadecyl
   chains on PHEA-g-C-18 and the epithelium of the tissue. As a
   consequence, the core shell particles prepared with Angiopoietin-1
   (Ang1)-encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles significantly promoted
   vascularization in the implanted tissue. Overall, the results of this
   study provide a simple but advanced strategy for improving therapeutic
   efficacy of drug-carrying nanoparticles without altering their surface
   chemistry and potential.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the structural performance of a steel moment
   resisting frame (MRF) subject to fire and fire following earthquake,
   using a methodology that is based on system level reliability analysis.
   The study includes probabilistic models for the quantities with
   uncertainty including fire load, and mechanical and thermal properties
   of steel at elevated temperatures. Performance of the structure is
   evaluated based on several different limit states, and at different fire
   locations. Results show that the location of fire in the frame (e.g.,
   lower vs. upper floors and interior vs. exterior bays) affects the beam
   response. Compartments in the interior bays reach limit states faster
   than those on the perimeter, and upper floors reach limit sates sooner
   than lower floors. The post-earthquake damage does not affect the
   structural response under a fire for the considered limit states;
   however, fire following earthquake increases the drift demand on columns
   located on the perimeter of the structure.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{10-19}},
Abstract = {{In life-cycle assessments of roadway infrastructure projects, the
   significant amount of energy consumed during the use phase has been
   largely ignored when decisions related to roadway construction and
   rehabilitation have been evaluated. Traffic congestion, pavement types,
   and surface roughness conditions affect energy consumption throughout
   the use phase. This study developed an integrated modeling framework
   that accounted for the effects of pavement roughness degradation on
   estimated energy consumption for freeways and other restricted access
   highways, considering vehicle types and traffic growth, as well as
   congestion Patterns. The framework was achieved through three
   interdependent modules: Module 1 estimated vehicle specific power (VSP)
   by relating the International Roughness Index (IRI) of pavements to
   coefficients used in the Environmental Protection Agency's motor vehicle
   emission simulator, Module 2 used the state-of-the-art cell transmission
   model to predict traffic evolution and congestion on the freeway and
   determined the total vehicle miles traveled at a spectrum of speed
   ranges, and Module 3 estimated energy consumption from an IRI profile,
   VSP coefficients, and traffic speed miles profile. A case study
   confirmed that IRI and congestion had significant impacts on estimates
   of energy consumption during the use phase. The study showed that
   ignoring IRI variation or traffic congestion could lead to
   underestimations in VSP by up to 2.5\% and energy consumption by
   approximately 6\%.}},

   size, QB is the residue deposit from the production of required grades
   of aggregate often stockpiled in excess quantities. This paper provides
   findings of an industry survey of Illinois aggregate producers on the
   annual production rate, excess QB generated, and the current application
   areas of QB. The current uses of QB in Illinois were limited to
   applications with low amounts of QB, and, therefore, excessive amounts
   of QB may remain in the stockpiles. A detailed laboratory study
   conducted to characterize the engineering properties of QB materials
   produced in the primary, secondary, and tertiary aggregate production
   stages examined aggregate gradation, shape characteristics, and
   mineralogical analysis. Differences in shape and gradation of QB
   materials produced in each crushing stage were observed. Strength tests,
   including unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and direct shear, were
   conducted. Because the UCS for QB materials is very low, chemical
   admixtures such as portland cement and Class C fly ash were used to
   improve their strength properties. In general, treated QB materials were
   10 to 30 times stronger than the virgin QB samples. In the case of 10\%
   Class C fly ash treatment, UCS values achieved were as high as 340 psi.
   Such significant increases observed in the strength of stabilized QB
   materials may indicate suitability of QB for sustainable pavement
   applications.}},

Title = {{Overlay Thickness Design for Low-Volume Roads Mechanistic-Empirical
   Approach with Nondestructive Deflection Testing and Pavement Damage
   Models}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},

Pages = {{46-56}},
Abstract = {{Identifying the appropriate overlay thicknesses is critical to a local
   transportation agency's ability to maintain its pavement network. Local
   agencies often use empirical approaches for designing the overlay
   thickness for low-volume pavements. For example, overlay design for
   low-volume roads in Illinois is currently carried out using assumed
   layer coefficients for a limited number of material types. Although such
   empirical approaches are fairly simple to use, they are often not
   suitable for considering the effects of recycled and nontraditional
   construction materials that are more commonly considered in current-day
   sustainable pavement applications. The lack of mechanical testing for
   evaluating the pavement structural condition often leads to uneconomical
   practices in the rehabilitation of low-volume roads. This paper presents
   a mechanistic empirical approach for overlay thickness designs of
   low-volume pavements through a combination of nondestructive deflection
   testing and preestablished pavement damage models. Five pavement
   sections, with varying structural and traffic characteristics, were
   selected from two counties in Illinois. Three sets of falling weight
   deflectometer tests were conducted over a period of one year to monitor
   changes in pavement deflection responses. Structural conditions of the
   pavement sections in their original configuration were evaluated first.
   Then, the corresponding required overlay thicknesses were determined by
   using two methods currently used by local agencies. The inability of the
   currently available methods to properly account for current pavement
   structural conditions was highlighted. A new mechanistic empirical
   overlay thickness design method introduced in this study successfully
   identified structural deficiencies in the original pavement
   configurations.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2481}},
Pages = {{90-99}},
Abstract = {{An investigation was conducted to evaluate the long-term field aging
   effects of hot-poured crack sealants by differential aging testing. An
   analysis of rheological and mechanical properties to implement two
   performance-based tests was used to characterize aging of sealants. A
   set of eight types of crack sealants was exposed to approximately 2
   years of weathering conditions. Aging mechanisms were investigated by a
   comparison of the critical properties with those obtained at the time of
   installation inside a small kettle. Samples were collected every 6
   months after installation for laboratory characterization. Laboratory
   characterization included low-temperature stiffness, cohesion, adhesion,
   and viscosity. According to the results of the experimental program, a
   consistent increase was observed in the low-temperature stiffness of
   crack sealants as a result of weathering. The study showed that the low-
   and high-temperature properties of the surface portion were
   significantly influenced by weathering effects even within a short
   period of time. A superposition rule analogous to time temperature
   superposition for viscoelastic materials was applied to develop master
   curves. A phenomenological aging model was developed as a function of
   aging time and represented shift factors used in the master curve
   development. Sealants were categorized as Type A, B, or Con the basis of
   increasing aging potential.}},

Pages = {{1340-1371}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by mass-spectrometry protein sequencing, we consider the
   problem of reconstructing a string from the multisets of its substring
   composition. We show that all strings of length 7, one less than a prime
   and one less than twice a prime, can be reconstructed uniquely up to
   reversal. For all other lengths, we show that unique reconstruction is
   not always possible and provide sometimes-tight bounds on the largest
   number of strings with given substring compositions. The lower bounds
   are derived by combinatorial arguments, while the upper bounds follow
   from algebraic approaches that lead to precise characterizations of the
   sets of strings with the same substring compositions in terms of the
   factorization properties of bivariate polynomials. Using results on the
   transience of multidimensional random walks, we also provide a
   reconstruction algorithm that recovers random strings over alphabets of
   size >= 4 from their substring compositions in optimal near-quadratic
   time. The problem considered is related to the well-known turnpike
   problem, and its solution may hence shed light on this longstanding open
   problem as well.}},

   elucidation of the RNA recognition code for Pumilio and fem-3

   artificial RBPs for targeting endogenous mRNAs. In this review, we will
   focus on the recent advances in elucidating and reprogramming PUF domain
   specificity, update on several promising applications of PUF-based

Abstract = {{Continuous flow reactors show great promise for large-scale synthesis of
   quantum dots. Here, we discuss results for the synthesis of
   multi-layered Cd-based hybrid nanocrystals - CdSe/CdS/ZnS, CdS/ZnS, and
   CdSeS/ZnS - in a continuous flow reactor. The simple reactor design and
   liquid-phase chemistry obviate the need for preheating or in-line
   mixing, and the chosen reactor dimensions and operating conditions allow
   for high flow rates (similar to 10 mL min(-1)). Additionally, the simple
   reactor design is well suited for scale-up. The CdSe/CdS/ZnS particles
   synthesized at elevated temperatures in the reactor exhibit quantum
   yields of over 60\% at longer wavelengths (red region). The shell growth
   for these particles is conducted without the need for complex dropwise
   addition or SILAR shell growth procedures used in batch reactors.
   CdS-based particles were shown to have a higher performance when using
   octadecene-S instead of TOP-S, which improved the quality of shell
   growth. In addition, stoichiometric synthesis of the alternate CdSeS/ZnS
   alloy particles was conducted, removing the need for a large excess of S
   to offset the lower S reactivity. CdSeS/ZnS alloy nanoparticles exhibit
   quantum yields of about 50\% in the intermediate wavelength range
   (500-600 nm).}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{38}},
Pages = {{7663-7673}},
Abstract = {{We explore the gel transition of the aromatic dipeptide derivative
   molecule fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-diphenylalanine (Fmoc-FF). The
   addition of water to a solution of Fmoc-FF in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
   results in increased attractions leading to self-assembly of Fmoc-FF
   molecules into a space-filling fibrous network. We provide evidence that
   gel formation is associated with a first order phase transition
   resulting in nucleation and growth of strongly anisotropic crystals with
   high aspect ratios. The strength of attraction between Fmoc-FF molecules
   as a function of water concentration is estimated from long-time
   self-diffusion measurements using H-1 NMR diffusion-ordered spectroscopy
   (DOSY). The resulting phase behavior follows that observed for a wide
   range of other crystallizing nanoparticles and small molecules - a
   result consistent with the short-range nature of the intermolecular
   attractions. Furthermore, we use NMR to measure the rate of increase in
   the fraction of bound Fmoc-FF molecules after water is suddenly mixed
   into the system. We observe a lag time in the formation of the new phase
   indicative of the existence of a free energy barrier to the formation of
   a crystal nucleus of critical size. The application of classical
   nucleation theory for a cylindrical nucleus indicates that
   one-dimensional crystal growth is driven by an imbalance of the surface
   energies of the ends and sides of the fiber.}},

Journal = {{ANALYST}},

Volume = {{140}},

Pages = {{6544-6552}},
Abstract = {{Two label-free molecular imaging techniques, confocal Raman microscopy
   (CRM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), are combined for in
   situ characterization of the spatiotemporal distributions of quinolone
   metabolites and signaling molecules in communities of the pathogenic
   bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Dramatic molecular differences are
   observed between planktonic and biofilm modes of growth for these
   bacteria. We observe patterned aggregation and a high abundance of
   N-oxide quinolines in early biofilms and swarm zones of P. aeruginosa,
   while the concentrations of these secreted components in planktonic
   cells and agar plate colonies are below CRM and SIMS detection limits.
   CRM, in conjunction with principal component analysis (PCA) is used to
   distinguish between the two co-localized isomeric analyte pairs
   4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline-N-oxide (HQNO)/2-heptyl-3-hydroxyquinolone
   (PQS) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonylquinoline-N-oxide
   (NQNO)/2-nonyl-hydroxyquinolone (C9-PQS) based on differences in their
   vibrational fingerprints, illustrating how the technique can be used to
   guide tandem-MS and tandem-MS imaging analysis. Because N-oxide
   quinolines are ubiquitous and expressed early in biofilms, these
   analytes may be fundamentally important for early biofilm formation and
   the growth and organization of P. aeruginosa microbial communities. This
   study underscores the advantages of using multimodal molecular imaging
   to study complex biological systems.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{92}},
Pages = {{75519-75527}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates physicochemical properties of four different
   types of bio-oil produced through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and
   vacuum pyrolysis including wood pallet, corn stover, miscanthus and
   swine manure. It should be noted that the term bio-oil in this paper is
   used to refer to synthesized oil from post processing of biomass.
   Accordingly, swine manure was processed under HTL conditions of 340
   degrees C, 10-12 MPa with 15 min residence time. Bio-oils from
   miscanthus, corn stover and wood pellet were produced at 450 degrees C
   under vacuum pyrolysis. Furthermore, in this paper the merit of applying
   each of these bio-oils as a precursor for producing bio-adhesive was
   studied using physiochemical and rheological characterization. Chemical
   functional groups and individual compounds were identified with GC-MS,
   NMR and FT-IR, while molecular weight distribution determined using GPC
   showed that wood pellet bio-oil has the lowest molecular weight followed
   by those from corn stover, miscanthus and swine manure. In addition,
   boiling point distributions of different fractions of bio-oils were
   analyzed. Furthermore, TLC-FID was used to determine different fractions
   of bio-oils based on their solubility in comparison with those of
   petroleum. It was shown that overall bio-oils from woody bio-mass have
   higher amount of alcoholic compounds as evidenced by the presence of
   strong peaks related to ether and alcohols in FTIR spectra; in addition,
   the TLC-FID analysis showed presence of higher fraction of fused poly
   aromatic rings referred to ``asphaltene{''} in bio-oils produced from
   woody biomass compared to bio-oils from swine manure. The results of our
   characterization show the importance of feedstock composition and their
   effect on the characteristics of bio-oils as well as their applicability
   for use in bio-adhesives production.}},

Abstract = {{In a confluent, single-cell tissue layer, we show that cell shapes and
   statistics correlate directly with the tissue's mechanical properties,
   described by an energy functional with generic interfacial terms only.
   Upon increasing the cohesive component of the model, we observe a clear
   transition from a tense state with isotropic cells to a relaxed state
   with anisotropic cells. Signatures of the transition are present in the
   interfacial mechanics, the domain geometry, and the domain statistics,
   thus linking all three fields of study. This transition persists for all
   cell size distributions, but its exact position is crucially dependent
   on fluctuations in the parameter values of the functional (quenched
   disorder). The magnitude of fluctuations can be matched to the observed
   shape distribution of cells, so that visual observation of cell shapes
   and statistics provides information about the mechanical state of the
   tissue. Comparing with experimental data from the Cucumis epidermis, we
   find that the system is located right at the transition, allowing the
   tissue to relieve most of the local stress while maintaining integrity.}},

   direction. Here, we predict that bi-tortuous electrode structures
   (containing electrolyte-filled macro-pores embedded in micro-porous
   graphite) can enhance ion transport and can achieve double the discharge
   capacity compared to an unstructured electrode at the same average
   porosity. We introduce a new two-dimensional version of porous-electrode
   theory with anisotropic ion transport to investigate these effects and
   to interpret the mechanisms by which performance enhancements arise.
   From this analysis we determine criteria for the design of bi-tortuous
   graphite anodes, including the particular volume fraction of macro-pores
   that maximizes discharge capacity (approximately 20 vol.\%) and a
   threshold spacing interval (half the electrode's thickness) below which
   only marginal enhancement in discharge capacity is obtained. We also
   report the sensitivity of performance with respect to cycling rate,
   electrode thickness, and average porosity/electroactive-material
   loading. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.}},

Abstract = {{An inorganic solution similar to the inorganic electrolyte compartment
   of the DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium) cell culture medium is
   developed. This biomineralization medium contains 44.05 mM HCO3-, 126.86
   mM Na+, 93.37 mM Cl-, 5.33 mM K+, 2.26 mM Ca2+, 0.905 mM H2PO4-, and
   0.81 mM Mg2+. Its Ca/P molar ratio is set to be identical with that of
   human blood plasma, i.e., 2.50. The medium is free of any Tris or Hepes
   but maintains a pH of 7.45 both at 37 and 65 degrees C. The first
   novelty of this solution is it has the unique ability to homogeneously
   coat X-ray-amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) on glass slides vertically
   immersed in it and kept at 37 degrees C for less than 48 h. The second
   innovative aspect of this solution is it has the unprecedented ability
   to produce monodisperse ACP nanospheres with diameters of about 180 nm
   when simply heated at 65 degrees C for 1 h while being stirred. The
   third novelty of this solution is it only forms ACP and it does not form
   apatite in stark contrast to many other synthetic calcification or
   biomineralization solutions (media) known. Samples were characterized by
   XRD, FTIR, EDXS, BET, SEM, TEM, ICP-AES and contact angle goniometry.}},

Abstract = {{Geopolymer is the refractory inorganic ps formed from both aluminum and
   silicon source. South Korean rice husk ash (RHA) has been investigated
   as an alternative silica source to replace fume silica currently used in
   geopolymer rdfdffdfdesearch. In order to acquire proper RHA from raw
   rice husk, the optimal calcination temperature, which produces the
   highest amount of amorphous silica, was studied. Scanning Electron
   Microscopy with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) have been used to verify the contents of RHA.
   Previously many researchers have studied mixtures of RHA/fly ash (FA) or
   RHA/red mud (RM), resulting the ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 varied by the each
   mixture. However, in this paper, RHA is only replaced to a certain
   portion of fumed silica. Thus, the fundamental ratio of each ingredient
   in the geopolymer (M: SiO2 : AlO2 : H2O = 1 : 1 : 4 : 11) where M is Na,
   K or Cs was strictly kept. Five variations of RHA/Fumed silica mixture
   (0/100, 25/75, 50/50, 75/25, 100/0) have been studied. Each mixture was
   dissolved with potassium hydroxide (KOH) and deionized water for 24
   hours on the stirring plate and then became water glass. Metakaolin was
   added to water glass and mixed properly. The geopolymer slurry was
   poured into the mold and cured at 50 degrees C for 24 hours. After
   demolding, the RHA geopolymer samples were kept for a minimum of 3 days
   at the room temperature. The flexural stress of RHA geopolymer samples
   were investigated by 3-point bend tests at room temperature using the
   guidelines prescribed by ASTM C78/C78-M standard. The fracture surfaces
   from the bending tests were examined by using Scanning Electron
   Microscope (SEM). It was demonstrated that the RHA can clearly be the
   fumed-silica alternative.}},

Abstract = {{Sociohydrology is the study of coupled human-water systems, building on
   the premise that water and human systems co-evolve: the state of the
   water system feeds back onto the human system, and vice versa, a
   situation denoted as ``two-way coupling{''}. A recent special issue in
   HESS/ESD, ``Predictions under change: water, earth, and biota in the
   Anthropocene{''}, includes a number of sociohydrologic publications that
   allow for a survey of the current state of understanding of
   sociohydrology and the dynamics and feedbacks that couple water and
   human systems together, of the research methodologies being employed to
   date, and of the normative and ethical issues raised by the study of
   sociohydrologic systems. Although sociohydrology is concerned with
   coupled human-water systems, the feedback may be filtered by a
   connection through natural or social systems, for example, the health of
   a fishery or through the global food trade, and therefore it may not
   always be possible to treat the human-water system in isolation. As part
   of a larger complex system, sociohydrology can draw on tools developed
   in the social-ecological and complex systems literature to further our
   sociohydrologic knowledge, and this is identified as a ripe area of
   future research.}},

Abstract = {{Recent North American railway trends, signify a transition to increased
   axle loads and higher train speeds. The use of concrete crossties is
   common practice in these applications for a variety of reasons,
   including higher load-carrying capacity and improved ability to maintain
   proper track geometry. Currently, prestressed concrete monoblock
   crossties share many geometric and structural properties regardless of
   manufacturer. For multiple reasons, some manufacturers are investigating
   the potential benefits of new geometries for crosstie design. One
   alternative currently being explored is to modify the length and
   cross-section of the crosstie in order to increase the flexural capacity
   while using a similar amount of material. In this paper the benefits and
   implications of these changes will be explored both through theoretical
   calculations and laboratory testing. This alternative design will be
   evaluated and compared to concrete crossties representative of those
   currently found in North America. Comparison of the designs will be
   based on structural cracking at critical locations along the crosstie.
   These results were used to provide guidance on critical design
   parameters for concrete crossties capable of withstanding future loading
   and performance demands.}},

Abstract = {{As higher demands are placed on North American railroad infrastructure
   by heavy haul traffic, it is increasingly important to understand the
   factors affecting the magnitude and distribution of load imparted to
   concrete crosstie rail seats. The rail seat load distribution is
   critical to the analysis of failure mechanisms associated with rail seat
   deterioration (RSD), the degradation of the concrete surface at the
   crosstie rail seat. RSD can lead to wide gauge, cant deficiency, and an
   increased risk of rail rollover, and is therefore of primary concern to
   Class I Freight Railroads in North America. Researchers at the
   University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (URIC) have successfully
   characterized the loading environment at the rail seat using
   matrix-based tactile surface sensors (MBTSS). Previous research has
   proven the feasibility of using MBTSS in both laboratory and field
   applications, and recent field experimentation has yielded several
   hypotheses concerning the effect of fastening system wear on the rail
   seat load distribution. This paper will focus on the analysis of data
   gathered from laboratory experimentation with MBTSS to evaluate these
   hypotheses, and will propose a metric for crosstie and fastening system
   design which considers the uniformity of the load distribution. The
   knowledge gained from this experimentation will be integrated with
   associated research conducted at URIC to form the framework for a
   mechanistic design approach for concrete crossties and fastening
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a review of railroad track transition designs that
   have performed well, e.g., ballasted bridge decks, hot-mixed asphalt
   (HMA) sublayer, and concrete wing walls parallel to the track, to guide
   future design and maintenance of bridge transitions instead of
   installing a concept and monitoring its performance. Using non-invasive
   monitoring techniques, e.g., miniature accelerometers, the performance
   of the two railroad track transitions has been measured and evaluated.
   The results show well-performing track exhibits tie accelerations of 5g
   or less with little difference between: (1) the bridge deck, approach
   embankment, and open track, (2) concrete and wood ties, and (3) clayey
   or silty subgrades. The measured transient vertical tie displacements
   are negligible, which verifies the observed good track support. The
   results from these two sites are being used as a control for comparison
   with poorly-performing bridge transitions, track defects, e.g. broken
   ties, rail-fastener gaps, fouled ballast, broken rail, and to verify the
   success of remedial measures.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{912-943}},
Abstract = {{We consider multicommodity flow and cut problems in polymatroidal
   networks where there are submodular capacity constraints on the edges
   incident to a node. Polymatroidal networks were introduced by Lawler and
   Martel {[}Math. Oper. Res., 7 (1982), pp. 334-347] and Hassin {[}On
   Network Flows, Ph.D. dissertation, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 1978]
   in the single-commodity setting and are closely related to the
   submodular flow model of Edmonds and Giles {[}Ann. Discrete Math., 1
   (1977), pp. 185-204]; the well-known maxflow-mincut theorem holds in
   this more general setting. Polymatroidal networks for the multicommodity
   case have not, as far we are aware, been previously explored. Our work
   is primarily motivated by applications to information flow in wireless
   networks. We also consider the notion of undirected polymatroidal
   networks and observe that they provide a natural way to generalize flows
   and cuts in edge and node capacitated undirected networks. We establish
   flow-cut gap results in several scenarios that have been previously
   considered in the standard network flow models where capacities are on
   the edges or nodes. Our results are based on analyzing the dual of the
   flow relaxations via continuous extensions of submodular functions, in
   particular, the Lovasz extension. For directed graphs we rely on a
   simple yet useful reduction from polymatroidal networks to standard
   networks. For undirected graphs we rely on the interplay between the
   Lovasz extension of a submodular function and line embeddings with low
   average distortion introduced by Matousek and Rabinovich {[}Israel J.
   Math., 123 (2001), pp. 285-301]; this connection is inspired by, and
   generalizes, the work of Feige, Hajiaghayi, and Lee on node-capacitated
   multicommodity flows and cuts. Our results have found applications in
   wireless network information flow {[}S. Kannan and P. Viswanath, IEEE
   Trans. Inform. Theory, 60 (2014), pp. 6303-6328] and we anticipate
   others in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale groundwater management problems pose great computational
   challenges for decision making because of the spatial complexity and
   heterogeneity. This study describes a modeling framework to solve
   large-scale groundwater management problems using a newly developed
   spatial evolutionary algorithm (SEA). This method incorporates spatial
   patterns of the hydrological conditions to facilitate the optimal search
   of spatial decision variables. The SEA employs a hierarchical tree
   structure to represent spatial variables in a more efficient way than
   the data structure used by a regular EA. Furthermore, special crossover,
   mutation and selection operators are designed in accordance with the
   tree representation. In this paper, the SEA was applied to searching for
   the maximum vegetation coverage associated with a distributed
   groundwater system in an arid region. Computational experiments
   demonstrate the efficiency of SEA for large-scale spatial optimization
   problems. The extension of this algorithm for other water resources
   management problems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a data-driven method of estimating stochastic models
   that describe spatial uncertainties. Relating these uncertainties to the
   spatial statistics literature, we describe a general framework that can
   handle heterogeneous random processes by providing a parameterization
   for the nonstationary covariance function in terms of a transformation
   function and then estimating the unknown hyperparameters from data using
   Bayesian inference. The transformation function is specified as a
   displacement that transforms the coordinate space to a deformed
   configuration in which the covariance between points can be represented
   by a stationary model. This approach is then used to model spatial
   uncertainties in microelectromechanical actuators, where the ground
   plate is assumed to have a spatially varying profile. We estimate the
   stochastic model corresponding to the random surface using synthetic
   profilometric data that simulate multiple experimental measurements of
   ground plate surface roughness. We then demonstrate the effect of the
   uncertainty on the displacement of the actuator as well as on other
   parameters, such as the pull-in voltage. We show that the
   nonstationarity is essential when performing uncertainty quantification
   in electrostatic microactuators.}},

Abstract = {{Carbonation is an important deleterious process for concrete structures.
   Carbonation begins when carbon dioxide (CO2) present in the atmosphere
   reacts with portlandite producing calcium carbonate (CaCO3). In severe
   carbonation conditions, C-S-H gel is decomposed into silica gel (SiO2
   center dot nH(2)O) and CaCO3. As a result, concrete pore water pH
   decreases (usually below 10) and eventually steel reinforcing bars
   become unprotected from corrosion agents. Usually, the carbonation of
   the cementing matrix reduces the porosity, because CaCO3 crystals
   (calcite and vaterite) occupy more volume than portlandite. In this
   study, an accelerated carbonation-ageing process is conducted on
   Portland cement mortar samples with water to cement ratio of 0.5. The
   evolution of the carbonation process on mortar is monitored at different
   levels of ageing until the mortar is almost fully carbonated. A
   nondestructive technique based on nonlinear acoustic resonance is used
   to monitor the variation of the constitutive properties upon
   carbonation. At selected levels of ageing, the compressive strength is
   obtained. From fractured surfaces the depth of carbonation is determined
   with phenolphthalein solution. An image analysis of the fractured
   surfaces is used to quantify the depth of carbonation. The results from
   resonant acoustic tests revealed a progressive increase of stiffness and
   a decrease of material nonlinearity.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of dolomitic limestone rock samples with increasing
   levels of damage is presented using linear and nonlinear ultrasonic
   approaches. Limestone test samples with increasing levels of damage were
   created artificially by exposing virgin samples to increasing
   temperature levels of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 degrees C
   for a ninety minute period of time. The linear characterization is based
   upon the concept of complex moduli, which is estimated using ultrasonic
   dilatational and shear phase velocity measurements and corresponding
   attenuations. The nonlinear approach is based upon non-collinear wave
   mixing, involving mixing of two dilatational waves. Criteria were used
   to assure that the detected scattered wave originated via wave
   interaction in the limestone and not from nonlinearities in the testing
   equipment. These criteria included frequency and propagating direction
   of the resultant scattered wave, and the time-of-flight separation
   between the two primary waves and the resulting scattered wave. It was
   observed that both the linear and nonlinear approaches are able to
   characterize the level of damage in limestone rock.}},

Abstract = {{Towards developing a method capable to assess the efficiency of
   rejuvenators to restore embrittlement temperatures of oxidized asphalt
   binders towards their original, i.e., unaged values, three gyratory
   compacted specimens were manufactured with mixtures oven-aged for 36
   hours at 135 degrees C. In addition, one gyratory compacted specimen
   manufactured using a short-term oven-aged mixture for two hours at 155
   degrees C was used for control to simulate aging during plant
   production. Each of these four gyratory compacted specimens was then cut
   into two cylindrical specimen 5 cm thick for a total of six 36-hour
   oven-aged specimens and two short term aging specimens. Two specimens
   aged for 36 hours and the two short-term specimens were then tested
   using an acoustic emission approach to obtain base acoustic emission
   response of short-term and severely-aged specimens. The remaining four
   specimens oven-aged for 36 hours were then treated by spreading their
   top surface with rejuvenator in the amount of 10\% of the binder by
   weight. These four specimens were then tested using the same acoustic
   emission approach after two, four, six, and eight weeks of dwell time.
   It was observed that the embrittlement temperatures of the short-term
   aged and severely oven-aged specimens were -25 degrees C and 15 degrees
   C, respectively. It was also observed that after four weeks of dwell
   time, the rejuvenator-treated samples had recuperated the original
   embrittlement temperatures. In addition, it was also observed that the
   rejuvenator kept acting upon the binder after four weeks of dwell time;
   at eight weeks of dwell time, the specimens had an embrittlement
   temperature about one grade cooler than the embrittlement temperature
   corresponding to the short-term aged specimen.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial long chain alcohols and alkanes are renewable biofuels that
   could one day replace petroleum-derived fuels. Here we report a novel
   pathway for high efficiency production of these products in Escherichia
   coli strain BL21(DE3). We first identified the acyl-ACP
   reductase/aldehyde deformylase combinations with the highest activity in
   this strain. Next, we used catalase coexpression to remove toxic
   byproducts and increase the overall titer. Finally, by introducing the
   type-I fatty acid synthase from Corynebacterium ammoniagenes, we were
   able to bypass host regulatory mechanisms of fatty acid synthesis that
   have thus far hampered efforts to optimize the yield of acyl-ACP-derived
   products in BL21(DE3). When all these engineering strategies were
   combined with subsequent optimization of fermentation conditions, we
   were able to achieve a final titer around 100 mg L-1 long chain
   alcohol/alkane products including a 57 mg L-1 titer of pentadecane, the
   highest titer reported in E. coli BL21(DE3) to date. The expression of
   prokaryotic type-I fatty acid synthases offer a unique strategy to
   produce fatty acid-derived products in E. coli that does not rely
   exclusively on the endogenous type-II fatty acid synthase system.}},

   implicit finite element method}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1526-1548}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe several novel
   techniques for implementing a crystal plasticity (CP) material model in
   a large deformation, implicit finite element framework.
   Design/methodology/approach - Starting from the key kinematic
   assumptions of CP, the presentation develops the necessary CP correction
   terms to several common objective stress rates and the consistent
   linearization of the stress update algorithm. Connections to models for
   slip system hardening are isolated from these processes.
   Findings - A kinematically consistent implementation is found to require
   a correction to the stress update to include plastic vorticity developed
   by slip deformation in polycrystals. A simpler, more direct form for the
   algorithmic tangent is described. Several numerical examples demonstrate
   the capabilities and computational efficiency of the formulation.
   Research limitations/implications - The implementation assumes isotropic
   slip system hardening. With simple modifications, the described approach
   extends readily to anisotropic coupled or uncoupled hardening functions.
   Practical implications - The modular formulation and implementation
   support streamlined development of new models for slip system hardening
   without modifications of the stress update and algorithmic tangent
   computations. This implementation is available in the open-source code
   WARP3D.
   Originality/value - In the process of developing the CP formulation,
   this work realized the need for corrections to the Green-Naghdi and
   Jaumann objective stress rates to account properly for non-zero plastic
   vorticity. The paper describes fully the consistent linearization of the
   stress update algorithm and details a new scheme to implement the model
   with improved efficiency.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},

Abstract = {{The demand for leadership capacity in engineering graduates is growing.
   However, little research has been done to examine the current state of
   leadership education of engineering students. Using a college experience
   framework, we tested how engineering students' leadership-oriented
   experiences and outcomes differ from non-engineering students. This
   study examined a national representative sample of students (N = 90,444)
   encompassing 101 higher education institutions. The results suggest that
   engineering students are less involved in group experiences in high
   school, but do not differ from comparable peers in self-reported
   leadership capacity coming to college. The involvement gap continues
   throughout their higher education. While their self-reported leadership
   capacity remains similar to comparable non-engineering students, the
   results suggest their ability to interact on diverse teams remains
   depressed. This study has significant implications for the processes
   engineering educators utilize to support their students in building
   working relationships and successful teams.}},

Title = {{Using an optimality model to understand medium and long-term responses
   of vegetation water use to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{Vegetation has different adjustable properties for adaptation to its
   environment. Examples include stomatal conductance at short time scale
   (minutes), leaf area index and fine root distributions at longer time
   scales (days - months) and species composition and dominant growth forms
   at very long time scales (years - decades - centuries). As a result, the
   overall response of evapotranspiration to changes in environmental
   forcing may also change at different time scales. The vegetation
   optimality model simulates optimal adaptation to environmental
   conditions, based on the assumption that different vegetation properties
   are optimized to maximize the long-term net carbon profit, allowing for
   separation of different scales of adaptation, without the need for
   parametrization with observed responses. This paper discusses model
   simulations of vegetation responses to today's elevated atmospheric CO2
   concentrations (eCO(2)) at different temporal scales and puts them in
   context with experimental evidence from free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE)
   experiments. Without any model tuning or calibration, the model
   reproduced general trends deduced from FACE experiments, but, contrary
   to the widespread expectation that eCO(2) would generally decrease water
   use due to its leaf-scale effect on stomatal conductance, our results
   suggest that eCO(2) may lead to unchanged or even increased vegetation
   water use in water-limited climates, accompanied by an increase in
   perennial vegetation cover.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of measurement artifacts can be blamed for misinterpretations
   of shear thinning, shear thickening, and viscoelastic responses, when
   the material does not actually have these properties. The softness and
   activity of biological materials will often magnify the challenges of
   experimental rheological measurements. The theoretical definitions of
   rheological material functions are based on stress, strain, and
   strain-rate components in simple deformation fields. In reality, one
   typically measures loads and displacements at the boundaries of a
   sample, and the calculation of true stress and strain may be encumbered
   by instrument resolution, instrument inertia, sample inertia, boundary
   effects, and volumetric effects. Here we discuss these common challenges
   in measuring shear material functions in the context of soft,
   water-based, and even living biological complex fluids. We discuss
   techniques for identifying and minimizing experimental errors and for
   pushing the experimental limits of rotational shear rheometers. Two
   extreme case studies are used: an ultrasoft aqueous polymer/fiber
   network (hagfish defense gel) and an actively swimming suspension of
   microalgae (Dunaliella primolecta).}},

Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{198-202}},
Abstract = {{The electrical, optical and mechanical properties of compound oxides
   film depend strongly on the composition of the film, especially for
   vanadium oxide thin films, since the vanadium-oxygen phase diagram
   includes mixed valence oxides with two or more oxidation states.
   Therefore, it is interesting to predict the film stoichiometry in VOx
   films. However, it has not, to any great extent yet, been possible to
   predict the composition of vanadium oxides films. In this article, we
   present a model that enables us to predict film composition of vanadium
   oxides prepared by reactive sputtering. Based on this model, the
   fraction ratio of V, V2O3, VO2 and V2O5 in the substrate surface as a
   function of oxygen flow is investigated. It is concluded that the
   presented theoretical model for the involved reactions and composition
   of VOx thin film during reactive sputtering process is in qualitative
   agreement with the XPS results from experiment and can be used to find
   optimum processing conditions for deposition of films of a desired
   composition.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles have recently had a major impact on basic biosciences, the
   pharmaceutical industry, and preclinical and translational medicine by
   enabling targeted delivery of therapeutic cargo to cells and tissues.
   The capacity to specifically tailor the pharmacokinetics,
   biodistribution, and long-term fate of therapeutic molecules for
   specific diseases and to avoid off-target side effects is a tremendously
   promising capability of these materials. However targeting of
   nanoparticle therapies from systemic circulation is very inefficient,
   and our understanding of the fundamental processes dictating in vivo
   fate remains limited, making it challenging to determine how to
   optimally and rationally design these materials for maximum efficacy.
   Recently multi-modal, multi-scale imaging technologies have emerged that
   have helped to improve our insight into these processes. Theranostic
   imaging agents have provided real-time and quantitative readouts of drug
   distribution and therapeutic response, multimodal imaging platforms have
   allowed a multi-scale analysis of distribution from the levels of cells
   to tissues, and exciting applications in live-animal tissue microscopy
   have provided key insights at the cellular level. In this review, we
   describe how multiscale imaging has shaped our ability to optimize
   nanoparticle drugs and discuss future directions that are expected to
   further catalyze clinical translation.}},

   the thermoelectric properties of quantum dot molecules}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Pages = {{19386-19393}},
Abstract = {{The quantum interference and orbital filling effects on the
   thermoelectric (TE) properties of quantum dot (QD) molecules with high
   figure of merit are illustrated via the full solution to the
   Hubbard-Anderson model in the Coulomb blockade regime. It is found that
   under certain conditions in the triangular QD molecule (TQDM),
   destructive quantum interference (QI) can occur, which leads to
   vanishingly small electrical conductance, while the Seebeck coefficient
   is modified dramatically. When the TQDM is in the charge localization
   state due to QI, the Seebeck coefficient is seriously suppressed at low
   temperature, but is highly enhanced at high temperature. Meanwhile, the
   behavior of the Lorenz number reveals that it is easier to block charge
   transport via destructive QI than the electron heat transport at high
   temperatures. The maximum power factor (PF) in the TQDM occurs under
   full-filling conditions. Nevertheless, low-filling conditions are
   preferred for getting the maximum PF in serially coupled triple QDs in
   general. In double QDs, the maximum PF can be achieved either with
   orbital-depletion or orbital-filling as a result of electron-hole
   symmetry. Our theoretical work provides a useful guideline for the
   advancement of the nanoscale TE technology.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{29}},
Pages = {{5947-5954}},
Abstract = {{We propose an interpolation formula (the EV-WLC relation) for the
   force-extension behavior of wormlike chains in the presence of hard-core
   excluded volume interactions, analogous to the classic interpolation
   formula from Marko and Siggia for ideal wormlike chains. Using
   pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) simulations of asymptotically
   long, discrete wormlike chains in an external force, we show that the
   error in the EV-WLC interpolation formula to describe discrete wormlike
   chains is systematically smaller than the error in the Marko-Siggia
   interpolation formula, except for the saturation region in which both
   formulas have the same limiting behavior. We anticipate that the EV-WLC
   interpolation formula will prove useful in the coarse-graining of
   wormlike chain models for dynamic simulations. Related results for the
   excess free energy due to excluded volume provide strong support for the
   physical basis of the Pincus regime.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes research at Oklahoma State University (OSU) to
   develop innovative technologies that provide solutions to issues and
   problems affecting pecan production and processing. Some of the projects
   areas include;
   1. Pecan yield estimation technique using backscattered terrestrial
   microwave sensing.
   2. Dielectric spectroscopy for estimating quality of in-shell pecans.
   3. Wireless image sensor networks in estimating the population of pecan
   weevils.
   4. Low-cost small-scale sanitizer for in-shell pecans.
   5. Optical sensors and algorithms that adequately predict plant N status
   for nitrogen management.
   6. X-ray machine vision inspection systems for pecan defect
   identification.
   Accurate estimates of pecans in the field prior to harvest are
   critically important for production management decisions and marketing.
   Pecan producers, processors and marketers identified improved accuracy
   of crop estimates as a research priority for the industry. The pecan
   weevil (Curculio caryae) is considered a key pest. Without timely
   insecticide treatments, crop losses can exceed 75\%. Research has
   focused on the design of a wireless sensor network for real-time
   monitoring and population estimation of pecan weevils. Nitrogen (N) has
   become a major cost in producing pecans. Traditionally, N is applied
   once or twice per season. Application rates usually exceed the minimum N
   requirement for optimum production. Research has focused on reducing N
   inputs while maintaining production levels. Sorting of defective nuts is
   difficult because nutmeat defects are not fully recognizable by physical
   properties, color and appearance of whole unshelled nuts. Commercial
   sorters are available to sort nutmeat after shelling the nuts, but this
   results in unnecessary shelling of defective nuts. Development of
   automated inspection systems to identify good pecan nuts from defective
   ones before shelling would reduce processing costs. Due to space
   limitations, only the highlights of each research area will be
   presented. Interested readers desiring more comprehensive discussion of
   the projects are encouraged to access the references.}},

Abstract = {{In continuous steel casting, argon gas is usually injected at the slide
   gate or stopper rod to prevent clogging, but entrapped bubbles may cause
   defects in the final product. To better understand this, the flow of
   molten steel and the transport and capture of argon gas bubbles have
   been simulated and compared with plant measurements. First, the flow
   field was solved with an Eulerian k-e model of the steel, which was
   two-way coupled with a Lagrangian model of the large bubbles using a
   Discrete Random Walk method to include dispersion of bubbles due to
   turbulence. The asymmetrical flow pattern predicted on the top surface
   agreed well with nailboard measurements. Then, the motion and capture of
   over two million bubbles were simulated using two different capture
   criteria. Results with the advanced capture criterion agreed well with
   measurements of the number, locations, and sizes of captured bubbles,
   especially for larger bubbles. The relative capture fraction of 0.3\%
   was close to the measured 0.2\% for 1mm bubbles, and occurred very near
   the top surface. The model presented here is an efficient tool to study
   the capture of bubbles and inclusion particles in solidification
   processes.}},

Title = {{What causes tumbling of altro-alpha-CD derivatives? Insight from
   computer simulations}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{71}},
Pages = {{57309-57317}},
Abstract = {{In water, a remarkable motion can be observed with a {[}2] rotaxane,
   wherein the rotor translocates by reeling its axle in the cavity of an
   altro-alpha-CD stopper. Similarly, in aqueous solution, an alkyl
   altro-alpha-CD dimer reels its alkyl chain in the altro-alpha-CD cavity
   to form a pseudo{[}1] rotaxane dimer. This reeling motion is in fact
   induced by the tumbling of the altropyranose unit of an altro-alpha-CD,
   a process shown to be solvent-dependent. Tumbling, however, does not
   occur in low-polarity solvents such as methanol and DMSO. In the present
   contribution, the mechanism that underlies solvent-controlled tumbling
   has been studied at the atomic level by means of molecular dynamics
   simulations combined with microsecond-timescale free-energy
   calculations. The free-energy profile delineating the tumbling in water
   of the altropyranose unit of an alkyl altro-alpha-CD indicates that a
   19.8 kcal mol(-1) barrier must be overcome to yield the self-inclusion
   complex, which is the most stable state available to the supramolecular
   assembly. In DMSO, the free-energy barrier is about 21.0 kcal mol(-1)
   higher, and the self-included alkyl altro-alpha-CD corresponds to a
   metastable state. These results provide new thermodynamic and kinetic
   insights into solvent-controlled tumbling, and reveal the essence of
   different experimental observations. Further investigation shows that
   aside from the polarity of the solvent, tumbling of the altro-alpha-CD
   derivative stems from the hydrophobicity of the side chain and the
   propensity of the former to include the latter, which opens perspectives
   for the design of new, related supramolecular assemblies.}},

Abstract = {{A sensitive polyaniline (PANI)/titanium dioxide (TiO2) based toxic gas
   sensor deposited on a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) chip was
   fabricated and developed through electrostatic layer-by-layer (LbL)
   self-assembly (SA) with polyaniline and titanium dioxide sol as original
   materials. The synthesis process and the obtained nanocomposite were
   confirmed through a home-made measurement set-up, field-emission
   scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), which demonstrates that a thin PANI/TiO2
   nanocomposite sensing film was successfully achieved by LbL
   self-assembly. The sensor response was found to be greatly influenced by
   the number of deposited layers. The resulting PANI/TiO2 based gas sensor
   exhibited good sensitivity and smooth shift in terms of responses based
   on frequency data compared to responses based on resistance data. It
   exhibited high sensitivity toward 10 ppm of three different toxic gases
   (ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and trimethylamine) with an evident frequency
   shift and a fast response and recovery time. The sensor showed excellent
   reversibility and long-term stability as well as good selectivity
   towards NH3. In real-time application, the obtained PANI/TiO2 based gas
   sensor exhibited excellent performance and accurate evaluation of three
   typical foodstuffs. The PANI/TiO2 nanocomposite based gas sensor coated
   on QCM substrate via LbL self-assembly provides a promising efficient
   sensor to detect toxic gases in relatively low concentrations.}},

   production (E-FF) are based on energy statistics and cement production
   data, respectively, while emissions from land-use change (E-LUC), mainly
   deforestation, are based on combined evidence from land-cover-change
   data, fire activity associated with deforestation, and models. The
   global atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its rate
   of growth (G(ATM)) is computed from the annual changes in concentration.
   The mean ocean CO2 sink (S-OCEAN) is based on observations from the
   1990s, while the annual anomalies and trends are estimated with ocean
   models. The variability in S-OCEAN is evaluated with data products based
   on surveys of ocean CO2 measurements. The global residual terrestrial
   CO2 sink (S-LAND) is estimated by the difference of the other terms of
   the global carbon budget and compared to results of independent dynamic
   global vegetation models forced by observed climate, CO2, and
   land-cover-change (some including nitrogen-carbon interactions). We
   compare the mean land and ocean fluxes and their variability to
   estimates from three atmospheric inverse methods for three broad
   latitude bands. All uncertainties are reported as +/- 1 sigma,
   reflecting the current capacity to characterise the annual estimates of
   each component of the global carbon budget. For the last decade
   available (2004-2013), E-FF was 8.9 +/- 0.4 GtC yr(-1), E-LUC 0.9 +/-
   0.5 GtC yr(-1), G(ATM) 4.3 +/- 0.1 GtC yr(-1), S-OCEAN 2.6 +/- 0.5 GtC
   yr(-1), and S-LAND 2.9 +/- 0.8 GtC yr(-1). For year 2013 alone, E-FF
   grew to 9.9 +/- 0.5 GtC yr(-1), 2.3\% above 2012, continuing the growth
   trend in these emissions, E-LUC was 0.9 +/- 0.5 GtC yr(-1), G(ATM) was
   5.4 +/- 0.2 GtC yr(-1), S-OCEAN was 2.9 +/- 0.5 GtC yr(-1), and S-LAND
   was 2.5 +/- 0.9 GtC yr(-1). G(ATM) was high in 2013, reflecting a steady
   increase in E-FF and smaller and opposite changes between S-OCEAN and
   S-LAND compared to the past decade (2004-2013). The global atmospheric
   CO2 concentration reached 395.31 +/- 0.10 ppm averaged over 2013. We
   estimate that E-FF will increase by 2.5\% (1.3-3.5 \%) to 10.1 +/- 0.6
   GtC in 2014 (37.0 +/- 2.2 GtCO(2) yr(-1)), 65\% above emissions in 1990,
   based on projections of world gross domestic product and recent changes
   in the carbon intensity of the global economy.
   From this projection of E-FF and assumed constant E-LUC for 2014,
   cumulative emissions of CO2 will reach about 545 +/- 55 GtC (2000 +/-
   200 GtCO(2)) for 1870-2014, about 75\% from E-FF and 25\% from E-LUC.
   This paper documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this
   new carbon budget compared with previous publications of this living
   data set (Le Quere et al., 2013, 2014). All observations presented here

Pages = {{85-92}},
Abstract = {{A rapid quantification method was developed and validated for
   non-destructive measurement of starch content, theoretical ethanol yield
   and actual ethanol yield of 48 cultivars of sorghum grain using Fourier
   transform near infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy in diffuse reflectance
   mode. Multiplicative scatter correction, Savitzky-Golay derivative
   smoothing and mean centring were used for processing the spectra of
   ground sorghum grain. The processed spectra were correlated with starch
   content, theoretical ethanol yield and ethanol produced through
   simultaneous saccharification and fermentation using partial
   least-squares regression (PLSR). The spectral range and number of
   factors were optimised for the low number of factors, high coefficients
   of determination for calibration (R-2) and validation (r(2)), low root
   mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), high ratio of performance to
   deviation (RPM and high ratio of the standard error of prediction to the
   range (RER). The best PLSR model for starch content utilised the
   4000-6000cm(-1) wavebands and had the following values: R-2 = r(2) =
   0.97, RMSEP = 5.5g kg(-1) grain, RPD = 5.9 and RER = 15. Likewise, the
   model for theoretical ethanol yield utilised the 4000-8000 cm(-1)
   wavebands and had R-2 and r(2) values of >0.90, RMSEP = 4.9g kg(-1)
   grain, RPD = 4.47 and RER = 12.8. It was more difficult to predict
   actual ethanol yield using FT-NIR spectroscopy given the small data set,
   and spectra were collected prior to the fermentation step. Resulting
   PLSR models had R-2 and r(2) values of <0.60, RMSEP = 11.2-21.4g kg(-1),
   RPD < 3 and RER < 6. These results demonstrated that FT-NIR spectroscopy
   may be a practical method for rough screening of sorghum cultivars for
   desirable starch content and theoretical ethanol yield. The models may
   be improved by including more cultivars in the model and additional
   compositional information, such as tannin and free amino nitrogen
   contents, in the chemometric analysis and using FT-NIR scans of the
   fermentation products to predict actual ethanol yields.}},

Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{523-528}},
Abstract = {{Rice straw is a potential feedstock for cellulosic ethanol, since it is
   the most abundant agricultural waste in the world and contains starch.
   The structural configuration of starch makes it easy to hydrolyze, which
   consequently could increase ethanol yields. In this study, effects of
   starch in rice straw on ethanol production were investigated. A
   transgenic rice straw with high vegetative starch content and
   conventional rice straw were pretreated using dilute acid, hot water, or
   ammonium hydroxide. To evaluate starch solubility during the
   pretreatments, pretreated samples were either washed or unwashed prior
   to enzymatic hydrolysis. Starch or cellulose were solubilized and
   hydrolyzed during all three pretreatments. As a result, unwashed samples
   showed up to 60\% and 79\% higher glucose yield and ethanol yield,
   respectively, than washed samples. In addition, greater starch content
   in transgenic rice straw led to increased ethanol yields compared to
   control rice straw. Unwashed transgenic samples pretreated with dilute
   acid, hot water, or ammonium hydroxide achieved ethanol yields of
   17.5\%, 14.9\%, and 20.4\% g g(-1) biomass, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Methane (CH4) generated by cattle is both a major source of greenhouse
   gas emissions and a powerful indicator of feed conversion efficiency;
   thus, accurate quantification of CH4 production is required for
   addressing future global food security without neglecting environmental
   impacts. A newly developed Ruminant Emission Measurement System (REMS)
   supports research on the relationships between bovine nutrition,
   genetics, and management strategies by measuring eructated CH4 emissions
   from ruminal activity. REMS is a substantial improvement and extension
   of the chamber technique, which is considered the standard method to
   quantify ruminant CH4 generation. Part I of this two-part series
   describes the design and evaluation of REMS. An uncertainty analysis of
   chamber emission rate (ER) was conducted to identify critical
   measurement component contributions to overall ER uncertainty and guide
   component selection. In Part II, REMS commissioning was performed and a
   method for system validation including overall emission uncertainty is
   reported. REMS consists of six positive pressure ventilated hood-type
   chambers individually equipped with a thermal environmental control
   subsystem, fresh air supply control subsystem, and gas sampling
   subsystem. Estimates of the standard uncertainty for each measurement
   parameter were quantified and propagated through the ER equation derived
   from CH4 and air mass flow balances. A sensitivity analysis was
   conducted to assess the contribution of each parameter to the emission
   rate standard uncertainty (absolute = Delta ER; relative = \%Delta ER)
   under predicted normal operation by varying gas analyzer and ventilation
   measurement uncertainties as anticipated with REMS use. Results showed
   that expanded \%Delta ER (similar to 95\% confidence level) associated
   with the methane ER computation was approximately 5.9\% for ER values
   between 3.5 and 17.2 g h(-1). Ventilation rate and gas concentration
   measurements were the major sources of uncertainty, contributing about
   69\% and 29\%, respectively, to the uncertainty associated with methane
   ER values. This work provides the foundation for future studies using
   respiration chambers to include a stated standard uncertainty associated
   with animal emission measurements.}},

Abstract = {{A cocrystal of piroxicam (PRX) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (HBA),
   PRX-HBA, and an acetone (ACT) solvate of the cocrystal, PRX-HBA-ACT,
   were crystallized on a microfluidic platform via solvent evaporation.
   The inclusion of ACT was found serendipitously, with the ACT probably
   being introduced into the crystallization system as an impurity in HBA.
   The crystal structures of PRX-HBA and PRX-HBA-ACT obtained by X-ray
   diffraction both exhibit the P2(1)/c space group. Bulk quantities of the
   cocrystals were synthesized using a slurry method and their physical
   properties were characterized with thermogravimetric analysis and
   differential scanning calorimetry. Additionally, the phase behavior of
   PRX-HBA-ACT during desolvation was monitored with powder X-ray
   diffraction. The powder diffraction of PRX-HBA-ACT after complete
   desolvation has the same peak positions as the PRX-HBA, suggesting that
   PRX-HBA-ACT rearranges to the structure of PRX-HBA.}},

Abstract = {{Here we demonstrate three principle modalities for a smartphone-based
   spectrometer: absorption, fluorescence, and photonic crystal (PC)-based
   label-free detection. When combined with some simple optical components,
   the rear-facing CMOS camera in a mobile device can provide spectrometric
   data that rivals that of laboratory instruments, but at a fraction of
   the cost. The use of a smartphone-based platform poses significant
   advantages based upon the rise of smartphone apps, which allow for
   user-interface and data-processing algorithms to be packaged and
   distributed within environments that are externally maintained with
   potential for integration with services such as cloud storage,
   GIS-tagging, and remote expert analysis.
   We demonstrate the absorption modality of our device by performing an
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on both a cancer biomarker and
   a peanut allergen, demonstrating clinically relevant limits of detection
   (LOD). Second, we demonstrate the success of a molecular beacon
   (MB)-based assay on the smartphone platform, achieving an LOD of 1.3 pM
   for a specific RNA sequence, less than that of a commercial benchtop
   instrument. Finally, we use a PC biosensor to perform label-free
   detection of a representative biological interaction: Protein A and
   human immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the nanomolar regime.
   Our work represents the first demonstration of smartphone-based
   spectroscopy for biological assays, and the first mobile-device-enabled
   detection instrument that serves to measure three distinct sensing
   modalities (label-free biosensing, absorption spectroscopy, and
   fluorescence spectroscopy). The smartphone platform has the potential to
   expand the use of spectrometric analysis to environments assay from the
   laboratory, which may include rural or remote locations, low-resource
   settings, and consumer markets.}},

Title = {{Macro-roughness model of bedrock-alluvial river morphodynamics}},
Journal = {{EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{113-138}},
Abstract = {{The 1-D saltation-abrasion model of channel bedrock incision of Sklar
   and Dietrich (2004), in which the erosion rate is buffered by the
   surface area fraction of bedrock covered by alluvium, was a major
   advance over models that treat river erosion as a function of bed slope
   and drainage area. Their model is, however, limited because it
   calculates bed cover in terms of bedload sediment supply rather than
   local bedload transport. It implicitly assumes that as sediment supply
   from upstream changes, the transport rate adjusts instantaneously
   everywhere downstream to match. This assumption is not valid in general,
   and thus can give rise to unphysical consequences. Here we present a
   unified morphodynamic formulation of both channel incision and
   alluviation that specifically tracks the spatiotemporal variation in
   both bedload transport and alluvial thickness. It does so by relating
   the bedrock cover fraction to the ratio of alluvium thickness to bedrock
   macro-roughness, rather than to the ratio of bedload supply rate to
   capacity bedload transport. The new formulation (MRSAA) predicts waves
   of alluviation and rarification, in addition to bedrock erosion.
   Embedded in it are three physical processes: alluvial diffusion, fast
   downstream advection of alluvial disturbances, and slow upstream
   migration of incisional disturbances. Solutions of this formulation over
   a fixed bed are used to demonstrate the stripping of an initial alluvial
   cover, the emplacement of alluvial cover over an initially bare bed and
   the advection-diffusion of a sediment pulse over an alluvial bed. A
   solution for alluvial-incisional interaction in a channel with a
   basement undergoing net rock uplift shows how an impulsive increase in
   sediment supply can quickly and completely bury the bedrock under thick
   alluvium, thus blocking bedrock erosion. As the river responds to rock
   uplift or base level fall, the transition point separating an alluvial
   reach upstream from an alluvial-bedrock reach downstream migrates
   upstream in the form of a ``hidden knickpoint{''}. A tectonically more
   complex case of rock uplift subject to a localized zone of subsidence
   (graben) yields a steady-state solution that is not attainable with the
   original saltation-abrasion model. A solution for the case of
   bedrock-alluvial coevolution upstream of an alluviated river mouth
   illustrates how the bedrock surface can be progressively buried not far
   below the alluvium. Because the model tracks the spatiotemporal
   variation in both bedload transport and alluvial thickness, it is
   applicable to the study of the incisional response of a river subject to
   temporally varying sediment supply. It thus has the potential to capture
   the response of an alluvial-bedrock river to massive impulsive sediment
   inputs associated with landslides or debris flows.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrous manganite (MnOOH) nanorods were synthesized by a simple
   precipitation process in ethanol at room temperature, which eliminated
   high temperature calcination or a hydrothermal process in the creation
   of most manganese oxide-based adsorbents and resulted in low energy
   consumption and subsequently low production cost. These MnOOH nanorods
   had a high specific surface area at similar to 165.9 m(2) g(-1) and
   their total pore volume was similar to 0.561 cm(3) g(-1), which was
   beneficial to their arsenic removal performance. These MnOOH nanorods
   demonstrated a superior As(III) removal performance from an aqueous
   environment. At near neutral conditions (pH similar to 7), their arsenic
   adsorption capacity was over 431.2 mg g(-1), which was among the highest
   reported values in the literature. The superior As(III) removal
   performance of these MnOOH nanorods relied on the adsorption and
   subsequent oxidation of As(III) to less mobilized/toxic As(V), and its
   fixation on their surface to form inner-sphere arsenic surface
   complexes.}},

Title = {{Prediction of microalgae hydrothermal liquefaction products from
   feedstock biochemical composition}},
Journal = {{GREEN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3584-3599}},
Abstract = {{Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) uses water under elevated temperatures
   and pressures (200-350 degrees C, 5-20 MPa) to convert biomass into
   liquid ``biocrude{''} oil. Despite extensive reports on factors
   influencing microalgae cell composition during cultivation and separate
   reports on HTL products linked to cell composition, the field still
   lacks a quantitative model to predict HTL conversion product yield and
   qualities from feedstock biochemical composition; the tailoring of
   microalgae feedstock for downstream conversion is a unique and critical
   aspect of microalgae biofuels that must be leveraged upon for
   optimization of the whole process. This study developed predictive
   relationships for HTL biocrude yield and other conversion product
   characteristics based on HTL of Nannochloropsis oculata batches
   harvested with a wide range of compositions (23-59\% dw lipids, 58-17\%
   dw proteins, 12-22\% dw carbohydrates) and a defatted batch (0\% dw
   lipids, 75\% dw proteins, 19\% dw carbohydrates). HTL biocrude yield
   (33-68\% dw) and carbon distribution (49-83\%) increased in proportion
   to the fatty acid (FA) content. A component additivity model (predicting
   biocrude yield from lipid, protein, and carbohydrates) was more accurate
   predicting literature yields for diverse microalgae species than
   previous additivity models derived from model compounds. FA profiling of
   the biocrude product showed strong links to the initial feedstock FA
   profile of the lipid component, demonstrating that HTL acts as a
   water-based extraction process for FAs; the remainder non-FA structural
   components could be represented using the defatted batch. These findings
   were used to introduce a new FA-based model that predicts biocrude oil
   yields along with other critical parameters, and is capable of adjusting
   for the wide variations in HTL methodology and microalgae species
   through the defatted batch. The FA model was linked to an upstream
   cultivation model (Phototrophic Process Model), providing for the first
   time an integrated modeling framework to overcome a critical barrier to
   microalgae-derived HTL biofuels and enable predictive analysis of the
   overall microalgal-to-biofuel process.}},

Title = {{Puncture mechanics of soft solids}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{4723-4730}},
Abstract = {{Gels and other soft elastic networks are a ubiquitous and important
   class of materials whose unique properties enable special behavior, but
   generally elude characterization due to the inherent difficulty in
   manipulating them. An example of such behavior is the stability of gels
   to large local deformations on their surface. This paper analyzes
   puncture of model soft materials with particular focus on the force
   response to deep indentation and the critical load for material failure.
   Large-strain behavior during deep indentation is described with a
   neo-hookean contact model. A fracture process zone model is applied to
   the critical load for puncture. It is found that the indenter geometry
   influences the size of the fracture process zone, resulting in two
   distinct failure regimes: stress-limited and energy-limited. The methods
   outlined in this paper provide a simple means for measuring Young's
   modulus, E, as well as the material's maximum cohesive stress, sigma(0),
   fracture energy, Gamma(0), and the intrinsic length scale linking the
   two, l(0), all without requiring specialized sample preparation.}},

   Modeling for Consideration of Wheel Interaction}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2471}},
Pages = {{40-47}},
Abstract = {{The effect of wheel configuration on critical airfield pavement
   responses during takeoff was calculated, and variables, usually omitted
   in conventional pavement analysis, were considered. The numerical
   analysis matrix consisted of two takeoff speeds, two inflation
   pressures, two pavement structures, and four wheel configurations. One
   of the pavement structures was built at the National Airport Pavement
   Test Facility and had been previously described in the literature. The
   method used in this study advanced current knowledge in two respects.
   First, the study examined not only the tensile strains at the bottom of
   the asphalt concrete (AC) layer (fatigue cracking) and vertical strain
   on top of the subgrade (rutting) but also the transverse surface strain
   (surface cracking) and vertical shear strains (near-surface cracking and
   rutting). Second, several assumptions about existing methods were
   advanced. These assumptions included (a) nonuniform three-dimensional
   contact stresses instead of uniform one-dimensional vertical stresses
   over a circular contact area, (b) viscoelastic and nonlinear material
   characterization for AC and granular material under high stress levels
   in lieu of a linear elastic model, and (c) load variation with time to
   reflect takeoff. Transverse surface strain and vertical shear strain in
   the subgrade were most affected by wheel configuration. In addition, the
   variables had varying influence on pavement responses and wheel
   interaction. For instance, takeoff speed affected vertical strain on top
   of the subgrade but did not affect transverse surface strain. Tire
   inflation pressure modified wheel interaction for shear strain in the AC
   but not in the subgrade.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic techniques provide an effective non-destructive evaluation
   (NDE) method to monitor concrete structures, but the need to perform
   rapid and accurate structural assessment requires evaluation of
   hundreds, or even thousands, of measurement datasets. Use of a fully
   contactless ultrasonic system can save time and labor through rapid
   implementation, and can enable automated and controlled data
   acquisition, for example through robotic scanning. Here we present
   results using a fully contactless ultrasonic system. This paper
   describes our efforts to develop a contactless ultrasonic guided wave
   NDE approach to detect and characterize delamination defects in concrete
   structures. The developed contactless sensors, controlled scanning
   system, and employed Multi-channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW)
   signal processing scheme are reviewed. Then a guided wave interpretation
   approach for MASW data is described. The presence of delamination is
   interpreted by guided plate wave (Lamb wave) behavior, where a shift in
   excited Lamb mode phase velocity, is monitored. Numerically simulated
   and experimental ultrasonic data collected from a concrete sample with
   simulated delamination defects are presented, where the occurrence of
   delamination is shown to be associated with a mode shift in Lamb wave
   energy.}},

Abstract = {{Free tropospheric aerosol was sampled at the Pico Mountain Observatory
   located at 2225 m above mean sea level on Pico Island of the Azores
   archipelago in the North Atlantic. The observatory is located similar to
   3900 km east and downwind of North America, which enables studies of
   free tropospheric air transported over long distances. Aerosol samples
   collected on filters from June to October 2012 were analyzed to
   characterize organic carbon, elemental carbon, and inorganic ions. The
   average ambient concentration of aerosol was 0.9 +/- 0.7 mu gm(-3). On
   average, organic aerosol components represent the largest mass fraction
   of the total measured aerosol (60 +/- 51 \%), followed by sulfate (23
   +/- 28 \%), nitrate (13 +/- 10 \%), chloride (2 +/- 3 \%), and elemental
   carbon (2 +/- 2 \%). Water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) extracted from
   two aerosol samples (9/24 and 9/25) collected consecutively during a
   pollution event were analyzed using ultrahigh-resolution electrospray
   ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry.
   Approximately 4000 molecular formulas were assigned to each of the mass
   spectra in the range of m/z 100-1000. The majority of the assigned
   molecular formulas had unsaturated structures with CHO and CHNO
   elemental compositions. FLEXPART retroplume analyses showed the sampled
   air masses were very aged (average plume age > 12 days). These aged
   aerosol WSOM compounds had an average O/C ratio of similar to 0.45,
   which is relatively low compared to O/C ratios of other aged aerosol.
   The increase in aerosol loading during the measurement period of 9/24
   was linked to biomass burning emissions from North America by FLEXPART
   retroplume analysis and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS) fire counts. This was confirmed with biomass burning markers
   detected in the WSOM and with the morphology and mixing state of
   particles as determined by scanning electron microscopy. The presence of
   markers characteristic of aqueous-phase reactions of phenolic species
   suggests that the aerosol collected at the Pico Mountain Observatory had
   undergone cloud processing before reaching the site. Finally, the air
   masses of 9/25 were more aged and influenced by marine emissions, as
   indicated by the presence of organosulfates and other species
   characteristic of marine aerosol. The change in the air masses for the
   two samples was corroborated by the changes in ethane, propane, and
   ozone, morphology of particles, as well as by the FLEXPART retroplume
   simulations. This paper presents the first detailed molecular
   characterization of free tropospheric aged aerosol intercepted at a
   lower free troposphere remote location and provides evidence of low
   oxygenation after long-range transport. We hypothesize this is a result
   of the selective removal of highly aged and polar species during
   long-range transport, because the aerosol underwent a combination of
   atmospheric processes during transport facilitating aqueous-phase
   removal (e.g., clouds processing) and fragmentation (e.g., photolysis)
   of components.}},

Journal = {{BLOOD PURIFICATION}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Hemodialysis (HD) patients are less active than their healthy
   counterparts; this is associated with higher mortality. Healthcare
   workers observe their patients only during HD, which accounts for about
   7\% of the week. Knowing more about what occurs in between sessions,
   particularly with respect to physical activity, may improve patient care
   and prognosis. Yet without a standard method to measure interdialytic
   activity, it is difficult to compare the effect of interventions.
   However, it is unclear how interdialytic activity can be accurately
   measured. Since activity associated with quality of life is
   multi-dimensional, objective and subjective tools should be used in
   conjunction. While commercially available tracking devices can be
   seamlessly incorporated into everyday life and can increase awareness of
   user's activity, their validation is needed in the HD population.
   Fertile topics for research should include the relationship between
   objective and subjective measures in HD patients, and the investigation
   of physical activity in non-ambulatory HD patients. (C) 2015 S. Karger

Journal = {{ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{N60-N63}},
Abstract = {{We report a simple process for the selective deposition of copper films
   on RuO2, while no Cu nucleation occurs on thermal SiO2 or porous carbon
   doped oxide (CDO). Using the precursor Cu(hfac) VTMS, selectivity is
   attained by adding a co-flow of excess VTMS to act as a growth
   inhibitor. With precursor alone, 52 nm of Cu grows on RuO2; on CDO or on
   thermal SiO2, nucleation is delayed such that 41 or 1.3 nm are
   deposited, respectively. Repeating the experiment with the co-flow of
   VTMS affords a 12 nm thick Cu film on RuO2 with roughness of 1.8 nm. But
   on CDO or thermal SiO2, the Cu deposition is only 0.10 or similar to
   0.04 nm, respectively. AFM scans of the CDO and SiO2 surfaces are
   identical to the bare substrates. The small quantity of Cu that is
   deposited must be finely distributed, presumably on defect sites; it can
   be etched to below the RBS detection limit using a co-flow of Hhfac and
   VTMS for few minutes at the end of the growth. The process window is
   wide: selective growth occurs for a range of VTMS pressures (0.5-2.0
   mTorr), growth times (up to 90 min), and growth temperatures (up to 180
   degrees C). (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The freezing tendency towards 4-coordinated amorphous networks causes an
   increase in the heat capacity of supercooled Stillinger-Weber silicon}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{55}},
Pages = {{44679-44686}},
Abstract = {{Supercooled liquid silicon (Si), modeled by the Stillinger-Weber (SW)
   potential, has been shown to undergo transition to low density amorphous
   phases at 1060 K in previous studies. Furthermore, the constant pressure
   heat capacity C-p has been found to exhibit a large increase as the
   liquid is cooled to 1060 K. In this work, we examine the nature of the
   equilibrium and the relaxation process of supercooled SW Si in the
   temperature range of 1060 K to 1070 K at zero pressure. We find that the
   relaxation of the supercooled liquid leads to a sharp irreversible
   decrease in the fluctuation of the two body energy of the largest
   connected network of 4-coordinated particles. Such a process implies a
   tightening of the bonds (i.e. freezing or jamming) of the network, and
   is accompanied by a sharp increase in the fraction of the 4-coordinated
   particles in the system. We find that the jamming (or freezing) process
   shows a sudden acceleration across a dynamical instability point that
   occurs at a unique potential energy state of the network. Further, we
   find that the occurrence of the dynamical instability is associated with
   the appearance of a straight line region in the cumulative potential
   energy distributions with a configurational temperature close to 1060 K.
   We conclude that the supercooled liquid state must be regarded as a
   constrained equilibrium state, since the accessible microstates are
   constrained by the inherent tendency of the system to approach the
   dynamical instability point. Thus all properties of supercooled liquid
   SW-Si, including the rise in C-p at 1060 K, can be attributed to the
   freezing tendency of the 4-coordinated particle network.}},

Title = {{Parameter sensitivity of system reliability using sequential compounding
   method}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{26-36}},
Abstract = {{Computation of sensitivities of the `system' failure probability with
   respect to various parameters is essential in reliability based design
   optimization (RBDO) and uncertainty/risk management of a complex
   engineering system. The system failure event is defined as a logical
   function of multiple component events representing failure modes,
   locations or time points. Recently, the sequential compounding method
   (SCM) was developed for efficient calculations of the probabilities of
   large-size, general system events for a wide range of correlation
   properties. To facilitate the use of SCM in RBDO and uncertainty/risk
   management under a constraint on the system failure probability, a
   method, termed as Chun-Song-Paulino (CSP) method, is developed in this
   paper to compute parameter sensitivities of system failure probability
   using SCM. For a parallel or series system, the derivative of the system
   failure probability with respect to the reliability index is
   analytically derived at the last step of the sequential compounding. For
   a general system, the sensitivity of the probability of the set
   involving the component of interest and the sensitivity of the system
   failure probability with respect to the super-component representing the
   set are computed respectively using the CSP method and combined by the
   chain-rule. The CSP method is illustrated by numerical examples, and
   successfully tested by examples covering a wide range of system event
   types, reliability indices, number of components, and correlation
   properties. The method is also applied to compute the sensitivity of the
   first-passage probability of a building structure under stochastic
   excitations, modeled by use of finite elements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{On-chip metal/polypyrrole quasi-reference electrodes for robust ISFET
   operation}},
Journal = {{ANALYST}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{140}},

Pages = {{3630-3641}},
Abstract = {{To operate an ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFETs) it is
   necessary to set the electrolyte potential using a reference electrode.
   Conventional reference electrodes are bulky, fragile, and too big for
   applications where the electrolyte volume is small. Several researchers
   have proposed tackling this issue using a solid-state planar
   micro-reference electrode or a reference field-effect transistor.
   However, these approaches are limited by poor robustness, high cost, or
   complex integration with other microfabrication processes. Here we
   report a simple method to create robust on-chip quasi-reference
   electrodes by electrodepositing polypyrrole on micro-patterned metal
   leads. The electrodes were fabricated through the polymerization of
   pyrrole on patterned metals with a cyclic voltammetry process. Open
   circuit potential measurements were performed to characterize the
   polypyrrole electrode performance, demonstrating good stability (similar
   to 1 mV), low drift (similar to 1 mV h(-1)), and reduced pH response (5
   mV per pH). In addition, the polypyrrole deposition was repeated in
   microelectrodes made of different metals to test compatibility with
   standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes. Our
   results suggest that nickel, a metal commonly used in semiconductor
   foundries for silicide formation, is a good candidate to form the
   polypyrrole quasi-reference electrodes. Finally, the polypyrrole
   microelectrodes were used to operate foundry fabricated ISFETs. These
   experiments demonstrated that transistors biased with polypyrrole
   electrodes have pH sensitivity and resolution comparable to ones that
   are biased with standard reference electrodes. Therefore, the simple
   fabrication, high compatibility, and robust electrical performance make
   polypyrrole an ideal choice for the fabrication of outstanding
   microreference electrodes that enable robust and sensitive operation of
   multiple ISFET sensors on a chip.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to approximate discrete joint probability
   distributions using first-order dependence trees and the recent concept
   of cumulative residual entropy. A first-order dependence tree is one
   where each variable is conditioned on at most one variable. The
   cumulative residual entropy measure is the entropy functional applied to
   the survival function instead of the probability measure. We formulate
   the cumulative residual Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence and the
   cumulative residual mutual information measures in terms of the survival
   function. We then show that the optimal first-order dependence tree
   approximation of the joint distribution using the cumulative
   Kullback-Leibler divergence is the one with the largest sum of
   cumulative residual mutual information pairs. The results parallel
   Chow-Liu's approximation of joint probability distributions using the
   traditional Kullback-Leibler divergence and mutual information but
   applied to survival functions. We compare the approximation results with
   those of Chow-Liu using the traditional entropy measure. Using a Monte
   Carlo simulation, we show that the two approximations perform almost
   equally but they are not same.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography sources produce EUV photons by
   means of a hot, dense, highly-ionized Sn plasma. This plasma expels
   high-energy Sn ions and neutrals, which deposit on the collector optic
   used to focus the EUV light. This Sn deposition lowers the reflectivity
   of the collector optic, necessitating downtime for collector cleaning
   and replacement. A method is being developed to clean the collector with
   an in-situ hydrogen plasma, which provides hydrogen radicals that etch
   the Sn by forming gaseous SnH4. This method has the potential to
   significantly reduce collector-related source downtime. EUV reflectivity
   restoration and Sn cleaning have been demonstrated on multilayer mirror
   samples attached to a Sn-coated 300mm-diameter steel dummy collector
   driven at 300W RF power with 500sccm H-2 and a pressure of 260mTorr. Use
   of the in-situ cleaning method is also being studied at
   industrially-applicable high pressure (1.3 Torr). Plasma creation across
   the dummy collector surface has been demonstrated at 1.3 Torr with
   1000sccm H-2 flow, and etch rates have been measured. Additionally,
   etching has been demonstrated at higher flow rates up to 3200sccm. A
   catalytic probe has been used to measure radical density at various
   pressures and flows. The results lend further credence to the hypothesis
   that Sn removal is limited not by radical creation but by the removal of
   SnH4 from the plasma. Additionally, further progress has been made in an
   attempt to model the physical processes behind Sn removal.}},

Abstract = {{The LLLT was found to recover NIHL and ototoxicity induced hearing loss
   in rats but the optimal LLLT laser dosage to treat NIHL needs to be
   determined. The aim of this study was to find the optimal laser dosage
   to recover a NIHL with transmeatal-LLLT. Methods: Bilateral ears of rats
   were exposed to noise (narrow band noise, 120 dB, 16 kHz, 6 h). Left
   ears of the rats were irradiated with transmeatal-LLLT (830 nm) of 50,
   100, 150, 200, 250, 300 mW for 60 minutes per day for 12 days, starting
   1 day post induction of NIHL. Right ears were not irradiated and used as
   control ears. The hearing levels were measured at each frequency of 8,
   12, and 32 kHz before the noise exposure, 1, 3, 8, and 12 days post
   noise exposure. The differences of hearing levels between left treated
   ear and right controlled ear at each frequency of different laser
   dosages (50 - 300 mW) were compared to see the most effective laser
   dosages to treat NIHL. Results: Hearing levels were most improved by 150
   mW, slightly improved by 200 mW, not improved by 50 and 250 mW, and
   became worse by 300 mW. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest
   that most effective therapeutic laser dosage window to treat NIHL with
   transmeatal-LLLT was 150 mW for 12 days and it was not effective by 50,
   250, and 300 mW.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of 1-hexyl-3-methyl-imidazolium ethylsulfate ({[}HMIM] EtSO4)
   using an extended surface forces apparatus show, for the first time, an
   ordered structure within the nanoconfined ionic liquid (IL) between mica
   surfaces that extends up to similar to 60 nm from the surface. Our
   measurements show the growth of this ordered IL-film upon successive
   nanoconfinements-the structural changes being irreversible upon removal
   of the confinement-and the response of the structure to shear. The
   compressibility of this system is lower than that typically measured for
   ILs, while creep takes place during shear, both findings supporting a
   long-range liquid-to-solid transition. AFM (sharp-tip) studies of
   {[}HMIM] EtSO4 on mica only reveal similar to 2 surface IL-layers, with
   order extending only similar to 3 nm from the surface, indicating that
   confinement is required for the long-range IL-solidification to occur.
   WAXS studies of the bulk IL show a more pronounced ordered structure
   than is the case for {[}HMIM] with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide as
   anion, but no long-range order is detected, consistent with the results
   obtained with the sharp AFM tip. These are the first force measurements
   of nanoconfinement-induced long-range solidification of an IL.}},

Abstract = {{The multi-shot approach in SLIM requires reliable, synchronous, and
   parallel operation of three independent hardware devices - not meeting
   these challenges results in degraded phase and slow acquisition speeds,
   narrowing applications to holistic statements about complex phenomena.
   The relative youth of quantitative imaging and the lack of ready-made
   commercial hardware and tools further compounds the problem as Higher
   level programming languages result in inflexible, experiment specific
   instruments limited by ill-fitting computational modules, resulting in a
   palpable chasm between promised and realized hardware performance.
   Furthermore, general unfamiliarity with intricacies such as background
   calibration, objective lens attenuation, along with spatial light
   modular alignment, makes successful measurements difficult for the
   inattentive or uninitiated. This poses an immediate challenge for moving
   our techniques beyond the lab to biologically oriented collaborators and
   clinical practitioners.
   To meet these challenges, we present our new Quantitative Phase Imaging
   pipeline, with improved instrument performance, friendly user interface
   and robust data processing features, enabling us to acquire and catalog
   clinical datasets hundreds of gigapixels in size.}},

Abstract = {{White-light diffraction tomography (WDT) is a recently developed 3D
   imaging technique based on a quantitative phase imaging system called
   spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM). The technique has achieved
   a sub-micron resolution in all three directions with high sensitivity
   granted by the low-coherence of a white-light source. Demonstrations of
   the technique on single cell imaging have been presented previously;
   however, imaging on any larger sample, including a cluster of cells, has
   not been demonstrated using the technique.
   Neurons in an animal body form a highly complex and spatially organized
   3D structure, which can be characterized by neuronal networks or
   circuits. Currently, the most common method of studying the 3D structure
   of neuron networks is by using a confocal fluorescence microscope, which
   requires fluorescence tagging with either transient membrane dyes or
   after fixation of the cells. Therefore, studies on neurons are often
   limited to samples that are chemically treated and/or dead.
   WDT presents a solution for imaging live neuron networks with a high
   spatial and temporal resolution, because it is a 3D imaging method that
   is label-free and non-invasive. Using this method, a mouse or rat
   hippocampal neuron culture and a mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron
   culture have been imaged in order to see the extension of processes
   between the cells in 3D. Furthermore, the tomogram is compared with a
   confocal fluorescence image in order to investigate the 3D structure at
   synapses.}},

Abstract = {{Even with the recent rapid advances in the field of microscopy,
   non-laser light sources used for light microscopy have not been
   developing significantly. Most current optical microscopy systems use
   halogen bulbs as their light sources to provide a white-light
   illumination. Due to the confined shapes and finite filament size of the
   bulbs, little room is available for modification in the light source,
   which prevents further advances in microscopy.
   By contrast, commercial projectors provide a high power output that is
   comparable to the halogen lamps while allowing for great flexibility in
   patterning the illumination. In addition to their high brightness, the
   illumination can be patterned to have arbitrary spatial and spectral
   distributions. Therefore, commercial projectors can be adopted as a
   flexible light source to an optical microscope by careful alignment to
   the existing optical path.
   In this study, we employed a commercial projector source to a
   quantitative phase imaging system called spatial light interference
   microscopy (SLIM), which is an outside module for an existing phase
   contrast (PC) microscope. By replacing the ring illumination of PC with
   a ring-shaped pattern projected onto the condenser plane, we were able
   to recover the same result as the original SLIM. Furthermore, the ring
   illumination is replaced with multiple dots aligned along the same ring
   to minimize the overlap between the scattered and unscattered fields.
   This new method minimizes the halo artifact of the imaging system, which
   allows for a halo-free high-resolution quantitative phase microscopy
   system.}},

Abstract = {{While automated blood cell counters have made great progress in
   detecting abnormalities in blood, the lack of specificity for a
   particular disease, limited information on single cell morphology and
   intrinsic uncertainly due to high throughput in these instruments often
   necessitates detailed inspection in the form of a peripheral blood
   smear. Such tests are relatively time consuming and frequently rely on
   medical professionals tally counting specific cell types. These assays
   rely on the contrast generated by chemical stains, with the signal
   intensity strongly related to staining and preparation techniques,
   frustrating machine learning algorithms that require consistent
   quantities to denote the features in question. Instead we opt to use
   quantitative phase imaging, understanding that the resulting image is
   entirely due to the structure (intrinsic contrast) rather than the
   complex interplay of stain and sample. We present here our first steps
   to automate peripheral blood smear scanning, in particular a method to
   generate the quantitative phase image of an entire blood smear at high
   throughput using white light diffraction phase microscopy (wDPM), a
   single shot and common path interferometric imaging technique.}},

Abstract = {{The standard practice in the histopathology of breast cancers is to
   examine a hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained tissue biopsy under a
   microscope. The pathologist looks at certain morphological features,
   visible under the stain, to diagnose whether a tumor is benign or
   malignant. This determination is made based on qualitative inspection
   making it subject to investigator bias. Furthermore, since this method
   requires a microscopic examination by the pathologist it suffers from
   low throughput. A quantitative, label-free and high throughput method
   for detection of these morphological features from images of tissue
   biopsies is, hence, highly desirable as it would assist the pathologist
   in making a quicker and more accurate diagnosis of cancers. We present
   here preliminary results showing the potential of using quantitative
   phase imaging for breast cancer screening and help with differential
   diagnosis. We generated optical path length maps of unstained breast
   tissue biopsies using Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM). As a
   first step towards diagnosis based on quantitative phase imaging, we
   carried out a qualitative evaluation of the imaging resolution and
   contrast of our label-free phase images. These images were shown to two
   pathologists who marked the tumors present in tissue as either benign or
   malignant. This diagnosis was then compared against the diagnosis of the
   two pathologists on H\&E stained tissue images and the number of
   agreements were counted. In our experiment, the agreement between SLIM
   and H\&E based diagnosis was measured to be 88\%. Our preliminary
   results demonstrate the potential and promise of SLIM for a push in the
   future towards quantitative, label-free and high throughput diagnosis.}},

   aggressiveness of the treatment plan adopted by the patient is strongly

   disagreement rate between pathologists on Gleason grades 3 and 4 is high
   and this affects treatment options. We used quantitative phase imaging
   to develop an objective method for Gleason grading. Using the glandular
   solidity, which is the ratio of the area of the gland to a convex hull
   fit around it, and anisotropy of light scattered from the stroma
   immediately adjoining the gland, we were able to quantitatively separate
   Gleason grades 3 and 4 with 81\% accuracy in 43 cases marked as

Title = {{Effects of dissolution alkalinity and self-assembly on ZSM-5-based
   micro-/mesoporous composites: a study of the relationship between
   porosity, acidity, and catalytic performance}},
Journal = {{CRYSTENGCOMM}},

Pages = {{3820-3828}},
Abstract = {{ZSM-5-based micro-/mesoporous composites have attracted extensive
   attention as a promising material that could be industrialized in the
   near future. The hierarchical structure and catalytic performance of the
   ZSM-5-based hierarchical composite are highly dependent on its treatment
   conditions. Of these synthesis parameters, dissolution alkalinity is the
   most important one. However, systematic studies on the effects of
   dissolution alkalinity, specifically those that discuss the relationship
   between porosity, acidity, and catalytic performance in ZSM-5-based
   hierarchical composites by the combined dissolution and self-assembly
   method, have not yet been reported. In this article, the porosity and
   acidity of ZSM-5-based micro-/mesoporous composite samples made by
   select dissolution alkalinities are systematically investigated. Various
   characterization techniques illustrate that three different groups of
   ZSM-5-based micro-/mesoporous composites are classified based on their
   distinctive indexed hierarchical factor values, I through III. Group I,
   treated with 0 to 0.5 mol L-1 NaOH, is mesoporous ZSM-5 attached by
   Al-MCM-41-like ordered mesostructures and has a high yield for liquid
   petroleum gas. Group II, treated with 0.5 mol L-1 to 1.0 mol L-1 NaOH,
   is a mixture of ZSM-5 zeolite phase and Al-MCM-41-like ordered
   mesostructure phase and has a high yield of light oil. Group III,
   treated with 1.0 mol L-1 NaOH, is formed by complete collapse of ZSM-5
   crystals and formation of Al-MCM-41-like ordered mesostructures and
   exhibits a high yield of total liquid oil. Due to increasingly enhanced
   accessibility of acid sites ( indexed as accessibility index), all three
   groups of ZSM-5-based micro-/mesoporous composites show comparable
   conversion for vacuum gas oil cracking compared with their parent
   counterpart. These results are of vital importance during the selection
   of the synthesis conditions and scale-up tests of ZSM-5-based
   micro-/mesoporous composites to selectively produce liquid petroleum
   gas, light oil, and total liquid oil.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer diagnosis relies on staining serial sections of a biopsy
   in a process that can be time intensive and costly. Fourier transform
   infrared imaging (FT-IR) is a non-destructive, label-free chemical
   imaging technique that uses the vibrational structure of the biological
   molecules of the sample to provide contrast for images at any absorption
   peak in the mid-infrared. The full potential of spectroscopic imaging
   has been limited by the spatial resolution provided by most commercial
   instruments. By increasing the magnification and numerical aperture of
   the microscope, image pixel sizes on the order of 1.1 micron can be
   achieved, allowing HD FT-IR spectroscopic imaging to provide high
   quality images that could aid in histopathology, diagnosis, and studies
   of breast cancer progression.}},

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal plasmonic nanomaterials, consisting of metals such as gold and
   silver, are excellent candidates for advanced optical probes and
   devices, but precise control over surface chemistry is essential for
   realizing their full potential. Coupling thiolated (R-SH) molecules to
   nanoprobe surfaces is a convenient and established route to tailor
   surface properties. The ability to dynamically probe and monitor the
   surface chemistry of nanoparticles in solution is essential for rapidly
   manufacturing spectroscopically tunable nanoparticles. In this study, we
   report the development of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as
   a method to monitor the kinetics of gold-thiolate bond formation on
   colloidal gold nanoparticles. A theoretical model combining SERS
   enhancement with the Beer-Lambert law is proposed to explain ensemble
   scattering and absorption effects in colloids during chemisorption. In
   order to maximize biological relevance and signal reproducibility,
   experiments used to validate the model focused on maintaining
   nanoparticle stability after the addition of water-soluble aromatic
   thiolated molecules. Our results indicate that ligand exchange on gold
   nanoparticles follow a first-order Langmuir adsorption model with rate
   constants on the order of 0.01 min(-1). This study demonstrates an
   experimental spectroscopic method and theoretical model for monitoring
   binding kinetics that may prove useful for designing novel probes.}},

   functionalized nanoparticle inclusion}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{8864-8872}},
Abstract = {{Nanoscale interfaces can modify the phase transition behaviors of
   polymeric materials. Here, we report the double glass transition
   temperature (Tg) behavior of sulfonated polystyrene (sPS) by the
   inclusion of 14 nm amine-functionalized silica (NH2-SiO2) nanoparticles,
   which is different from the single Tg behaviors of neat sPS and silica
   (SiO2)-filled sPS. The inclusion of 20 wt\% NH2-SiO2 nanoparticles
   results in an increase of Tg by 9.3 degrees C as well as revealing a
   second Tg reduced by 44.7 degrees C compared to the Tg of neat sPS. By
   contrast, when SiO2 nanoparticles with an identical concentration and
   size to NH2-SiO2 are dispersed, sPS composites possess a single Tg of
   7.3 degrees C higher than that of the neat sPS. While a nanoscale
   dispersion is observed for SiO2 nanoparticles, as confirmed by
   microscopic and X-ray scattering analyses, NH2-SiO2 nanoparticles show
   the coexistence of micron-scale clustering along with a nanoscale
   dispersion of the individual nanoparticles. The micro-phase separation
   contributes to the free volume induced Tg reduction by the
   plasticization effect, whereas the Tg increase originates from the
   polymer segment mobility constrained by nanoconfinement and the rigid
   amorphous fractions deriving from strong polymer-particle interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals that absorb and emit light
   at wavelengths tunable by the size of the crystal. Size-tuning provides
   access to a broad range of optical spectra, however it is fundamentally
   problematic for many applications because it leads to a large mismatch
   in absorption cross-section and fluorescence brightness across a series
   of colors. We have recently demonstrated engineering strategies to
   generate multicolor, extinction-matched, and brightness-matched quantum
   dots based on colloidal multi-domain core/shell structures. We use
   alloyed cores with composition-tunable bandgaps and finely adjust the
   domain size and electronic properties of the shell to precisely match
   both absorption cross-section and quantum yield. Using this strategy, it
   is possible to tune fluorescence wavelength, extinction, and quantum
   yield independently, vastly expanding the photophysical landscape of
   these materials. Moreover compared with conventional size-tuning
   strategies, this enables access to a wider spectral range with compact
   dimensions. The equalized optical properties translate from the ensemble
   level down to the single-molecule level, setting the stage for new
   possibilities in highly quantitative, multiplexed imaging in cells and
   tissue. However selection of appropriate structural parameters to
   generate specific optical properties is challenging without insight into
   the photophysics of these materials. Here we describe the evolution of
   the optical properties of alloyed cores during the shell growth process
   that provide new insights into general engineering strategies.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{832-846}},
Abstract = {{Field and laboratory experiments were performed to unravel the structure
   of the power output fluctuations of horizontal-axis wind turbines based
   on incoming flow turbulence. The study considers the power data of three
   wind turbines of rotor sizes 0.12, 3.2, and 96 m, with rated power
   spanning six decades from the order of 10(0) to 10(6) W. The 0.12 m wind
   turbine was tested in a wind tunnel while the 3.2 and 96 m wind turbines
   were operated in open fields under approximately neutrally stratified
   thermal conditions. Incoming flow turbulence was characterised by
   hotwire and sonic anemometers for the wind tunnel and field set-ups.
   While previous works have observed a filtering behaviour in wind turbine
   power output, this exact behaviour has not, to date, been properly
   characterised. Based on the spectral structure of the incoming flow
   turbulence at hub height, and the mechanical and structural properties
   of the turbines, a physical basis for the behaviour of temporal power
   fluctuations and their spectral structure is found with potential
   applications in turbine control and numerical simulations. Consistent
   results are observed across the geometrical scales of the wind turbines
   investigated, suggesting no Reynolds number dependence in the tested

Abstract = {{Cardiac tissue engineering aims to recreate functional tissue constructs

Abstract = {{The influence of transistor size reduction (scaling) on the speed of
   realistic multi-stage integrated circuits (ICs) represents the main
   performance metric of a given transistor technology. Despite extensive
   interest in graphene electronics, scaling efforts have so far focused on
   individual transistors rather than multi-stage ICs. Here we study the
   scaling of graphene ICs based on transistors from 3.3 to 0.5 mu m gate
   lengths and with different channel widths, access lengths, and lead
   thicknesses. The shortest gate delay of 31 ps per stage was obtained in
   sub-micron graphene ROs oscillating at 4.3 GHz, which is the highest
   oscillation frequency obtained in any strictly low-dimensional material
   to date. We also derived the fundamental Johnson limit, showing that
   scaled graphene ICs could be used at high frequencies in applications
   with small voltage swing.}},

Title = {{Tip-based nanofabrication of arbitrary shapes of graphene nanoribbons
   for device applications}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{46}},
Pages = {{37006-37012}},
Abstract = {{Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have promising applications in future
   nanoelectronics, chemical sensing and electrical interconnects. Although
   there are quite a few GNR nanofabrication methods reported, a rapid and
   low-cost fabrication method that is capable of fabricating arbitrary
   shapes of GNRs with good-quality is still in demand for using GNRs for
   device applications. In this paper, we present a tip-based
   nanofabrication method capable of fabricating arbitrary shapes of GNRs.
   A heated atomic force microscope (AFM) tip deposits polymer nanowires
   atop a CVD-grown graphene surface. The polymer nanowires serve as an
   etch mask to define GNRs through one step of oxygen plasma etching
   similar to a photoresist in conventional photolithography. Various
   shapes of GNRs with either linear or curvilinear features are
   demonstrated. The width of the GNR is around 270 nm and is determined by
   the width of the deposited polymer nanowire, which we estimate can be
   scaled down to 15 nm. We characterize our TBN-fabricated GNRs using
   Raman spectroscopy and I-V measurements. The measured sheet resistances
   of our GNRs fall within the range of 1.65-2.64 k Omega, square(-1), in
   agreement with previously reported values. Furthermore, we determined
   the high-field breakdown current density of GNRs to be approximately
   2.94 x 10(8) A cm(-2). This TBN process is seamlessly compatible with
   existing nanofabrication processes, and is particularly suitable for
   fabricating GNR based electronic devices including next generation DNA
   sequencing technologies and beyond silicon field effect transistors.}},

Title = {{A HETEROGENEOUS MULTICLASS TRAFFIC FLOW MODEL WITH CREEPING}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{813-835}},
Abstract = {{A heterogeneous traffic model with two vehicle classes is developed to
   capture overtaking and creeping in highly heterogeneous traffic flows.
   Creeping is a special case of overtaking that occurs when small vehicles
   continue to advance in congestion even though larger vehicles have
   completely stopped. To motivate the new model, it is shown that a two
   class homogeneous multiclass model is equivalent to a class of second
   order models originally proposed by Aw, Rascle, and Zhang (ARZ). Based
   on the properties of the ARZ model, homogeneous models do not allow
   overtaking or creeping. The new creeping model is a phase transition
   model which applies a system of conservation laws in the noncreeping
   phase and a system equivalent to a scalar model in the creeping phase.
   The solution to the Riemann problem is obtained by investigating the
   elementary waves, particularly for the cases when one vehicle class is
   absent, as well as in the presence of a phase transition. Based on the
   proposed Riemann solver, the solution to the Cauchy problem is
   constructed using wavefront tracking. Numerical tests are carried out
   using a Godunov scheme to illustrate the creeping phenomenon. Source
   code for the numerical simulations is available at
   https://github.com/shimaof/heterogeneous-traffic-model.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to provide a variational interpretation of the

   derived via analysis of the first-order optimality conditions for these

   regarded as a gradient flow, or a steepest descent, for a certain energy
   functional with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The second
   part of the paper is concerned with derivation of the feedback particle
   filter algorithm, based again on the analysis of the first variation.
   The algorithm is shown to be exact. That is, the posterior distribution
   of the particle matches exactly the true posterior, provided the filter
   is initialized with the true prior.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{A1067-A1088}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a family of H(div)-compatible finite element
   spaces on strictly convex n-gons, whose construction makes use of
   generalized barycentric coordinates. In particular, for integers 0 <= k
   <= 2, we define finite element spaces with edge degrees of freedom that
   include polynomial vector fields of order k and whose vector fields have
   piecewise kth-order polynomial normal traces along the element boundary.
   These spaces suffer from the shortcoming that the image of the
   divergence operator includes nonpolynomial functions and, as such, their
   direct use in a mixed setting along with polynomial scalar fields may
   lead to unstable discretizations exhibiting degraded or no convergence.
   We present a general remedy for restoration of optimal convergence that
   involves ``polynomial corrections{''} of vector fields and their
   divergence at the element level. These corrections are consistent with
   one another and require computation of suitable polynomial projection
   maps. In addition to the theoretical discussion, the performance of the
   discretization schemes based on the proposed spaces and the accompanying
   correction maps is numerically evaluated through their application to
   H(div) eigenvalue problems, mixed and least-squares approximations of
   linear and nonlinear porous media flow problems.}},

Abstract = {{Multilamellar membranes are important building blocks for constructing
   self-assembled structures with improved barrier properties, such as
   multilamellar lipid vesicles. Polymeric vesicles (polymersomes) have
   attracted growing interest, but multilamellar polymersomes are much less
   explored. Here, we report the formation of polypeptide vesicles with
   unprecedented densely packed multilayer membrane structures with
   poly(ethylene
   glycol)-block-poly(gamma-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl)-L-glutamate)
   (PEG-b-PL), an amphiphilic diblock rod-coil copolymer containing a short
   PEG block and a short hydrophobic rod-like polypeptide segment. The
   polypeptide rods undergo smectic ordering with PEG buried between the
   hydrophobic polypeptide layers. The size of both blocks and the rigidity
   of the hydrophobic polypeptide block are critical in determining the
   membrane structures. Increase of the PEG length in PEG-b-PL results in
   the formation of bilayer sheets, while using random-coil polypeptide
   block leads to the formation of large compound micelles. UV treatment
   causes ester bond cleavage of the polypeptide side chain, which induces
   helix-to-coil transition, change of copolymer amphiphilicity, and
   eventual disassembly of vesicles. These polypeptide vesicles with unique
   membrane structures provide a new insight into self-assembly structure
   control by precisely tuning the composition and conformation of
   polymeric amphiphiles.}},

Abstract = {{We address demands and challenges for GaAs-based Vertical-Cavity
   Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSEL) in data communication. High speed
   modulation (similar to 50Gb/s) at a high reliability can be realized
   with a proper VCSEL design providing a high differential gain. In cases
   where extreme temperatures are required electrooptic modulation in
   duo-cavity VCSELs can be applied as the modulation speed and the
   differential gain are decoupled. Single mode operation of VCSELs is
   necessary to counteract the chromatic dispersion of glass fibers and
   extend distances to above 1 km while using standard multimode fibers.
   Oxide layer engineering or using of photonic crystals can be applied.
   Parallel error-free 25Gb/s transmission over OM3 and OM4 multimode fiber
   (similar to 0.5 and 1 km, respectively) is realized in large aperture
   oxide-engineered VCSEL arrays. Passive cavity VCSELs with gain medium
   placed in the bottom DBR and the upper part made of dielectric materials
   a complete temperature insensitivity of the emission wavelength can be
   realized. Engineering of the oxide aperture region enables near field
   vertical cavity lasers. Such devices can operate in a high-order
   transverse mode with an effective mode angle beyond the angle of the
   total internal reflection at the semiconductor-air interface. Near filed
   coupling to optical fibers and waveguides becomes possible in this case.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate high-resolution imaging of the living human retina by
   computationally correcting highorder ocular aberrations. These
   corrections are performed post-acquisition and without the need for a
   deformable mirror or wavefront sensor that are commonly employed in
   hardware adaptive optics (HAO) systems. With the introduction of HAO to
   ophthalmic imaging, high-resolution near diffraction-limited imaging of
   the living human retina has become possible. The combination of a
   deformable mirror, wavefront sensor, and supporting hardware/software,
   though, can more than double the cost of the underlying imaging
   modality, in addition to significantly increasing the system complexity
   and sensitivity to misalignment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)
   allows 3-D imaging in addition to naturally providing the complex
   optical field of backscattered light. This is unlike a scanning laser
   ophthalmoscope which measures only the intensity of the backscattered
   light. Previously, our group has demonstrated the utility of a technique
   called computational adaptive optics (CAO) which utilizes the complex
   field measured with OCT to computationally correct for optical
   aberrations in a manner similar to HAO. Until now, CAO has been applied
   to ex vivo imaging and in vivo skin imaging. Here, we demonstrate in
   vivo imaging of cone photoreceptors using CAO. Additional practical
   considerations such as imaging speed, and stability are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Because of increased use of fertilizers to feed the increasing global
   population, the nutrient loads in surface and subsurface water have
   increased substantially in the last few decades. Many studies have been
   conducted to investigate the factors affecting nitrate load in surface
   and subsurface flow. The objective of this study is to investigate the
   relationship between the various factors affecting nitrate transport
   using principal component analysis (PCA) and nearest neighborhood
   analysis methods. Hydrological and biogeochemical data from a small
   (<500 km(2)) agricultural watershed in east central Illinois, USA for
   the duration of 10 years have been used in this study. The PCA approach
   divided various factors that influence nitrate transport into three
   principal components. The first component contained air temperature,
   cover phenotype, evapotranspiration, cover factor and dry mass factors.
   The second component contained precipitation and flow, which was defined
   as the hydrologic component. The third component included tillage
   practices and nitrogen application and was termed the anthropogenic
   component. The results from the PCA approach suggested all three
   components had significant influence on nitrate transportation and
   transformation. Among these three components, the hydrological
   components had the highest contribution on both surface and subsurface
   nitrate load. The nearest neighborhood analysis yielded a similar
   conclusion.}},

Journal = {{ANALYST}},

Volume = {{140}},

Abstract = {{Biosensors incorporating nanomaterials have demonstrated superior
   performance compared to their conventional counterparts. Most reported
   sensors use nanomaterials as a single transducer of signals, while
   biosensor designs using dual transducing elements have emerged as new
   approaches to further improve overall sensing performance. This review
   focuses on recent developments in nanomaterial-based biosensors using
   dual transducing elements for solution phase detection. The review
   begins with a brief introduction of the commonly used nanomaterial
   transducers suitable for designing dual element sensors, including
   quantum dots, metal nanoparticles, upconversion nanoparticles, graphene,
   graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, and carbon nanodots. This is followed
   by the presentation of the four basic design principles, namely Forster
   Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), Amplified Fluorescence Polarization
   (AFP), Bio-barcode Assay (BCA) and Chemiluminescence (CL), involving
   either two kinds of nanomaterials, or one nanomaterial and an organic
   luminescent agent (e.g. organic dyes, luminescent polymers) as dual
   transducers. Biomolecular and chemical analytes or biological
   interactions are detected by their control of the assembly and
   disassembly of the two transducing elements that change the distance
   between them, the size of the fluorophore-containing composite, or the
   catalytic properties of the nanomaterial transducers, among other
   property changes. Comparative discussions on their respective design
   rules and overall performances are presented afterwards. Compared with
   the single transducer biosensor design, such a dual-transducer
   configuration exhibits much enhanced flexibility and design versatility,
   allowing biosensors to be more specifically devised for various
   purposes. The review ends by highlighting some of the further
   development opportunities in this field.}},

Abstract = {{Lipids play fundamental roles in mammalian embryo preimplantation
   development and cell fate. Triacylglycerol accumulates in oocytes and
   blastomeres as lipid droplets, phospholipids influence membrane
   functional properties, and essential fatty acid metabolism is important
   for maintaining the stemness of cells cultured in vitro. The growing
   impact that lipids have in the field of developmental biology makes
   analytical approaches to analyse structural information of great
   interest. This paper describes the concept and presents the results of
   lipid profiling by mass spectrometry (MS) of oocytes and preimplantation
   embryos, with special focus on ambient ionisation. Based on our previous
   experience with oocytes and embryos, we aim to convey that ambient MS is
   also valuable for stem cell differentiation analysis. Ambient ionisation
   MS allows the detection of a wide range of lipid classes (e.g. free
   fatty acids, cholesterol esters, phospholipids) in single oocytes,
   embryos and cell pellets, which are informative of in vitro culture
   impact, developmental and differentiation stages. Background on MS
   principles, the importance of underused MS scan modes for structural
   analysis of lipids, and statistical approaches used for data analysis
   are covered. We envisage that MS alone or in combination with other
   techniques will have a profound impact on the understanding of lipid
   metabolism, particularly in early embryo development and cell
   differentiation research.}},

Abstract = {{Polymicrobial infections are caused by more than one pathogen. They
   require antimicrobial dosing regimens that are different from those
   prescribed for monomicrobial infections because these interactions are
   predicted to influence the antimicrobial susceptibility of the
   individual pathogens. Here we report on a microfluidic approach to study
   the effect of bacterial interactions in polymicrobial cultures on the
   antimicrobial susceptibility. The use of microfluidics enables real-time
   quantification of bacterial growth dynamics in the presence and absence
   of antimicrobials, which is challenging to achieve using current
   methods. We studied microbial interactions between Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. A key
   observation was that in co-cultures with relatively high initial cell
   numbers of P. aeruginosa, the co-cultured partner bacteria exhibited
   initial growth followed by lyses or growth stasis. In addition, we
   observed a significantly higher antimicrobial tolerance of P. aeruginosa
   in polymicrobial cultures, as evident by up to 8-fold increases in the
   minimum inhibitory concentration of the antimicrobials, compared to
   those observed in monomicrobial cultures. This work demonstrates the
   potential of microfluidics to study bacterial interactions and their
   effect on antimicrobial susceptibility, which in turn will aid in
   determining appropriate antimicrobial treatment for polymicrobial
   infections.}},

Abstract = {{This study pursues the detection of bruised areas caused by mechanical
   impact on Golden Delicious apples using chlorophyll fluorescence
   imagery. When a fruit is impacted by a mechanical force and a bruise
   occurs, the chlorophyll nuclei inside the peel are damaged, which causes
   a reduction in fluorescence excitation compared to non-impacted areas.
   This difference allows automated detection of bruises and removal of
   damaged fruits to maintain optimal quality. In this study, fruit bruises
   were created using impact forces of 68.6, 88.2, and 107.8 N, and the
   resulting damage to chlorophyll nuclei inside the fruit peel was
   observed. Expansion of the area of damaged chlorophyll nuclei over time
   was observed using fluorescence imagery 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after the
   mechanical impact. This study employed a continuous capture of fruit
   fluorescence images and used MATLAB software for image processing and
   analysis. Edge contour noise was filtered by presetting a proper
   threshold, and the contour features of fruit bruises were distinguished
   using local adaptive binarization and a size filter. The experimental
   results showed that the mean recognition rate of a bruise 0.5 h after
   impact forces of 68.6, 88.2, and 107.8 N was as high as 86.7\%, and the
   bruise recognition rate 1 h after impact was 100\%. In conclusion, the
   fluoroscopic examination system for bruises was capable of detecting
   bruises accurately before the bruises were visible to the naked eye.}},

Abstract = {{Measurement and analysis of airflow resistance are essential for the
   engineering design of systems to dry or aerate agricultural products.
   This work investigates the measurement of airflow resistance as a
   function of airflow velocity for two types of chopped miscanthus.
   Chopped miscanthus physical properties (moisture content, bulk density,
   and particle size distribution) were measured and analyzed for their
   effects on airflow resistance. Chopped miscanthus with a bed depth of
   0.57 m was stored in a drum 0.83 m x 0.60 m (height x diameter) and
   aerated with ambient air at different velocities ranging from 0.073 to
   0.461 m s(-1). Bulk density was considered an important parameter in
   relation to pressure drop of chopped miscanthus. Shedd's curves were
   developed for both types of chopped miscanthus. Airflow resistance
   increased with the increase in airflow velocity, as affected by bulk
   density (moisture content, particle size and shape), and was in the
   range between ASABE standard values for ear corn and shelled corn.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a real-time drug-reporting conjugate (CPT-SS-CyN) composed
   of a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent cyanine-amine dye (CyN), a
   disulfide linker, and a model therapeutic drug (camptothecin, CPT).
   Treatment with dithiothreitol (DTT) induces cleavage of the disulfide
   bond, followed by two simultaneous intramolecular cyclization reactions
   with identical kinetics, one to cleave the urethane linkage to release
   the NIR dye and the other to cleave the carbonate linkage to release
   CPT. The released CyN has an emission wavelength (760 nm) that is
   significantly different from CPT-SS-CyN (820 nm), enabling easy
   detection and monitoring of drug release. A linear relationship between
   the NIR fluorescence intensity at 760 nm and the amount of CPT released
   was observed, substantiating the use of this drug-reporting conjugate to
   enable precise, real-time, and non-invasive quantitative monitoring of
   drug release in live cells and semi-quantitative monitoring in live

Abstract = {{This study for the first time reports the unusual sorption capabilities
   of polyurethane foam (PUF) for bisphenol A (BPA) - a major industrial
   plasticizer and endocrine-disrupting chemical ubiquitously detected in
   environmental waters. The low surface-area material showed not only
   anomalously high sorption capacities, but also rapid uptake for BPA
   compared with activated carbon and macroreticular polymeric adsorbents.
   BPA sorption by PUF was driven by a solid-phase partitioning mechanism
   assisted by hydrogen bonding on PUF lone-pair donor groups. Using
   high-resolution electron microscopy, gas pycnometry, and cross-sectional
   infrared imaging analyses, we present new direct evidence for the
   partitioning of large organic sorbate into PUF through aqueous sorption:
   volumetric swelling of PUF fibrils induced by BPA uptake, thorough
   diffusion of BPA inside PUF fibrils, and hydrogen bonds between BPA and
   PUF carbonyl and ether oxygen groups. Building on this improved
   understanding of PUF sorption mechanism, we elucidated the specificity
   of PUF sorption by examining its sorption behaviors under different
   water chemistry. Quantitative recovery of BPA was readily achieved by
   exploiting the reversibility of PUF sorption in alkaline solutions. This
   work provides the first proof of concept on PUF as a large and selective
   absorption sink for BPA, and demonstrates the potential use of this
   inexpensive, easily accessible material as a superior sorbent medium for
   BPA in aqueous media.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{617-632}},
Abstract = {{The scale-dependent response of an instrumented full-scale wind turbine
   is studied under neutrally stratified conditions. The analysis is
   focused on the linkage between the incoming flow, turbine power output
   and foundation strain. Wind speed, measured from sonic anemometers
   installed on a meteorological tower, and foundation strain were sampled
   at 20 Hz, while the turbine power was sampled at 1 Hz. A wavelet
   framework and structure function are used to obtain cross correlations
   among flow turbulence, turbine power and strain across scales as well as
   to quantify intermittent signatures in both flow and turbine quantities.
   Results indicate that correlation between the streamwise velocity
   component of the wind flow and turbine power is maximised across all
   scales larger than the rotor radius for wind measured at the turbine hub
   height. The characteristic time lag associated with maximum correlation
   is shown to be consistent with the Taylor's hypothesis for turbulent
   scales smaller than the separation between the meteorological tower and
   the turbine. However, it decreases with increasing scale size and
   diminishes to zero at scales on the order of the boundary layer
   thickness. Turbine power and strain fluctuations exhibited practically
   the same behaviour at scales larger than two rotor diameters. At those
   scales, the cross correlation between these quantities resulted similar
   to 0.99 and remains still over 0.9 at the scale of rotor radius. Below
   this scale, the correlation decreases logarithmically with scale. The
   strong linkage between power and strain for all the relevant scales
   would eventually allow the analysis of dynamic forcing on the foundation
   based on the power output. Intermittency on the flow is shown to be
   transferred and amplified by the turbine, leading to highly intermittent
   power output.}},
