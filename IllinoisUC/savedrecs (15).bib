Abstract = {{Asymmetric assembly of nanomaterials has attracted broad Interests
   because of their unique anisotropic properties that are different from
   those based on the more widely reported symmetric assemblies. Despite
   the potential advantages, programmable fabrication of asymmetric
   structure in nanoscale remains a challenge. We report here a
   DNA-directed approach for the assembly of asymmetric nanoclusters using
   Janus nanoparticles as building blocks. DNA-functionalized spherical
   gold nanoparticles (AuNSs) can be selectively attached onto two
   different hemispheres of DNA-functionalized Janus nanoparticle (JNP)
   through DNA hybridization. Complementary and invasive DNA strands have
   been used to control the degree and reversibility of the assembly
   process through programmable base-pairing interactions, resulting in a
   series of modular and asymmetric nanostructures that allow systematic
   study of the size-dependent assembly process. We have also shown that
   the attachment of the AuNSs onto the gold surface of the Janus
   nanoparticle results In red shifting of the UV-vis and plasmon resonance
   spectra.}},

Title = {{On the variational equilibrium as a refinement of the generalized Nash
   equilibrium}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{45-55}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We are concerned with a class of games in which the players' strategy
   sets are coupled by a shared constraint. A widely employed solution
   concept for such generalized Nash games is the generalized Nash
   equilibrium (GNE). The variational equilibrium (VE) (Facchinei \&
   Kanzow, 2007) is a specific kind of GNE characterized by the solution of
   the variational inequality formed from the common constraint and the
   mapping of the gradients of player objectives. Our contribution is a
   theory that provides sufficient conditions for ensuring that the
   existence of a GNE implies the existence of a VE; in such an instance,
   the VE is said to be a refinement of the GNE. For certain games, these
   conditions are shown to be necessary. This theory rests on a result
   showing the equality of the Brouwer degree of two suitably defined
   functions, whose zeros are the GNE and VE, respectively. This theory has
   a natural extension to the primal-dual space of strategies and Lagrange
   multipliers corresponding to the shared constraint. Our results unify
   some known results pertaining to such equilibria and provide
   mathematical substantiation for ideas that were known to be appealing to
   economic intuition. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{On stochastic gradient and subgradient methods with adaptive steplength
   sequences}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{56-67}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Traditionally, stochastic approximation (SA) schemes have been popular
   choices for solving stochastic optimization problems. However, the
   performance of standard SA implementations can vary significantly based
   on the choice of the steplength sequence, and in general, little
   guidance is provided about good choices. Motivated by this gap, we
   present two adaptive steplength schemes for strongly convex
   differentiable stochastic optimization problems, equipped with
   convergence theory, that aim to overcome some of the reliance on
   user-specific parameters. The first scheme, referred to as a recursive
   steplength stochastic approximation (RSA) scheme, optimizes the error
   bounds to derive a rule that expresses the steplength at a given
   iteration as a simple function of the steplength at the previous
   iteration and certain problem parameters. The second scheme, termed as a
   cascading steplength stochastic approximation (CSA) scheme, maintains
   the steplength sequence as a piecewise-constant decreasing function with
   the reduction in the steplength occurring when a suitable error
   threshold is met. Then, we allow for nondifferentiable objectives but
   with bounded subgradients over a certain domain. In such a regime, we
   propose a local smoothing technique, based on random local perturbations
   of the objective function, that leads to a differentiable approximation
   of the function. Assuming a uniform distribution on the local
   randomness, we establish a Lipschitzian property for the gradient of the
   approximation and prove that the obtained Lipschitz bound grows at a
   modest rate with problem size. This facilitates the development of an
   adaptive steplength stochastic approximation framework, which now
   requires sampling in the product space of the original measure and the
   artificially introduced distribution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this work, we develop and validate an automated micro-computed
   tomography (micro-CT) image segmentation algorithm that accurately and
   efficiently segments bone, calcium phosphate (CaP)-based bone scaffold,
   and soft tissue. The algorithm enables quantitative evaluation of bone
   growth in CaP scaffolds in our study that includes many samples (100+)
   and large data sets (900 images per sample). The use of micro-CT for
   such applications is otherwise limited because the similarity in X-ray
   attenuation for the two materials makes them indistinguishable.
   Destructive characterization using histological techniques and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) has been the standard for CaP scaffolds, but
   these methods are cumbersome, inaccurate, and yield only 2D information.
   The proposed algorithm exploits scaffold periodicity and combines signal
   analysis, edge detection, and knowledge of three-dimensional spatial
   relationships between bone, CaP scaffold, and soft tissue to achieve
   fast and accurate segmentation. Application of this algorithm can lead
   to a new understanding of the role of CaP and scaffold internal
   structure on patterns and rates of bone growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Risks and Benefits of Consumption of Great Lakes Fish}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{11-18}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Beneficial effects of fish consumption on early cognitive
   development and cardiovascular health have been attributed to the
   omega-3 fatty acids in fish and fish oils, but toxic chemicals in fish
   may adversely affect these health outcomes. Risk benefit assessments of
   fish consumption have frequently focused on methylmercury and omega-3
   fatty acids, not persistent pollutants such as polychlorinated
   biphenyls, and none have evaluated Great Lakes fish consumption.
   OBJECTIVES: The risks and benefits of fish consumption have been
   established primarily for marine fish. Here, we examine whether
   sufficient data are available to evaluate the risks and benefits of
   eating freshwater fish from the Great Lakes.
   METHODS: We used a scoping review to integrate information from multiple
   state, provincial, and federal agency sources regarding the contaminants
   and omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes fish and fish consumers,
   consumption rates and fish consumption advisories, and health effects of
   contaminants and omega-3 fatty acids.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: Great Lakes fish contain persistent contaminants many of
   which have documented adverse health effects-that accumulate in humans
   consuming them. In contrast, data are sparse on omega-3 fatty acids in
   the fish and their consumers. Moreover, few studies have documented the
   social and cultural benefits of Great Lakes fish consumption,
   particularly for subsistence fishers and native communities. At this
   time, federal and state/provincial governments provide fish consumption
   advisories based solely on risk.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our knowledge of Great Lakes fish has critical gaps,
   particularly regarding the benefits of consumption. A risk benefit
   analysis requires more information than is currently available on the
   concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in Great Lakes fish and their
   absorption by fish eaters in addition to more information on the social,
   cultural, and health consequences of changes in the amount of fish
   consumed.}},

Abstract = {{Carbonaceous materials and carbon matrix composites (CAMCs) have
   potential to be used in heat exchangers and heat sinks for a number of
   thermal management applications related to HVAC\&R systems, especially
   in high-temperature and corrosive environments. Recent developments in
   carbonaceous materials, such as new, natural graphite, carbon foam,

   various monolithic carbonaceous materials and CAMCs and their
   applications in liquid-to-liquid heat exchangers, liquid-to-gas heat
   exchangers, gas-to-gas heat exchangers and heat sinks are reviewed in
   this paper. While it is clear that these materials do hold promise for
   use in the construction of heat exchangers in different applications,
   additional research is still required in material properties, life-time

Abstract = {{In the 1970-1980's, a number of papers explored the role of the
   transitional and burst features in consonant-vowel context. These papers
   left unresolved the relative importance of these two acoustic cues. This
   research takes advantage of refined signal processing methods, allowing
   for the visualization and modification of acoustic details. This
   experiment explores the impact of modifying the strength of the acoustic
   burst feature on the recognition scores P-c(SNR) (function of the
   signal-to-noise ratio), for four plosive sounds /ta, ka, da, ga/. These
   results show high correlations between the relative burst intensity and
   the scores P-c(SNR). Based on this correlation, one must conclude that
   these bursts are the primary acoustic cues used for the identification
   of these four consonants. This is in contrast to previous experiments,
   which used less precise methods to manipulate speech, and observe
   complex relationships between the scores, bursts and transition cues. In
   cases where the burst feature is removed entirely, it is shown that
   naturally existing conflicting acoustic features dominate the score.
   These observations seem directly inconsistent with transition cues
   playing a role: if the transition cues were important, they would
   dominate over low-level conflicting burst cues. These limited results
   arguably rule out the concept of redundant cues. (C) 2012 Acoustical

Abstract = {{The key hurdle to the practical use of as-grown single-walled carbon
   nanotubes (SWNTs) for high performance nanoelectronics is the
   unavoidable presence of metallic nanotubes with current synthesis
   methods. We present a simple approach to convert metallic SWNTs to
   semiconducting ones in situ to improve device field effect behaviour,
   using an aromatic compound (2-ethylanthraquinone - EAQ) which is a mild
   radical initiator. We show that the reaction between EAQ-generated
   radicals and SWNTs is diameter and metallicity dependent; in the
   medium-diameter regime (0.8 to 1.0 nm), the EAQ-generated radicals
   preferentially attack the metallic SWNTs over semiconducting ones and
   convert them to semiconducting, as evidenced by several orders (10 and
   10(4)) increase in the on/off ratio.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Pages = {{2237-2242}},
Abstract = {{Polymer vesicles are being extensively studied to emulate self-assembly
   in biological systems and also use them in a variety of biological and
   industrial applications. This study demonstrates a novel strategy to
   prepare polymer vesicles in a pure aqueous medium by driving the
   micelle-to-vesicle transition with metallic nanoparticles. We
   synthesized poly(2-amino-2-hydroxyethyl aspartamide) (PAHA) substituted
   with octadecyl chains, which could form micelle-like self-aggregates in
   the aqueous medium and chemically bind with platinum precursors. Then,
   in situ polymerization of Pt nanoparticles within the PAHA
   self-aggregates generated polymer vesicles that possess nanoparticles
   within bilayers, because of the increase of the hydrophilic mass ratio
   to total mass of PAHA, f(w). This new strategy to prepare polymer
   vesicles would greatly serve to facilitate the control of self-assembly
   and ultimately improve the functionality of a wide array of polymer
   vesicles.}},

Abstract = {{The P300-based speller is a well-established brain-computer interface
   for communication. It displays a matrix of objects on the computer
   screen, flashes each object in sequence, and looks for a P300 response
   induced by flashing the desired object. Most existing P300 spellers uses
   a fixed set of flash objects. We demonstrate that performance can be
   significantly improved by sequential selections from a hierarchy of
   flash sets containing variable number of objects. Theoretically, the
   optimal hierarchy of flash sets-with respect to a given statistical
   language model-can be found by solving a stochastic control problem of
   low computational complexity. Experimentally, statistical analysis
   demonstrates that the average time per output character at 85\% accuracy
   is reduced by over 50\% using our variable-flash-set approach as
   compared to traditional fixed-flash-set spellers.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed investigation of the relationship between the physical
   structure and electrochemical activity of state-of-the-art fuel cell
   electrodes is a critical, yet often poorly reported or proprietary, step
   in the manufacturing of cheaper and more durable configurations. Here we
   demonstrate the utility of X-ray micro-computed tomography (MicroCT) for
   detailed characterization of the architecture and buried interfaces of
   fuel cell electrodes in a non-destructive fashion. We employ a combined
   thresholding and filament tracing based analytical protocol for image
   analysis which enables more accurate quantification of GDE structures as
   compared to previously-used thresholding-only methods. Furthermore, we
   report on a methodology of combining in-situ electrochemical analysis in
   a microfluidic fuel cell and ex-situ structural analysis in a MicroCT
   which enables direct correlation of changes in electrode performance to
   changes in physical structure, in this case, porosity. As a
   demonstration, the effects of electrode compression are investigated. We
   observed that both subtle shifts in structure in the microporous and
   catalyst layers at low compression pressures (<1 x 10(3) lb(f)) and more
   drastic structural densification of the macroporous carbon fiber layer
   at moderate compression pressures (>= 1 x 10(3) lb(f)) impact electrode
   performance. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{We explore the intrinsic viscosity of 40 nm silica particles in
   concentrated solutions of low molecular weight hydroxyl terminated
   polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether (PEGDME)
   and polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF). Our goal is to develop a correlation
   between the intrinsic viscosity and the strength of the polymer
   segment-surface attractions, epsilon(pc). We show when the particles are
   large compared to the polymer radius of gyration and the polymer
   molecular weight is below the entanglement molecular weight, the
   intrinsic viscosity can be larger or smaller than the Einstein value of
   2.5 expected for spheres with hard surfaces experiencing no-slip
   boundary conditions at the fluid/particle interface. Extensive small
   angle X-ray scattering studies are undertaken to extract epsilon(pc) and
   establish the thermodynamic state of particle dispersion. We demonstrate
   a monotonic dependence of intrinsic viscosity on epsilon(pc) with weaker
   polymer segment-particle surface interactions leading to sub-Einstein
   intrinsic viscosities. When interpreted in terms of a continuum model,
   our results suggest that the variations in intrinsic viscosity can be
   understood in terms of adsorbed layers which can have different
   viscosities from that of bulk fluid and which can slip at the particle
   surface. Increased layer viscosities are encouraged by large epsilon(pc)
   while slip and or low viscosities are encouraged by low epsilon(pc).}},

Abstract = {{In this article, the development of the Reconfigurable Data Acquisition
   Vehicle (R-DAV) that has a high performance as a wheeled mobile robot is
   presented. The R-DAV is designed to monitor and manage the growing
   status of bio-energy crops, and the vehicle will be used for image
   collection, density measurements, and chemical applications. A
   theoretical model has been proposed to optimize the configuration. The
   4-Wheel-Drive-4-Wheel-Steering (4WD4WS) locomotion was proposed as the
   essential base for high traffic conditions and maneuverability, and a
   prototype model was fabricated for this scenario. The chassis was
   uniquely reconfigured in two ways: (1) by adjusting the clearance and
   (2) by changing the wheel gauge. The reconfiguration of the clearance
   was necessary to operate the vehicle over a range of heights of
   bio-energy crops at different growing stages in the Miscanthus
   (Miscanthus is a genus of about 15 species of perennial grasses native
   to subtropical and tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia). The
   adjustable wheel gauge layout was designed to follow variable inter-row
   tracks in the Miscanthus field. Furthermore, a triangle-shaped guard was
   specifically considered to minimize the crop damage when the vehicle
   enters into the field. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4004914]}},

Abstract = {{Two monomers, acrylamide (AM) and (2-methacryloyloxyethyl) trimethyl
   ammonium chloride (DMC) were grafted onto chitosan simultaneously in
   acid-water solution initiated by the highly efficient and
   environmentally friendly gamma ray radiation at ambient temperatures.
   The copolymer obtained was analyzed using Fourier-transform infrared,
   X-ray powder diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The cationic
   degree of the copolymer was determined by the colloid titration method.
   Its flocculation properties were evaluated in 0.25\% (wt) kaolin
   suspensions and its significant superiority over PAM (polyacrylamide)
   and chitosan was observed. The results of zeta potential measurement
   demonstrated that the flocculation mechanism of the copolymer was
   distinct when it was used as a flocculant under different conditions.
   The images and the settling rate test of the floccules after treating by
   the flocculant showed that the capacities of bridging and charge
   neutralization of the graft copolymer were improved after the grafting
   of AM and DMC. Jar tests with pulp mill wastewater demonstrated that the
   flocculation efficiency of the graft copolymer was much better than that

Abstract = {{The sliding contact between two rough surfaces in the presence of a

   rates, the lubricant is treated as a semi-solid layer with normal and
   lateral shear-dependent stiffness components obtained from experimental
   data. The adhesive force in the presence of lubricant is also adapted
   from the Sub-boundary lubrication model and improved to account for
   variation in surface energy with penetration into the lubricant layer. A
   model is then proposed, based on the Improved sub-boundary lubrication
   model, which accounts for lubricant contact and adhesion and its
   validity is discussed. The model is in good agreement with published
   experimental measurements of friction in the presence of molecularly
   thin lubricant layers and suggests that a molecularly thin lubricant
   bearing could be successfully used to reduce solid substrate damage at

Abstract = {{We propose a link layer protocol and link-state routing protocol suite
   for multi-channel ad hoc networks. The proposed protocol suite addresses
   several practical issues that arise when nodes equipped with two radio
   interfaces want to utilize available channels. The routing layer makes a
   hybrid channel assignment where one interface is fixed and the other is
   switchable. Based on that, the routing layer runs a shortest path
   routing algorithm augmented with channel diversity. The link layer
   implements a slotted structure to minimize broadcast overhead inherent
   to multi-channel networks. By using flow- and packet-level simulators,
   we make some important observations. First, a hybrid channel assignment
   is good for connectivity and amenable to shortest-path routing. Second,
   seeking a shortest-path can be a better routing strategy in terms of
   global system throughput than complex channel-diverse routing. Third,
   channel switching delay is not a throttling factor in terms of global
   system throughput. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Ethanol from corn is produced using dry grind corn process in which
   simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) is one of the most
   critical unit operations. In this work an optimal controller based on a
   previously validated SSF model was developed by formulating the SSF
   process as a Bolza problem and using gradient descent methods.
   Validation experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of
   optimal controller under different process disturbances that are likely
   to occur in practice. Use of optimal control algorithm for the SSF
   process resulted in lower peak glucose concentration, similar ethanol
   yields (13.38 +/- 0.36\% v/v and 13.50 +/- 0.15\% v/v for optimally
   controlled and baseline experiments, respectively). Optimal controller
   improved final ethanol concentrations as compared to process without
   optimal controller under conditions of temperature (13.35 +/- 1.28 and
   12.52 +/- 1.19\% v/v for optimal and no optimal control, respectively)
   and pH disturbances (12.65 +/- 0.74 and 11.86 +/- 0.49\% v/v for optimal
   and no optimal control, respectively). Cost savings due to lower enzyme
   usage and reduced cooling requirement were estimated to be up to \$1
   million for a 151 million L/yr (40 million gal/yr) dry grind plant.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{659-664}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Gas-Phase Biofiltration technology is widely utilized for treating
   ammonia gas (NH(3)) with one of its potential detrimental by-products
   being nitrous oxide (N(2)O), a potent greenhouse gas (100-y radiative
   forcing 298 times greater than carbon dioxide). The present work was
   conducted to investigate the relation between NH(3) removal during
   biofiltration and N(2)O generation as a product of incomplete
   denitrification during the start-up of gas-phase compost biofilters.
   Four laboratory scale tubular biofilters in up flow mode (20 s
   residence-time) were studied for 21 days: 3 replicates were subjected to
   16 ppm(v) (0.78 g m(-2) h(-1)) of NH(3) and a statistical control not
   subjected to NH3. Ammonia concentration differences between biofilter
   inlet (Bottom = 16 ppmv) and outlet (Top) and N(2)O concentration
   differences between biofilter outlet (Top) and biofilter inlet
   (background concentrations at the bottom) were used to determine the
   extent of the correlation between NH(3) removal and N(2)O generation.
   Correlations with CH(4) and CO(2) were also reported. The high Spearman
   correlation coefficients for the three replicates (p = -0.845, -0.820,
   and -0.841, with P <= 0.0001 for replications A, B and C, respectively)
   suggested that availability of nitrate/nitrite owing to NH(3)
   nitrification favored conditions for N(2)O generation as a sub-product
   of denitrification. The statistical control received no NH(3) inputs and
   did not generate N(2)O. Therefore, the results indicated that the
   process of NH(3) removal was a trigger for N(2)O production. Carbon
   dioxide and N(2)O were moderately correlated. Methane and N(2)O were
   weakly correlated and only for replicate C. No significant correlation
   was found for the Statistical Control between N(2)O and CH(4). (C) 2011

Pages = {{731-744}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear transient behavior of fiber-metal laminated (FML) composite
   plates under non-ideal blast loads are investigated by both experimental
   and numerical techniques. In the experiments three plates with different
   aspect ratios are tested under blast loads and their response is also
   simulated and compared with both the developed mixed finite element
   method and the commercial software ANSYS. Furthermore parametric
   numerical analyses are conducted for nonlinear transient behavior of
   functionally graded (FGM) thin plates under blast loads with mixed FEM.
   In these parametric analyses the effect of aspect ratio, load
   distribution and impulse function in time domain are investigated. In
   the developed mixed FE formulation, the von Karman plate theory is used.
   Nonlinear functional is developed using the Hellinger-Reissner principle
   and linearized with the incremental formulation. Dynamic analyses are
   carried using the Newmark method with the Newton-Raphson iterations.
   Condensation is not performed hence time derivative of internal forces
   are also calculated during the solutions. Damping is incorporated to the
   analysis in the sense of the Rayleigh damping. As a result of conducted
   analyses, there is a good and reliable agreement between the numerical
   and the experimental results. Moreover, the developed mixed FEM results
   are almost identical to the ANSYS results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study recourse-based stochastic nonlinear programs and
   make two sets of contributions. The first set assumes general
   probability spaces and provides a deeper understanding of feasibility
   and recourse in stochastic nonlinear programs. A sufficient condition,
   for equality between the sets of feasible first-stage decisions arising
   from two different interpretations of almost sure feasibility, is
   provided. This condition is an extension to nonlinear settings of the
   ``W-condition,{''} first suggested by Walkup and Wets (SIAM J. Appl.
   Math. 15:1299-1314, 1967). Notions of complete and relatively-complete
   recourse for nonlinear stochastic programs are defined and simple
   sufficient conditions for these to hold are given. Implications of these
   results on the L-shaped method are discussed. Our second set of
   contributions lies in the construction of a scalable, superlinearly
   convergent method for solving this class of problems, under the setting
   of a finite sample-space. We present a novel hybrid algorithm that
   combines sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and Benders
   decomposition. In this framework, the resulting quadratic programming
   approximations while arbitrarily large, are observed to be two-period
   stochastic quadratic programs (QPs) and are solved through two variants
   of Benders decomposition. The first is based on an inexact-cut L-shaped
   method for stochastic quadratic programming while the second is a
   quadratic extension to a trust-region method suggested by Linderoth and
   Wright (Comput. Optim. Appl. 24:207-250, 2003). Obtaining Lagrange
   multiplier estimates in this framework poses a unique challenge and are
   shown to be cheaply obtainable through the solution of a single
   low-dimensional QP. Globalization of the method is achieved through a
   parallelizable linesearch procedure. Finally, the efficiency and
   scalability of the algorithm are demonstrated on a set of stochastic
   nonlinear programming test problems.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Fragility analyses are conducted in this study to evaluate the relative
   seismic safety margins of seismic code-designed multi-story reinforced
   concrete (RC) buildings with varying input motion intensity, ductility
   level and configuration. Structural variations are accounted for by
   using twelve buildings {[}13] with diverse structural systems, heights
   and ductile detailing. The design peak ground acceleration (PGA) is also
   varied. The reference structures also include regular and irregular
   buildings in order to cover a wide spectrum of contemporary mid-rise
   buildings. Incremental dynamic analyses (IDAs) are deployed using the
   twelve inelastic fiber-based simulation models of the reference
   structures and sixty natural ground motions recorded on different soil
   conditions with a wide range of spectral amplifications. The regression
   analyses of the selected response quantities show that the soil
   condition has a marginal effect on the demand-ground motion intensity
   relationships when adopting spectral acceleration to characterize the
   ground shaking intensity. The damage state probabilities of wall-frame
   structures designed to high PGA and ductility levels do not
   satisfactorily achieve the most favorable safety objectives. Fragilities
   are reduced by decreasing the design PGA due to the higher contribution
   of gravity loads to the details of the building design. Using extensive
   results from twelve buildings subjected to sixty ground motions, a
   relationship is proposed to enable the quantifying of the Life Safety
   limit state probabilities of code-compliant mid-rise RC buildings. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a framework that can process a user query for
   retrieval of information from documents of different properties across
   multiple domains, with specific application to patent laws and
   regulations. The framework has three basic components. The first
   component is ontology mapping and generation. What happens is that the
   keywords entered by users are mapped into a subset of relevant keywords.
   This step is performed by looking up those words in an ontology
   database. The second component is the joint and cross search in various
   document domains; in our case, they are patents and scientific
   publications. The last component is to modify the search results by
   applying user feedback statistics. The results of feedback will be saved
   as metadata for future uses.
   A case example is given to demonstrate how results from multiple domain
   searches can be combined using ontology and cross referencing. We use an
   example of well-known biotechnology patents on erythropoietin (EPO) and
   give detailed analysis on each document domain with this keyword.
   Relationships between each domain are demonstrated.
   A user feedback mechanism is also discussed in this paper. The ability
   to take user feedback into the framework is important. There is no doubt
   that domain knowledge from expert or experienced users could be a very
   good compliment to the proposed system. Both direct and indirect user
   feedbacks are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology is proposed for the development of reduced-order models of
   finite element approximations of electromagnetic devices exhibiting
   uncertainty or statistical variability in their input parameters. In
   this approach, the reduced order system matrices are represented in
   terms of their orthogonal polynomial chaos expansions on the probability
   space defined by the input random variables. The coefficients of these
   polynomials, which are matrices, are obtained through the repeated,
   deterministic model order reduction of finite element models generated
   for specific values of the input random parameters. These values are
   chosen efficiently in a multi-dimensional grid using a Smolyak
   algorithm. The generated stochastic reduced order model is represented
   in the form of an augmented system that lends itself to the direct
   generation of the desired statistics of the device response. The
   accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through
   its application to the reduced-order finite element modeling of a
   terminated coaxial cable and a circular wire loop antenna.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a complete framework for articulatory inversion
   based on jump Markov linear systems (JMLS). In the model, the acoustic
   measurements and the position of each articulator are considered as
   observable measurement and continuous-valued hidden state of the system,
   respectively, and discrete regimes of the system are represented by the
   use of a discrete-valued hidden modal state. Articulatory inversion
   based on JMLS involves learning the model parameter set of the system
   and making inference about the state (position of each articulator) of
   the system using acoustic measurements. Iterative learning algorithms
   based on maximum-likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) criteria
   are proposed to learn the model parameter set of the JMLS. It is shown
   that the learning procedure of the JMLS is a generalized version of
   hidden Markov model (HMM) training when both acoustic and articulatory
   data are given. In this paper, it is shown that the MAP-based learning
   algorithm improves modeling performance of the system and gives
   significantly better results compared to ML. The inference stage of the
   proposed algorithm is based on an interacting multiple models (IMM)
   approach, and done online (filtering), and/or offline (smoothing).
   Formulas are provided for IMM-based JMLS smoothing. It is shown that
   smoothing significantly improves the performance of articulatory
   inversion compared to filtering. Several experiments are conducted with
   the MOCHA database to show the performance of the proposed method.
   Comparison of the performance of the proposed method with the ones given
   in the literature shows that the proposed method improves the
   performance of state space approaches, making state space approaches
   comparable to the best published results.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a computationally efficient framework to solve a large class
   of dynamic coverage and clustering problems, ranging from those that
   arise from deployment of mobile sensor networks to classification of
   cellular data for diagnosing cancer stages. This framework provides the
   ability to identify natural clusters in the underlying data set. In
   particular, we define the problem of minimizing instantaneous coverage
   as a combinatorial optimization problem in a Maximum Entropy Principle
   (MEP) framework that we formulate specifically for the dynamic setting,
   and which allows us to address inherent tradeoffs such as those between
   the resolution of the identified clusters and computational cost. The
   proposed MEP framework addresses both the coverage and the tracking
   aspects of these problems. Locating cluster centers of swarms of moving
   objects and tracking them is cast as a control design problem ensuring
   that the algorithm achieves progressively better coverage with time.
   Simulation results are presented that highlight the features of this
   framework; these results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm attains
   target coverage costs five to seven times faster than related
   frame-by-frame methods.}},

   stamps, are developed to include these elements in the circuit matrix
   equation without the need of deriving equivalent circuit models
   consisting of interconnections of elements characterized only by
   currents and voltages, as in the current practice. The method is applied
   to derive circuit stamps of memristive, memcapacitive, meminductive, and

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{237-247}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The low-rank matrix completion problem can be succinctly stated as
   follows: given a subset of the entries of a matrix, find a low-rank
   matrix consistent with the observations. While several low-complexity
   algorithms for matrix completion have been proposed so far, it remains
   an open problem to devise l(0)-type search procedures with provable
   performance guarantees. The standard approach to the problem, which
   involves the minimization of an objective function defined using the
   Frobenius metric, has inherent difficulties: the objective function is
   not continuous and the solution set is not closed. To address this
   problem, we consider an optimization procedure that searches for a
   column (or row) space that is geometrically consistent with the partial
   observations. The geometric objective function is continuous everywhere
   and the solution set is the closure of the solution set of the Frobenius
   metric. We also preclude the existence of local minimizers, and hence
   establish strong performance guarantees, for special completion
   scenarios, which do not require matrix incoherence and hold with
   probability one for arbitrary matrix size.}},

   interreflections, to enable applications like projector radiometric
   compensation and light bounce separation. With known scene geometry and
   diffuse reflectance, inverse light transport can be easily derived in
   closed form. However, with unknown scene geometry and reflectance
   properties, we must acquire and invert the scene's light transport
   matrix to undo the effects of global illumination. For many photometric
   setups such as that of a projector-camera system, the light transport
   matrix often has a size of 10(5)x10(5) or larger. Direct matrix
   inversion is accurate but impractical computationally at these
   resolutions.
   In this work, we explore a theoretical analysis of inverse light
   transport, relating it to its forward counterpart, expressed in the form
   of the rendering equation. It is well known that forward light transport
   has a Neumann series that corresponds to adding bounces of light. In
   this paper, we show the existence of a similar inverse series, that
   zeroes out the corresponding physical bounces of light. We refer to this
   series solution as stratified light transport inversion, since
   truncating to a certain number of terms corresponds to cancelling the
   corresponding interreflection bounces. The framework of stratified
   inversion is general and may provide insight for other problems in light
   transport and beyond, that involve large-size matrix inversion. It is
   also efficient, requiring only sparse matrix-matrix multiplications. Our
   practical application is to radiometric compensation, where we seek to
   project patterns onto real-world surfaces, undoing the effects of global
   illumination. We use stratified light transport inversion to efficiently
   invert the acquired light transport matrix for a static scene, after
   which interreflection cancellation is a simple matrix-vector
   multiplication to compensate the input image for projection.}},

Abstract = {{The agricultural sector is highly vulnerable to bioterrorism attacks
   with the potential for severe economic consequences. This article
   presents estimates of state-by-state total economic impacts of a
   hypothetical agroterrorism attack that uses foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
   pathogens, which is one of the most contagious animal diseases and can
   be easily weaponized. The authors estimate the economic impacts across
   the U.S. states by applying the National Interstate Economic Model
   (NIEMO), a multiregional input output (MRIO) model. Total economic
   impacts range from \$23 billion to \$34 billion. The overwhelming
   sources of the losses are due to domestic and international demand cuts.
   The results of this research highlight the point that the economic
   impacts are nationwide, regardless of the location of the attack because
   of large-scale export losses.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the dynamics of strongly nonlinear granular chains of beads
   in Hertzian contact with light intruders. We show that the interactions
   of the light intruders with solitary pulses propagating through the
   granular medium can be approximately studied by reduced models of the
   intruders with only their neighboring beads under similar excitation
   conditions. Studying the reduced models, we identify weakly and strongly
   nonlinear regimes in the dynamics, depending on the degree of
   compression between beads and on the occurrence of separation between
   neighboring beads leading to collisions. We analyze weakly and strongly
   nonlinear oscillatory regimes of the intruder dynamics by multiple-scale
   analysis, and by applying special nonsmooth coordinate transformations.
   When separation between beads occurs, localized transient breathers are
   excited, corresponding to repeated collisions of an intruder with its
   neighbors. This leads to high-frequency scattering energy, and to
   radiation of energy in the granular medium in the form of low-amplitude
   slowly modulated oscillatory pulses. We find that repeated excitation of
   localized transient breathers by an array of periodically placed
   intruders can result in drastic reduction of the amplitude of a solitary
   wave propagating through the granular medium. This indicates that this
   type of granular media can be designed as effective shock attenuators.

   we incorporated a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor
   comprised of an array of closely spaced metal nanodomes into flexible
   tubing commonly used for IV drug delivery and urinary catheters. The
   nanodome sensor was fabricated by a low-cost, large-area process that
   enables single use disposable operation. As exemplary demonstrations,
   the sensor was used to kinetically detect promethazine (pain medication)
   and urea (urinary metabolite) within their clinically relevant
   concentration ranges. Distinct SERS peaks for each analyte were used to
   demonstrate separate detection and co-detection of the analytes.}},

   turbidity currents}},
Journal = {{NATURE GEOSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{42-45}},

Abstract = {{Submarine turbidity currents are controlled by gravity acting on
   suspended sediments that pull water downslope along with them(1). In
   addition to suspended sediments, turbidity currents also transport
   sediments at the base of the flow(2), which causes the reorganization of
   basal sediments prior to the settling of suspended grains(3-6). However,
   as turbidity currents reach areas with minimal slope, they cross a
   fall-velocity threshold beyond which the suspended sediments begin to
   stratify the flow. This process extinguishes the turbulence near the
   bed(7,8). Here we use direct numerical simulation of turbidity currents
   to show that this extinction of turbulence eliminates the ability of the
   flow to re-entrain sediment and rework the sediment at the base of the
   flow. Our simulations indicate that deposits from flows without basal
   reworking should lack internal structures such as laminations. Under
   appropriate conditions, then, sustained delivery of fine sediments will
   therefore result in the emplacement of massive turbidites. We suggest
   that this mechanism can explain field observations of massive
   deposits(9) that were emplaced gradually by dilute but powerful
   turbidity currents. We also conclude that turbulence in submarine
   turbidity currents is more fragile than river systems, and more
   sensitive to damping by the stratification of suspended sediment in the
   flow.}},

Abstract = {{We present a simple and shape-controllable method to tune the surface
   energy and tilting angle of nanohairy structures using broad ion beam

   (UV)-curable polyurethane acrylate (PUA) material were prepared by
   replica molding. Subsequently, the nanohairs were bent to a wide range
   of angles from 0 (vertical) to 75 degrees (stooped hairs) by the oblique
   broad Ar ion beam. The surface energy was tuned with normal oxygen
   (O(2)) ion beam irradiation together with aging effect (47.1 to 71.9 mJ
   m(-2)). It was observed that the shear adhesion strength was
   significantly increased from 25.2 to 58.1 N cm(-2) on the hydrophilic
   test surface and from 22.8 to 45.7 N cm(-2) on the hydrophobic test
   surface, respectively, with the variation of surface energy from 47.1 to

Abstract = {{Public transit structure is traditionally designed to contain fixed bus
   routes and predetermined bus stations. This paper presents an
   alternative flexible-route transit system, in which each bus is allowed
   to travel across a predetermined area to serve passengers, while these
   bus service areas collectively form a hybrid ``grand{''} structure that
   resembles hub-and-spoke and grid networks. We analyze the agency and
   user cost components of this proposed system in idealized square cities
   and seek the optimum network layout, service area of each bus, and bus
   headway, to minimize the total system cost. We compare the performance
   of the proposed transit system with those of comparable systems (e.g.,
   fixed-route transit network and taxi service), and show how each system
   is advantageous under certain passenger demand levels. It is found out
   that under low-to-moderate demand levels, the proposed flexible-route
   system tends to have the lowest system cost. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a generalized finite element method (GFEM) for crack
   growth simulations based on a two-scale decomposition of the solution-a
   smooth coarse-scale component and a singular fine-scale component. The
   smooth component is approximated by discretizations defined on coarse
   finite element meshes. The fine-scale component is approximated by the
   solution of local problems defined in neighborhoods of cracks. Boundary
   conditions for the local problems are provided by the available solution
   at a crack growth step. The methodology enables accurate modeling of 3-D
   propagating cracks on meshes with elements that are orders of magnitude
   larger than those required by the FEM. The coarse-scale mesh remains
   unchanged during the simulation. This, combined with the hierarchical
   nature of GFEM shape functions, allows the recycling of the
   factorization of the global stiffness matrix during a crack growth
   simulation. Numerical examples demonstrating the approximating
   properties of the proposed enrichment functions and the computational
   performance of the methodology are presented.}},

   texture-smoothing filtering to improve the visibility of images in
   presence of haze or fog. The proposed framework can effectively achieve
   strong texture smoothing while keeping edges sharp, and any low-pass
   filter can be directly integrated into the framework. Our experiments
   with three popular low-pass filters (Gaussian filter, median filter and
   bilateral filter) show that our framework can better preserve the
   contrast around edges than the original filters. The visibility
   restoration algorithm based on our framework outperforms existing
   filtering-based algorithm without losing the speed advantage compared to
   non-filtering-based algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Design is now considered to be the central or distinguishing activity of
   engineering and thus is being widely integrated throughout engineering
   education. However, engineering programs face special challenges in
   assessing student design abilities because of the subjective nature of
   design. Research has shown that current evaluation methods are
   insufficient in evaluating student design performance because
   quantitative tests of students design skills are not indicators of
   students design performance and open-ended project evaluations are
   mudded by the subjective biases of the single human evaluator. The
   purpose of this paper is to evaluate a new evaluation metric that
   utilizes a novel application of the Bayesian Truth Serum (BTS) in an
   effort to increase the accuracy of design skill evaluations and minimize
   subjective bias. Through a series of experiments our results indicate
   that BTS is a better indicator of idea generation ability than
   traditional evaluation methods. Although more work is needed to validate
   and understand how BTS can be used as an evaluation technique in
   engineering design, the results from this study are promising and
   provide a first step at deriving quantitative measures of student design
   performance in engineering.}},

Abstract = {{The success of modernizing the U.S. electrical grid depends on research,
   engineering, and policy, but also, on the education and acceptance of
   electricity consumers. In this paper we introduce K-12 power engineering
   education curriculum material that focuses the benefits and challenges
   that come with integrating renewable resources and the impact of energy
   storage technology. The curriculum aims to provide information about
   current and future electricity generation and delivery systems and to
   engage students who may pursue careers in related industries.
   An interactive Java applet (see Fig. 1) and related lessons allow
   students to explore effects on the power system as communities demand
   more power and wind generation is added or increased. They can also
   investigate how the availability of large-scale energy storage allows
   for the efficient use of intermittent energy sources like wind and
   solar. The simulation helps students understand some of the complexities
   of the power grid of the future. The lessons allow students to compare
   residential, commercial and industrial demand and to consider how past
   behaviors allow power professionals to predict future use. Students can
   consider wind variability, transmission needs, system costs and CO2
   emissions, and how the availability of energy storage may impact the
   system.
   The course materials have been used successfully in classrooms and in
   community events throughout the nation. During the past year, there were
   over 24,000 visits to the websites associated with the curriculum.
   Teachers from several states have adopted the materials for their
   classes. Power utilities and environmental groups are also interested in
   our materials for customer education. The materials are available from
   the project website.(2)
   This paper provides examples of the materials and discusses the major
   engineering concepts associated with them. We also discuss our
   continuing efforts to disseminate these materials to educators around
   the world and outline future plans for further development and
   dissemination.}},

Abstract = {{The curriculum incubator is a change strategy that nurtures innovative
   instructional design. Within the incubator, faculty test ideas outside
   of the official curriculum. The intention of this research and
   development process is to minimize early resistance and demonstrate
   methods that work.
   This study probed faculty perceptions about incubator characteristics
   and effectiveness during the first year of operation. An existing
   instrument, the Situational Outlook Questionnaire (SOQ), which measures
   organizational capacity for innovation, was adapted for use.
   Results indicated that faculty perceived high levels of nine
   characteristics called dimensions of innovation. Support for New Ideas
   and Time to Explore Ideas were identified as the most valuable. Results
   for the curriculum incubator compared favorably to earlier studies of
   organizations with a track record of innovation.
   The wider significance of this study is about leadership. Within the
   secure environment of the curriculum incubator, individuals had the time
   and the opportunity to refine their teaching in ways that made personal
   sense, and moved the organization forward.}},

Abstract = {{Although motivation in the classroom is often neglected in graduate
   student training, most instructors and TAs intuitively understand that
   motivation is critical for effective learning. These intuitions are
   corroborated by the research on motivation and learning that
   consistently shows that students do not learn well unless they are
   motivated to learn.
   In this paper, we present the basics of motivation theories, their
   impact on student learning and their implications for teaching
   engineering. It is a primer of motivation theories and how they can be
   used to inform and direct TAs work with engineering students. This
   primer was developed from the perspectives of a researcher of the
   preparation of future faculty and a developer of teaching assistant
   training programs.}},

Abstract = {{As railroad ballast ages, it is also progressively fouled primarily due
   to material degradation with particle breakage filling the void spaces.
   This paper focuses on investigating ballast performance associated with
   degradation and fouling levels in the field by analyzing both clean and
   deteriorated ballast particle size distributions and morphological
   properties. Los Angeles Abrasion (LAA) tests were conducted on limestone
   and granite type ballast materials to establish particle crushing or
   degradation trends associated with increased track usage. These
   degradation trends were successfully linked to before and after test
   values of aggregate imaging based shape indices, such as the flatness
   and elongation ratio, angularity index and surface texture index
   established using the University of Illinois Aggregate Image Analyzer.
   At around 400 drum turns of the LAA test, original uniform ballast
   gradations became more ``well-graded{''} according to the Unified Soil
   Classification System and approximately two thirds of the particle
   angularity was lost when compared to the full 1000 turns.}},

Abstract = {{Unsurfaced pavement sections are often constructed over weak subgrades
   and placement of geotextiles at the aggregate-subgrade interface has
   been shown to provide layer separation and pavement reinforcement
   benefits. As part of a recent full-scale pavement testing research
   effort at the University of Illinois, open-graded aggregate materials
   with large top-size particles were used to provide a ``platform{''} for
   placement and compaction of dense-graded surface layers. Geotextile
   separation and reinforcement of the aggregate-subgrade interface was
   considered in the experimental design to improve load distribution
   within the aggregate layer and prevent material migration across the
   layer interface. A 305-mm thick foundation layer was first constructed
   over the subgrade, and was subsequently ``capped{''} with a 152-mm thick
   surface layer comprising a dense-graded crushed limestone material. The
   test sections were loaded to failure under geotextile-reinforced and
   unreinforced conditions along two wheel paths separated by a distance of
   2.4 m. The geotextile-reinforced sections performed significantly better
   and showed lower rate of rut accumulation compared to the unreinforced
   sections that underwent shear failure after a few load applications. The
   reinforced sections also sustained significantly higher number of load
   applications (up to 200\% higher) before accumulating the same amount of
   rutting as the unreinforced sections. Excavation of transverse trench
   sections after testing showed significantly reduced inter-layer material
   migration due to geotextile use.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse representation based classification (SRC) methods have recently
   drawn much attention in face recognition, due to their good performance
   and robustness against misalignment, illumination variation, and
   occlusion. They assume the errors caused by image variations can be
   modeled as pixel-wisely sparse. However, in many practical scenarios
   these errors are not truly pixel-wisely sparse but rather sparsely
   distributed with structures, i.e., they constitute contiguous regions
   distributed at different face positions. In this paper, we introduce a
   class of structured sparsity-inducing norms into the SRC framework, to
   model various corruptions in face images caused by misalignment, shadow
   (due to illumination change), and occlusion. For practical face
   recognition, we develop an automatic face alignment method based on
   minimizing the structured sparsity norm. Experiments on benchmark face
   datasets show improved performance over SRC and other alternative
   methods.}},

   the regions to be completed. Through extensive simulations, we show our
   method can complete and repair textures corrupted by errors with both
   random and contiguous supports better than existing low-rank matrix
   recovery methods. Through experimental comparisons with existing image
   completion systems (such as Photoshop) our method demonstrate
   significant advantage over local patch based texture synthesis
   techniques in dealing with large corruption, non-uniform texture, and

Abstract = {{Progression of Si-based device processing ever deeper into nanoscale
   dimensions is creating stiffer challenges for the control and
   manipulation of atomic-scale defects. For example, the increasing use of
   multiple chemical elements creates a much more complicated network of
   defect reactions. The growing surface-to-volume ratios that stem from
   device shrinkage accentuate the importance of defect interactions with
   surfaces and interfaces, even though the understanding of these
   interactions remains in embryonic stages. And previously unrecognized
   effects of temperature on defect creation during ion implantation, as
   well as of photostimulated defect diffusion during annealing, manifest
   themselves more clearly in the nanoscale regime. The present work
   briefly describes these phenomena, and makes the case that modeling of
   defect behavior through a combination of quantum calculations, molecular
   dynamics, Monte Carlo, and continuum simulations - coupled with
   appropriate experiments - has become ever more integral to effective
   defect engineering.}},

Title = {{Directed evolution of bright mutants of an oxygen-independent
   flavin-binding fluorescent protein from Pseudomonas putida}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Fluorescent reporter proteins have revolutionized our
   understanding of cellular bioprocesses by enabling live cell imaging
   with exquisite spatio-temporal resolution. Existing fluorescent proteins
   are predominantly based on the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and
   related analogs. However, GFP-family proteins strictly require molecular
   oxygen for maturation of fluorescence, which precludes their application
   for investigating biological processes in low-oxygen environments. A new
   class of oxygen-independent fluorescent reporter proteins was recently
   reported based on flavin-binding photosensors from Bacillus subtilis and
   Pseudomonas putida. However, flavin-binding fluorescent proteins show
   very limited brightness, which restricts their utility as biological
   imaging probes.
   Results: In this work, we report the discovery of bright mutants of a
   flavin-binding fluorescent protein from P. putida using directed
   evolution by site saturation mutagenesis. We discovered two mutations at
   a chromophore-proximal amino acid (F37S and F37T) that confer a twofold
   enhancement in brightness relative to the wild type fluorescent protein
   through improvements in quantum yield and holoprotein fraction. In
   addition, we observed that substitution with other aromatic amino acids
   at this residue (F37Y and F37W) severely diminishes fluorescence
   emission. Therefore, we identify F37 as a key amino acid residue in
   determining fluorescence.
   Conclusions: To increase the scope and utility of flavin-binding
   fluorescent proteins as practical fluorescent reporters, there is a
   strong need for improved variants of the wild type protein. Our work
   reports on the application of site saturation mutagenesis to isolate
   brighter variants of a flavin-binding fluorescent protein, which is a
   first-of-its-kind approach. Overall, we anticipate that the improved
   variants will find pervasive use as fluorescent reporters for biological
   studies in low-oxygen environments.}},

Abstract = {{In wireless networks, users share a transmission medium. To increase the
   efficiency of channel usage, wireless systems often use a Medium Access
   Control (MAC) protocol to perform channel coordination by having each
   node announce its usage intentions; other nodes avoid making conflicting
   transmissions minimizing interference both to the node that has
   announced its intentions and to a node that cooperates by avoiding
   transmissions during the reserved slot. Traditionally, in a
   multi-channel environment, such announcements are made on a common
   control channel. However, this control channel is vulnerable to jamming
   because its location is pre-assigned and known to attackers.
   Furthermore, the announcements themselves provide information useful for
   jamming. In this paper, we focus on a situation where multiple wireless
   transmitters share spectrum in the presence of intelligent and possibly
   insider jammers capable of dynamically and adaptively changing their
   jamming patterns.
   We develop a framework for effectively countering MAC-aware jamming
   attacks and then propose SimpleMAC, a protocol resilient to these
   attacks. SimpleMAC consists of two schemes (the Simple Transmitter
   Strategy and the Simple Signaling Scheme) that are easily analyzed using
   game theory, and show the optimal adversarial behavior under these
   protocols. We evaluate our schemes mathematically, through Monte Carlo
   simulations, and by implementation on the WARP software-defined radio
   platform. SimpleMAC provides very rapid improvement over the alternative
   of not using any MAC protocol, and eventually converges to optimal
   performance (over six-fold improvement in SINR, 50\% gains in Shannon
   capacity in a realistic mobile scenario).}},

   demonstrated the ability to spectroscopically measure bulk refractive

   changes, thin film imaging with sensitivities down to submonolayer
   levels using a common optical microscope, and Raman signal enhancement
   using a single common device framework. These plasmonic crystals have

Abstract = {{Engine-out HC emissions resulting from liquid fuel, which escapes from
   the combustion process, provides the motivation to better understand the
   film vaporization in a combustion chamber. Previous work theorized that
   the removal of liquid fuel from the combustion cycle was a result of the
   increase in film vaporization time due to the Leidenfrost phenomenon.
   Currently, KIVA 3V predicts a continuous decrease in vaporization time
   for piston top films. The objective of this work is to improve the KIVA
   3V film vaporization model through the inclusion of established boiling
   correlations, and thus, the Leidenfrost phenomenon.
   Experimental results have been reviewed from which expressions
   encompassing high acceleration effects for the nucleate boiling regime
   and the film boiling regime were investigated, implemented, and
   validated. Validation was conducted using published experimental data
   sets for boiling heat flux. As a result of the implementation, a
   noticeable increase in heat flux occurred due to high accelerations for
   films in saturated film boiling in both nucleate and film boiling.
   Computational simulations were conducted using a semi-infinite plate and
   a direct-injection spark-ignition engine. The semi-infinite plate
   provided a controlled environment which could separate the effects of
   pressure and acceleration on film boiling heat flux, film vaporization
   rates, and film vaporization times. The effect of decreased film
   vaporization rates, during the Leidenfrost phenomenon, was observed to
   decrease with increasing acceleration. Finally, the engine computations
   were used to provide the first film boiling and film vaporization rates
   for engine fuel films at temperatures above saturation temperature. As a
   result of this work, a film vaporization model capable of improved
   prediction of vaporization rates of piston top films in saturated
   boiling conditions has been created.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical study of micro-explosion in multi-component bio-fuel
   droplets is presented. The onset of micro-explosion is characterized by
   the normalized onset radius (NOR). Bubble expansion is described by a
   modified Rayleigh equation. The final breakup is modeled from a surface
   energy approach by determining the minimal surface energy (MSE). After
   the breakup, the Sauter mean radius (SMR) for initially small size
   droplets can be estimated from a look-up table generated from the
   current breakup model. There exists an optimal droplet size for the
   onset of micro-explosion. The MSE approach reaches the same conclusion
   as previous model determining atomization by aerodynamic disturbances.
   The SMR of secondary droplets can be estimated by the possible void
   fraction, E, at breakup and the corresponding surface Weber number, Wes,
   at the minimal surface energy ratio (MSER). Biodiesel can enhance
   micro-explosion in the fuel blends of ethanol and diesel (which is
   represented by a single composition tetradecane). The simulation results
   show that the secondary atomization of bio-fuel and diesel blends can be
   achieved by micro-explosion under typical diesel engine operation

Abstract = {{We study the nonlinear fluid-structure interaction of an elastically
   supported rigid circular cylinder in a laminar flow. Periodic shedding
   of counter-rotating vortices from either side of the cylinder results in
   vortex-induced vibration of the cylinder. We demonstrate the passive
   suppression of the limit cycle oscillation (LCO) of the cylinder with
   the use of an essentially nonlinear element, the nonlinear energy sink
   (NES). The computational study is performed at a Reynolds number (Re) of
   100; Re is defined based on the cylinder diameter and inlet velocity.
   The variational multiscale residual-based stabilized finite-element
   method is used to compute approximate solutions of the incompressible
   Navier-Stokes equations. The NES is comprised of a small mass, an
   essentially nonlinear spring, and a linear damper. With appropriate
   values for the NES parameters, the coupled system of flow-cylinder-NES
   exhibits resonant interactions, resulting in targeted energy transfer
   (TET) from the flow via the cylinder to the NES, where the energy is
   dissipated by the linear damper. The NES interacts with the fluid via
   the cylinder by altering the phase relation between the lift force and
   the cylinder displacement; this brings about significant reduction in
   the LCO amplitude of the cylinder for several set of values of the NES
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In modern structures, mechanical joints are ubiquitous, significantly
   influencing a structure's dynamics. Frictional connections contained in
   a joint provide coupling of forces and moments between assembled
   components as well as localized nonlinear energy dissipation. Certain
   aspects of the mechanics of these friction Connections are yet to be
   fully understood and characterized in a dynamical systems framework.
   This work applies a nonlinear system identification (NSI) technique to
   characterize the influence of frictional connections on the dynamics of
   a bolted beam assembly. The methodology utilized in this work combines
   experimental measurements with slow-flow dynamic analysis and empirical
   mode decomposition, and reconstructs the dynamics through reduced-order
   models. These are in the form of single-degree-of-freedom linear
   oscillators (termed intrinsic modal oscillators - IMOs) with forcing
   terms derived directly from the experimental measurements through
   slow-flOw analysis. The derived reduced order models are capable of
   reproducing the measured dynamics, whereas the forcing terms provide
   important information about nonlinear damping effects. The NSI
   methodology is applied to model nonlinear friction effects in a bolted
   beam assembly. A `monolithic' beam with identical geometric and material
   properties is also tested for comparison. Three different forcing
   (energy) levels are considered in the tests in order to study the
   energy-dependencies of the damping nonlinearities induced in the beam
   from the bolted joint. In all cases, the NSI technique employed is
   successful in identifying the damping nonlinearities, their spatial
   distributions and their effects on the vibration modes of the structural
   component.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic response of component lofted joints often plays a
   significant role in the overall behavior of a structural system.
   Accurate finite element simulation of these problems requires proper
   treatment of the interface conditions. We present a formulation
   carefully suited to these problems that incorporates discontinuous
   Galerkin (DG) treatment locally at the interface. The present work is an
   extension of our previous investigations of friction models within a
   finite element method for quasi-static problems. The current emphasis is
   on the treatment of the inertial term and ensuring that artificial
   resonance is not induced by the discrete interface. The weak imposition
   of continuity constraints allows the stick-slip behavior at the jointed
   surface to proceed smoothly, reducing the numerical instability compared
   to node-to-node contact techniques. As a model problem, we simulate the
   dynamic response of a lap joint subjected to an impulse axial force
   assuming Coulomb friction at the interface.}},

   steering tie rod and tie rod arm was described based on Hertz model.
   Numerical analysis on the dynamic response of the vehicle shimmy system
   with clearance was carried out, and the results were presented with
   phase plane, Poincare map, and bifurcation diagram. The dynamic behavior
   of the vehicle shimmy system with clearance is compared with that
   without clearance, and the influence of the clearance on the dynamic
   behavior of the system is discussed, which will provide theoretical

Abstract = {{In the present work we study the dynamics of spatially periodic
   traveling waves in granular 1:1 (each bead is followed and preceded by a
   bead of different mass and/or stiffness) dimer chain with no
   pre-compression. The dynamics of a 1:1 dimer chain is governed by a
   single parameter, the mass ratio of the two beads forming each dimer
   pair of the chain. In particular, we demonstrate numerically the
   formation of special families of traveling waves with spatially periodic
   waveforms that are realized in semi-infinite dimer chains with the
   application of an arbitrary impulse. These traveling waves were first
   observed in the form of oscillatory tails in the trail of the
   propagating primary pulse. The energy radiated by the propagating
   primary pulse manifests in the form of traveling waves of varying
   spatial periodicity depending on the mass ratio. These traveling waves
   depend only on the mass ratio and are rescalable with respect to any
   arbitrary applied energy. The dynamics of these families of traveling
   waves is systematically studied by considering finite dimer chains
   (termed the `reduced systems') subject to periodic boundary conditions.
   We demonstrate that these waves may exhibit interesting bifurcations or
   loss of stability as the system parameter varies. In turn, these
   bifurcations and stability exchanges in infinite dimer chains are
   correlated to previous studies of pulse attenuation in finite dimer
   chains through efficient energy radiation from the propagating pulse to
   the far field, mainly in the form of traveling waves. Based on these
   results a new formulation of attenuation and propagation zones (stop and
   pass bands) in semi-infinite granular dimer chains is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{One of the prime focuses in the design of highly adaptive granular
   material is in ability to passively control the flow of energy through
   it by means of trapping, redirection and scattering. In this study we
   demonstrate that one of the possible mechanisms to achieve efficient
   control over the propagating shock wave in the material is the usage of
   weakly interacting, non-compressed granular chains. In the latest
   computational studies we have demonstrated that the shock waves
   initially localized on a finite amount of chains can be efficiently
   redirected to the neighboring granular chains. In this work; we present
   an analytical and numerical approach to the concept of targeted energy
   transfer (TET) in granular media. We consider two weakly coupled
   granular chains which have on-site potential. This on-site potential
   arises if the granular chains are mounted on linear elastic foundation.
   We propose two different mechanisms for TET in granular media: (i)
   decouple the coupling, and (ii) stratification of the foundation. Each
   mechanism provides an efficient way of localization of energy in one of
   the two chains. For the second mechanism, one chain with varying
   parameter is excited by an initial impulse but coupled with another
   chain with constant parameter is initially at rest and we transform the
   governing equation of the granular chain system into two coupled
   oscillators and thus made an analogy between strongly nonlinear granular
   chain with the quantum Landau-Zener tunneling. The revealed phenomena
   open up the possibility of designing granular media as shock mitigators
   by efficiently redirecting the incoming energy to the neighboring
   granular chain, i.e. it gives a passive control over the incoming energy
   by redirecting among the granular networks.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear energy sink (NES) is a passive device used to rapidly
   direct energy into higher modes of vibration and locally dissipate a
   significant portion of the impulsive shock energy induced in the
   primary, linear structure to which it is attached. The Type III NES is a
   two degree-of-freedom device comprised of two lightweight masses coupled
   together through an essentially nonlinear element. The lower mass in
   this two-mass arrangement is coupled to the linear structure through
   another essentially nonlinear element. This modification has been found
   to dramatically improve the performance of the NES to mitigate the shock
   when compared to a one degree-of-freedom NES device. The measure of
   effective damping of the linear structure indicates the ability of the
   NES to dissipate energy and reduce the response of the structure across
   a wide range of energies. Experimental tests have been performed to
   verify the numerical findings. Good agreement between numerical
   predictions and experimental observations validates the identified model
   of the NES.}},

Abstract = {{With the goal of making product recovery economically viable,
   disassembly sequence planning and evaluation can be used to influence
   product design features early in the product design process. Several
   researchers have investigated using optimization methods to determine
   disassembly sequences. One of the difficulties with using this approach
   is that because of the unique aspects of product disassembly at the end
   of life, input parameters for the optimization algorithms are commonly
   unavailable or estimated under high uncertainty. In practice, design
   engineers explore disassembly sequencing using either CAD software or
   manipulation of physical prototypes. These approaches produce solutions,
   but only intuitive solutions are explored and more optimal solutions may
   exist. To support decision making early in the design process, the
   research presented in this paper combines these two approaches within an
   immersive computing technology (ICT) application to aid in early product
   design with the goal of designing products with consideration of product
   recovery, reuse and recycle.
   The ICT application displays both 3D geometry of the product to be
   disassembled and an interactive graph visualization of the potential
   disassembly paths. The user can naturally interact with the geometric
   models and explore the potential paths indicated by the graph
   visualization. The optimal path can be indicated and the user can
   explore other potential paths. The result is an application that
   combines the strength of mathematical modeling with visualization and
   human interaction to provide an experience where the user can explore
   potential effects of design decisions. The initial application has been
   implemented in a 3 wall immersive projection environment and preliminary
   results show this approach proves to be an efficient method of
   evaluating and training potential disassembly sequences.}},

Abstract = {{As with most highway bridges, railway transitions experience
   differential movements due to differences in track system stiffness,
   track damping characteristics, foundation type, ballast settlement from
   fouling and/or degradation, as well as fill and sub grade settlement.
   This differential movement is especially problematic for high speed rail
   infrastructure as the ``bump{''} at the transition is accentuated at
   high speeds. Identification of different factors contributing towards
   this differential movement, as well as development of design and
   maintenance strategies to mitigate the problem is imperative for the
   safe and economical operation of both freight and passenger rail
   networks. This paper presents the research framework and preliminary
   findings from a recently initiated research effort at the University of
   Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Aimed at developing design and repair
   techniques to mitigate differential movement at railway transitions,
   this research project involves instrumentation, performance monitoring
   and numerical modeling of new and existing track transitions.}},

Abstract = {{A sustained increase in gross rail loads and cumulative freight
   tonnages, as well as increased interest in high and higher-speed
   passenger rail development in the United States, is placing an
   increasing demand on railway infrastructure. According to a railway
   industry survey conducted by the University of Illinois at
   Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), rail seat deterioration (RSD) was identified as
   one of the primary factors limiting concrete crosstie service life.
   Therefore, it can be seen that there is a need for infrastructure
   components with increased strength, durability, and ability to maintain
   the tighter geometric track tolerances under demanding loading
   conditions. Researchers have hypothesized that localized crushing of the
   concrete rail seat is one of five potential mechanisms that contribute
   to RSD. Therefore, to better understand this mechanism, UIUC is
   utilizing a matrix based tactile surface sensor (MBTSS) to quantify the
   forces acting at the interface between the bottom of the rail pad and
   the concrete tie rail seat. The MBTSS measures the forces and
   distribution of pressure as a load is applied to the rail seat.
   Preliminary laboratory testing has shown that higher modulus rail pads
   distribute forces poorer than lower modulus rail pads, leading to
   localized areas with high contact pressure and a higher probability of
   crushing. Testing has also shown that as the lateral/vertical (L/V)
   force ratio increases, the pressure on the field side of the rail seat
   also increases, possibly accelerating RSD. The objective of future field
   testing is to be able to validate the assumptions made from this
   preliminary laboratory data. Data collected and analyzed throughout this
   research project will provide valuable insight into developing future
   concrete crosstie and fastening system component designs that meet the
   operational and loading demands of high speed rail and joint
   passenger/freight corridors.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, there are divergent design and performance demands on railway
   infrastructure components due to increasing freight axle loads and
   cumulative gross tonnages, as well as increased investment in high-speed
   passenger rail development in North America. The divergence in loading
   and performance demands on shared infrastructure arises from the fact
   that while high-speed passenger trains exert lower loads at relatively
   high speeds, freight trains exert high loads at relatively low speeds.
   Improvements in infrastructure component designs are needed to achieve
   increased durability and tighter geometric tolerances. According to a
   rail industry survey administered by University of Illinois at
   Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2008, Rail Seat Deterioration (RSD) is the
   principal performance problem limiting the service life of concrete
   crossties in North America. Rail infrastructure researchers and industry
   experts agree that abrasive wear may occur due to relative motion
   between the rail pad and concrete crosstie rail seat, potentially
   resulting in RSD. The complex tribological process of abrasion is
   further complicated and expected to be accelerated by the presence of
   abrasive fines and moisture, creating 3-body wear condition. Lack of 99
   understanding of the abrasion mechanism has resulted in a sub-optimal
   and iterative design of ties, causing reduced service life. This paper
   summarizes our efforts in understanding the effect of changing the mix
   design of concrete on the abrasion resistance of the rail seat which
   will eventually help us in modeling abrasive wear in RSD by constructing
   a mathematical relationship between the rail seat wear rate and input
   parameters including concrete mix design, mechanical/tribological
   properties of materials involved, normal load applied, presence of
   moisture, and abrasive fines. To simulate abrasive wear in RSD, a simple
   experiment is being carried out using a rotating wheel (lapping machine)
   capable of abrading concrete samples as a part of UIUC's Small-Scale
   Abrasion Resistance Test (SSART). The objective of this research is to
   develop wear performance curves (e.g. wear depth versus
   load/time/cycles) for lab specimens developed from concrete crosstie mix
   designs that are currently being used in the industry, as well as for
   the evaluation of new mix designs. These data will help the rail
   industry in mechanistically designing concrete crossties by improving
   the understanding of materials used for concrete crosstie mix designs,
   with the objective of decreasing life cycle costs for the crosstie and
   fastening system. Preliminary SSART results are in agreement with
   relevant literature documenting the relationships between concrete mix
   designs and curing conditions and the resulting rate of abrasion.}},

Abstract = {{Two-track passenger rail lines typically operate with all trains serving
   every station. Without additional infrastructure, transit planners have
   limited options to improve travel times. Service could be improved by
   operating a skip-stop service where trains only serve a subset of all
   the station stops. A skip-stop pattern must find an optimal balance
   between faster passenger travel times and lower service frequencies at
   each station. A mixed integer formulation is proposed to analyze this
   tradeoff; however, the mixed integer formulation could not scale
   efficiently to analyze a large scale commuter line. A genetic algorithm
   is presented to search the solution space incorporating a larger problem
   scope and complexity. In a case study of a Midwest commuter line,
   overall passenger travel time could be decreased by 9.5\%. Both analyses
   can give insights to transit operators on how to improve their service
   to their customers and increase ridership.}},

Abstract = {{Classical tomographic reconstruction methods fail for problems in which
   there is extreme temporal and spatial sparsity in the measured data.
   Reconstruction of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), a space weather
   phenomenon with potential negative effects on the Earth, is one such
   problem. However, the topological complexity of CMEs renders recent
   limited data reconstruction methods inapplicable. We propose an energy
   function, based on a phase field level set framework, for the joint
   segmentation and tomographic reconstruction of CMEs from measurements
   acquired by coronagraphs, a type of solar telescope. Our phase field
   model deals easily with complex topologies, and is more robust than
   classical methods when the data are very sparse. We use a fast
   variational algorithm that combines the finite element method with a
   trust region variant of Newton's method to minimize the energy. We
   compare the results obtained with our model to classical regularized
   tomography for synthetic CME-like images.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model that predicts the stratigraphy of a prograding Gilbert
   delta is presented. Such a Gilbert delta is formed when a river is
   flowing into a deep basin and the sediment transported by the river
   downstream avalanches down a steep slope. These deltas are characterized
   by thin and relatively low-slope topsets, steep foresets (the prograding
   slip faces), and thin, fine-grained bottomsets. Bedforms such as dunes,
   bars and Gilbert deltas prograde through avalanching of sediment down
   the slip face, in which a vertical sorting pattern develops, with the
   coarser sediment preferentially deposited at lower elevations. We
   describe the stratigraphy formed by such a prograding delta in case of a
   variable base level by coupling the Hirano active layer model for the
   topset to a lee face-sorting model for the foreset. Numerical
   simulations are performed at laboratory scale. Base level varies as a
   cosine function with constant amplitude and variable frequency, so
   representing cycles of base level. The main result is that low-frequency
   oscillations of base level are recorded in the stratigraphy of a Gilbert
   delta, which offers possibilities for future interpretations of base
   level variations from measured stratigraphy.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, ubiquitous geographic information (UBGI), which is a
   relatively new set of concepts, practices, and standards, is introduced
   and described, and its possible ramifications are analyzed in detail.
   The chapter begins with the definition of UBGI -geographic information
   that exists anywhere and anytime. However, the chapter attempts to
   convince readers that the true goal of UBGI is to make the use of
   geographic information easy and transparent. The emergence of UBGI needs
   to be understood within a broader context of both paradigm changes in
   computing technologies (i.e., centralized, distributed, mobile, and
   ubiquitous computing) and the advancement of information and
   communication technologies (ICTs), which make UBGI services feasible.
   Thus, the chapter reviews how computing technologies have evolved, and
   introduces the technological breakthroughs of each computing technology,
   which overcome place and time constraints and enable the realization of
   UBGI services in everyday life. A few enabling ICTs are then described,
   and existing UBGI initiatives are introduced. Issues on the technical
   developments of UBGI services are addressed, and recent standardization
   efforts on UBGI are introduced. Lastly, the ramifications of UBGI for
   future lifestyles, particularly in future cities, are discussed.
   The chapter is organized as follows: a brief review of Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS) evolution is introduced as a prelude to the
   emergence of UBGI. The evolution of computing technologies, from
   centralized to ubiquitous computing, is introduced as one of the UBGI
   enablers. Next, a few enabling information and communication
   technologies that make UBGI services feasible are briefly described,
   followed by existing UBGI initiatives. The future prospects of UBGI, in
   particular with respect to future cities, are introduced, before the
   summary and conclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Electrodeposition and electropolishing of nanograined nickel has been
   observed using an in situ electrochemical wet cell developed for
   transmission electron microscopy. The cell employs two thin film nickel
   electrodes in a 0.1 M aqueous NiCl2 electrolyte, which were biased at
   +/- 1 V. Anisotropic electrodeposition was observed in which growth of
   the nickel film across the substrate occurred much more rapidly than
   growth perpendicular to the substrate. The anisotropic behavior results
   from relatively equiaxed nanograins nucleating at the growth front with
   little subsequent coarsening. Grains were observed to nucleate ahead of
   the growth front, suggesting a new mechanism for electrochemically
   driven growth across a substrate which depends on ionic surface
   adsorption ahead of the growth front. During electropolishing the
   dissolution of nickel tended to occur more isotropically. The film
   thinned relatively uniformly until certain regions displayed Rayleigh
   instabilities. At this point the film broke up and some regions
   coarsened rapidly and/or were subject to electromigration. (C) 2011 Acta

Abstract = {{The (1 1 4) twin growth in the austenitic regime in NiTi (B2 lattice) is
   characterized precisely at the atomistic scale. This twinning mode is
   consistent with experimental observations but has not been well
   understood despite its importance. Combined shears, shuffles and
   interface shifts operate in a complex way to generate the (1 1 4) twin.
   Pure shear on the (1 1 4) plane results in a ``pseudo-twin{''}, and
   interchange shuffles are necessary to convert this to a ``reflective{''}
   twin and render a lower energy state. Additional atomic shifts at the
   twin-matrix interfaces result in ``sharp{''} boundaries, further
   lowering the energy barriers. We established the energy barrier to be
   148 mJ m(-2) during (1 1 4){[}2 2 (1) over bar] twin boundary growth of
   four layers at a time. The entire potential energy surface and the mean
   energy path during twinning can be derived from our simulations,
   providing the required insight into the atomistic processes involved.

Pages = {{123-137}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Maximal margin based frameworks have emerged as a powerful tool for
   supervised learning. The extension of these ideas to the unsupervised
   case, however, is problematic since the underlying optimization entails
   a discrete component. In this paper, we first study the computational
   complexity of maximal hard margin clustering and show that the hard
   margin clustering problem can be precisely solved in O(n (d+2)) time
   where n is the number of the data points and d is the dimensionality of
   the input data. However, since it is well known that many datasets
   commonly `express' themselves primarily in far fewer dimensions, our
   interest is in evaluating if a careful use of dimensionality reduction
   can lead to practical and effective algorithms. We build upon these
   observations and propose a new algorithm that gradually increases the
   number of features used in the separation model in each iteration, and
   analyze the convergence properties of this scheme. We report on
   promising numerical experiments based on a `truncated' version of this
   approach. Our experiments indicate that for a variety of datasets, good
   solutions equivalent to those from other existing techniques can be
   obtained in significantly less time.}},

Abstract = {{Cell-based biohybrid actuators are integrated systems that use
   biological components including proteins and cells to power material
   components by converting chemical energy to mechanical energy. The
   latest progress in cell-based biohybrid actuators has been limited to
   rigid materials, such as silicon and PDMS, ranging in elastic moduli on
   the order of mega (10(6)) to giga (10(9)) Pascals. Recent reports in the
   literature have established a correlation between substrate rigidity and
   its influence on the contractile behavior of cardiomyocytes (A.J.
   Engler, C. Carag-Krieger, C.P. Johnson, M. Raab, H.Y. Tang and D.W.
   Speicher, et al., J. Cell Sci., 2008, 121(Pt 22), 3794-3802, P. Bajaj,
   X. Tang, T.A. Saif and R. Bashir, J. Biomed. Mater. Res., Part A, 2010,
   95(4), 1261-1269). This study explores the fabrication of a more
   compliant cantilever, similar to that of the native myocardium, with
   elasticity on the order of kilo (10(3)) Pascals. 3D stereolithographic
   technology, a layer-by-layer UV polymerizable rapid prototyping system,
   was used to rapidly fabricate multi-material cantilevers composed of
   poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and acrylic-PEG-collagen (PC)
   mixtures. The incorporation of acrylic-PEG-collagen into PEGDA-based
   materials enhanced cell adhesion, spreading, and organization without
   altering the ability to vary the elastic modulus through the molecular
   weight of PEGDA. Cardiomyocytes derived from neonatal rats were seeded
   on the cantilevers, and the resulting stresses and contractile forces
   were calculated using finite element simulations validated with
   classical beam equations. These cantilevers can be used as a mechanical
   sensor to measure the contractile forces of cardiomyocyte cell sheets,
   and as an early prototype for the design of optimal cell-based biohybrid
   actuators.}},

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of a system of coupled oscillators possessing strongly
   nonlinear stiffness and damping is examined. The system consists of a
   linear oscillator coupled to a strongly nonlinear, light attachment,
   where the nonlinear terms of the system are realized due to geometric
   effects. We show that the effects of nonlinear damping are far from
   being purely parasitic and introduce new dynamics when compared to the
   corresponding systems with linear damping. The dynamics is analyzed by
   performing a slow/fast decomposition leading to slow flows, which in
   turn are used to study transient instability caused by a bifurcation to
   1:3 resonance capture. In addition, a new dynamical phenomenon of
   continuous resonance scattering is observed that is both persistent and
   prevalent for the case of the nonlinearly damped system: For certain
   moderate excitations, the transient dynamics ``tracks{''} a manifold of
   impulsive orbits, in effect transitioning between multiple resonance
   captures over definitive frequency and energy ranges. Eventual
   bifurcation to 1:3 resonance capture generates the dynamic instability,
   which is manifested as a sudden burst of the response of the light
   attachment. Such instabilities that result in strong energy transfer
   indicate potential for various applications of nonlinear damping such as
   in vibration suppression and energy harvesting.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{182-195}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Design of optimal plans for environmental planning and management
   applications should ideally consider the multiple quantitative and
   qualitative criteria relevant to the problem. For example, in ground
   water monitoring design problems, qualitative criteria such as
   acceptable spatial extent and shape of the contaminant plume predicted
   from the monitored locations can be equally important as the typical
   quantitative criteria such as economic costs and contaminant prediction
   accuracy. Incorporation of qualitative criteria in the problem-solving
   process is typically done in one of two ways: (a) quantifying
   approximate representations of the qualitative criteria, which are then
   used as additional criteria during the optimization process, or (b)
   post-optimization analysis of designs by experts to evaluate the overall
   performance of the optimized designs with respect to the qualitative
   criteria. These approaches, however, may not adequately represent all of
   the relevant qualitative information that affect a human expert involved
   in design (e. g. engineers, stakeholders, regulators, etc.), and do not
   necessarily incorporate the effect of the expert's own learning process
   on the suitability of the final design. The Interactive Genetic
   Algorithm with Mixed Initiative Interaction (IGAMII) is a novel approach
   that addresses these limitations by using a collaborative human-computer
   search strategy to assist users in designing optimized solutions to
   their applications, while also learning about their problem. The
   algorithm adaptively learns from the expert's feedback, and explores
   multiple designs that meet her/his criteria using both the human expert
   and a simulated model of the expert's responses in a collaborative
   fashion. The algorithm provides an introspection-based learning
   framework for the human expert and uses the human's subjective
   confidence measures to adjust the optimization search process to the
   transient learning process of the user. This paper presents the design
   and testing of this computational framework, and the benefits of using
   this approach for solving groundwater monitoring design problems. (C)

Abstract = {{Microorganisms have become key components in many biotechnological
   processes to produce various chemicals and biofuels. The encapsulation
   of microbial cells in calcium cross-linked alginate gel beads has been
   extensively studied due to several advantages over using free cells.
   However, industrial use of alginate gel beads has been hampered by the
   low structural stability of the beads. In this study, we demonstrate
   that the incorporation of interpenetrating covalent cross-links in an
   ionically cross-linked alginate gel bead significantly enhances the
   bead's structural durability. The interpenetrating network (IPN) was
   prepared by first cross-linking alginate chemically modified with
   methacrylic groups, termed methacrylic alginate (MA), with calcium ions
   and subsequently conducting a photo cross-linking reaction. The
   resulting methacrylic alginate gel beads (IPN-MA) exhibited higher
   stiffness, ultimate strength and ultimate strain and also remained more
   stable in media either subjected to high shear or supplemented with
   chelating agents than calcium cross-linked alginate gel beads.
   Furthermore, yeast cells encapsulated in IPN-MA gel beads remained more
   metabolically active in ethanol production than those in calcium
   cross-linked alginate gel beads. Overall, the results of this study will
   be highly useful in designing encapsulation devices with improved
   structural durability for a broad array of prokaryotic and eukaryotic
   cells used in biochemical and industrial processes. Biotechnol. Bioeng.

Abstract = {{Relative humidity (RH) affects the liquid water content of an aerosol,
   altering its scattering and absorption of visible light, which is
   important for aerosol effects on visibility and climate. Particle light
   extinction, light scattering, and light absorption coefficient values
   are reported here for laboratory-generated inorganic and organic carbon
   (OC) aerosols at RH values between 8\% and 95\%. Light scattering was
   measured with a nephelometer, light extinction was measured with an
   extinction cell, and light absorption was determined on the basis of the
   difference between those two values at three visible wavelengths (467,
   530, and 660 nm). The instrumentation was benchmarked with nonabsorbing
   ammonium sulfate, absorbing polystyrene microspheres (PSMs) and nigrosin
   aerosol under controlled RH conditions. Agreement between dry measured
   scattering and extinction coefficients for ammonium sulfate was achieved
   within 3\%. Optical closure with modeled scattering values based on
   measured ammonium sulfate particle size distributions was achieved
   within 7\%. Measured single scattering albedo for dry absorbing PSMs
   agreed within 0.02 with the literature value. Light absorption by
   nigrosin increased by a factor of 1.24 +/- 0.06 at all wavelengths as RH
   increased from 38\% to 95\%. Light absorption of OC aerosol that was
   generated from wood pyrolysis demonstrated enhancements of 2.2 +/- 0.7
   and 2.7 +/- 1.2 between 32\% and 95\% RH at the wavelengths of 467 and
   530 nm, but no absorption was detected at 660 nm. A spectral dependence
   of light absorption by OC was observed with absorption increasing from
   530 nm towards the 467 nm wavelength, consistent with previously
   reported ex situ measurements of filter extracts. The increase in OC
   light absorption with RH is currently not represented in radiative
   transfer models even though biomass burning produces most of the primary
   OC aerosol in the atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Modal analysis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and nanocones
   (SWCNCs) was performed using a finite element method (FEM) with ANSYS.
   The vibrational behaviors of fixed beam and cantilever SWCNTs with
   different section types of a circle and an ellipse were modeled using
   three-dimensional elastic beams of carbon bonds and point masses. Also,
   the vibrational behaviors of fixed beam and cantilever SWCNCs with
   different disclination angles of 120, 180, and 240 were modeled using
   the same method. The beam element natural frequencies were calculated by
   considering the mechanical characteristics of the covalent bonds between
   the carbon atoms in the hexagonal lattice. Each mass element of the
   carbon atoms was assigned as a point mass at the nodes of the FEM
   elements. The natural frequencies of zigzag and armchair SWCNTs and
   SWCNCs were also computed. There were some differences between the
   findings obtained in this study and the molecular structural mechanics
   data available in the literature. The natural frequencies of SWCNCs were
   estimated depending on the geometrical type and disclination angle with
   different boundary conditions. The natural frequencies of the SWCNCs
   with disclination angles of 120, 180, and 240 increased significantly at
   higher modes of vibration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wall-diaphragm connections can affect overall seismic performance of
   older unreinforced masonry buildings, but there is little test data
   available about the structural behavior of such connections. Results are
   presented of an experimental study designed to evaluate the behavior of
   typical brick wall to wood joist/diaphragm connections. Tests were
   conducted on two different types of component specimens (with and
   without nailed strap anchors), using three different loading methods
   (static monotonic, as well as static and dynamic cyclic). Contributions
   of friction (activated at brick joist supports to represent gravity load
   normal force effects) and of strap anchor nails loaded in shear have
   been considered separately and together in the testing matrix. Force vs.
   displacement envelope and hysteresis curves have been developed from the
   experimental data. Also from these data, simplified average multi-linear
   plots derived from all the experiments can be compared based on
   different test specimen and loading types, leading to aggregate findings
   about various distinctive structural behaviors exhibited. These findings
   include typical strengths and failure modes, as well as stiffness and/or
   friction coefficient values as a function of displacement, for all the
   test specimens. Results obtained from these masonry connection tests can
   be used in numerical analyses of whole building systems. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Uniformly-sized preparations with average microbubble (MB) diameters
   from 1 to 7 mu m were produced reliably by sonicating
   decafluorobutane-saturated solutions of serum albumin and dextrose.
   Detailed protocols for producing and size-separating the MBs are
   presented, along with the effects that changing each production
   parameter (serum albumin concentration, sonication power, sonication
   time, etc.) had on MB size distribution and acoustic stability. These
   protocols can be used to produce MBs for experimental applications or
   serve as templates for developing new protocols that yield MBs with
   physical and acoustic properties better suited to specific applications.
   Size stability and ultrasonic performance quality control tests were
   developed to assure that successive MB preparations perform identically
   and to distinguish the physical and acoustic properties of identically
   sized MBs produced with different serum albumin-dextrose formulations
   and sonication parameters. MBs can be stored at 5 degrees C for
   protracted periods (2 weeks to one year depending on formulation). (C)

Title = {{Making combination vaccines more accessible to low-income countries: The

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Combination vaccines have become the preferred choice for immunizing
   children in high- and middle-income countries. However, these new
   vaccines are prohibitively expensive for low-income countries, causing
   them to rely on older, less-expensive vaccines. This product divergence
   decreases economies of scale for the purchase of vaccines and eliminates
   the financial incentive for manufacturers to maintain production of
   less-expensive vaccines or even to develop new vaccines for diseases
   affecting developing countries. This paper treats combination vaccines
   as bundles of antigens that can be priced as a single item. Such bundles
   are used to formulate an optimization problem that determines the
   combination vaccine allocation between vaccine producers and different
   countries under a price discrimination agreement. The objective of the
   optimization problem is to satisfy countries' antigen demand at the
   lowest possible price, while providing a reasonable profit for the
   vaccine producers. The optimization problem results in a mixed-integer
   non-linear programming model that maximizes the sum of manufacturing
   profits and the customer surplus, and hence, it maximizes the total
   social surplus. Moreover, a constructive heuristic is proposed to
   determine an approximation to the best allocation of combination
   vaccines and their range of feasible prices. Computational results show
   that vaccine prices in all market segments become more affordable as the
   supply of the most complex combination vaccines becomes more available
   to low-income countries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
