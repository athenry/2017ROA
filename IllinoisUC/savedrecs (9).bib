Abstract = {{Given a finite number of workers with constant success rates, the
   Sequential Stochastic Assignment problem (SSAP) assigns the workers to
   sequentially arriving tasks with independent and identically distributed
   reward values, so as to maximize the total expected reward. This article
   studies the SSAP, with some (or all) workers having random success rates
   that are assumed to be independent but not necessarily identically
   distributed. Several assignment policies are proposed to address
   different levels of uncertainty in the success rates. Specifically, if
   the probability density functions of the random success rates are known,
   an optimal mixed policy is provided. If only the expected values of
   these rates are known, an optimal expectation policy is derived.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber lasers are susceptible to a number of nonlinear and parasitic
   effects that can significantly inhibit performance. From a system
   perspective, requirements of a fiber laser may cover average or peak
   power, amplitude stability, and spectral content of the source.
   Nonlinear and parasitic phenomena, including Brillouin scattering, Raman
   scattering, mode stability, self-phase modulation, four-wave mixing in
   multi-wavelength lasers, etc. can each influence one or all of these
   performance characteristics. Conventionally, these system-limiting
   undesirables have been addressed with complex waveguide designs.
   However, each of these light-medium interactions can be described by
   material coefficients that lead to estimates of `threshold' values where
   these phenomena become significant. For example, this may be the
   Brillouin gain coefficient for Brillouin scattering, the nonlinear
   refractive index, n(2), for self-phase modulation, or the thermo-optic
   coefficient, dn/dT, for mode stability. Furthermore, these coefficients
   tend to be strong functions of the material, and surprisingly wide
   ranges of values exist between known material systems. For example, both
   the Pockels' photoelastic constant, p(12), and thermo-optic coefficient
   may be either positive or negative for a material. It follows logically
   that mixtures of materials with coefficients of opposing signs would
   then give rise to compositions where these coefficients may be zero.
   Example of such effect negation may include the barium aluminosilicate
   system for p(12) and the phosphosilicate or titanosilicate system for
   dn/dT. Compositional tailoring of the optical fiber is therefore
   suggested as an alternative means to suppressing these parasitics, and
   methods to do so will be discussed at the conference.}},

Abstract = {{An effective characterization of intercept-evasion confrontations in
   various space environments and a derivation of corresponding solutions
   considering a variety of real-world constraints are daunting theoretical
   and practical challenges. Current and future space-based platforms have
   to simultaneously operate as components of satellite formations and/or
   systems and at the same time, have a capability to evade potential
   collisions with other maneuver constrained space objects. In this
   article, we formulate and numerically approximate solutions of a Low
   Earth Orbit (LEO) intercept-maneuver problem in terms of game-theoretic
   capture-evasion guaranteed strategies. The space intercept-evasion
   approach is based on Liapunov methodology that has been successfully
   implemented in a number of air and ground based multi-player multi-goal
   game/control applications. The corresponding numerical algorithms are
   derived using computationally efficient and orbital propagator
   independent methods that are previously developed for Space Situational
   Awareness (SSA). This game theoretical but at the same time robust and
   practical approach is demonstrated on a realistic LEO scenario using
   existing Two Line Element (TLE) sets and Simplified General
   Perturbation-4 (SGP-4) propagator.}},

Abstract = {{Visual estimations of target attributes in a real-world environment are
   highly context-dependent when the estimations are provided by human
   observers. For example, the accuracy of an individual estimating the
   age, height, or weight of another person is dependent upon environmental
   (e.g., viewing distance), observer (e.g., age/height/weight), and target
   (e.g., clothing, gate) factors. Prior efforts have attempted to
   characterize the ability of humans to estimate attributes of other
   humans; however, these studies typically only present observers with
   static images in controlled settings. The present study instead
   characterizes observations of attributes made of a more dynamic, real
   world. Participants provide estimates of target individuals' ages,
   heights, and weights, along with other descriptive data, as they watched
   video recorded scenes of simulated, realistic security incidents.
   Results indicate the anchoring effect demonstrated in prior efforts may
   not be as prevalent under more ecologically-valid viewing conditions;
   however, individuals are still able to provide relatively accurate
   estimations of individuals' age, height, and weight, with minimal
   influence of the observers' own physical attributes.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{9917-9922}},
Abstract = {{The cloud overlap parameter alpha relates the combined cloud fraction
   between two altitude levels in a grid box to the cloud fraction as
   derived under the maximum and random overlap assumptions. In a number of
   published studies in this and other journals, it is found that alpha
   tends to increase with an increasing scale. In this Technical Note, we
   investigate this analytically by considering what happens to alpha when
   two grid boxes are merged to give a grid box with twice the area.
   Assuming that alpha depends only on scale, then between any two fixed
   altitudes, there will be a linear relationship between the values of
   alpha on the two scales. We illustrate this by finding the relationship
   when cloud cover fractions are assumed to be uniformly distributed, but
   with varying degrees of horizontal and vertical correlation. Based on
   this, we conclude that alpha increases with scale if its value is less
   than the vertical correlation coefficient in cloud fraction between the
   two altitude levels. This occurs when the clouds are deeper than would
   be expected at random (i.e. for exponentially distributed cloud depths).}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between atmospheric chemistry and ozone (O-3) in the
   upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) presents a major uncertainty
   in understanding the effects of aviation on climate. In this study, two
   configurations of the atmospheric model from the Community Earth System
   Model (CESM), Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry, Version 4
   (CAM4) and Version 5 (CAM5), are used to evaluate the effects of
   aircraft nitrogen oxide (NOx = NO+ NO2) emissions on ozone and the
   background chemistry in the UTLS. CAM4 and CAM5 simulations were both
   performed with extensive tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry
   including 133 species and 330 photochemical reactions. CAM5 includes
   direct and indirect aerosol effects on clouds using a modal aerosol
   module (MAM), whereby CAM4 uses a bulk aerosol module, which can only
   simulate the direct effect. To examine the accuracy of the aviation
   NOx-induced ozone distribution in the two models, results from the CAM5
   and CAM4 simulations are compared to ozonesonde data. Aviation NOx
   emissions for 2006 were obtained from the AEDT (Aviation Environmental
   Design Tool) global commercial aircraft emissions inventory. Differences
   between simulated O-3 concentrations and ozonesonde measurements
   averaged at representative levels in the troposphere and different
   regions are 13\% in CAM5 and 18\% in CAM4. Results show a localized
   increase in aviationinduced O-3 concentrations at aviation cruise
   altitudes that stretches from 40 degrees N to the North Pole. The
   results indicatea greater and more disperse production of aviation
   NOx-induced ozone in CAM5, with the annual tropospheric mean O-3
   perturbation of 1.2 ppb (2.4 \%) for CAM5 and 1.0 ppb (1.9 \%) for CAM4.
   The annual mean O-3 perturbation peaks at about 8.2 ppb (6.4 \%) and 8.8
   ppb (5.2 \%) in CAM5 and CAM4, respectively. Aviation emissions also
   result in increased hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations and methane
   (CH4) loss rates, reducing the tropospheric methane lifetime in CAM5 and
   CAM4 by 1.69 and 1.40 \%, respectively. Aviation NOx emissions are
   associated with an instantaneous change in global mean short-term O-3
   radiative forcing (RF) of 40.3 and 36.5mWm(-2) in CAM5 and CAM4,
   respectively.}},

   within collagen-GAG biomaterials}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE}},

Pages = {{1296-1304}},
Abstract = {{Strategies to integrate instructive biomolecular signals into a
   biomaterial are becoming increasingly complex and bioinspired. While a
   large majority of reports still use repeated treatments with soluble
   factors, this approach can be prohibitively costly and difficult to
   translate in vivo for applications where spatial control over signal
   presentation is necessary. Recent efforts have explored the use of
   covalent immobilization of biomolecules to the biomaterial, via both
   bulk (ubiquitous) as well as spatially-selective light-based
   crosslinking, as a means to both enhance stability and bioactivity.
   However, little is known about how processing conditions during
   immobilization impact the degree of unintended non-covalent
   interactions, or fouling, that takes place between the biomaterial and
   the biomolecule of interest. Here we demonstrate the impact of
   processing conditions for bulk carbodiimide (EDC) and
   photolithography-based benzophenone (BP) crosslinking on specific
   attachment vs. fouling of a model protein (concanavalin A, ConA) within
   collagen-glycosaminoglycan (CG) scaffolds. Collagen source significantly
   impacts the selectivity of biomolecule immobilization. EDC crosslinking
   intensity and ligand concentration significantly impacted selective
   immobilization. For benzophenone photoimmobilization we observed that
   increased UV exposure time leads to increased ConA immobilization.
   Immobilization efficiency for both EDC and BP strategies was maximal at
   physiological pH. Increasing ligand concentration during immobilization
   process led to enhanced immobilization for EDC chemistry, no impact on
   BP immobilization, but significant increases in non-specific fouling.
   Given recent efforts to covalently immobilize biomolecules to a
   biomaterial surface to enhance bioactivity, improved understanding of
   the impact of crosslinking conditions on selective attachment versus
   non-specific fouling will inform the design of instructive biomaterials
   for applications across tissue engineering.}},

Title = {{Modeling of thermocapillary flow to purify single-walled carbon
   nanotubes}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{80}},
Pages = {{42454-42461}},
Abstract = {{Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are of significant interest in
   the electronic materials research community due to their excellent
   electrical properties. The mixture of synthesized SWNTs, however,
   significantly hampers device performance, particularly for potential
   applications in digital electronics. Recent purification techniques
   involve successful and complete removal of metallic SWNTs from
   horizontal arrays by using thermocapillary flows in thin film resists
   initiated by selective Joule heating. In this paper, an analytical
   model, as well as a fully coupled thermo-mechanical-fluid finite element
   model, is developed to study the physics of thermocapillary flow in this
   context. A simple scaling law for the film thickness profile is
   established in terms of the geometry (e.g., film thickness), material
   (e.g., thermal conductivity and viscosity) and loading parameters (e.g.,
   power density). The results show that the normalized thickness profile
   only depends on three non-dimensional parameters in addition to the
   normalized position and normalized time. In particular, for the
   experimentally investigated system, the thickness profile only depends
   on a single non-dimensional parameter. These findings may serve as
   useful design guidelines for process optimization.}},

Title = {{Topside signature of medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances}},
Journal = {{ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{959-965}},
Abstract = {{Plasma blobs, localized plasma density enhancements that occur
   singularly or in periodic groups, have been observed by in situ sensors
   in the lower- and middle-latitude nighttime ionosphere. Traditionally,
   creation of blobs has been thought to be connected to equatorial plasma
   bubbles, which are localized plasma depletions. Here, we report the
   association of blobs with medium-scale traveling ionospheric
   disturbances (MSTIDs). On 17 January 2010, an all-sky imager on the
   Caribbean island of Bonaire (geographic: 12.190 degrees N, 68.244
   degrees W; geomagnetic 22.46 degrees N, 7.099 degrees E) observed a
   nighttime electrified MSTID propagating to the southwest. At the time of
   the MSTID's transit, the Coupled Ion-Neutral Dynamics Investigation
   instrument onboard the Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting
   System satellite detected a group of blobs along the same geomagnetic
   flux tubes. The electron density variations measured at the satellite
   altitude, indicating the blobs, are anticorrelated with the intensity
   variations of the 630.0 nm dissociative recombination emission measured
   on the same magnetic field lines. This relationship is explained by a
   modulation of the O+ profile altitude due to electric fields generated
   within the MSTID. This idea is supported by in situ measurements of the
   vertical ion velocity. We argue that common climatology between blobs
   and MSTIDs reported in the literature, as well as this coincident
   observation, suggest that blobs may be the in situ signature of MSTIDs
   in the topside ionosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Well-defined WO3 center dot H2O hollow spheres composed of nanoflakes
   were successfully synthesized by a template-free solvothermal process
   with i-PrOH-H2O mixture solvent. In this process, the tungsten precursor
   was firstly hydrolyzed to form solid spheres composed of both WO3 center
   dot 2H(2)O and WO3 center dot H2O phases. Then, these solid spheres
   underwent an Ostwald ripening process and the WO3 center dot 2H(2)O
   phase was dehydrated to WO3 center dot H2O at the same time to form
   hollow spheres with a pure WO3 center dot H2O phase. With appropriate
   calcination temperature, hollow spheres with WO3 (major) and WO3 center
   dot H2O (minor) mixture phases were created. These hollow spheres with
   WO3 and WO3 center dot H2O mixture phases demonstrated a largely
   enhanced photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation under visible light
   irradiation compared with either pure WO3 center dot H2O hollow spheres
   or pure WO3 hollow spheres which could be attributed to the matched band
   structure between the WO3 and WO3 center dot H2O phases. Thus, an
   effective charge carrier separation can occur between the WO3 and WO3
   center dot H2O phases of these hollow spheres under visible light
   irradiation, contributing to the observed largely enhanced
   photocatalytic performance.}},

   moisture estimation}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3095-3107}},
Abstract = {{Estimating soil moisture typically involves calibrating models to sparse
   networks of in situ sensors, which introduces considerable error in
   locations where sensors are not available. We address this issue by
   calibrating parameters of a parsimonious soil moisture model, which
   requires only antecedent precipitation information, at gauged locations
   and then extrapolating these values to ungauged locations via a
   hydroclimatic classification system. Fifteen sites within the Soil
   Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) containing multiyear time series data
   for precipitation and soil moisture are used to calibrate the model. By
   calibrating at 1 of these 15 sites and validating at another, we observe
   that the best results are obtained where calibration and validation
   occur within the same hydroclimatic class. Additionally, soil texture
   data are tested for their importance in improving predictions between
   calibration and validation sites. Results have the largest errors when
   calibration-validation pairs differ hydroclimatically and edaphically,
   improve when one of these two characteristics are aligned, and are
   strongest when the calibration and validation sites are
   hydroclimatically and edaphically similar. These findings indicate
   considerable promise for improving soil moisture estimation in ungauged
   locations by considering these similarities.}},

Title = {{Endogenous technological and population change under increasing water
   scarcity}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3239-3258}},
Abstract = {{Ancient civilizations may have dispersed or collapsed under extreme dry
   conditions. There are indications that the same may hold for modern
   societies. However, hydroclimatic change cannot be the sole predictor of
   the fate of contemporary societies in water-scarce regions. This paper
   focuses on technological change as a factor that may ameliorate the
   effects of increasing water scarcity and as such counter the effects of
   hydroclimatic changes. We study the role of technological change on the
   dynamics of coupled human-water systems, and model technological change
   as an endogenous process that depends on many factors intrinsic to
   coupled human-water dynamics. We do not treat technology as an exogenous
   random sequence of events, but assume that it results from societal
   actions.
   While the proposed model is a rather simple model of a coupled
   human-water system, it is shown to be capable of replicating patterns of
   technological, population, production and consumption per capita
   changes. The model demonstrates that technological change may indeed
   ameliorate the effects of increasing water scarcity, but typically it
   does so only to a certain extent. In general we find that endogenous
   technology change under increasing water scarcity helps to delay the
   peak of population size before it inevitably starts to decline. We also
   analyze the case when water remains constant over time and find that
   co-evolutionary trajectories can never grow at a constant rate; rather
   the rate itself grows with time. Thus our model does not predict a
   co-evolutionary trajectory of a socio-hydrological system where
   technological innovation harmoniously provides for a growing population.
   It allows either for an explosion or an eventual dispersal of
   population. The latter occurs only under increasing water scarcity. As a
   result, we draw the conclusion that declining consumption per capita
   despite technological advancement and increase in aggregate production
   may serve as a useful predictor of upcoming decline in contemporary
   societies in water-scarce basins.}},

Pages = {{999-1006}},
Abstract = {{Miscanthus is emerging as a promising feedstock for domestic biofuel
   production. However, inefficiencies of the machinery that is used for
   harvesting bioenergy crops such as miscanthus currently prohibit
   commercial production. The performance of a mower-conditioner used to
   harvest miscanthus was evaluated, and modifications to the disk head
   were made to allow the machine to operate more efficiently. It was also
   hypothesized that the harvest energy requirement of the
   mower-conditioner in miscanthus could be reduced by increasing the blade
   oblique angle. Blades with oblique angles of 20 degrees and 30 degrees
   were manufactured and fitted to the disk mower-conditioner. When
   combined with data collected from a real-time yield sensing system, the
   data collected regarding the machine performance resulted in
   point-specific and overall machine energy consumption information. The
   30 degrees oblique angle resulted in a 27\% reduction in the energy
   requirement, with an energy consumption of 13.5 MJ Mg-1 as compared to
   18.5 MJ Mg-1 for the conventional straight (0 degrees) blades. Further
   studies are needed to examine the overall life of the angled blades as
   well as the feasibility of their application to other crops harvested by
   disk mower-conditioners, such as hay and forage.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is leading to a disproportionately large warming in the
   high northern latitudes, but the magnitude and sign of the future carbon
   balance of the Arctic are highly uncertain. Using 40 terrestrial
   biosphere models for the Alaskan Arctic from four recent model
   intercomparison projects - NACP (North American Carbon Program) site and
   regional syntheses, TRENDY (Trends in net land atmosphere carbon
   exchanges), and WETCHIMP (Wetland and Wetland CH4 Inter-comparison of
   Models Project) - we provide a baseline of terrestrial carbon cycle
   uncertainty, defined as the multi-model standard deviation (sigma) for
   each quantity that follows. Mean annual absolute uncertainty was largest
   for soil carbon (14.0+/-9.2 kgCm(-2)), then gross primary production
   (GPP) (0.22+/-0.50 kgCm(-2) yr(-1)), ecosystem respiration (Re)
   (0.23+/-0.38 kgCm(-2) yr(-1)), net primary production (NPP) (0.14+/-0.33
   kgCm(-2) yr(-1)), autotrophic respiration (Ra) (0.09+/-0.20 kgCm(-2)
   yr(-1)), heterotrophic respiration (Rh) (0.14+/-0.20 kgCm(-2) yr(-1)),
   net ecosystem exchange (NEE) (-0.01+/-0.19 kgCm(-2) yr(-1)), and CH4
   flux (2.52+/-4.02 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)). There were no consistent spatial
   patterns in the larger Alaskan Arctic and boreal regional carbon stocks
   and fluxes, with some models showing NEE for Alaska as a strong carbon
   sink, others as a strong carbon source, while still others as carbon
   neutral. Finally, AmeriFlux data are used at two sites in the Alaskan
   Arctic to evaluate the regional patterns; observed seasonal NEE was
   captured within multi-model uncertainty. This assessment of carbon cycle
   uncertainties may be used as a baseline for the improvement of
   experimental and modeling activities, as well as a reference for future
   trajectories in carbon cycling with climate change in the Alaskan Arctic
   and larger boreal region.}},

Pages = {{F1124-F1131}},
Abstract = {{The electroreduction of CO2 to CO or other products is one approach to
   curb the rise in atmospheric CO2 levels and/or to store excess energy of
   renewable intermittent sources like solar and wind. To date most efforts
   have focused on improving cathode catalysis, despite other components
   such as the anode (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) also being of key
   importance. Here, we report that the dihydrate form of IrO2 as the anode
   catalyst in alkaline media can achieve onset cell potentials as low as
   -1.55 V with a cathode overpotential of only 0.02 V, partial current
   densities for CO as high as 250 mA cm(-2) (compared to similar to 130 mA
   cm(-2) with a Pt anode), and energy efficiencies as high as 70\%. The
   IrO2 non-hydrate proved to be much more durable by maintaining more than
   90\% of its activity after cycling the anode potential over the 0 to 1.0
   V vs. Ag/AgCl range for over 200 times, whereas the dihydrate lost most
   of its activity after 19 cycles. Possible causes for these differences
   are discussed. This work shows that improvements to the anode, so to the
   OER, can drastically improve the prospects of the electrochemical
   reduction of CO2 to useful chemicals. (c) 2014 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{This work addresses Byzantine vector consensus, wherein the input at
   each process is a d-dimensional vector of reals, and each process is
   required to decide on a decision vector that is in the convex hull of
   the input vectors at the fault-free processes {[}9,12]. The input vector
   at each process may also be viewed as a point in the d-dimensional
   Euclidean space R-d, where d > 0 is a finite integer. Recent work
   {[}9,12] has addressed Byzantine vector consensus, and presented
   algorithms with optimal fault tolerance in complete graphs. This paper
   considers Byzantine vector consensus in incomplete graphs using a
   restricted class of iterative algorithms that maintain only a small
   amount of memory across iterations. For such algorithms, we prove a
   necessary condition, and a sufficient condition, for the graphs to be
   able to solve the vector consensus problem iteratively. We present an
   iterative Byzantine vector consensus algorithm, and prove it correct
   under the sufficient condition. The necessary condition presented in
   this paper for vector consensus does not match with the sufficient
   condition for d > 1; thus, a weaker condition may potentially suffice
   for Byzantine vector consensus.}},

   surface-enhanced dropwise condensation against the background of earlier

   approaches has led to increased study of complex interfacial phenomena.
   In the heat transfer community, researchers have been extensively
   exploring the use of advanced surface structuring techniques to enhance
   phase-change heat transfer processes. In particular, the field of
   vapor-to-liquid condensation and especially that of water condensation
   has experienced a renaissance due to the promise of further optimizing
   this process at the micro-and nanoscale by exploiting advances in
   surface engineering developed over the last several decades.}},

Abstract = {{In this opinion piece, we discuss recent advances in experimental
   methods for characterizing phase change heat transfer. We begin with a
   survey of techniques for high-resolution measurements of temperature and
   heat flux at the solid surface and in the working fluid. Next, we focus
   on diagnostic tools for boiling heat transfer and describe techniques
   for visualizing the temperature and velocity fields, as well as
   measurements at the single bubble level. Finally, we discuss techniques
   to probe the kinetics of vapor formation within a few molecular layers
   of the interface. We conclude with our outlook for future progress in
   experimental methods for phase change heat transfer.}},

Abstract = {{A novel superparamagnetic Ag@silver-based salt photocatalyst,
   MFNs@SiO2@Ag4SiW12O40/Ag, was created, which demonstrated highly
   efficient photocatalytic performance under visible light illumination in
   both the degradation of methylene blue (MB) and the disinfection of
   Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. In this composite photocatalyst,
   well-dispersed, superparamagnetic magnesium ferrite nanoparticles (MFNs)
   were used as the core because of their easy magnetic separation
   capability. A passive SiO2 mid-layer was used to separate MFNs and
   Ag4SiW12O40 and form a strong bond with silver ions for their loading
   after -SH surface modification. The Ag4SiW12O40 layer was subsequently
   formed by the reaction with silicotungstic acid to avoid the commonly
   adopted calcination procedure after deposition/precipitation, and silver
   nanoparticles were formed on the surface of Ag4SiW12O40 layer after UV
   irradiation to further enhance their photocatalytic performance and
   stability under visible light illumination. The surface modification on
   the passive SiO2 mid-layer and the bridging procedure for material
   loading developed in our approach could be readily applied to other
   material systems for the creation of novel composite materials with
   various functions.}},

Abstract = {{Ensuring the quality and reproducibility of results from biofilm

   nitrifying biofilms grown on ultrafiltration membranes. Both rinse and
   storage affected biofilm structure, as suggested by their strong
   correlation with total biovolume, biofilm thickness, roughness and the
   spatial distribution of EPS. Significant variations in DNA yields and
   microbial community diversity were also observed among samples treated
   by different rinses, storage and DNA extraction methods. For the tested
   biofilms, two rinses, no storage and DNA extraction with both mechanical
   and chemical cell lysis from attached biofilm were the optimal sample
   preparation procedures for obtaining accurate information about biofilm

   method (BEM) can be reinterpreted with this theory. Moreoever, our

Title = {{Renewal theory-based life-cycle analysis of deteriorating engineering
   systems}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{94-102}},
Abstract = {{Engineering systems typically deteriorate due to regular use and
   exposure to harsh environment. Under such circumstances the owner of a
   system must take important decisions such as whether to repair, replace
   or abandon the system. Such decisions can affect the safety of, and the
   benefits to the users and the owner. Life-cycle analysis (LCA) provides
   a rational basis for such decision making process. In particular, LCA
   can provide helpful information on the performance of a system over its
   entire life-cycle, like its time-dependent reliability, the costs
   associated with its operation, and other quantities related to the
   service life of the system.
   This paper proposes a novel probabilistic formulation for LCA of
   deteriorating systems named Renewal Theory-based Life-cycle Analysis
   (RTLCA). The formulation includes equations to obtain important
   life-cycle variables such as the expected time lost in repairs, the
   reliability of the system and the cost of operation and failure. The
   proposed RTLCA formulation is based on renewal theory and proposes
   analytical solutions for the desired LCA variables using numerically
   solvable integral equations. As an illustration, the proposed RTLCA
   formulation is implemented to analyze the life-cycle of an example
   reinforced concrete (RC) bridge located in a seismic region. This
   analysis accounts for the accumulated seismic damage in the bridge
   columns caused by the earthquakes occurring during bridge's life-cycle.
   The analysis results provide valuable insight into the importance of
   seismic damage in a bridge's life-cycle performance and the strategies
   to operate a system in an optimal manner. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE SERBIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{79}},

Pages = {{881-895}},
Abstract = {{Effects of the initial ambient temperature on combustion and soot
   emission characteristics of diesel fuel were investigated through
   experiments conducted in an optical constant volume chamber and
   simulation using a phenomenological soot model. Four different initial
   ambient temperatures were adopted in this research: 1000, 900, 800 and
   700 K. In order to obtain a better prediction of soot behavior, the
   phenomenological soot model was revised to take into account the
   feedback of soot oxidation on the soot number density and good agreement
   was observed in the comparison of soot measurement and prediction. The
   results indicated that the ignition delay was prolonged with decreasing
   initial ambient temperature. The heat release rate demonstrated the
   transition from mixing controlled combustion at high ambient
   temperatures to the premixed combustion mode at low ambient
   temperatures. At lower ambient temperatures, soot formation and the
   oxidation mechanism were both suppressed. However, the soot mass
   concentration was finally reduced with decreasing initial ambient
   temperature. Although the drop in ambient temperature did not cool the
   mean in-cylinder temperature during the combustion, it did shrink the
   total area of local high equivalence ratios, in which soot usually is
   rapidly generated. At an initial ambient temperature of 700 K, soot
   emissions were almost negligible, which indicates that sootless
   combustion might be achieved under super low initial temperature
   operation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), displacement fields from shear
   waves are inverted to estimate underlying material properties. Modulus
   differences detected by MRE may be used to distinguish tumors or other
   localized pathology in tissue. The accuracy of modulus estimates depends
   on the choice of the assumed constitutive model, as well as on the
   inversion algorithm, image resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio. In
   particular, in simpler inversion methods such as direct inversion and
   three-dimensional local frequency estimation (3D-LFE) the constitutive
   model is minimal (linear, elastic or viscoelastic, and isotropic) and
   the simplifying assumption of local homogeneity is usually made. The
   assumption of local homogeneity is often inaccurate {[}1], since the
   shear wavelength is typically comparable to the size of the structures
   of interest. Notably, the residual error (in direct inversion) between
   the model and the experimental data increases sharply at the boundaries
   of inclusions, while the ``certainty{''} of the 3D-LFE estimate
   decreases. These error metrics may be used to detect local stiffness
   heterogeneity, as well as indicate variations in appropriate
   constitutive models. The utility of model uncertainty is demonstrated in
   simulations and with MRE data from a heterogeneous gel phantom.}},

Abstract = {{In detailed routing for integrated circuit (IC) designs, vias are
   usually randomly inserted in order to connect between different routing
   layers. In the 7 nm technology node and beyond, the wire pitch is below
   40 nm, and consequently, the vias become very dense, making via layer
   printing a challenging problem. Recently block copolymer directed
   self-assembly (DSA) technology has demonstrated great advantages for via
   layer patterning using guiding templates. To pattern vias with DSA
   process, guiding templates are usually printed first with conventional
   lithography, e.g., 193 nm immersion lithography (193i) that has a
   coarser pitch resolution. Then the guiding templates will guide the
   placement of the DSA patterns (e.g., vias) inside, and these patterns
   have a finer resolution than the templates. Different template shapes
   have different control on the overlay accuracy of the inside vias. By
   performing DSA experiments, the guiding templates can be classified as
   feasible and infeasible templates according to the overlay requirement
   of the technology node. The templates that meet the overlay requirement
   are feasible templates, and other templates are infeasible. Without
   considering the DSA template constraints in detailed routing, randomly
   distributed vias may require infeasible templates to be patterned, which
   makes the via layers incompatible with the DSA process. In this paper,
   we propose a DSA-aware detail routing algorithm to optimize the via
   layers such that only feasible templates are needed for via layer
   patterning. In addition, among all the feasible templates, the one with
   better overlay accuracy has higher priority to be picked up by the
   router for via patterning, which further improves the yield. By enabling
   DSA process for via layer patterning in the 7 nm technology node, the
   proposed detailed routing strategy tremendously reduces the
   manufacturing cost and improves the throughput for IC fabrication.}},

Abstract = {{At the 7 nm technology node, the contact layers of integrated circuits
   (IC) are too dense to be printed by single exposure lithography. Block
   copolymer directed self-assembly (DSA) has shown its advantage in
   contact/via patterning with high throughput and low cost. To pattern
   contacts with DSA, guiding templates are usually printed first with
   conventional lithography, e. g., 193 nm immersion lithography (193i)
   that has a coarser pitch resolution. Contact holes are then patterned
   with DSA process. The guiding templates play the role of controlling the
   DSA patterns inside, which have a finer resolution than the templates.
   The DSA contact pitch depends on the chemical property of block
   copolymer and it can be adjusted within a certain range under strong
   lateral confinement to deviate from the natural pitch. As a result,
   different patterns can be obtained through different parameters.
   Although the guiding template shapes can be arbitrary, the overlay
   accuracy of the contact holes patterned are different and largely depend
   on the templates. Thus, the guiding templates that have tolerable
   variations are considered as feasible, and those have large overlays are
   considered as infeasible. To pattern the contact layer in a layout with
   DSA technology, we must ensure that all the DSA templates in the layout
   are feasible. However, the original layout may not be designed in a
   DSA-friendly way. Moreover, the routing process may introduce contacts
   that can only be patterned by infeasible templates. In this paper, we
   propose an optimization algorithm that optimize the contact layer for
   DSA patterning in 1D standard cell design. In particular, the algorithm
   modifies the layout via wire permutation technique to redistribute the
   contacts such that the use of infeasible templates is avoided and the
   feasible patterns that with better overlay control are favored. The
   experimental result demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm in
   helping to reduce the design and manufacturing cost of a DSA-enabled
   process at 7 nm technology node.}},

Abstract = {{Dissemination of medical information using mobile phones is still in a
   nascent stage because of their limited features - lack of penetration of
   mobile internet, small screen size etc. We present the design of a drug
   QA system that could be used for providing information about medicines
   over short message service (SMS). We begin with a survey of the drug
   information domain and classify the drug related queries into a set of
   predefined classes. Our system uses several natural language processing
   tools coupled with machine learning classification techniques to process
   drug information related queries. We focus on developing a natural
   language interface allowing the user to be flexible in phrasing their
   queries and attain an accuracy of 81\% in classifying the drug related
   questions. We conclude that it is feasible and cheap to deploy such a
   system to encourage the practice of evidence based medicine.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic atomic-scale lattice-based numerical method based on the
   Exact Lattice First Passage Time method was developed for the simulation
   of the early stages of kinetically controlled electrochemical nucleation
   and growth. Electrochemical reaction and surface diffusion on a
   hexagonal lattice was accounted for in a pristine physical model system
   that included edge diffusion along steps, and movement over step edges
   with Ehrlich-Schwobel barrier. Five cases were investigated:
   homoexpitaxy, heteroepitaxy, multi-layer growth, terraces, and confined
   regions. For each, the influence of the physical parameters, deposition
   conditions, and system geometry on growth morphology was investigated.
   Simulation based studies of multilayer surface morphology were able to
   distinguish between layer-by-layer and island growth modes. On stepped
   terraces, parameter regions associated with he surface diffusion to
   deposition flux ratio (D/F) and the Ehrlich-Schwobel bather were
   identified under which deposition occurred either at the step edge or by
   nucleation and growth of islands on the terraces. The probability of
   growing single crystals in a small confined region was found to scale
   with D/F and the radius squared. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society.

   405 nm diode laser. By using the 2DISC method, we detected parallel

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic (PA) tomography imaging is an emerging, versatile, and
   noninvasive imaging modality, which combines the advantages of both
   optical imaging and ultrasound imaging. It opens up opportunities for
   noninvasive imaging of angiogenesis, a feature of skin pathologies
   including cancers and psoriasis. In this study, high-density copper
   oleate encapsulated within a phospholipid surfactant (CuNPs) generated a
   soft nanoparticle with PA contrast comparable to gold. Within the
   near-infrared window, the copper nanoparticles can provide a signal more
   than 7 times higher that of blood. alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin targeting of
   CuNPs in a Matrigel mouse model demonstrated prominent PA contrast
   enhancement of the neovasculature compared to mice given nontargeted or
   competitively inhibited CuNPs. Incorporation of a sn-2 lipase-labile
   fumagillin prodrug into the CuNPs produced marked antiangiogenesis in
   the same model, demonstrating the theranostic potential of a PA agent
   for the first time in vivo. With a PA signal comparable to gold-based
   nanoparticles yet a lower cost and demonstrated drug delivery potential,
   alpha(v)beta(3)-targeted CuNPs hold great promise for the management of
   skin pathologies with neovascular features.}},

Title = {{Use of Advanced Aggregate Imaging Systems to Evaluate Aggregate
   Resistance to Breakage, Abrasion, and Polishing}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2401}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Abstract = {{Aggregate gradation and shape properties are known to affect pavement
   mechanistic response and performance significantly. Under repeated
   traffic loading, aggregate particles in pavement courses are routinely
   subjected to degradation through attrition, impact, grinding, and
   polishing mechanisms, which alter their shape and size properties.
   Machine vision provides an objective and quantitative measurement of
   aggregate particle shape or morphological properties, including flatness
   and elongation, angularity, and surface texture. This paper focuses on
   the effectiveness of two advanced and validated aggregate imaging
   systems: an enhanced University of Illinois aggregate image analyzer
   (E-UIAIA) and a second-generation aggregate imaging system (AIMS-II) for
   capturing changes in shape and size properties of aggregate particles
   caused by breakage, abrasion, and polishing actions. The micro-Deval
   apparatus was used in the laboratory to evaluate field degradation and
   polishing resistance of 11 aggregate materials with different
   mineralogical properties, collected from throughout Illinois and
   neighboring states. More than 26,000 particles were scanned with both
   imaging systems at various time intervals, and changes in aggregate
   morphological indexes were recorded. Despite differences in image
   acquisition and processing capabilities, both E-UIAIA and AIMS-H
   successfully quantified changes in morphological properties of particles
   from the micro-Deval tests. However, AIMS-H more closely reflected
   historical data on aggregate frictional properties obtained by the
   Illinois Department of Transportation. The imaging results were used to
   develop regression-based statistical models for determining aggregate
   polishing and degradation trends by considering both rate and magnitude
   of changes in shape properties.}},

   Model for Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2401}},
Pages = {{11-21}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents findings from an ongoing research study at the
   University of Illinois that aims to develop and calibrate improved
   models for unbound aggregate rutting through laboratory characterization
   of aggregate materials used for unbound base and subbase applications in
   the state of North Carolina. Extensive triaxial laboratory testing was
   performed to establish a robust link between the number of load
   applications, stress levels, shear stress and sheer strength ratios, and
   permanent deformation responses. A framework was established for
   considering the strong correlation that commonly exists between
   permanent deformation and shear strength characteristics, as opposed to
   resilient modulus properties, in the laboratory characterization of the
   permanent deformation behavior of various types of aggregate materials.
   Trends of permanent strain accumulations from repeated load triaxial
   tests were adequately captured in a new rutting model whose development
   took into account the shear stresses applied at 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% of
   the shear strength properties of these materials under similar field
   loading confinement conditions. The research shows that this model is an
   improvement on the rutting damage model for unbound aggregate currently
   used in AASHTO's mechanistic empirical pavement design approach because
   it offers better material characterization and rutting prediction of the
   unbound base or subbase layer.}},

Abstract = {{It is increasingly acknowledged that, in order to sustainably manage
   global freshwater resources, it is critical that we better understand
   the nature of human-hydrology interactions at the broader catchment
   system scale. Yet to date, a generic conceptual framework for building
   models of catchment systems that include adequate representation of
   socioeconomic systems - and the dynamic feedbacks between human and
   natural systems - has remained elusive. In an attempt to work towards
   such a model, this paper outlines a generic framework for models of
   socio-hydrology applicable to agricultural catchments, made up of six
   key components that combine to form the coupled system dynamics: namely,
   catchment hydrology, population, economics, environment, socioeconomic
   sensitivity and collective response. The conceptual framework posits two
   novel constructs: (i) a composite socioeconomic driving variable, termed
   the Community Sensitivity state variable, which seeks to capture the
   perceived level of threat to a community's quality of life, and acts as
   a key link tying together one of the fundamental feedback loops of the
   coupled system, and (ii) a Behavioural Response variable as the
   observable feedback mechanism, which reflects land and water management
   decisions relevant to the hydrological context. The framework makes a
   further contribution through the introduction of three macroscale
   parameters that enable it to normalise for differences in climate,
   socioeconomic and political gradients across study sites. In this way,
   the framework provides for both macroscale contextual parameters, which
   allow for comparative studies to be undertaken, and catchment-specific
   conditions, by way of tailored ``closure relationships{''}, in order to
   ensure that site-specific and application-specific contexts of
   sociohydrologic problems can be accommodated. To demonstrate how such a
   framework would be applied, two socio-hydrological case studies, taken
   from the Australian experience, are presented and the parameterisation
   approach that would be taken in each case is discussed. Preliminary
   findings in the case studies lend support to the conceptual theories
   outlined in the framework. It is envisioned that the application of this
   framework across study sites and gradients will aid in developing our
   understanding of the fundamental interactions and feedbacks in such
   complex human-hydrology systems, and allow hydrologists to improve
   social-ecological systems modelling through better representation of
   human feedbacks on hydrological processes.}},

Abstract = {{Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a new modality that has strong
   potential in improving the sensitivity and specificity of breast mass
   detection. However, the detection of microcalcifications (MCs) in DBT is
   challenging because radiologists have to search for the often subtle
   signals in many slices. We are developing a computer-aided detection
   (CAD) system to assist radiologists in reading DBT. The system consists
   of four major steps, namely: image enhancement; pre-screening of MC
   candidates; false-positive (FP) reduction, and detection of MC cluster
   candidates of clinical interest. We propose an algorithm for reducing
   FPs by using 3D characteristics of MC clusters in DBT. The proposed
   method takes the MC candidates from the pre-screening step described in
   {[}14] as input, which are then iteratively clustered to provide
   training samples to a random-forest classifier and a rule-based
   classifier. The random-forest classifier is used to learn a
   discriminative model of MC clusters using 3D texture features, whereas
   the rule-based classifier revisits the initial training samples and
   enhances them by combining median filtering and graph-cut-based
   segmentation followed by thresholding on the final number of MCs
   belonging to the candidate cluster. The outputs of these two classifiers
   are combined according to the prediction confidence of the random-forest
   classifier. We evaluate the proposed FP-reduction algorithm on a data
   set of two-view DBT from 40 breasts with biopsy-proven MC clusters. The
   experimental results demonstrate a significant reduction in FP
   detections, with a final sensitivity of 92.2\% for an FP rate of 50\%.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{6289-6299}},
Abstract = {{A newly developed framework for quantifying aerosol particle diversity
   and mixing state based on information-theoretic entropy is applied for
   the first time to single particle mass spectrometry field data. Single
   particle mass fraction estimates for black carbon, organic aerosol,
   ammonium, nitrate and sulfate, derived using single particle mass
   spectrometer, aerosol mass spectrometer and multi-angle absorption
   photometer measurements are used to calculate single particle species
   diversity (D-i). The average single particle species diversity (D-alpha)
   is then related to the species diversity of the bulk population
   (D-gamma) to derive a mixing state index value (chi) at hourly
   resolution. The mixing state index is a single parameter representation
   of how internally/externally mixed a particle population is at a given
   time. The index describes a continuum, with values of 0 and 100\%
   representing fully external and internal mixing, respectively. This
   framework was applied to data collected as part of the MEGAPOLI winter
   campaign in Paris, France, 2010. D-i values are low (similar to 2) for
   fresh traffic and wood-burning particles that contain high mass
   fractions of black carbon and organic aerosol but low mass fractions of
   inorganic ions. Conversely, D-i values are higher (similar to 4) for
   aged carbonaceous particles containing similar mass fractions of black
   carbon, organic aerosol, ammonium, nitrate and sulfate. Aerosol in Paris
   is estimated to be 59\% internally mixed in the size range 150-1067 nm,
   and mixing state is dependent both upon time of day and air mass origin.
   Daytime primary emissions associated with vehicular traffic and
   wood-burning result in low chi values, while enhanced condensation of
   ammonium nitrate on existing particles at night leads to higher chi
   values. Advection of particles from continental Europe containing
   ammonium, nitrate and sulfate leads to increases in D-alpha, D-gamma and
   chi. The mixing state index represents a useful metric by which to
   compare and contrast ambient particle mixing state at other locations
   globally.}},

   Cord Injury Using Wheelchair Tilt-in-Space and Recline: Methodology and
   Preliminary Report}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the sensel
   window's location and size when calculating the peak pressure index
   (PPI) of pressure mapping with varying degrees of wheelchair
   tilt-in-space (tilt) and recline in people with spinal cord injury
   (SCI). Thirteen power wheelchair users were recruited into this study.
   Six combinations of wheelchair tilt (15 degrees, 25 degrees, and 35
   degrees) and recline (10 degrees and 30 degrees) were used by the
   participants in random order. Displacements of peak pressure and center
   of pressure were extracted from the left side of the mapping system.
   Normalized PPI was computed for three sensel window dimensions (3
   sensels x 3 sensels, 5 x 5, and 7 x 7). At least 3.33 cm of Euclidean
   displacement of peak pressures was observed in the tilt and recline. For
   every tilt angle, peak pressure displacement was not significantly
   different between 10 degrees and 30 degrees recline, while center of
   pressure displacement was significantly different (P < .05). For each
   recline angle, peak pressure displacement was not significantly
   different between pairs of 15 degrees, 25 degrees, and 35 degrees tilt,
   while center of pressure displacement was significantly different
   between 15 degrees versus 35 degrees and 25 degrees versus 35 degrees.
   Our study showed that peak pressure displacement occurs in response to
   wheelchair tilt and recline, suggesting that the selected sensel window
   locations used to calculate PPI should be adjusted during changes in
   wheelchair configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Cell behavior in vivo is guided by a complex microenvironment containing
   many different molecules including extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins,
   growth factors, and proteoglycans. Controlling the interaction between
   these various components at the cell-material interface will be
   invaluable in developing new materials for biomedical devices and tissue
   engineering applications. We report a single step approach to forming
   mixed peptide conjugated self-assembled monolayers on gold using
   copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition chemistry to study the
   combinatorial effects of different peptide ligands on cellular
   processes. We synthesized ECM adhesion peptides (YIGSR, GRGDS), a bone
   morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7) derived peptide (KPSSAPTQLN), and a
   heparin binding peptide (KRSR), and arrayed them, alone and in
   combination, onto gold coated coverslips. SAMs were characterized by
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry, and arrayed peptide
   combinations were seen to differentially bind to adipose derived stem
   cells (ADSCs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We further
   investigated the osteogenesis of ADSCs on SAMs containing combinations
   of adhesion peptide and BMP-7 peptide in both standard culture and
   osteogenic differentiation media. We demonstrate enhanced expression of
   osteogenic markers Runx2 and osteopontin when ADSCs are adherent to
   BMP-7 derived peptide alone or in combination with ECM adhesion
   peptides. The platform presented here enables immobilization of multiple
   peptides in a single step using a commercially available microarray
   spotter which will prove useful in fabricating biomolecule interfaces

Abstract = {{A key limitation of atomic force microscopy (AFM) is the size of the

   Cantilever arrays have the potential to increase the measurement area

   use of cantilever arrays is still not widespread. We report integration
   of an array of 30 individually addressable cantilevers into a commercial

   can measure nanometer-scale topography by tracking the cantilever heat
   flow. Parallel imaging with this AFM array can acquire an image of size
   0.510 mm x 0.425 mm, much larger than typical AFM images. We acquired a
   9.05 million-pixel image in 256 seconds at a cantilever scan speed of
   226 mu m s(-1) with noise-limited vertical resolution of 1.21 nm and

   formation and microscopic growth) and macroscopic crack growth.
   Synergistic complexity of combined stress and stress concentration has
   been evaluated in a limited number of studies. Available experimental
   evidence suggests the current life estimation and fatigue damage
   analysis techniques commonly used may not be capable of accurate
   predictions for such complex and yet highly practical conditions. This
   paper investigates notched fatigue behavior under multiaxial loads using
   aluminum alloys. Many effects involved in such loading conditions are
   included. These include the effects of stress state (axial, torsion,
   combined axial-torsion), geometry condition (smooth versus notched), and
   damage evolution stage (nucleation and micro-crack growth versus long
   crack growth).}},

Title = {{Coupled Structural-Acoustic Response of a Duct-Mounted Elastic Plate
   with Grazing Flow}},
Journal = {{AIAA JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{An analytical solution for the fully coupled structural-acoustic
   response of a thin elastic plate mounted in a rectangular duct assuming
   linear dynamics is presented. The plate is subjected to harmonic planar
   acoustic waves at grazing incidence in the presence of a subsonic
   uniform mean flow in the duct. Both clamped and simply supported plates
   are considered. Regimes are identified in which the structural-acoustic
   coupling plays a significant role on the response of the plate. Four
   metrics characterizing the coupled response are considered: the
   deviation of the peak response frequency from the in vacuo natural
   frequency of plate, the amplitude of the peak response, the effective
   acoustic damping of the plate, and the plate intermodal coupling through
   the duct acoustic field. For a typical aerospace structure, the
   plate-fluid coupling does little to change the fundamental vibration
   frequencies from their in vacuo values but significantly alters the
   amplitudes of the plate vibration. This is a result of the acoustic
   radiation being a strong function of the in-duct flow Mach number
   M-infinity. Further, the intermodal coupling through the acoustic field
   is also a strong function of M-infinity. Therefore, reduced-order models
   relying on the panel's in vacuo modes require Mach-number-dependent
   coupling coefficients for accurate predictions.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the evolution of ship-emitted aerosol particles
   using the stochastic particle-resolved model PartMC-MOSAIC (Particle
   Monte Carlo model-Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and
   Chemistry). Comparisons of our results with observations from the
   QUANTIFY (Quantifying the Climate Impact of Global and European
   Transport Systems) study in 2007 in the English Channel and the Gulf of
   Biscay showed that the model was able to reproduce the observed
   evolution of total number concentration and the vanishing of the
   nucleation mode consisting of sulfate particles. Further process
   analysis revealed that during the first hour after emission, dilution
   reduced the total number concentration by four orders of magnitude,
   while coagulation reduced it by an additional order of magnitude.
   Neglecting coagulation resulted in an overprediction of more than one
   order of magnitude in the number concentration of particles smaller than
   40 nm at a plume age of 100 s. Coagulation also significantly altered
   the mixing state of the particles, leading to a continuum of internal
   mixtures of sulfate and black carbon. The impact on cloud condensation
   nuclei (CCN) concentrations depended on the supersaturation threshold S
   at which CCN activity was evaluated. For the base case conditions,
   characterized by a low formation rate of secondary aerosol species,
   neglecting coagulation, but simulating condensation, led to an
   underestimation of CCN concentrations of about 37\% for S = 0.3\% at the
   end of the 14-h simulation. In contrast, for supersaturations higher
   than 0.7\%, neglecting coagulation resulted in an overestimation of CCN
   concentration, about 75\% for S = 1\%. For S lower than 0.2\% the
   differences between simulations including coagulation and neglecting
   coagulation were negligible. Neglecting condensation, but simulating
   coagulation did not impact the CCN concentrations below 0.2\% and
   resulted in an underestimation of CCN concentrations for larger
   supersaturations, e.g., 18\% for S = 0.6\%. We also explored the role of
   nucleation for the CCN concentrations in the ship plume. For the base
   case the impact of nucleation on CCN concentrations was limited, but for
   a sensitivity case with higher formation rates of secondary aerosol over
   several hours, the CCN concentrations increased by an order of magnitude
   for supersaturation thresholds above 0.3\%.}},

Title = {{Global emission projections for the transportation sector using dynamic
   technology modeling}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{5709-5733}},
Abstract = {{In this study, global emissions of gases and particles from the
   transportation sector are projected from the year 2010 to 2050. The
   Speciated Pollutant Emission Wizard (SPEW)-Trend model, a dynamic model
   that links the emitter population to its emission characteristics, is
   used to project emissions from on-road vehicles and non-road engines.
   Unlike previous models of global emission estimates, SPEW-Trend
   incorporates considerable detail on the technology stock and builds
   explicit relationships between socioeconomic drivers and technological
   changes, such that the vehicle fleet and the vehicle technology shares
   change dynamically in response to economic development. Emissions from
   shipping, aviation, and rail are estimated based on other studies so
   that the final results encompass the entire transportation sector. The
   emission projections are driven by four commonly-used IPCC
   (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) scenarios (A1B, A2, B1, and
   B2). With global fossil-fuel use (oil and coal) in the transportation
   sector in the range of 128-171 EJ across the four scenarios, global
   emissions are projected to be 101-138 Tg of carbon monoxide (CO), 44-54
   Tg of nitrogen oxides (NOx), 14-18 Tg of non-methane total hydrocarbons
   (THC), and 3.6-4.4 Tg of particulate matter (PM) in the year 2030. At
   the global level, a common feature of the emission scenarios is a
   projected decline in emissions during the first one or two decades
   (2010-2030), because the effects of stringent emission standards offset
   the growth in fuel use. Emissions increase slightly in some scenarios
   after 2030, because of the fast growth of on-road vehicles with lax or
   no emission standards in Africa and increasing emissions from non-road
   gasoline engines and shipping. On-road vehicles and non-road engines
   contribute the most to global CO and THC emissions, while on-road
   vehicles and shipping contribute the most to NOx and PM emissions. At
   the regional level, Latin America and East Asia are the two largest
   contributors to global CO and THC emissions in the year 2010; this
   dominance shifts to Africa and South Asia in the future. By the year
   2050, for CO and THC emissions, non-road engines contribute the greatest
   fraction in Asia and the former USSR, while on-road vehicles make the
   largest contribution in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East; for
   NOx and PM emissions, shipping controls the trend in most regions. These
   forecasts include a formal treatment of the factors that drive
   technology choices in the global vehicle sector and therefore represent
   a robust and plausible projection of what future emissions may be. These
   results have important implications for emissions of gases and aerosols
   that influence air quality, human health, and climate change.}},

   bubbles in a microfluidic channel}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{2428-2436}},
Abstract = {{We studied the dissolution dynamics of CO2 gas bubbles in a microfluidic
   channel, both experimentally and theoretically. In the experiments,
   spherical CO2 bubbles in a flow of a solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate
   (SDS) first shrink rapidly before attaining an equilibrium size. In the
   rapid dissolution regime, the time to obtain a new equilibrium is 30 ms
   regardless of SDS concentration, and the equilibrium radius achieved
   varies with the SDS concentration. To explain the lack of complete
   dissolution, we interpret the results by considering the effects of
   other gases (O-2, N-2) that are already dissolved in the aqueous phase,
   and we develop a multicomponent dissolution model that includes the
   effect of surface tension and the liquid pressure drop along the
   channel. Solutions of the model for a stationary gas bubble show good
   agreement with the experimental results, which lead to our conclusion
   that the equilibrium regime is obtained by gas exchange between the
   bubbles and liquid phase. Also, our observations from experiments and
   model calculations suggest that SDS molecules on the gas-liquid
   interface form a diffusion barrier, which controls the dissolution
   behaviour and the eventual equilibrium radius of the bubble.}},

Journal = {{PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{2297-2317}},
Abstract = {{High-temperature shape memory alloy NiTiHf holds considerable promise
   for structural applications. An important consideration for these
   advanced alloys is the determination of the magnitude of the twinning
   stress. Theoretical stresses for twinning and dislocation slip in NiTiHf
   martensites are determined. The slip and twinning planes are (0 0 1) and
   (0 1 1) for monoclinic and orthorhombic crystals, respectively. The
   determination of the slip and twinning stress is achieved with a
   proposed Peierls-Nabarro-based formulation informed with atomistic
   simulations. In the case of the twin, multiple dislocations comprising
   the twin nucleus are considered. The overall energy expression is
   minimized to obtain the twinning and slip stresses. The magnitude of the
   predicted twinning stresses is lower than slip stresses which explains
   why the NiTiHf alloys can undergo reversibility without plastic
   deformation. In fact, the predicted critical resolved shear stress
   levels of 433 MPa for slip and 236 MPa for twinning in the case of
   12.5\% Hf agree very well with the experimental measurements. The high
   slip resistance confirms that these materials can be very attractive in
   load-bearing applications.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic energy as a form of physical energy has drawn the interests of
   both industry and scientific communities for its potential use as a food
   processing and preservation tool. Currently, most such applications deal
   with ultrasonic waves with relatively high intensities and acoustic
   power densities and are performed mostly in liquids. In this review, we
   briefly discuss the fundamentals of power ultrasound. We then summarize
   the physical and chemical effects of power ultrasound treatments based
   on the actions of acoustic cavitation and by looking into several
   ultrasound-assisted unit operations. Finally, we examine the biological
   effects of ultrasonication by focusing on its interactions with the
   miniature biological systems present in foods, i.e., microorganisms and
   food enzymes, as well as with selected macrobiological components.}},

Abstract = {{The process of echo-signal demodulation within the display stage of
   ultrasonic image formation discards signal phase. It has long been
   hypothesized that demodulation could be eliminating important clinical
   task information but the tools to study this effect were not developed.
   We have now developed a task-energy analysis to show how signal energy
   flows through different stages of image formation. In this paper, we
   show how traditional display-stage processing eliminates high
   spatial-frequency task information, and how simple methods can recover
   the loss for improved diagnostic performance. We also study the
   improvement in detecting breast microcalcifications using the proposed
   method.}},

   This allows to propose an efficient numerical scheme based on Fourier
   transform to compute the internal stress field, for a given spatial
   distribution of dislocations and applied macroscopic stress. This
   numerical implementation is assessed by comparison with analytical
   solutions for homogeneous as well as heterogeneous elastic media. A
   particular insight is given to the critical case of stress-free

Journal = {{PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE}},

Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{1816-1840}},
Abstract = {{We establish an overall energy expression to determine the twin
   migration stress in bcc metals. Twin migration succeeds twin nucleation
   often after a load drop, and a model to establish twin migration stress
   is of paramount importance. We compute the planar fault energy barriers
   and determine the elastic energies of twinning dislocations including
   the role of residual dislocations (b(r)) and twin intersection types
   such as < 1 1 0 >, < 1 1 3 > and < 2 1 0 >. The energy expression
   derived provides the twin migration stress in relation to the twin
   nucleation stress with a ratio of 0.5-0.8 depending on the resultant
   residual burgers vector and the intersection types. Utilizing digital
   image correlation, it was possible to differentiate the twin nucleation
   and twin advancement events experimentally, and transmission electron
   microscopy observations provided further support to the modelling
   efforts. Overall, the methodology developed provides an enhanced
   understanding of twin progression in bcc metals, and most importantly
   the proposed model does not rely on empirical constants. We utilize
   Fe-50at.\%Cr in our experiments, and subsequently predict the twin
   migration stress for pure Fe, and Fe-3at.\%V from the literature showing
   excellent agreement with experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Our knowledge base involving the biochemical participants of epigenetic
   control has expanded greatly over the last decade. The role of
   epigenetic marks to DNA and histones controlled by non-coding RNAs is
   one of the most intensely studied areas of biology today. This review
   covers many of themechanisms that non-coding RNAs and other molecules
   use to control gene expression and eventually affect responses to the
   environment. In the first part of the review, we discuss the array of
   covalent modifications to the genome that constitute the epigenome,
   which consists of the histone variants, covalent modifications, and
   post-translational modifications that result in gene expression changes.
   How the histone variants and post-translationalmodifications including,
   acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination and
   sumoylation help form the epigenome is also summarized. Our eventual
   understanding of how the environment controls these modifications will
   open incredible opportunities in agriculture, medicine and the
   development of practical tools for biology. In the second part of this
   review we discuss the growing list of environmentally-mediated
   epigenetic-modifications, and examples of transgenerational epigenetic
   inheritance events, that may begin to change our views of adaptive
   responses to the environment and evolution.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{1204-1222}},
Abstract = {{The negative energy balance of wastewater treatment could be reversed if
   anaerobic technologies were implemented for organic carbon oxidation and
   phototrophic technologies were utilized for nutrient recovery. To
   characterize the potential for energy positive wastewater treatment by
   anaerobic and phototrophic biotechnologies we performed a comprehensive
   literature review and analysis, focusing on energy production (as kJ per
   capita per day and as kJ m(-3) of wastewater treated), energy
   consumption, and treatment efficacy. Anaerobic technologies included in
   this review were the anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR), anaerobic membrane
   bioreactor (AnMBR), anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFB), upflow
   anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB), anaerobic sequencing batch reactor
   (ASBR), microbial electrolysis cell (MEC), and microbial fuel cell
   (MFC). Phototrophic technologies included were the high rate algal pond
   (HRAP), photobioreactor (PBR), stirred tank reactor, waste stabilization
   pond (WSP), and algal turf scrubber (ATS). Average energy recovery
   efficiencies for anaerobic technologies ranged from 1.6\% (MFC) to
   47.5\% (ABR). When including typical percent chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) removals by each technology, this range would equate to roughly
   40-1200 kJ per capita per day or 110-3300 kJ m(-3) of treated
   wastewater. The average bioenergy feedstock production by phototrophic
   technologies ranged from 1200-4700 kJ per capita per day or 3400-13 000
   kJ m(-3) (exceeding anaerobic technologies and, at times, the energetic
   content of the influent organic carbon), with usable energy production
   dependent upon downstream conversion to fuels. Energy consumption
   analysis showed that energy positive anaerobic wastewater treatment by
   emerging technologies would require significant reductions of parasitic
   losses from mechanical mixing and gas sparging. Technology targets and
   critical barriers for energy-producing technologies are identified, and
   the role of integrated anaerobic and phototrophic bioprocesses in energy
   positive wastewater management is discussed.}},

Title = {{Facile synthesis of Rh-Pd alloy nanodendrites as highly active and
   durable electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{7012-7018}},
Abstract = {{In addition to activity, durability of Pd-based catalysts in a highly
   corrosive medium has become one of the most important barriers to limit
   their industrial applications such as low-temperature fuel cell
   technologies. Here, Rh with a unique capability to resist against
   oxidation etching was incorporated into Pd-based catalysts to enhance
   both their activity and durability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).
   This idea was achieved through the synthesis of the Rh-Pd alloy
   nanodendrites by co-reducing Rh and Pd salt precursors in oleylamine
   (OAm) containing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). In this
   synthesis, Rh-Pd alloy nanostructures with Rh-Pd atomic ratios from 19 :
   1 to 1 : 4 were generated by varying the molar ratios of Rh and Pd salt
   precursors. Interestingly, this variation of the molar ratios of the
   precursors from Rh rich to Pd rich would lead to the shape evolution of
   Rh-Pd alloy from dendritic nanostructures to spherical aggregations. We
   found that Br- ions derived from CTAB were also indispensible to the
   production of Rh-Pd alloy nanodendrites. Owing to the addition of highly
   stable Rh as well as the radical structure with a large number of
   low-coordinated sites on the arms, Rh-Pd alloy nanodendrites with a
   Rh-Pd atomic ratio of 4 : 1 (Rh80Pd20) exhibited a substantially
   enhanced electrocatalytic performance towards ORR with a 5\% loss of
   mass activity during the accelerated stability test for 10 000 cycles
   compared to similar to 50\% loss of the commercial Pt/C (E-TEK).}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution tomography is of great importance to many areas of
   biomedical imaging, but with it comes several apparent tradeoffs such as
   a narrowing depth-of-field and increasing optical aberrations.
   Overcoming these challenges has attracted many hardware and
   computational solutions. Hardware solutions, though, can become bulky or
   expensive and computational approaches can require high computing power
   or large processing times. This study demonstrates memory efficient
   implementations of interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM)
   and computational adaptive optics (CAO) - two computational approaches
   for overcoming the depth-of-field limitation and the effect of optical
   aberrations in optical coherence tomography (OCT). Traditionally
   requiring lengthy post processing, here we report implementations of
   ISAM and CAO on a single GPU for real-time in vivo imaging. Real-time,
   camera-limited ISAM processing enabled reliable acquisition of stable
   data for in vivo imaging, and CAO processing on the same GPU is shown to
   quickly correct static aberrations. These algorithmic advances hold the
   promise for high-resolution volumetric imaging in time-sensitive
   situations as well as enabling aberration-free cellular-level volumetric
   tomography.}},

Abstract = {{Bone-marrow (BM)-derived cells have been shown to be capable of aiding
   skin regeneration in vivo by differentiating into keratinocytes.
   However, the conditions under which this occurs are not fully
   understood. Characterizing innate mechanisms of skin regeneration by
   stem cells in vivo is important for the area of stem cell biology. In
   this study, we investigate the use of novel in vivo imaging technology
   for characterizing the contribution of BM-derived cells to regeneration
   of the epidermis in mouse skin in vivo. In vivo imaging provides the
   ability to non-invasively observe the spatial positions and morphology
   of the BM-derived cells. Using a GFP BM-transplanted mouse model and in
   vivo multimodal microscopy, BM-derived cells can be observed in the
   skin. Our in vivo imaging method was used to search for the presence and
   identify the 3D spatial distribution of BM-derived cells in the
   epidermis of the skin under normal conditions, following wound healing,
   and after syngeneic skin grafting. We did not observe any evidence of
   BM-derived keratinocytes under these conditions, but we did observe
   BM-derived dendritic cells in the skin grafts. In vivo multimodal
   imaging has great potential for characterizing the conditions under
   which BM-derived cells contribute to skin regeneration. ((c) 2014

Title = {{Automated Diagnostics and Visualization of Potential Energy Performance
   Problems in Existing Buildings Using Energy Performance Augmented

Abstract = {{Quick and reliable identification of energy performance problems in
   buildings is a critical step in improving their efficiency. The current
   practice of building diagnostics typically involves nonintrusive data
   collection using thermal cameras. This requires large amounts of
   unordered and nongeo-tagged two-dimensional (2D) imagery to be manually
   analyzed at a later stage, which makes the analysis time-consuming and
   labor-intensive. Because of the absence of a benchmark for energy
   performance, identification of performance problems also heavily relies
   on the auditor's knowledge, and consequently may lead to subjective and
   error-prone inspections. As a step towards rapid and objective
   identification of performance problems, this paper presents a new method
   for automated analysis and visualization of deviations between
   buildings' actual and simulated energy performances. The proposed method
   is based on the recently developed energy performance augmented reality
   (EPAR) environments. In the EPAR modeling method, actual and expected
   three-dimensional (3D) spatio-thermal models are generated and
   superimposed in a common 3D virtual environment. The method leverages
   unordered collections of thermal and digital imagery for actual energy
   performance modeling, in addition to computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   analysis for expected energy performance simulation. Based on the EPAR
   models which store actual and simulated thermal values at the level of
   3D points, two new algorithms are developed to facilitate identification
   of potential performance problems: (1)3D thermal mesh modeling using k-d
   trees and nearest-neighbor searching to automate calculation of
   temperature deviations, and (2)automated visualization of performance
   deviations using a metaphor based on traffic light colors. The proposed
   modeling method is validated on several interior locations of
   instructional and residential buildings. Empirical observations show
   that automated analysis using EPAR models enables performance deviations
   to be rapidly and accurately measured. The visualization of deviations
   in three dimensions enables auditors to easily identify potential
   performance problems and, in turn, enables auditors to focus more on
   other important tasks of analyzing retrofit alternatives.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Numerous ecofeedback systems have been built around the proven principle
   that providing feedback to individuals about their energy use can lead
   to increased conservation through behavior change. This paper presents a
   novel ecofeedback system called Watt's Watts, which is designed to
   leverage the impacts of individual and social feedback to influence
   energy consumption behavior. Watt's Watts is one of the first
   ecofeedback systems that integrates individual-level, near-real-time
   energy consumption feedback within a social network environment and
   simultaneously collects network data that can be used to quantify social
   network effects on energy consumption. It was designed around two main
   goals: (1)to create a hardware/software integrated system that maximizes
   potential energy savings through behavior-based energy use reduction in
   residential buildings; (2)to collect data that will allow the validation
   of the user interface design and the examination of how social network
   dynamics impact energy consumption behavior. The objective of this paper
   is to introduce the concepts driving the design of the front and back
   ends of the novel Watt's Watts system to inform the design and
   development of future socially oriented ecofeedback systems. It explains
   the principles that directly informed the design of the system's
   interface, the methods by which the system's design is validated in
   numerous studies, how the back end system design enabled the robust
   analysis undertaken in the validation studies, and the future research
   avenues enabled by the development of this system.}},

Abstract = {{Based on Fano resonance principles in photonic crystals, high
   performance broadband reflectors can be realized with 100\% reflection.
   Applying an innovative magnetic field guided metal-assisted chemical
   etching (MacEtch) process, we report here high performance membrane
   reflectors on SOI with controlled sidewall etching and high reflection
   around 1550 nm. This work represents the first demonstration of
   magnetically guided MacEtch (h-MacEtch) of periodic arrays of discrete
   nanoholes of sub-micron dimensions. Such an innovative process can lead
   to facile formation of large area 2D and 3D nanoscale-structures, for
   high performance photonic crystal membrane reflectors, filters, and

Abstract = {{Metal-cavity submonolayer (SML) quantum-dot (QD) microlasers are
   demonstrated at room temperature under continuous-wave electrical
   injection for 2-mu m-radius devices and pulsed operation for 0.5-mu
   m-radius devices. Compared to our previous quantum well devices, the
   superior optical properties of SML QDs provide the possibility for
   further size reduction. Size-dependent lasing characteristics are
   extracted from measurements to investigate the device physics for future
   size reduction. An optical cavity model using the transfer matrix and
   the effective index method including metal dispersion is developed and
   used for both the design and the experimental results analysis. The
   laser uses an active region consisting of three groups of SML QDs, and
   each group consists of 10 stacks of 0.5-monolayer InAs QD layers. The
   cylindrical microcavity is formed by hybrid metal-distributed Bragg
   reflectors (DBRs) mirrors with an optimized SiNx passivation layer on
   the sidewall to reduce the metal loss and to avoid the leakage current.
   The transverse optical modes are solved using the Maxwell equations, and
   the resonance condition is determined by round-trip phase matching.
   Vertically-correlated QDs are modeled as quantum disks, and the wave
   functions and eigenenergies in both conduction and valance bands are
   solved from Schrodinger equation. Carrier-dependent material gain is
   calculated using Fermi's golden rule and included in the model. The
   lasing wavelengths, quality factors, and confinement factors for cavity
   modes are the inputs for the rate-equation model, which predicts the
   light output power vs. current behavior and has shown excellent
   agreement with experiments. Size-dependent physical quantities such as
   leakage current and spontaneous emission coupling factor are extracted
   and investigated. Further size reduction using only four pairs of DBRs
   is proposed.}},

Pages = {{1059-1067}},
Abstract = {{Steel pedestals have been proposed to elevate bridge decks to reduce the
   likelihood of collisions of overheight vehicles. However, the use of
   steel pedestals might also increase the bridge vulnerability to seismic
   events. This paper develops a formulation for decision analysis for
   elevating bridges with steel pedestals. The formulation accounts for the
   expected life-cycle costs (LCCs) associated with vehicular impacts to
   bridge decks and seismic events. The optimum height of the steel
   pedestals is then obtained by minimising the total expected costs. The
   expected LCC associated with a bridge retrofitted with the optimum
   pedestal height is compared with that of the same bridge before the
   installation of the steel pedestals to determine whether elevating the
   bridge with steel pedestals is justifiable. The proposed framework is
   applied on a typical two-span slab-on-girder bridge at different
   locations in the USA.}},

Title = {{SENSING MISCANTHUS SWATH VOLUME FOR MAXIMIZING BALER THROUGHPUT RATE}},
Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{355-362}},
Abstract = {{The cost of harvesting is one of the constraints in improving biofuel
   economics. Adjusting the ground speed of harvesting machines to maximize
   their throughput rate in relation to yield level is one of the ways to
   reduce harvesting cost. To control the ground speed of a baler, a
   real-time sensor that can predict the swathed-biomass yield in front of
   the baler would be an invaluable tool. It was hypothesized that the
   swathed-biomass volume is a reliable predictor of the swathed-biomass
   yield. A light detection and ranging (LIDAR) based sensing system was
   developed to sense swathed-biomass volume and was field tested. To
   correlate the sensed swathed-biomass volume with the Miscanthus yield, a
   new bale-specific method was developed. A linear correlation (R-2 =
   0.76) was found between Miscanthus yield and sensed swathed-biomass
   volume at the time of mowing-conditioning. Yield maps were generated
   using the developed correlation model. The model was also used to
   predict the harvested plot biomass. The average percent error in
   predicting the harvested plot biomass was 12.4\% for training plots and
   10.1\% for validation plots. The analysis revealed that a proper control
   strategy to maximize the baler throughput rate would be to either
   operate the large square baler at the maximum feasible ground speed (6
   km h(-1)) or at the maximum achievable throughput rate (35 Mg h(-1)).
   For the specific case analyzed, the proposed control strategy would
   result in the following advantages: 38.0\% higher field capacity, 35.6\%
   higher throughput rate, and 30.4\% lower baling cost. Further studies
   and field evaluation of the proposed control strategy are needed.
   Studies are also needed to extend the swathed-biomass volume sensing
   concept to corn stover, other energy grasses, and forage crops.}},

Abstract = {{Sudden death syndrome (SDS), caused by the fungus Fusarium virguliforme,
   is a widespread mid- to late-season soybean disease with distinctive
   foliar symptoms that in some extreme cases may cause nearly 100\% yield

   method to quantify SDS severity using an RGB camera under natural light
   in a laboratory environment. An HSI (hue, saturation, and intensity)
   color space based image processing approach was developed. A lesion
   index (LI) was defined as the ratio of affected leaf area to healthy
   area for evaluating SDS severity levels on leaves of infected plants. A
   method of using the frequency distribution of hue values of whole leaf
   area to measure the severity of SDS was also investigated. Preliminary
   results obtained from laboratory-scale validation demonstrated that the
   developed method could provide a feasible means of recording SDS
   severity in situ that could potentially be used for high-throughput
   greenhouse evaluation of breeding lines or commercial soybean cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{Model based iterative reconstruction algorithms are capable of
   reconstructing high-quality images from low-dose CT measurements. The
   performance of these algorithms is dependent on the ability of a signal
   model to characterize signals of interest. Recent work has shown the
   promise of signal models that are learned directly from data. We propose
   a new method for low-dose tomographic reconstruction by combining
   adaptive sparsifying transform regularization within a statistically
   weighted constrained optimization problem. The new formulation removes
   the need to tune a regularization parameter. We propose an algorithm to
   solve this optimization problem, based on the Alternating Direction
   Method of Multipliers and FISTA proximal gradient algorithm. Numerical
   experiments on the FORBILD head phantom illustrate the utility of the
   new formulation and show that adaptive sparsifying transform
   regularization outperforms competing dictionary learning methods at
   speeds rivaling total-variation regularization.}},

Abstract = {{The mature furfural industry mostly under-utilizes its cellulose-rich
   solids as a boiler fuel. In this paper, a new sugarcane bagasse
   biorefinery concept was studied using switchable butadiene sulfone in
   the presence of water (BSW) to pretreat the solid residues after
   production of furfural followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulose
   fraction for potential production of biofuels. Butadiene sulfone is a
   solvent that is inexpensive, easily recyclable, with low toxicity, and
   effective as a biomass pretreatment agent under mild conditions,
   characteristics that make BSW a greener pretreatment alternative. In
   this biorefinery concept, hemicellulose (xylan) in sugarcane bagasse was
   converted in a batch reactor to furfural via dilute sulfuric acid
   catalysis at 170 degrees C and 180 degrees C for 10 min. The furfural
   yields were comparable to industrial batch production, achieving 38\%
   and 50\% of the theoretical yield at 170 degrees C and 180 degrees C,
   respectively. Under these conditions, unwanted humins (pseudo-lignin)
   formed mostly from xylan and were observed by an increase in the total
   lignin composition. The mild BSW pretreatment at 110 degrees C for 3 h
   solubilized 21.6\% to 27.9\% of the solids consistent with the removal
   of 38.6\% and 32.5\% of the total lignin prior to enzymatic hydrolysis.}},

Title = {{Socio-hydrologic perspectives of the co-evolution of humans and water in
   the Tarim River basin, Western China: the Taiji-Tire model}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a historical socio-hydrological analysis of the
   Tarim River basin (TRB), Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, in Western
   China, from the time of the opening of the Silk Road to the present. The
   analysis is aimed at exploring the historical co-evolution of coupled
   human-water systems and at identifying common patterns or organizing
   principles underpinning socio-hydrological systems (SHS). As a
   self-organized entity, the evolution of the human-water system in the
   Tarim Basin reached stable states for long periods of time, but then was
   punctuated by sudden shifts due to internal or external disturbances. In
   this study, we discuss three stable periods (i.e., natural, human
   exploitation, and degradation and recovery) and the transitions in
   between during the past 2000 years. During the ``natural{''} stage that
   existed pre-18th century, with small-scale human society and sound
   environment, evolution of the SHS was mainly driven by natural
   environmental changes such as river channel migration and climate
   change. During the human exploitation stage, especially in the 19th and
   20th centuries, it experienced rapid population growth, massive land
   reclamation and fast socio-economic development, and humans became the
   principal players of system evolution. By the 1970s, the Tarim Basin had
   evolved into a new regime with a vulnerable eco-hydrological system
   seemingly populated beyond its carrying capacity, and a human society
   that began to suffer from serious water shortages, land salinization and
   desertification. With intensified deterioration of river health and
   increased recognition of unsustainability of traditional development
   patterns, human intervention and recovery measures have since been
   adopted. As a result, the basin has shown a reverse regime shift towards
   some healing of the environmental damage. Based on our analysis within
   TRB and a common theory of social development, four general types of
   SHSs are defined according to their characteristic spatio-temporal
   variations of historical co-evolution, including primitive agricultural,
   traditional agricultural, industrial agricultural, and urban SHSs. These
   co-evolutionary changes have been explained in the paper in terms of the
   Taiji-Tire model, a refinement of a special concept in Chinese
   philosophy, relating to the co-evolution of a system because of
   interactions among its components.}},

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{5162-5171}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate an approach for detection, identification, and kinetic
   monitoring of drugs flowing within tubing, through the use of a
   plasmonic nanodome array (PNA) surface. The PNA structures are
   fabricated using a low-cost nanoreplica molding process upon a flexible
   plastic substrate that is subsequently integrated with a flow cell that
   connects in series with ordinary intravenous (IV) drug delivery tubing.
   To investigate the potential clinical applications for point-of-care
   detection and real-time monitoring, we perform SERS detection of ten
   pharmaceutical compounds (hydrocodone, levorphanol, morphine, oxycodone,
   methadone, phenobarbital, dopamine, diltiazem, promethazine, and
   mitoxantrone). We demonstrate dose-dependent SERS signal magnitude,
   resulting in detection limits (ng ml(-1)) well below typical
   administered dosages (mg ml(-1)). Further, we show that the detected
   drugs are not permanently attached to the PNA surface, and thus our
   approach is capable of performing continuous monitoring of drug delivery
   as materials flow through IV tubing that is connected in series with the
   sensor. Finally, we demonstrate the potential co-detection of multiple
   drugs when they are mixed together, and show excellent reproducibility
   and stability of SERS measurements for periods extending at least five
   days. The capabilities reported here demonstrate the potential to use
   PNA SERS surfaces for enhancing the safety of IV drug delivery.}},

Pages = {{16958-16967}},
Abstract = {{Biofuels derived from biomass conversion have the potential to mitigate
   the problems caused by over-exploitation of fossil fuels in recent
   decades. In this work, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, a fast-growing and
   low-lipid microalga species, was converted into bio-crude oils via a
   hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process. Response surface methodology
   (RSM) was applied to investigate the effects of operating conditions
   including reaction temperature, retention time and total solid ratio of
   feedstock on bio-crude oil yield and quality. A higher heating value
   (HHV), carbon recovery (CR) and nitrogen recovery (NR) were used as
   indicators of bio-crude quality. Reaction temperature was found to be
   the most influential factor affecting the yield and quality of bio-crude
   oils. Compared with the bio-crude oil sample obtained at boundary
   conditions (260 degrees C, 30 min, 35 wt\%), the bio-crude oils at two
   optimized operating conditions (280 degrees C, 60 min, 35 wt\%; 300
   degrees C, 60 min, 25 wt\%) were observed to have higher yields (43.26\%
   and 39.55\% versus 25.65\%), higher HHV (34.21 MJ kg(-1) and 36.51 MJ
   kg(-1) versus 30.59 MJ kg(-1)), higher carbon recovery (72.18\% and
   68.18\% versus 61.22\%) and slightly lower nitrogen recovery (33.15\%
   and 33.28\% versus 35.88\%). TGA, FT-IR, GC-MS and NMR analysis
   indicated that the optimized bio-crude oils were observed to have higher
   boiling point distributions (250- 500 degrees C), a higher percentage of
   aliphatic functional groups (63-67\%), a certain percentage of
   heteroatomic functionalities (21- 26\%) and a lower percentage of
   aromatic groups (1.5- 3.3\%).}},

   Part I. Measurements and Modeling of Two-phase Flow}},
Journal = {{ISIJ INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Unstable mold flow could induce surface velocity and level fluctuations,
   and entrain slag, leading to surface defects during continuous casting
   of steel. Both argon gas injection and Electro-Magnetic Braking (EMBr)
   greatly affect transient mold flow and stability. Part I of this
   two-part article investigates transient flow of steel and argon in the
   nozzle and mold during nominally steady-state casting using both plant
   measurements and computational modeling. Nail board dipping measurements
   are employed to quantify transient surface level, surface velocity, flow
   direction, and slag depth. Transient flow in the nozzle and strand is
   modeled using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) coupled with the Lagrangian
   Discrete Phase Model (DPM) for argon gas injection. The surface level of
   the molten steel fluctuates due to sloshing and shows greater
   fluctuations near the nozzle. The slag level fluctuates with time
   according to the lifting force of the molten steel motion below. Surface
   flow shows a classic double roll pattern with transient cross-flow
   between the Inside Radius (IR) and the Outside Radius (OR), and varies
   with fluctuations up to similar to 50\% of the average velocity
   magnitude. The LES results suggest that these transient phenomena at the
   surface are induced by up-and-down jet wobbling caused by transient
   swirl in the slide-gate nozzle. The jet wobbling influences transient
   argon gas distribution and the location of jet impingement on the Narrow
   Face (NF), resulting in variations of surface level and velocity. A
   power-spectrum analysis of the predicted jet velocity revealed strong
   peaks at several characteristic frequencies from 0.5-2 Hz (0.5-2 sec).}},

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{Plant measurements and computational models of transient flow with and
   without electromagnetic fields are applied to investigate transient
   phenomena in the nozzle and mold region during nominallysteady steel
   slab casting. In Part II of this two-part article, the effect of
   applying a static magnetic field on stabilizing the transient flow is
   investigated by modeling a double-ruler Electro-Magnetic Braking (EMBr)
   system, under conditions where measurements were obtained. A Reynolds
   Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computational model using the standard
   k-epsilon model is employed with a magnetic field distribution
   extrapolated from measurements. The magnetic field decreases velocity
   fluctuations and deflects the jet flow downward in the mold, resulting
   in a flatter surface level and slower surface flow with slightly better
   stability. The effect of EMBr on surface level and surface velocity,
   including the effect of the real conducting steel shell, falls between
   the cases assuming perfectly-conducting and insulating walls.
   Measurements using an eddy current sensor and nail boards were performed
   to quantify the effect of EMBr on level and velocity at the mold
   surface. Power spectrum analysis of the surface level variations
   measured by the sensor revealed a frequency peak at similar to 0.03 Hz
   (similar to 35 seconds) both with and without the EMBr. With EMBr, the
   surface level is more stable, with lower amplitude fluctuations, and
   higher frequency sloshing. The EMBr also produced similar to 20\% lower
   surface velocity, with similar to 60\% less velocity variations.
   Finally, the motion of the slag-steel interface level causes mainly
   lifting rather than displacement of the molten slag layer, especially
   near the SEN.}},

   pipiens mosquito, were tested. The spirochaetes were grown in BSK-H
   Complete liquid medium. The optimal in vitro growth temperature of the
   strain was 33 degrees C. Strain BR91 was sensitive to trimethoprim,
   nalidixic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and tolerated phosphomycin. The strain
   produced acid and alkaline phosphatase, esterase (C4), esterase-lipase
   (C8), leucine arylamidase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase and
   a-fucosidase. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
   (SDS-PAGE) assay revealed several major proteins in the size range of
   13-16 kDa, 22-30 kDa and 37-131 kDa. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME)
   analysis showed that C-14:0, C-16:0, C-18:1 omega 9c and summed feature
   5(C-18:2 omega 6,9c and/or C18:0 anteiso) are major fatty acids. This
   study highlights certain phenotypic differences between strain BR91 and
   the Lyme disease spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi, and supports the
   hypothesis that strain BR91 represents a unique taxonomical entity in a
   system of spirochaetal species. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{We report anisotropic expansion of self-assembled colloidal
   polystyrene-poly(dimethylsiloxane) crystals and its impact on the phonon

   achieved by a multistep infiltration-polymerization process. Such a
   process expands the interplanar lattice distance 17\% after 8 cycles
   whereas the in-plane distance remains unaffected. The variation of
   hypersonic phonon band structure induced by the anisotropic lattice
   expansion was recorded by Brillouin measurements. In the sample before
   expansion, a phononic band gap between 3.7 and 4.4 GHz is observed;
   after 17\% structural expansion, the gap is shifted to a lower frequency
   between 3.5 and 4.0 GHz. This study offers a facile approach to control
   the macroscopic structure of colloidal crystals with great potential in

   multivariate analysis of Raman spectra}},
Journal = {{ANALYST}},

Volume = {{139}},

Pages = {{2177-2185}},
Abstract = {{The cellular and matrix cues that induce stem cell differentiation into
   distinct cell lineages must be identified to permit the ex vivo
   expansion of desired cell populations for clinical applications.
   Combinatorial biomaterials enable screening multiple different
   microenvironments while using small numbers of rare stem cells. New
   methods to identify the phenotypes of individual cells in cocultures
   with location specificity would increase the efficiency and throughput
   of these screening platforms. Here, we demonstrate that partial
   least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models of calibration Raman
   spectra from cells in pure cultures can be used to identify the lineages
   of individual cells in more complex culture environments. The
   calibration Raman spectra were collected from individual cells of four
   different lineages, and a PLS-DA model that captured the Raman spectral
   profiles characteristic of each cell line was created. The application
   of these models to Raman spectra from test sets of cells indicated
   individual, fixed and living cells in separate monocultures, as well as
   those in more complex culture environments, such as cocultures, could be
   identified with low error. Cells from populations with very similar
   biochemistries could also be identified with high accuracy. We show that
   these identifications are based on reproducible cell-related spectral
   features, and not spectral contributions from the culture environment.
   This work demonstrates that PLS-DA of Raman spectra acquired from pure
   monocultures provides an objective, noninvasive, and label-free approach
   for accurately identifying the lineages of individual, living cells in
   more complex coculture environments.}},

Abstract = {{We report a method to control the surface morphology of thin copper
   films during growth by chemical vapor deposition from the precursor
   Cu(hfac) VTMS. A molecular inhibitor - an additive that modifies the
   surface attachment kinetics but does not decompose and contribute
   impurity atoms to the film - is added during the nucleation and/or
   growth stages of the film. Here we show that the reaction by-product
   VTMS can serve as such an inhibitor. If the inhibitor is added during
   the nucleation stage, when bare substrate surface is still exposed, the
   inhibitor greatly reduces the rate of coalescence and promotes the
   formation of a large density of uniformly-sized copper islands.
   Alternatively, if the film is allowed to nucleate in the absence of the
   inhibitor, subsequent addition of the inhibitor leads to a continuous
   copper film that is remarkably smooth on the nm scale. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{This article focuses on estimation of four soil fertility variables
   including K, OM, p1, and pH using collocated cokriging by combining soil
   sample data and aerial hyperspectral imagery. A soil fertility map is a
   key component in precision farming practices using variable rate
   technologies. The common approach for soil fertility mapping is
   univariate spatial interpolation based on soil sample data. Another
   potential approach is reflectance-based method using remotely sensed
   images. Both methods use soil sample and image data separately. On the
   other hand, cokriging estimators provide a way to combine the two data
   sets for improving soil fertility estimation. Compared to cokriging,
   collocated cokriging does not require the calculation of a large number
   of unstable cross variograms between soil fertility variables and
   spectral variables from image data. In addition, the aerial
   hyperspectral image provides soil surface reflectance information with
   fine spatial and spectral details. In this study, one hyperspectral
   image band was selected for each soil fertility variable based on the
   correlation between the soil fertility variables and the image bands.
   For comparison, a traditional regression modeling was also conducted
   Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients and root mean square
   errors (RMSE) between the estimated and observed values were calculated
   The results showed that although only moderate correlations between the
   soil fertility variables and hyperspectral image bands were obtained,
   the collocated cokriging led to accurate estimates of four soil
   fertility variables. Compared to the regression modeling, the collocated
   cokriging increased the correlation by 7\% to 105\% and decreased the
   RMSE by 7\% to 41\% depending on the soil fertility variable.}},

Title = {{Agronomic and Stream Nitrate Load Responses to Incentives for Bioenergy
   Crop Cultivation and Reductions of Carbon Emissions and Fertilizer Use}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Excessive nitrate loads in surface waters are a major cause of hypoxia
   and eutrophication. In many places, agriculture is the single largest
   source of nitrogen entering receiving waters. Perennial energy grass
   crops have the potential to reduce nitrogen loads from agricultural
   areas, while sequestering carbon and offering new economic opportunities
   for farmers. This study analyzes farm system-scale cropping and
   fertilizer application decisions, and resulting nitrate loads, as driven
   by prices for the bioenergy crop miscanthus, as well as investigates
   reductions of carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen
   fertilizer use. An economic model of farm-system-scale decisions is
   coupled to a hydrologic-agronomic model of the physical stream system to
   obtain nitrate loading and crop yield results for varying combinations
   of prices and policies for a typical Midwestern agricultural watershed.
   For the scenarios examined, a large reduction in stream nitrate load
   depends on a high price for miscanthus relative to competing crops. A
   price for miscanthus that exceeds 50\% of the average of corn and
   soybean prices, per unit weight, is estimated to lead to nitrate load
   reductions of 25\% or more. Though significant, these reductions are
   still less than the recommended 45\% reduction in stream nitrogen flux
   entering the Gulf of Mexico needed to mitigate the hypoxia problem in
   the gulf. Miscanthus prices are unlikely ever to reach such levels.
   However, nitrate load reductions could still be achieved by implementing
   a nitrogen fertilizer reduction subsidy alongside a miscanthus market.
   The results also show that carbon trading is unlikely to result in any
   significant reduction in nitrate load. The results are useful for
   improving understanding of the potential of these incentives,
   individually and concurrently, to reduce pollution from Midwestern crop
   agriculture.}},

   is analyzed. The novel part of the approach is in the choice of weights
   that are used to construct the averages. Through the use of these
   weighted averages, we show that the known optimal rates can be obtained
   with simpler algorithms than those currently existing in the literature.
   Specifically, by suitably choosing the stepsize values, one can obtain
   the rate of the order 1/k for strongly convex functions, and the rate
   1/root k for general convex functions (not necessarily differentiable).
   Furthermore, for the latter case, it is shown that a stochastic
   subgradient mirror-descent with iterate averaging converges (along a
   subsequence) to an optimal solution, almost surely, even with the
   stepsize of the form 1/root 1 + k, which was not previously known. The
   stepsize choices that achieve the best rates are those proposed by Tseng
   for acceleration of proximal gradient methods {[}P. Tseng, SIAM J.

Abstract = {{One of the reasons for relatively high biomass harvesting cost is
   challenges in adjusting the ground speed of harvesting machines with
   respect to the yield level within a field A real-time biomass yield
   sensor that can predict the yield in front of a machine could be a
   useful tool to control ground speed. It was hypothesized that the force
   required to bend Miscanthus stems is a reliable predictor of biomass
   yield. Based on this novel concept, a stem bending force-sensing system
   was developed and field tested with a disk mower-conditioner A
   bale-specific method, segmenting the field area from which a bale was
   formed, was developed to correlate sensed bending force and Miscanthus
   yield The measured bending force showed a logarithmic relationship (R-2
   = 0.80) with Miscanthus yield The average error in predicting
   bale-specific yield was 10.3\% for training data and 12.9\% for
   validation data. The average error in predicting plot yield was 3.4\%
   for training plots and 10.0\% for validation plots. Using the developed
   logarithmic correlation model, yield maps were also generated For the
   specific case analyzed, a proper control strategy to maximize throughput
   rate (mass per unit time) would be to either operate the
   mower-conditioner at the maximum feasible ground speed (9 km h(-1)) or
   at the maximum achievable throughput rate (60 Mg h(-1)). The
   yield-sensor controlled machine would result in 44.2\% higher field
   capacity, 41.3\% higher throughput rate, and 31.2\% lower
   mowing-conditioning cost for the specific case analyzed compared to the
   operator-controlled machine. Studies are needed to extend the stem
   bending force-sensing concept to other thick-stemmed crop harvesting
   machines, such as sugarcane harvesters and coppice harvesters.}},

Abstract = {{A Microsoft Excel facilitated SuperPro model was developed to analyze
   the economy of scale of biomass refineries. Economic analysis, using the
   model, showed that the unit ethanol production cost (UEPC) of fuel
   ethanol is affected by the bulk density of the feedstock, transportation
   cost coefficients, and producer incentives. The UEPC decreases as the
   feedstock bulk density increases. The UEPC is more sensitive to variable
   cost (VC) than fixed cost (FC), and incentives can attract more
   producers to participate in a contract program but will increase the
   UEPC. The bulk density and transportation cost coefficients have
   significant impacts on the optimal plant size of biorefineries. Producer
   incentives do not have an effect on the economy of scale for refineries
   since the optimal plant size is constant no matter how much incentive is

Abstract = {{The Fan Assessment Numeration System (FANS), developed by the USDA-ARS
   Southern Poultry Research Laboratory and refined at the University of
   Kentucky, has become a useful tool to measure airflow of agricultural
   ventilation fans in situ. However, procedures for using FANS for in situ
   ventilation fan performance have not been standardized. A common
   practice for changing the static pressure inside tunnel-ventilated
   animal housing during fan tests is to energize other fans, although
   little is known about the effects of adjacent operating fans on FANS
   test results. Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of the position
   of various operating fans relative to the FANS unit and test fan. Tests
   were conducted for ten 1.22 m diameter fans of two different models in
   two types of poultry barns in which fans were installed either
   immediately next to each other or 1.6 m apart. The effect of the FANS
   unit placement at both the intake and discharge sides of the tested fans
   was also evaluated. Airflow values obtained for different FANS unit
   placement and operating fan combinations at constant static pressure
   differed by as much as 12.6\% +/- 4.4\% compared to the control
   configuration with the FANS placed on the intake side of the sidewall
   fans. In contrast, placing the FANS unit on the fan discharge provided
   valid fan test results compared with the (inside) control configuration.}},

   SPRAYING SLIGHTLY ACIDIC ELECTROLYZED WATER IN AN EXPERIMENTAL AVIARY

Abstract = {{Compared to conventional cage laying-hen houses, aviary hen houses
   generally have much higher concentrations of airborne dust and bacteria
   due to generation of bioaerosols by the hens' access to and activities
   on the litter floor. Hence, reducing these airborne agents is important
   to safeguard the health of the animals and workers in such housing
   systems. Spraying slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) is a novel
   approach to reducing airborne culturable bacteria (CB) and particulate
   matter (PM) levels in hen houses. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate the efficacy of reducing airborne CB and PM in an experimental
   aviary chamber by periodic spraying of SAEW (Trt), as compared to no
   spraying (Ctrl(ns)) or spraying of tap water (Ctrl(w)). The hens were
   provided 16 h light and 8 h dark (lights on at 6:00 h and off at 22:00
   h) and were given access to the litter floor from 12:00 h to 22:00 h.
   The Trt regimen sprayed SAEW at 14:00 h for 15 min at a dosage of 80 mL
   m(-2); the Ctrl(ns) regimen had no spraying; and the Ctrl(w) regimen
   sprayed tap water following the same procedure as with Trt
   Concentrations of airborne CB and PM in six aerodynamic size ranges
   (0.65-1.1, 1.1-2.1, 2.1-3.3, 3.3-4.7, 4.7-7.1, and >7.1 mu m) were
   measured at 1.5 m above the floor in the center of the room during the
   periods of 13:45-14:00 h and 14:45-15:00 h. Compared to Ctrl(ns),
   spraying SAEW significantly reduced airborne CB (>2.1 mu m) by up to
   49\% +/- 10\% (p < 0.05), while Ctrl(w) did not show a reduction effect.
   No significant difference was found between Trt and Ctrl(w) in reducing
   airborne PM, although both reduced or tended to suppress PM >7.1 mu m in
   size. The results show that spraying SAEW can inactivate airborne CB
   attached to PM Thus, this is a promising technique for alleviating the
   adverse health impacts of bioaerosols in aviary laying-hen housing
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The core concepts, or threads, of biosystems engineering (BSEN) are
   variously understood by those within the discipline but have never been
   unequivocally defined due to BSEN's early stage of development. This
   makes communication and teaching difficult compared to other
   well-established engineering disciplines. Biosystems engineering is
   afield of engineering that integrates engineering science and design
   with applied biological, environmental, and agricultural sciences. It
   represents an evolution of the agricultural engineering discipline
   applied to all living organisms but generally does not include
   biomedical applications. The key element for the emerging EU biosystems
   engineering program of studies is to ensure that it offers essential
   minimum fundamental engineering knowledge and competences. A core
   curriculum developed by successive Erasmus thematic networks has
   benchmarked agricultural and biosystems engineering studies in Europe.
   The common basis of a core curriculum for the discipline across European
   countries and the U.S. has been defined by an EU-US Atlantis project,
   but this needs to be taken further by defining the threads that link
   courses together This article presents a structured approach to define
   the threads of BSEN. Definition of the mid-level competences and the
   associated learning outcomes has been one of the objectives of the EU-US
   Atlantis project TABE.NET. The mid-level competences and learning
   outcomes for each of six specializations within BSEN are defined, while
   the domain-specific knowledge to be acquired for each outcome is
   proposed. Once the proposed definitions are discussed, modified, and
   ultimately adopted, these threads will be available for the global
   development of BSEN.}},

Abstract = {{MEMS resonant mass sensors can measure the mass of individual cells,
   though long-term growth measurements are limited by the movement of
   cells off the sensor area. Micro-patterning techniques are a powerful
   approach to control the placement of individual cells in an arrayed
   format. In this work we present a method for micro-patterning cells on
   fully suspended resonant sensors through select functionalization and
   passivation of the chip surface. This method combines high-resolution
   photolithography with a blanket transfer technique for applying
   photoresist to avoid damaging the sensors. Cells are constrained to the
   patterned collagen area on the sensor by pluronic acting as a cell
   adhesion blocker. This micro-patterning method enables long-term growth
   measurements, which is demonstrated by a measurement of the change in
   mass of a human breast cancer cell over 18 h.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluidic devices based on the Coulter principle require a small
   aperture for cell counting. For applications using such cell counting
   devices, the volume of the sample also needs to be metered to determine
   the absolute cell count in a specific volume. Hence, integrated methods
   to characterize and meter the volume of a fluid are required in these
   microfluidic devices. Here, we present fluid flow characterization and
   electrically-based sample metering results of blood through a
   measurement channelwith a cross-section of 15 mu m x 15 mu m (i.e. the
   Coulter aperture). Red blood cells in whole blood are lysed and the
   remaining fluid, consisting of leukocytes, erythrocyte cell lysate and

   embedded in the counting channel shows a linear relationship with the
   increase in the fluid flow rate. We also show that the fluid volume can
   be determined by measuring the decrease in pulse width, and increase in
   number of cells as they pass through the counting channel per unit time.}},

   (Co(CO3)(0.5)(OH)center dot 0.11H(2)O) has been synthesized featuring a
   hollow urchin-like structure by a one-step hydrothermal method at modest

   of the spherical urchin-like microclusters has been furnished through
   time-dependent investigations. Introduction of other transitional metal
   doping (Cu, Ni) would give rise to a substantial morphological change
   associated with a surface area drop. The directly grown cobalt-based
   hydroxide composite electrodes were found to be capable of catalyzing
   oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under both neutral pH and alkaline
   conditions. The favorable 3D dendritic morphology and porous structure
   provide large surface areas and possible defect sites that are likely

Abstract = {{Automatically monitoring construction progress or generating Building
   Information Models using site images collections - beyond point cloud
   data - requires semantic information such as construction materials and
   inter-connectivity to be recognized for building elements. In the case
   of materials such information can only be derived from appearance-based
   data contained in 2D imagery. Currently, the state-of-the-art texture
   recognition algorithms which are often used for recognizing materials
   are very promising (reaching over 95\% average accuracy), yet they have
   mainly been tested in strictly controlled conditions and often do not
   perform well with images collected from construction sites (dropping to
   70\% accuracy and lower). In addition, there is no benchmark that
   validates their performance under real-world construction site
   conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new vision-based
   method for material classification from single images taken under
   unknown viewpoint and site illumination conditions. In the proposed
   algorithm, material appearance is modeled by a joint probability
   distribution of responses from a filter bank and principal
   Hue-Saturation-Value color values and classified using a multiple
   one-vs.-all chi(2) kernel Support Vector Machine classifier.
   Classification performance is compared with the state-of-the-art
   algorithms both in computer vision and AEC communities. For experimental
   studies, a new database containing 20 typical construction materials
   with more than 150 images per category is assembled and used for
   validation. Overall, for material classification an average accuracy of
   97.1\% for 200 x 200 pixel image patches are reported. In cases where
   image patches are smaller, our method can synthetically generate
   additional pixels and maintain a competitive accuracy to those reported
   above (90.8\% for 30 x 30 pixel patches). The results show the promise
   of the applicability of the proposed method and expose the limitations
   of the state-of-the-art classification algorithms under real world
   conditions. It further defines a new benchmark that could be used to
   measure the performance of future algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Inhibition of the 4Fe-4S proteins IspG and IspH: an EPR, ENDOR and
   HYSCORE investigation}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1642-1649}},
Abstract = {{IspG and IspH are proteins that are involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis
   in most bacteria as well as in malaria parasites and are important drug
   targets. They contain cubane-type 4Fe-4S clusters that are involved in
   unusual 2H(+)/2e(-) reductions. Here, we report the results of electron
   paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic investigations of the binding of
   amino- and thiolo-HMBPP (HMBPP = E-1-hydroxy-2-methyl-but-2-enyl
   4-diphosphate) IspH substrate-analog inhibitors to both proteins, as
   well as the binding of HMBPP and an acetylene diphosphate inhibitor, to
   IspG. The results show that amino-HMBPP binds to reduced IspH by Fe-C
   pi-bonding with the olefinic carbons interacting with the unique 4th Fe
   in the 4Fe-4S cluster, quite different to the direct Fe-N ligation seen
   with the oxidized protein. No such pi-complex is observed when
   amino-HMBPP binds to reduced IspG. No EPR signal is observed with IspH
   in the presence of dithionite and thiolo-HMBPP, suggesting that the
   4Fe-4S cluster is not reduced, consistent with the presence of a 420 nm
   feature in the absorption spectrum (characteristic of an oxidized
   cluster). However, with IspG, the EPR spectrum in the presence of
   dithionite and thiolo-HMBPP is very similar to that seen with HMBPP. The
   binding of HMBPP to IspG was studied using hyperfine sublevel
   correlation spectroscopy with O-17 and C-13 labeled samples: the results
   rule out direct Fe-O bonding and indicate pi-bonding. Finally, the
   binding to IspG of a potent acetylene diphosphate inhibitor was studied
   by using electron-nuclear double resonance spectroscopy with C-13
   labeled ligands: the large hyperfine couplings indicate strong Fe-C
   pi-bonding with the acetylenic group. These results illustrate a
   remarkable diversity in binding behavior for HMBPP-analog inhibitors,
   opening up new routes to inhibitor design of interest in the context of
   anti-bacterial and anti-malarial drug discovery, as well as
   ``cubane-type{''} metallo-biochemistry, in general.}},

Title = {{Hydrothermal catalytic processing of saturated and unsaturated fatty
   acids to hydrocarbons with glycerol for in situ hydrogen production}},
Journal = {{GREEN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1507-1520}},
Abstract = {{Lipids are a promising feedstock to produce renewable hydrocarbon fuels
   and H-2 via catalytic hydrothermal processing. Upon exposure to
   hydrothermal media (e.g., 300 degrees C, 8-11 MPa), lipids rapidly
   hydrolyze to produce saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids in
   varying ratios, depending on the feedstock, as well as glycerol. This
   report demonstrates the potential of Pt-Re/C for the hydrothermal
   conversion of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids to hydrocarbons,
   using glycerol reforming for in situ H2 production to meet process
   demands. Experiments showed that deoxygenation of stearic acid, a model
   saturated fatty acid, was significantly enhanced with Pt-Re/C under a
   reducing atmosphere compared to Pt/C. The coupled hydrogenation and
   deoxygenation (HYD-DOX) of oleic aid, a model unsaturated fatty acid,
   was also moderately enhanced under an inert atmosphere using glycerol
   for in situ H-2 production, with DOX as the rate-limiting step.
   Characterization of Pt-Re/C showed that Re had a significant effect on
   CO: H uptake ratio (2.2) compared to commercial Pt/C (1.3), with the
   metals dispersed as small crystallites (similar to 3-4 nm) throughout
   carbon support. Experiments revealed that the initial system H-2
   headspace loading <3.45 MPa greatly enhances fatty acid DOX kinetics via
   decarboxylation/decarbonylation without net H2 consumption. At higher
   initial H2 loadings (>= 3.45 MPa), fatty acid reduction was also
   observed as a minor DOX pathway. Experiments also showed that oleic acid
   HYD-DOX and glycerol reforming are affected by initial glycerol
   concentration and catalyst loading. Under optimized process conditions,
   complete HYD-DOX of oleic acid to heptadecane was achieved within 2 h
   with a net-zero H2 consumption using a 1 : 3 glycerol-to-fatty acid
   ratio (i.e., the native ratio in triacylglycerides). X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy showed that H2 in the reactor headspace results in lower
   oxidation states of Pt and Re, suggesting a possible mechanism for
   enhanced DOX kinetics. This approach holds promise for overcoming the
   high external H2 demands of conventional lipid hydrotreatment processes.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the problem of human identity and gender recognition from
   gait sequences with arbitrary walking directions. Most current
   approaches make the unrealistic assumption that persons walk along a
   fixed direction or a pre-defined path. Given a gait sequence collected
   from arbitrary walking directions, we first obtain human silhouettes by
   background subtraction and cluster them into several clusters. For each
   cluster, we compute the cluster-based averaged gait image as features.
   Then, we propose a sparse reconstruction based metric learning method to
   learn a distance metric to minimize the intra-class sparse
   reconstruction errors and maximize the inter-class sparse reconstruction
   errors simultaneously, so that discriminative information can be
   exploited for recognition. The experimental results show the efficacy of
   our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the variations in the local solidification conditions in typical
   industrial casting processes, dendrites grow under transient rather than
   steady-state conditions. In this study, the phase-field method was used
   to study the evolution of secondary dendrite arms of Fe-0.3 wt.\% C
   alloy during transient directional solidification imposed by decreasing
   the pulling velocity. We find that the dendrite under transient growth
   conditions is different from the steady-state dendrite, with smaller
   selection parameter e and the dendrite envelope inside the parabola
   scaled by the tip radius. The secondary arms undergo a ripening process
   in which other secondary arms remelt by shrinking from their tips,
   rather than by detachment from the primary stalk. The surviving arms are
   finer than those found under steady-state growth conditions, and the
   size of the surviving arms decreases with decreasing growth velocity.}},

   boundary-layer flows}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Exploratory measurements of oscillatory boundary layers were conducted
   over a smooth and two different rough beds spanning the laminar,
   transitional and turbulent flow regimes using a multi-camera 2D-PIV
   system in a small oscillatory-flow tunnel (Admiraal et al. in J Hydraul
   Res 44(4): 437-450, 2006). Results show how the phase lag between bed
   shear stress and free-stream velocity is better defined when the
   integral of the momentum equation is used to estimate the bed shear
   stress. Observed differences in bed shear stress and phase lag between
   bed shear stress and free-stream velocity are highly sensitive to the
   definition of the bed position (y = b). The underestimation of turbulent
   stresses close to the wall is found to explain such differences when
   using the addition of Reynolds and viscous stresses to define both the
   bed shear stress and the phase lag. Regardless of the flow regime, in
   all experiments, boundary-layer thickness reached its maximum value at a
   phase near the flow reversal at the wall. Friction factors in smooth
   walls are better estimated using a theoretical equation first proposed
   by Batchelor (An introduction to fluid dynamics. Cambridge University
   Press, Cambridge, 1967) while the more recent empirical predictor of
   Pedocchi and Garcia (J Hydraul Res 47(4): 438-444, 2009a) was found to
   be appropriate for estimating friction coefficients in the
   laminar-to-turbulent transition regime.}},

Title = {{Analyzing streamflow changes: irrigation-enhanced interaction between
   aquifer and streamflow in the Republican River basin}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{493-502}},
Abstract = {{Groundwater-fed irrigation has altered surface and groundwater
   interactions in the Republic River basin (RRB) in the midwestern United
   States, where agriculture heavily depends on irrigation. The decreasing
   flow trend recorded at the RRB gauging station since the 1950s reflects
   the synthetical effect of dynamic interactions between surface water and
   groundwater systems, which has been enhanced by groundwater pumping and
   irrigation return flow. This study uses a systematic modeling approach
   to analyze the conjunctive effects of pumping and return flow on
   streamflow. A watershed management model, the Soil and Water Assessment
   Tool (SWAT), is modified and established for the Frenchman Creek basin
   (FCB), a subbasin of RRB, to examine the causes of streamflow changes.
   The baseflow component in SWAT is linked to aquifer storage so that the
   model can simulate the combined effects of groundwater pumping and
   irrigation return flow on natural streamflow. Results show that
   irrigation has not only depleted streamflow but also changed the flow
   pattern and seasonal variability. The changes can be decomposed into
   decrease in the slow component (baseflow) and increase in the fast
   components (surface and subsurface flow). Since the fast components are
   subject to higher variability than the slow component, the annual
   streamflow variability is amplified. Agricultural water use in this
   region also has changed the groundwater storage seasonal regime from the
   pattern of ``summer recharge and winter discharge{''} in the past to
   ``summer discharge and winter recharge{''} at present. This challenges
   the existing groundwater modeling, which usually assumes fixed recharge
   pattern and rates.}},

Title = {{Advancing catchment hydrology to deal with predictions under change}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{649-671}},
Abstract = {{Throughout its historical development, hydrology as an earth science,
   but especially as a problem-centred engineering discipline has largely
   relied (quite successfully) on the assumption of stationarity. This
   includes assuming time invariance of boundary conditions such as
   climate, system configurations such as land use, topography and
   morphology, and dynamics such as flow regimes and flood recurrence at
   different spatio-temporal aggregation scales. The justification for this
   assumption was often that when compared with the temporal, spatial, or
   topical extent of the questions posed to hydrology, such conditions
   could indeed be considered stationary, and therefore the neglect of
   certain long-term non-stationarities or feedback effects (even if they
   were known) would not introduce a large error.
   However, over time two closely related phenomena emerged that have
   increasingly reduced the general applicability of the stationarity
   concept: the first is the rapid and extensive global changes in many
   parts of the hydrological cycle, changing formerly stationary systems to
   transient ones. The second is that the questions posed to hydrology have
   become increasingly more complex, requiring the joint consideration of
   increasingly more (sub-) systems and their interactions across more and
   longer timescales, which limits the applicability of stationarity
   assumptions.
   Therefore, the applicability of hydrological concepts based on
   stationarity has diminished at the same rate as the complexity of the
   hydrological problems we are confronted with and the transient nature of
   the hydrological systems we are dealing with has increased.
   The aim of this paper is to present and discuss potentially helpful
   paradigms and theories that should be considered as we seek to better
   understand complex hydrological systems under change. For the sake of
   brevity we focus on catchment hydrology. We begin with a discussion of
   the general nature of explanation in hydrology and briefly review the
   history of catchment hydrology. We then propose and discuss several
   perspectives on catchments: as complex dynamical systems,
   self-organizing systems, co-evolving systems and open dissipative
   thermodynamic systems. We discuss the benefits of comparative hydrology
   and of taking an information-theoretic view of catchments, including the
   flow of information from data to models to predictions.
   In summary, we suggest that these perspectives deserve closer attention
   and that their synergistic combination can advance catchment hydrology
   to address questions of change.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to determine polymer elasticity and force-extension
   relations from polymer dynamics in flow has been challenging, mainly due
   to difficulties in relating equilibrium properties such as free energy
   to far-from-equilibrium processes. In this work, we determine polymer
   elasticity from the dynamic properties of polymer chains in fluid flow
   using recent advances in statistical mechanics. In this way, we obtain
   the force-extension relation for DNA from single molecule measurements
   of polymer dynamics in flow without the need for optical tweezers or
   bead tethers. We further employ simulations to demonstrate the
   practicality and applicability of this approach to the dynamics of
   complex fluids. We investigate the effects of flow type on this analysis
   method, and we develop scaling laws to relate the work relation to bulk
   polymer viscometric functions. Taken together, our results show that
   nonequilibrium work relations can play a key role in the analysis of
   soft material dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Steady streaming flow from oscillating sessile bubbles at walls is the
   centrepiece of many microstreaming experiments. A complete asymptotic
   theory of the flow is developed, requiring only the oscillatory driving
   frequency and material parameters as input, and properly accounting for
   bubble and wall boundary conditions. It is shown that mixed-mode
   streaming of neighbouring bubble oscillation modes is responsible for
   the robustness of the generic `fountain' vortex pair flow pattern, and
   that the pattern reverses for high frequencies when wall-induced
   streaming becomes dominant. The far-field flow and its dependence on
   control parameters are in agreement with experimental data and can be
   understood considering just a few asymptotic coefficients.}},

Title = {{Budget-Optimal Task Allocation for Reliable Crowdsourcing Systems}},
Journal = {{OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-24}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Crowdsourcing systems, in which numerous tasks are electronically
   distributed to numerous ``information pieceworkers,{''} have emerged as
   an effective paradigm for human-powered solving of large-scale problems
   in domains such as image classification, data entry, optical character
   recognition, recommendation, and proofreading. Because these low-paid
   workers can be unreliable, nearly all such systems must devise schemes
   to increase confidence in their answers, typically by assigning each
   task multiple times and combining the answers in an appropriate manner,
   e.g., majority voting.
   In this paper, we consider a general model of such crowdsourcing tasks
   and pose the problem of minimizing the total price (i.e., number of task
   assignments) that must be paid to achieve a target overall reliability.
   We give a new algorithm for deciding which tasks to assign to which
   workers and for inferring correct answers from the workers' answers. We
   show that our algorithm, inspired by belief propagation and low-rank
   matrix approximation, significantly outperforms majority voting and, in
   fact, is optimal through comparison to an oracle that knows the
   reliability of every worker. Further, we compare our approach with a
   more general class of algorithms that can dynamically assign tasks. By
   adaptively deciding which questions to ask to the next set of arriving
   workers, one might hope to reduce uncertainty more efficiently. We show
   that, perhaps surprisingly, the minimum price necessary to achieve a
   target reliability scales in the same manner under both adaptive and
   nonadaptive scenarios. Hence, our nonadaptive approach is order optimal
   under both scenarios. This strongly relies on the fact that workers are
   fleeting and cannot be exploited. Therefore, architecturally, our
   results suggest that building a reliable worker-reputation system is
   essential to fully harnessing the potential of adaptive designs.}},

Journal = {{OPERATIONS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{195-206}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider an optimal portfolio deleveraging problem,
   where the objective is to meet specified debt/equity requirements at the
   minimal execution cost. Permanent and temporary price impact is taken
   into account. With no restrictions on the relative magnitudes of
   permanent and temporary price impact, the optimal deleveraging problem
   reduces to a nonconvex quadratic program with quadratic and box
   constraints. Analytical results on the optimal deleveraging strategy are
   obtained. They provide guidance on how we liquidate a portfolio
   according to endogenous and exogenous factors. A Lagrangian method is
   proposed to solve the nonconvex quadratic program numerically. By
   studying the breakpoints of the Lagrangian problem, we obtain conditions
   under which the Lagrangian method returns an optimal solution of the
   deleveraging problem. When the Lagrangian algorithm returns a suboptimal
   approximation, we present upper bounds on the loss in equity caused by
   using such an approximation.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of pH on gas-phase biofilter performance including NH3 removal

   carried out on four biofilters for 130 days. In step 1 with pH 8.0, NH3
   REs were 85-95\% and N2O concentrations were 0.1-0.4 ppm. In step 2, pH
   was adjusted to 4.5, 6.0, 8.0, and 9.5 in four biofilters, respectively.
   The acidified biofilters showed higher NH3 REs than the alkalized
   biofilters. N2O concentration in biofilters with pH 4.5 and 6.0 was
   increased to 1.5 and 0.5 ppm, respectively, while no change in the
   alkalized biofilters. Comparing to communities in step 1, the amoA and
   nosZ structures were altered when pH was changed to 4.5 and 6.0, but not
   at 9.5. Abundance of amoA was reduced at pH 4.5, while nosZ abundance

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{268}},
Pages = {{194-224}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a primal interface formulation that is derived in a
   systematic manner from a Lagrange multiplier method to provide a
   consistent framework to couple different partial differential equations
   (PDE) as well as to tie together nonconforming meshes. The derivation
   relies crucially on concepts from the Variational Multiscale (VMS)
   approach wherein an additive multiscale decomposition is applied to the
   primary solution field. Modeling the fine scales locally at the
   interface using bubble functions, consistent residual-based terms on the
   boundary are obtained that are subsequently embedded into the
   coarse-scale problem. The resulting stabilized Lagrange multiplier
   formulation is converted into a robust Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
   method by employing a discontinuous interpolation of the multipliers
   along the segments of the interface. As a byproduct, analytical
   expressions are derived for the stabilizing terms and weighted numerical
   flux that reflect the jump in material properties, governing equation,
   or element geometry across the interface. Also, a procedure is proposed
   for automatically generating the fine-scale bubble functions that is
   inspired by a performance study of residual-free bubbles for the
   interface problem. A series of numerical tests confirms the robustness
   of the method for solving interface problems with heterogeneous
   elements, materials, and/or governing equations and also highlights the
   benefit and importance of deriving the flux and stabilization terms. (C)

Abstract = {{To enable a probabilistic performance-based approach to fire design,
   probabilistic models to represent the fire load are needed. Such
   probabilistic models are presented in this paper for office buildings.
   First, a literature review of recent fire load density surveys is
   presented. These surveys indicate a large range of fire load density
   values, and strong correlation between fire load density, compartment
   area, and use. However, current codes and standards (such as Eurocode
   and a recent publication of NFPA 557) that are used to estimate fire
   load density do not account for these variables and specify constant
   values. Based on survey data, a Bayesian probability approach is used to
   develop probabilistic models to predict the fire load density in office
   buildings (one for light-weight use and one for heavy-weight use). The
   models consider the size of the compartment and the office room use
   (general office, library, storage, etc.). The proposed models correlate
   well to the data and have a better fit than that obtained, using the
   Eurocode and NFPA 557. The proposed models for fire load density are
   then used to develop probabilistic models for the maximum fire
   temperature in a given compartment. Several scenarios with different
   floor areas and openings are defined and the fire load models developed
   in this paper are used to investigate the range of possible maximum fire
   temperatures and their corresponding probabilities. It is found that the
   proposed maximum temperature model results in a range of temperatures
   that correlates well with the test data and the Refined Tanaka Method
   proposed by a recent SFPE standard. It is shown that both the fire load
   density and the maximum temperature probabilistic models are well suited
   for application in a probabilistic performance-based approach to fire
   design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Characterizing hydrologic change through catchment classification}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{273-285}},
Abstract = {{There has been an intensive search in recent years for suitable
   strategies to organize and classify the very heterogeneous group of
   catchments that characterize our landscape. One strand of this work has
   focused on testing the value of hydrological signatures derived from
   widely available hydro-meteorological observations for this catchment
   classification effort. Here we extend this effort by organizing 314
   catchments across the contiguous US into 12 distinct clusters using six
   signature characteristics for a baseline decade (1948-1958, period 1).
   We subsequently develop a regression tree and utilize it to classify
   these catchments for three subsequent decades (periods 2-4). This
   analysis allows us to assess the movement of catchments between clusters
   over time, and therefore to assess whether their hydrologic
   similarity/dissimilarity changes. We find examples in which catchments
   initially assigned to a single class diverge into multiple classes (e.
   g., midwestern catchments between periods 1 and 2), but also cases where
   catchments from different classes would converge into a single class (e.
   g., midwestern catchments between periods 2 and 3). We attempt to
   interpret the observed changes for causes of this temporal variability
   in hydrologic behavior. Generally, the changes in both directions were
   most strongly controlled by changes in the water balance of catchments
   characterized by an aridity index close to one. Changes to climate
   characteristics of catchments mean annual precipitation, length of cold
   season or the seasonality of precipitation throughout the year - seem to
   explain most of the observed class transitions between slightly
   water-limited and slightly energy-limited states. Inadequate temporal
   information on other time-varying aspects, such as land use change,
   limits our ability to further disentangle causes for change.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE The study demonstrates use of a novel intervention for severe
   tracheobronchomalacia (TBM).
   OBJECTIVE To test a novel, 3-dimensionally (3D) printed, bioresorbable
   airway splint for efficacy in extending survival in a porcine model of
   severe, life-threatening TBM.
   DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized, prospective animal trial was used
   to evaluate an external airway splint as treatment of severe,
   life-threatening TBM in a multi-institutional, multidisciplinary
   collaboration between a biomedical engineering department and an
   academic animal surgery center. Six 2-month-old Yorkshire pigs underwent
   tracheal cartilage division and inner tracheal lumen dissociation and
   were randomly assigned to splint treatment (n = 3) or control groups (n
   = 3). Two additional pigs had the splint placed over their normal
   trachea.
   INTERVENTIONS A 3D-printed, bioresorbable airway splint was assessed in
   a porcine animal model of life-threatening TBM. The open-cylindrical,
   bellow-shaped, porous polycaprolactone splint was placed externally and
   designed to suspend the underlying collapsed airway. Two additional
   animals were splinted without model creation.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The observer-based Westley Clinical Croup
   Scale was used to assess the clinical condition of animals
   postoperatively. Animal survival time was noted.
   RESULTS Complete or nearly complete tracheal lumen collapse was observed
   in each animal, with resolution of symptoms in all of the experimental
   animals after splint placement. Using our severe TBM animal model,
   survival was significantly longer in the experimental group receiving
   the airway splint after model creation than in the control group (P =
   .0495).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A multidisciplinary effort producing a
   computer-aided designed, computer-aided manufactured bioresorbable
   tracheobronchial splint was tested in a porcine model of severe TBM and
   was found to extend survival time. Mortality in the splinted group was
   ascribed to the TBM model based on the lack of respiratory distress in
   splinted pigs, long-term survival in animals implanted with the splint
   without TBM, and necropsy findings.}},

Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{803-819}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effect of rainstorm movement on the peak
   discharge response (PDR) of drainage networks by comparing it with the
   corresponding equivalent stationary and uniform rainfall. A synthetic
   circular watershed is introduced to avoid biases from interaction
   between catchment geometry and storm orientation. The drainage network
   of the watershed is simulated by the Gibbsian model to examine the
   effect of network configuration on the peak response depending on the
   storm kinematics. This study utilizes two types of the equivalent
   stationary storm (ESS): the average rainfall intensity over the entire
   catchment (ESSAV) and the point stationary rainfall intensity (ESSQ) to
   evaluate the effect of moving rainstorms in terms of the PDR. The
   results show that there exists an interval in which the same rainfall
   duration produces higher peak responses for moving storms compared with
   ESSQ. The augmentation of the peak response by moving rainstorm is
   dependent on the relative rainstorm speed, size, and direction as well
   as drainage network configuration of the catchment; especially, the
   results show that a less efficient network tends to mitigate the effect
   of rainstorm movement on peak response. In contrast, a more efficient
   network is more sensitive to storm kinematics and the peak response
   increases compared with ESS. Therefore, the results in this study imply
   a potential improvement in urban drainage networks in terms of
   efficiency as well as safety to moving rainstorms. Also, this study
   suggests the range of variation in peak flows due to storm kinematics
   compared with the ESS, which can be a reference to the current design
   practices.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Many microorganisms, including spermatozoa and forms of bacteria,
   oscillate or twist a hair-like flagella to swim. At this small scale,
   where locomotion is challenged by large viscous drag, organisms must
   generate time-irreversible deformations of their flagella to produce
   thrust. To date, there is no demonstration of a self propelled,
   synthetic flagellar swimmer operating at low Reynolds number. Here we
   report a microscale, biohybrid swimmer enabled by a unique fabrication
   process and a supporting slender-body hydrodynamics model. The swimmer
   consists of a polydimethylsiloxane filament with a short, rigid head and
   a long, slender tail on which cardiomyocytes are selectively cultured.
   The cardiomyocytes contract and deform the filament to propel the
   swimmer at 5-10 mu m s(-1), consistent with model predictions. We then
   demonstrate a two-tailed swimmer swimming at 81 mu m s(-1). This
   small-scale, elementary biohybrid swimmer can serve as a platform for
   more complex biological machines.}},

Abstract = {{The cellular detail of blood is an essential factor in its flow,
   especially in vessels or devices with size comparable to that of its
   suspended cells. This article motivates and reviews numerical simulation
   techniques that provide a realistic description of cell-scale blood flow
   by explicitly representing its coupled fluid and solid mechanics. Red
   blood cells are the principal focus because of their importance and
   because of their remarkable deformability, which presents particular
   simulation challenges. Such simulations must couple discretizations of
   the large-deformation elasticity of the cells with the viscous flow
   mechanics of the suspension. The Reynolds numbers are low, so the
   effectively linear fluid mechanics is amenable to a wide range of
   simulation methods, although the constitutive models and geometric
   factors of the coupled system introduce challenging nonlinearity.
   Particular emphasis is given to the relative merits of several
   fundamentally different simulation methods. The detailed description
   provided by such simulations is invaluable for advancing our scientific
   understanding of blood flow, and their ultimate impact will be in the
   design of biomedical tools and interventions.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{537-549}},
Abstract = {{Carbonaceous and sulfur aerosols have a substantial global and regional
   influence on climate, resulting in a net cooling to date, in addition to
   their impact on health and ecosystems. The magnitude of this influence
   has changed substantially over the past and is expected to continue to
   change into the future. An integrated picture of the changing climatic
   influence of black carbon, organic carbon and sulfate over the period
   1850 through 2100, focusing on uncertainty, is presented using updated
   historical inventories and a coordinated set of emission projections. We
   describe, in detail, the aerosol emissions from the RCP4.5 scenario and
   its associated reference scenario. While aerosols have had a substantial
   impact on climate over the past century, we show that, by the end of the
   21st century, aerosols will likely be only a minor contributor to
   radiative forcing due to increases in greenhouse gas forcing and a net
   global decrease in pollutant emissions. This outcome is even more
   certain under a successful implementation of a policy to limit
   greenhouse gas emissions as low-carbon energy technologies that do not
   emit appreciable aerosol or SO2 are deployed.}},

Abstract = {{The aggregation of suspended metal oxide and oxyhydroxide nanoparticles
   dramatically changes as a function of solvent properties. In addition,
   solvent selection can offer an additional parameter for controlling
   aggregation and aggregative crystal growth (e.g., oriented aggregation).
   Here, results are presented demonstrating dramatic changes in the
   aggregation state of goethite (alpha-FeOOH), anatase (TiO2), and
   ferrihydrite (Fe5HO8 center dot 4H(2)O) nanoparticles as a function of
   changing solvents. Results are discussed in the context of Derjaguin and
   Landau, Verwey and Overbeek (DLVO) theory, additional dynamic light
   scattering data, and solvent properties like dielectric constant and
   coordinative ability. Generally speaking, solvents that strongly
   coordinate the metal oxide/oxyhydroxide surfaces produce the smallest
   and least compact aggregates, whereas those that weakly coordinate
   produce the largest and most compact aggregates. Dielectric constant and
   the nanoparticle morphology are also important factors that impact
   aggregation state.}},

Abstract = {{A C-S-H series with calcium-silicon ratio 0.6-3.0 was synthesized by
   pozzolanic reaction. Phase composition, nanostructural and morphological
   characteristics were determined using XRD, XRF, SEM and Si-29 NMR. Most

   changes in the nanostructure of the C-S-H samples were observed when the
   calcium-silicon ratio reached values of 0.8, 1.0 and 1.5. At
   calcium-silicon ratio 0.8 the basal XRD peak began to develop,
   crosslinking between layers was seen below this ratio but not above, and
   there was a substantial decrease in mean silica chain length at this
   ratio. At calcium-silicon ratio 1.0 there was a pronounced
   microstructural change from granular to reticular and another
   substantial decrease in mean chain length (indicated by an abrupt
   increase in the Q(1) peak intensity and decrease in the Q(2) peak
   intensity). At calcium-silicon ratio 1.5 the basal XRD peak began to
   diminish again, the mean silica chain length decreased further, and
   isolated tetrahedra (Q(0)) were observed.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{446-453}},
Abstract = {{Transcription-activator like effector nucleases (TALENs) are tailor-made
   DNA endonucleases and serve as a powerful tool for genome engineering.
   Site-specific DNA cleavage can be made by the dimerization of FokI
   nuclease domains at custom-targeted genomic loci, where a pair of TALENs
   must be positioned in close proximity with an appropriate orientation.
   However, the simultaneous delivery and coordinated expression of two
   bulky TALEN monomers (>100 kDa) in cells may be problematic to implement
   for certain applications. Here, we report the development of a
   single-chain TALEN (scTALEN) architecture, in which two FokI nuclease
   domains are fused on a single polypeptide. The scTALEN was created by
   connecting two FokI nuclease domains with a 95 amino acid polypeptide
   linker, which was isolated from a linker library by high-throughput
   screening. We demonstrated that scTALENs were catalytically active as
   monomers in yeast and human cells. The use of this novel scTALEN
   architecture should reduce protein payload, simplify design and decrease
   production cost.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The heat generation and fluid convection induced by plasmonic
   nanostructures is attractive for optofluidic applications. However,
   previously published theoretical studies predict only nanometre per
   second fluid velocities that are inadequate for microscale mass
   transport. Here we show both theoretically and experimentally that an
   array of plasmonic nanoantennas coupled to an optically absorptive
   indium-tin-oxide (ITO) substrate can generate >micrometre per second
   fluid convection. Crucially, the ITO distributes thermal energy created
   by the nanoantennas generating an order of magnitude increase in
   convection velocities compared with nanoantennas on a SiO2 base layer.
   In addition, the plasmonic array alters absorption in the ITO, causing a
   deviation from Beer-Lambert absorption that results in an optimum ITO
   thickness for a given system. This work elucidates the role of
   convection in plasmonic optical trapping and particle assembly, and
   opens up new avenues for controlling fluid and mass transport on the
   micro- and nanoscale.}},

Title = {{Stationary domain wall contribution to enhanced ferroelectric
   susceptibility}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In ferroelectrics, the effect of domain wall motion on properties has
   been widely studied, but non-motional or stationary contributions from
   the volume of material within the domain wall itself has received less
   attention. Here we report the measurement of stationary domain wall
   contributions to permittivity in PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 films. Studies of
   (001)-, (101)- and (111)-oriented epitaxial films reveal that
   (111)-oriented films, in which the motional domain wall contributions
   are frozen out, exhibit permittivity values approximately three times
   larger than the intrinsic response alone. This discrepancy can only be
   accounted for by considering a stationary contribution from the domain
   wall volume of the material that is 6-78 times larger than the bulk
   response, and is consistent with predictions of the enhancement of
   susceptibilities within 90 degrees domain walls. This work offers new
   insights into the microscopic origin of dielectric enhancement and
   provides a pathway to engineer the dielectric response of materials.}},

Title = {{Troubleshooting Interactive Complexity Bugs in Wireless Sensor Networks
   Using Data Mining Techniques}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This article presents a tool for uncovering bugs due to interactive
   complexity in networked sensing applications. Such bugs are not
   localized to one component that is faulty, but rather result from
   complex and unexpected interactions between multiple often individually
   nonfaulty components. Moreover, the manifestations of these bugs are
   often not repeatable, making them particularly hard to find, as the
   particular sequence of events that invokes the bug may not be easy to
   reconstruct. Because of the distributed nature of failure scenarios, our
   tool looks for sequences of events that may be responsible for faulty
   behavior, as opposed to localized bugs such as a bad pointer in a
   module. We identified several challenges in applying discriminative
   sequence mining for root cause analysis when the system fails to perform
   as expected and presented our solutions to those challenges. We also
   present two alternative schemes, namely, two-stage mining and the
   progressive discriminative sequence mining to address the scalability
   challenge. An extensible framework is developed where a front-end
   collects runtime data logs of the system being debugged and an offline
   back-end uses frequent discriminative pattern mining to uncover likely
   causes of failure. We provided several case studies where we applied our
   tool successfully to troubleshoot the cause of the problem. We uncovered
   a kernel-level race condition bug in the LiteOS operating system and a
   protocol design bug in the directed diffusion protocol. We also
   presented a case study of debugging a multichannel MAC protocol that was
   found to exhibit corner cases of poor performance (worse than
   single-channel MAC). The tool helped to uncover event sequences that
   lead to a highly degraded mode of operation. Fixing the problem
   significantly improved the performance of the protocol. We also
   evaluated the extensions presented in this article. Finally, we provided
   a detailed analysis of tool overhead in terms of memory requirements and
   impact on the running application.}},

Abstract = {{Stable pH is an established biomarker of health, relevant to all tissues
   of the body, including the heart. Clinical monitoring of pH in a
   practical manner, with high spatiotemporal resolution, is particularly
   difficult in organs such as the heart due to its soft mechanics,
   curvilinear geometry, heterogeneous surfaces, and continuous, complex
   rhythmic motion. The results presented here illustrate that advanced
   strategies in materials assembly and electrochemical growth can yield
   interconnected arrays of miniaturized IrOx pH sensors encapsulated in
   thin, low-modulus elastomers to yield conformal monitoring systems
   capable of noninvasive measurements on the surface of the beating heart.
   A thirty channel custom data acquisition system enables spatiotemporal
   pH mapping with a single potentiostat. In vitro testing reveals
   super-Nernstian sensitivity with excellent uniformity (69.9 +/- 2.2
   mV/pH), linear response to temperature (-1.6 mV degrees C-1), and
   minimal influence of extracellular ions (<3.5 mV). Device examples
   include sensor arrays on balloon catheters and on skin-like stretchable
   membranes. Real-time measurement of pH on the surfaces of explanted
   rabbit hearts and a donated human heart during protocols of
   ischemia-reperfusion illustrate some of the capabilities. Envisioned
   applications range from devices for biological research, to surgical
   tools and long-term implants.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a label-free biosensor imaging approach that utilizes a
   photonic crystal (PC) surface to detect surface attachment of individual
   dielectric and metal nanoparticles through measurement of localized
   shifts in the resonant wavelength and resonant reflection magnitude from
   the PC. Using a microscopy-based approach to scan the PC resonant
   reflection properties with 0.6 mu m spatial resolution, we show that
   metal nanoparticles attached to the biosensor surface with strong
   absorption at the resonant wavelength induce a highly localized
   reduction in reflection efficiency and are able to be detected by
   modulation of the resonant wavelength. Experimental demonstrations of
   single-nanoparticle imaging are supported by finite-difference
   time-domain computer simulations. The ability to image
   surface-adsorption of individual nanoparticles offers a route to single
   molecule biosensing, in which the particles can be functionalized with
   specific recognition molecules and utilized as tags.}},

Abstract = {{The application of non-viral gene delivery vectors is often accompanied
   with the poor correlation between transfection efficiency and the safety
   profiles of vectors. Vectors with high transfection efficiencies often
   suffer from high toxicities, making it unlikely to improve their
   efficiencies by increasing the DNA dosage. In the current study, we
   developed a ternary complex system which consisted of a highly
   membrane-active cationic helical polypeptide (PVBLG-8), a low-toxic,
   membrane-inactive cationic helical polypeptide (PVBLG-7) capable of
   mediating mannose receptor targeting, and DNA. The PVBLG-7 moiety
   notably enhanced the cellular uptake and transfection efficiency of
   PVBLG-8 in a variety of mannose receptor-expressing cell types (HeLa,
   COS-7, and Raw 264.7), while it did not compromise the membrane
   permeability of PVBLG-8 or bring additional cytotoxicities. Because of
   the simplicity and adjustability of the self-assembly approach, optimal
   formulations of the ternary complexes with a proper balance between
   membrane activity and targeting capability were easily identified in
   each specific cell type. The optimal ternary complexes displayed desired
   cell tolerability and markedly outperformed the PVBLG-8/DNA binary
   complexes as well as commercial reagent Lipofectamine (TM) 2000 in terms
   of transfection efficiency. This study therefore provides an effective
   and facile strategy to overcome the efficiency-toxicity poor correlation
   of non-viral vectors, which contributes insights into the design
   strategy of effective and safe non-viral gene delivery vectors. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A system is said to be current-state opaque if the entrance of the
   system state to a set of secret states remains opaque (uncertain) to an
   intruder-at least until the system leaves the set of secret states. This
   notion of opacity has been studied in nondeterministic finite automata
   settings (where the intruder observes a subset of events, for example,
   via some natural projection mapping) and has been shown to be useful in
   characterizing security requirements in many applications (including
   encryption using pseudorandom generators and coverage properties in
   sensor networks). One limitation of the majority of existing analysis is
   that it fails to provide a quantifiable measure of opacity for a given
   system; instead, it simply provides a binary characterization of the
   system (being opaque or not opaque). In this paper, we address this
   limitation by extending current-state opacity formulations to systems
   that can be modeled as probabilistic finite automata under partial
   observation. We introduce three notions of opacity, namely: 1)
   step-based almost current-state opacity; 2) almost current-state
   opacity; and 3) probabilistic current-state opacity, all of which can be
   used to provide a measure of a given system's opacity. We also propose
   verification methods for these probabilistic notions of opacity and
   characterize their corresponding computational complexities.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundPioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione (TZD) insulin sensitizer
   approved for use in human type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therapeutic options
   for diabetes in cats are limited.
   ObjectiveTo evaluate the effects of pioglitazone in obese cats, which
   are predisposed to insulin resistance, to assess its potential for
   future use in feline diabetes mellitus.
   AnimalsA total of 12 obese purpose-bred research cats (6 neutered males
   and 6 spayed females, 5-7years of age, weighing 5.4-9.8kg).
   MethodsRandomized, placebo-controlled 3-way crossover study. Oral
   placebo or pioglitazone (Actos; 1 or 3mg/kg) was administered daily for
   7-week periods, with IV glucose tolerance testing before and after each
   period.
   ResultsThreemg/kg pioglitazone significantly improved insulin
   sensitivity (geometric mean {[}95\% CI] 0.90 {[}0.64-1.28] to 2.03
   {[}1.49-2.78] min (-1)pmol(-1)L; P=.0014 versus change with placebo),
   reduced insulin area under the curve during IVGTT (geometric mean
   {[}range] 27 {[}9-64] to 18 {[}6-54] min.nmol/L; P=.0031 versus change
   with placebo), and lowered serum triglyceride (geometric mean {[}range]
   71 {[}29-271] to 48 {[}27-75] mg/dL; P=.047 versus change with placebo)
   and cholesterol (geometric mean {[}range] 187 {[}133-294] to 162
   {[}107-249] mg/dL; P=.0042 versus change with placebo) concentrations in
   the obese cats. No adverse effects attributable to pioglitazone were
   evident in the otherwise healthy obese cats at this dosage and duration.
   Conclusions and Clinical ImportanceResults of this study support a
   positive effect of pioglitazone on insulin sensitivity and lipid
   metabolism in obese cats, and suggest that further evaluation of the
   drug in cats with diabetes mellitus or other metabolic disorders might
   be warranted.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel, capped bowtie nanoantenna capable of achieving
   simultaneous enhancement of electric and magnetic fields in a broad
   spectrum spanning visible to near-infrared frequencies. By controlling
   parameters including nanoantenna array spacing, cap thickness, and
   bowtie gap spacing, we show magnetic enhancements in excess of 3000
   times the incident field, which are among the highest values reported to
   date. Further, electric field enhancements >10(4) are obtained across
   the full parameter range. This is in contrast to diabolo antenna designs
   that achieve strong magnetic enhancement at the expense of mitigating
   the electrical resonance. We further show that this architecture
   achieves refractive index sensitivities of similar to 700 nm RIU-1. The
   combination of large, tunable electric and magnetic-field enhancements
   makes the capped-nanoantenna platform highly attractive for magnetic
   plasmonics, metamaterial engineering, nonlinear optics, and sensing
   applications.}},

Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{44-53}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We utilize CdSe/CdS seeded nanorods as a tunable lumophore for
   luminescent concentration. Transfer-printed, ultrathin crystalline Si
   solar cells are embedded directly into the luminescent concentrator,
   allowing the study of luminescent concentrators with an area over 5000
   times the area of the solar cell. By increasing the size of the CdS rod
   with respect to the luminescent CdSe seed, the reabsorption of
   propagating photons is dramatically reduced. At long luminescence
   propagation distances, this reduced reabsorption can overcome the
   diminished quantum yield inherent to the larger semiconductor
   structures, which is studied with lifetime spectroscopy. A Monte Carlo
   ray tracing model is developed to explain the performance of the
   luminescent concentrator and is then used as a design tool to determine
   the effect of luminescence trapping on the concentration of light using
   both CdSe/CdS nanorods and a model organic dye. We design an efficient
   luminescence trapping structure that should allow the luminescent
   concentrator based on CdSe/CdS nanorods to operate in the
   high-concentration regime.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetoelectric oxide heterostructures are proposed active layers for
   spintronic memory and logic devices, where information is conveyed
   through spin transport in the solid state. Incomplete theories of the
   coupling between local strain, charge, and magnetic order have limited
   their deployment into new information and communication technologies. In
   this study, we report direct, local measurements of strain-and
   charge-mediated magnetization changes in the
   La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 system using spatially resolved
   characterization techniques in both real and reciprocal space. Polarized
   neutron reflectometry reveals a graded magnetization that results from
   both local structural distortions and interfacial screening of bound
   surface charge from the adjacent ferroelectric. Density functional
   theory calculations support the experimental observation that strain
   locally suppresses through a change in the Mn-e(g) orbital polarization.
   We suggest that this local coupling and magnetization suppression may be
   tuned by controlling the manganite and ferroelectric layer thicknesses,
   with direct implications for device applications.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this paper was to study the performance, emissions
   and combustion characteristics of a diesel engine using rapeseed
   oil-diesel blends. The main fuel properties of rapeseed oil (RSO) were
   investigated and compared with that of diesel fuel. The experimental
   results showed that the viscosity and density of the blends were
   decreased and approached to that of diesel fuel when RSO volume fraction
   was less than 20\%. At low engine loads, the start of combustion for the
   blends was almost similar to that for diesel fuel, but the peak cylinder
   pressure and heat release rate were higher. At high engine loads, the
   start of combustion for the blends was slightly earlier than that for
   diesel fuel, but the peak cylinder pressure and heat release rate were
   identical. For the blends, there was slightly higher brake specific fuel
   consumptions (BSFC) and brake specific energy consumptions (BSEC) at low
   engine loads. Smoke emission was higher at low engine loads, but lower
   at high engine loads. Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission was observed
   slightly lower at low engine loads and almost identical at high engine
   loads. Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emission were higher
   under all range of engine loads for the blends. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A new approach, based on reciprocal-space vectors (RSVs), is developed
   to determine Bravais lattice types and accurate lattice parameters of
   epitaxial thin films by high-resolution X-ray diffractometry. The
   lattice parameters of single-crystal substrates are employed as
   references to correct the systematic experimental errors of RSVs of thin
   films. The general procedure is summarized, involving correction of
   RSVs, derivation of the raw unit cell, and subsequent conversion to the
   Niggli unit cell and the Bravais unit cell by matrix calculation. Two
   methods of this procedure are described: in three-dimensional reciprocal
   space and in six-dimensional G(6) space. The estimation of standard
   error in the lattice parameters derived by this new approach is
   discussed. The whole approach is illustrated by examples of experimental
   data. The error of the best result is 0.0006 angstrom for the lattice
   parameter of indium tin oxide film. This new RSV method provides a
   practical and concise route to the crystal structure study of epitaxial
   thin films and could also be applied to the investigation of surface and

Abstract = {{The objective of this research effort is to investigate the use of a
   high power-aperture Rayleigh lidar to measure neutral density and
   temperature in the upper atmosphere, into the lower thermosphere ( > 100
   km). The scientific interest with this system is to obtain measurements
   of atmospheric tides, planetary and gravity wave amplitudes and phase in
   the lower thermosphere. Measurement of waves into the lower thermosphere
   is accomplished using Rayleigh lidar methods with high power-aperture
   (PA) products using new technology lasers and large collecting
   apertures, resulting in PA of 50700 W m(2). This paper describes the
   simulation of high PA Rayleigh lidar systems and estimates their
   capability to measure gravity waves and tides in the mesosphere and
   lower thermosphere. Both traditional backscatter and bistatic (imaging)
   methods are simulated. Simulations show that substantive measurements
   can be achieved for characterizing gravity waves at altitudes > 90 km
   and atmospheric tides at altitudes > 100 km for this lidar system.
   Measurements of density and temperature to 10\% precision are possible
   up to 120 km. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Mobility and cognitive correlates of dual task cost of walking in

Journal = {{DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{36}},

Pages = {{205-209}},
Abstract = {{Background: Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) often experience a
   decrease in walking performance while simultaneously performing a
   cognitive task. This decrease in walking performance is termed dual task
   cost (DTC). Objective: To examine if mobility and cognitive function are
   correlates of DTC in persons with MS. Methods: Participants were 96
   persons with MS who had Expanded Disability Status Scale scores that
   ranged between 2.0 and 6.5. To determine DTC, participants walked at a
   self-selected pace with and without a cognitive task while gait velocity
   was recorded. The effect of the cognitive task was quantified as the
   percent change in walking velocity between conditions. Participants
   further completed the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) and Symbol Digit
   Modalities Test (SDMT). Centered scores for the T25FW and SDMT, and the
   product of the center scores, were placed into a linear regression to
   determine the correlates of DTC. Results: DTC averaged 12.5\% (SD = 9.3)
   and ranged between -14.1 and 42.4\%. Performance on the T25FW ranged
   between 3.1 and 24.5 s with an average of 6.8 s (SD = 3.1 s). SDMT
   scores ranged between 15 and 79 with an average of 45 items (SD = 12).
   Regression analysis revealed that age, disability, walking and cognitive
   performance explained 17\% of the variance in DTC. The interaction
   between walking and cognition did not explain additional variance.
   Conclusions: Mobility and cognitive impairment were both independent
   predictors of DTC of walking in persons with MS. This raises the
   possibility that DTC could be reduced with modifications of either
   mobility or cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Low cycle fatigue (LCF) and creep-fatigue testing of Ni-based alloy 617
   was carried out at 850 degrees C. Compared with its LCF life, the
   material's creep-fatigue life decreases to different extents depending
   on test conditions. To elucidate the microstructure-fatigue property
   relationship for alloy 617 and the effect of creep and oxidation on its
   fatigue life, systematic microstructural investigations were carried out
   using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy, and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). In LCF tests,
   as the total strain range increased, deformations concentrated near high
   angle grain boundaries (HAGBs). The strain hold period in the
   creep-fatigue tests introduced additional creep damage to the material,
   which revealed the detrimental effect of the strain hold time on the
   material fatigue life in two ways. First, the strain hold time enhanced
   the localized deformation near HAGBs, resulting in the promotion of
   intergranular cracking of alloy 617. Second, the strain hold time
   encouraged grain boundary sliding, which resulted in interior
   intergranular cracking of the material. Oxidation accelerated the
   initiation of intergranular cracking in alloy 617. In the crack
   propagation stage, if oxidation was promoted and the cyclic oxidation
   damage was greater than the fatigue damage, oxidation-assisted
   intergranular crack growth resulted in a significant reduction in the
   material's fatigue life, (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing the physical properties of single cells is of great
   interest for unraveling the heterogeneity in a cell population. Recent
   advances in micro-systems technologies and quantitative imaging have
   enabled measurements of the mass and growth of single cells. So far,
   three classes of techniques have been reported for such measurements.
   These are suspended micro-channel resonators (SMR) sensors, quantitative
   phase imaging (QPI), and pedestal resonant sensors. Here we compare the
   unique merits of each method and discuss their potential to evolve into
   multi-modal platforms for answering fundamental questions in biology and

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{653-670}},
Abstract = {{In this review, we summarize the recent developments in the emerging
   field of bioactuators across a multitude of length scales. First, we
   discuss the use and control of biomolecules as nanoscale actuators.
   Molecular motors, such as DNA, kinesin, myosin, and F-1-ATPase, have
   been shown to exert forces in the range between 1 pN to 45 pN. Second,
   we discuss the use and control of single and small clusters of cells to
   power microscale devices. Microorganisms, such as flagellated bacteria,
   protozoa, and algae, can naturally swim at speeds between 20 mu m s(-1)
   to 2 mm s(-1) and produce thrust forces between 0.3 pN to 200 pN.
   Individual and clustered mammalian cells, such as cardiac and skeletal
   cells, can produce even higher contractile forces between 80 nN to 3.5
   mu N. Finally, we discuss the use and control of 2D-and 3D-assembled
   muscle tissues and muscle tissue explants as bioactuators to power
   devices. Depending on the size, composition, and organization of these
   hierarchical tissue constructs, contractile forces have been
   demonstrated to produce between 25 mu N to 1.18 mN.}},

Abstract = {{A facile method was developed to fabricate fibrous membranes of
   niobium-doped titania-supported platinum catalysts (Pt@Nb-TiO2) by a
   two-step approach. The process started with generating niobium-doped
   titania (Nb-TiO2) fibrous membranes by electrospinning, followed by the
   deposition of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) using an atomic layer deposition
   (ALD) technique. The area specific oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
   activity of Pt@TiO2 catalyst membrane was increased by similar to 20
   folds if 10 at.\% of Nb was incorporated into the ceramic fibers. The
   area-specific activity also increased with the number of ALD cycles,
   because of the increase of the Pt loading in the catalysts. After
   post-treatment of the catalyst membrane at high temperature in
   H-2-containing atmosphere, the ORR activity became 0.28 mA/cm(Pt)(2) at
   0.9 V (vs RHE), because of the improvement in conductivity of Nb-TiO2
   fibers and better crystalinity of Pt NPs. The results of
   accelerated-stability test showed that the Pt@Nb-TiO2 catalyst membrane
   was highly stable and lost only 10\% of its initial activity after 30
   000 potential cycles (0.6 to 1.0 V vs RHE) under a strong acidic
   condition..}},

Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{95}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine if strict use of the Paralyzed Veterans of
   America's Clinical Practice Guidelines for Preservation of Upper Limb
   Function affects wheelchair setup, selection, propulsion biomechanics,
   pain, satisfaction with life, and participation of individuals with new
   spinal cord injuries (SCIs).
   Design: Single blinded, randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: Model SCI systems rehabilitation facility and community.
   Participants: Volunteer sample of manual wheelchair users with new SCIs
   (N=37).
   Intervention: The intervention group was strictly educated on the
   clinical practice guideline by a physical therapist and an occupational
   therapist in an inpatient rehabilitation facility. The standard of care
   group received standard therapy services.
   Main Outcome Measures: Comparison of wheelchair setup, selection,
   propulsion biomechanics, pain, and Satisfaction With Life Scale and
   Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique scores at the time of
   discharge from inpatient rehabilitation and at 6 months and 1 year
   postdischarge.
   Results: Participants in the intervention group pushed on tile with
   significantly lower push frequency (P=.02) at the discharge visit. On
   the ramp, the intervention group used a significantly larger push length
   (P =.03) across all time points. No significant differences were found
   between groups related to wheelchair setup, selection, pain,
   satisfaction with life, and participation.
   Conclusions: The intervention group showed better skills on key
   wheelchair propulsion biomechanics variables related to upper-limb
   health. Use of a structured education program may be an effective method
   of educating new manual wheelchair users to prevent the development of
   upper-limb impairments in an inpatient setting. Additional follow-up
   testing is necessary to determine whether the differences seen in
   propulsion skills translate into decreased pain and improved quality of
   life in the long term. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation

Abstract = {{Contingency analysis is a critical activity in the context of the power
   infrastructure because it provides a guide for resiliency and enables
   the grid to continue operating even in the case of failure. In this
   paper, we augment this concept by introducing SOCCA, a cyber-physical
   security evaluation technique to plan not only for accidental
   contingencies but also for malicious compromises. SOCCA presents a new
   unified formalism to model the cyber-physical system including
   interconnections among cyber and physical components. The cyber-physical
   contingency ranking technique employed by SOCCA assesses the potential
   impacts of events. Contingencies are ranked according to their impact as
   well as attack complexity. The results are valuable in both cyber and
   physical domains. From a physical perspective, SOCCA scores power system
   contingencies based on cyber network configuration, whereas from a cyber
   perspective, control network vulnerabilities are ranked according to the
   underlying power system topology.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{43-53}},
Abstract = {{Oligonucleotides homologous to 3'-telomere overhang (T-oligos) trigger
   inherent telomere-based DNA damage responses mediated by p53 and/or ATM
   and induce senescence or apoptosis in various cancerous cells. However,
   T-oligo has limited stability in vivo due to serum and intracellular
   nucleases. To develop T-oligo as an innovative, effective therapeutic
   drug and to understand its mechanism of action, we investigated the
   antitumor effects of T-oligo or T-oligo complexed with a novel cationic
   alpha helical peptide, PVBLG-8 (PVBLG), in a p53 null melanoma cell line
   both in vitro and in vivo. The uptake of T-oligo by MM-AN cells was
   confirmed by immunofluorescence, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting
   analysis indicated that the T-oligo-PVBLG nanocomplex increased uptake
   by 15-fold. In vitro results showed a 3-fold increase in MM-AN cell
   growth inhibition by the T-oligo-PVBLG nanocomplex compared with T-oligo
   alone. Treatment of preformed tumors in immunodeficient mice with the
   T-oligoPVBLG nanocomplex resulted in a 3-fold reduction in tumor volume
   compared with T-oligo alone. This reduction in tumor volume was
   associated with decreased vascular endothelial growth factor expression
   and induction of thrombospondin-1 expression and apoptosis. Moreover,
   T-oligo treatment downregulated procaspase-3 and procaspase-7 and
   increased catalytic activity of caspase-3 by 4-fold in MM-AN cells.
   Furthermore, T-oligo induced a 10-fold increase of senescence and
   upregulated the melanoma tumor-associated antigens MART-1, tyrosinase,
   and thrombospondin-1 in MM-AN cells, which are currently being targeted
   for melanoma immunotherapy. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of
   p73 (4-10-fold) abolished this upregulation of tumor-associated
   antigens. In summary, we suggest a key role of p73 in mediating the
   anticancer effects of T-oligo and introduce a novel nanoparticle, the
   T-oligo-PVBLG nanocomplex, as an effective anticancer therapeutic.}},

Abstract = {{Consider a thin, flexible wire of fixed length that is held at each end
   by a robotic gripper. Any curve traced by this wire when in static
   equilibrium is a local solution to a geometric optimal control problem,
   with boundary conditions that vary with the position and orientation of
   each gripper. We prove that the set of all local solutions to this
   problem over all possible boundary conditions is a smooth manifold of
   finite dimension that can be parameterized by a single chart. We show
   that this chart makes it easy to implement a sampling-based algorithm
   for quasi-static manipulation planning. We characterize the performance
   of such an algorithm with experiments in simulation.}},

Abstract = {{It is well recognized that the primary interaction of most biological
   environments with nanoparticles (NPs) is strongly influenced by a
   long-lived ({''}hard{''}) protein corona that surrounds the NP and
   remains strongly adsorbed to its surface. The amount and composition of
   associated proteins in the corona adsorbed onto the NPs is related to
   several important factors, including the physicochemical properties of
   the NPs and the composition of the protein solution. Here, for the first
   time, it is shown that plasmonic heat induction (by laser activation)
   leads to significant changes in the composition of the hard protein
   corona adsorbed on low aspect ratio gold nanorods. Using mass
   spectrometry, several proteins in the corona were identified whose
   concentrations change most substantially as a result of photoinduced
   (plasmonic) heating versus simple thermal heating. Molecular modeling
   suggests that the origin of these changes in protein adsorption may be
   the result of protein conformational changes in response to much higher
   local temperatures that occur near the gold nanorods during
   photoinduced, plasmonic heating. These results may define new
   applications in vivo for NPs with hyperthermia capability and better
   define the likely interactions of cells with NPs after plasmonic
   heating. Potential changes in the protein corona following hyperthermia
   treatment may influence the final biological fate of plasmonic NPs in
   clinical applications and help elucidate safety considerations for
   hyperthermia applications.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work establishes that ultrathin, stretchable sensors can enable
   high precision thermal characterization of the skin, with capabilities
   for spatial mapping, in forms that avoid irritation, thermal or

   have potential for use in cardiovascular screening, skin hydration
   sensing, and local skin heating and thermal therapy. A theoretical
   framework for understanding the thermal behavior of these types of
   sensors is critically important for interpreting the data and
   identifying optimized designs. This paper presents an analytical model,
   validated by the finite element method and experiments, for this
   purpose. The sensor temperature is obtained analytically in terms of
   material and geometric parameters. A scaling law for the sensor response
   time shows that the normalized time depends only on the normalized
   sensor location and normalized thermal properties. A simple, analytic
   formula for the response at long times is also obtained. The results
   provide strategies for reducing the sensor response time and thereby for
   improving the device performance.}},

Abstract = {{In many species of chorusing frogs, callers can rapidly adjust their
   call timing with reference to neighboring callers so as to maintain call
   rate while minimizing acoustic interference. The rules governing the
   interactions, in particular, who is listening to whom are largely
   unknown, presumably influenced by distance between callers, caller
   density, and intensities of interfering calls. We report vocal
   interactions in a unison bout caller, the green tree frog (Hyla
   cinerea). Using a microphone array, we monitored bouts from a local
   group of six callers embedded in a larger chorus. Data were analyzed in
   a 21-min segment at the peak of the chorus. Callers within this group
   were localized and their voices were separated for analysis of
   spatio-temporal interactions. We show that callers in this group: (1)
   synchronize with one another, (2) prefer to time their calls
   antiphonally, almost exactly at one-third and two-thirds of the call
   intervals of their neighbors, (3) tolerate call collision when
   antiphonal calling is not possible, and (4) perform discrete
   phase-hopping between three preferred phases when tracking other
   callers. Further, call collision increases and phase-locking decreases,
   with increasing inter-caller spacing. We conclude that the precise
   phase-positioning, phase-tracking, and phase-hopping minimizes acoustic
   jamming while maintaining chorus synchrony.}},

Abstract = {{Geopolymers (GP) represent a fascinating alternative to typical
   structural ceramics, but all prior work has demonstrated substantial
   mesoporosity. This porosity is detrimental to mechanical properties as
   well as drying failure resistance. Here, mesoporosity in metakaolin
   Na-based GP has been reduced by an order of magnitude through the
   addition of acrylate-functional silane coupling agents, and the effect
   of this modification was extensively analyzed using a variety of
   characterization techniques. It was found that a critical concentration
   of approximately 0.06 mol methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane/mol GP was
   necessary for extensive property modification. Above this concentration,
   membranes and tubes of organic material could be observed, suggesting
   that only this surplus additive contributed to mesoporosity reduction.
   The source of this mesoporosity reduction is shown to be segregation of
   free water via hydrogel-like interaction caused by the formation of
   sodium acrylate groups.}},

Title = {{Light-induced deformation in a liquid crystal elastomer photonic crystal}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{48-56}},

Abstract = {{Elastomer materials can undergo large, reversible elastic deformation,
   and offer novel possibilities for coupled optomechanical behavior when
   light itself is used to induce that deformation. This phenomenology is
   especially interesting to consider when photonic bandstructure effects
   and mechanical instabilities are present over the same length scales.
   Here we investigate a novel, coupled optomechanical material behavior
   whereby complex deformation, with the potential to occur cyclically,
   occurs in a soft photonic crystal structure due to a mechanical
   instability, as a result of constant, uniform illumination by normally
   incident light. We suppose that the base material for the structure is a
   material that responds to light by undergoing a microstructural change.
   Such a behavior is observed, for example, in a liquid crystal elastomer
   containing azobenzene moieties attached to the liquid crystal
   main-chains (Finkelmann et al., 2001) transformational strain generated
   by the effect of localized light energy on the isomerization of the
   azobenzene moieties can be calculated from an order-parameter based
   model (Hogan et al., 2002). Under uniform exposure to constant
   illumination, the interaction between the light, the material, and the
   deforming structure lead to a complex, reversible deformation sequence.
   We analyze the electromagnetic energy distribution inside this photonic
   crystal structure by solving Maxwells equations for the electromagnetic
   problem of light transmittance using finite element analysis. First,
   upon contraction of the structure due to isomerization in the uniformly
   illuminated material, the photonic bandstructure shifts, thereby
   significantly reducing the average illumination of material within the
   structure. The locally reduced illumination allows for a relaxation of
   the strain in some parts of the structure, due to the reversible
   isomerization at room temperature. Then, as a result of this relaxation,
   the structure is subjected to uniaxial stress, leading to a mechanical
   instability that triggers a geometrical pattern transformation. This in
   turn produces a second contractile deformation, as a result of the
   buckling-like deformation in the structure. Finally, the highly
   nonuniform local strain field that results generates a dramatic change
   in the photonic bandstructure of the system, leading to a new
   localization of the light that tends to reverse the effect of pattern
   transformation. This completes the transformation sequence,
   demonstrating the potential for cyclical deformation induced simply by
   uniform illumination. The coupled optomechanical material/structure
   behavior observed here could lead to applications in optically sensors,
   energy harvesters, or other reversible optomechanically active
   structures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A control scheme is proposed for an islanded lowinertia three-phase
   inverter-based microgrid with a high penetration of photovoltaic (PV)
   generation resources. The output of each inverter is programmed to
   emulate the dynamics of a nonlinear oscillator. The virtual oscillators
   within each controller are implicitly coupled through the physical
   electrical network. The asymptotic synchronization of the oscillators
   can be guaranteed by design, and as a result, a stable power system
   emerges innately with no communication between the inverters.
   Time-domain switching-level simulation results for a 45-kW microgrid
   with 33\% PV penetration demonstrate the merits of the proposed
   technique; in particular they show that the load voltage can be
   maintained between prescribed bounds in spite of variations in incident
   irradiance and step changes in the load.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical modeling of electromagnetic subsurface detection is always
   challenging because the computational domain is large and the frequency
   is very low. This paper describes a nonconformal
   finite-element-method-based domain decomposition method (NC-FEM-DDM) for
   an efficient and accurate modeling of subsurface detecting problems in
   any frequency band. It first compares several transmission conditions
   (TCs) employed in DDM and identifies the most appropriate TC for
   subsurface applications. A tree-cotree splitting (TCS) strategy is then
   applied to hexahedral-based hierarchical basis functions to eliminate
   the low-frequency breakdown of NC-FEM-DDM at very low frequencies.
   Numerical results of a few testing problems show excellent convergence
   and accuracy obtained with an improved second-order TC in conjunction
   with the TCS at any frequencies even close to dc. Numerical results of a
   real-life application further demonstrate the efficiency and capability
   of this method for subsurface detection applications.}},

Title = {{Calculating Individual Resources Variability and Uncertainty Factors

Abstract = {{The variability and uncertainty of wind power production require
   increased flexibility in the power systems, or more operational reserves
   to maintain a satisfactory level of reliability. The incremental
   increase in reserve requirement caused by wind power is often studied
   separately from the effects of loads. Accordingly, the cost in procuring
   reserves is allocated based on this simplification rather than a fair
   and transparent calculation of the different resources' contribution to
   the reserve requirement. This work proposes a new allocation mechanism
   for variability and uncertainty of resources regardless of their type.
   It is based on a new formula called the grid-balancing metric (GBM). The
   proposed GBM has several distinct features: 1) it is directly linked to
   the control performance standard scores and interconnection frequency
   performance, 2) it provides scientifically defined allocation factors
   for individual resources, 3) the sum of allocation factors within any
   group of resources is equal to the groups' collective allocation factor
   (linearity), and 4) it distinguishes helpers and harmers. The paper
   illustrates and provides results of the new approach based on actual
   transmission system operator data.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a full-band Monte Carlo simulator is employed to study
   the dynamic characteristics and high-frequency noise performances of a
   double-gate (DG) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor
   (MOSFET) with 30nm gate length. Admittance parameters (Y parameters) are
   calculated to characterize the dynamic response of the device. The noise
   behaviors of the simulated structure are studied on the basis of the
   spectral densities of the instantaneous current fluctuations at the
   drain and gate terminals, together with their cross-correlation. Then
   the normalized noise parameters (P, R, and C), minimum noise figure
   (NFmin), and so on are employed to evaluate the noise performances. To
   show the outstanding radio-frequency performances of the DG MOSFET, a
   single-gate silicon-on-insulator MOSFET with the same gate length is
   also studied for comparison. The results show that the DG structure
   provides better dynamic characteristics and superior high-frequency
   noise performances, owing to its inherent short-channel effect immunity,
   better gate control ability, and lower channel noise. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Geometry and confinement effects at the nanoscale can result in
   substantial modifications to a material's properties with significant
   consequences in terms of chemical reactivity, biocompatibility and
   toxicity(1,2). Although benefiting applications across a diverse array
   of environmental and technological settings, the long-term effects of
   these changes, for example in the reaction of metallic nanoparticles
   under atmospheric conditions, are not well understood. Here, we use the
   unprecedented resolution attainable with aberration-corrected scanning
   transmission electron microscopy(3) to study the oxidation of cuboid Fe
   nanoparticles. Performing strain analysis at the atomic level, we reveal
   that strain gradients induced in the confined oxide shell by the
   nanoparticle geometry enhance the transport of diffusing species,
   ultimately driving oxide domain formation and the shape evolution of the
   particle. We conjecture that such a strain-gradient-enhanced mass
   transport mechanism may prove essential for understanding the reaction
   of nanoparticles with gases in general, and for providing deeper insight
   into ionic conductivity in strained nanostructures.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a novel universal eigenvalue analysis for 2D arbitrary
   nanostructures comprising dispersive and lossy materials. The complex
   dispersion relation (or complex Bloch band structure) of a metallic
   grating is rigorously calculated by the proposed algorithm with the
   finite-difference implementation. The abnormally large group velocity is
   observed at a plasmonic band edge with a large attenuation constant.
   Interestingly, we found the abnormal group velocity is caused by the
   leaky (radiation) loss, not by metallic absorption (ohmic) loss. The
   periodically modulated surface of the grating significantly modifies the
   original dispersion relation of the semi-infinite dielectric-metal
   structure and induces the extraordinarily large group velocity, which is
   different from the near-zero group velocity at photonic band edge. The
   work is fundamentally important to the design of plasmonic

Volume = {{266}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Numerical simulations are performed to study wave propagation in an
   infinite domain of square packed spheres with intruders at interstitial
   locations. Randomness is uniformly distributed in the densities of the
   spheres and the packing contains no precompression. The simulations
   reveal the two regimes of force amplitude decay: exponential and power
   law, similar to those previously reported in 1D random granular chains.
   The source of transition between the regimes is identified as a function
   of the amplitude of the leading pulse and the backscatter. An analysis
   of the contours of force amplitude demonstrates the anisotropy of wave
   propagation with respect to the distance traveled by the wave and the
   level of randomness. An investigation of the evolution of ensemble
   kinetic energy shows a gradual increase with increasing randomness, and
   the results are compared with the corresponding 1D random chains. The
   study of angular decay provides a way to identify suitable sphere
   properties to design optimized granular structures. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Structural reinforcement of microvascular networks using electrostatic
   layer-by-layer assembly with halloysite nanotubes}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{544-548}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate a method for tailoring local mechanical properties near
   channel surfaces of vascular structural polymers in order to achieve
   high structural performance in microvascular systems. While synthetic
   vascularized materials have been created by a variety of manufacturing
   techniques, unreinforced microchannels act as stress concentrators and
   lead to the initiation of premature failure. Taking inspiration from
   biological tissues such as dentin and bone, these mechanical
   deficiencies can be mitigated by complex hierarchical structural
   features near to channel surfaces. By employing electrostatic
   layer-by-layer assembly (ELbL) to deposit films containing halloysite
   nanotubes onto scaffold surfaces followed by matrix infiltration and
   scaffold removal, we are able to controllably deposit nanoscale
   reinforcement onto 200 micron diameter channel surface interiors in
   microvascular networks. High resolution strain measurements on
   reinforced networks under load verify that the halloysite reduces strain
   concentrations and improves mechanical performance.}},

Title = {{Grain boundary complexions}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{1-48}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Grain boundaries exhibit phase-like behavior in which their structure,
   chemistry and properties may change discontinuously at critical values
   of thermodynamic parameters such as temperature, pressure and chemical
   potential. Therefore, grain boundaries (and other interfaces such as
   surfaces and heterophase boundaries) can be treated as thermodynamically
   stable interfacial states. To differentiate these interfacial states
   from bulk phases, the term ``complexion{''} has been introduced. A
   variety of terminology has been used to describe complexions and
   complexion transitions. In many cases, several terms exist that describe
   essentially the same phenomenon. We give an overview of
   complexion-related terminology, suggest a preferred nomenclature and
   discuss a classification framework that can be used to categorize
   complexions and complexion transitions. The field of grain boundary
   complexions has evolved rapidly in the past decade due to advances in
   experimental equipment - in particular, aberration-corrected
   transmission electron microscopy - and progress in computational
   simulation methods. Grain boundary complexion transitions are the root
   cause of a wide variety of materials phenomena - such as abnormal grain
   growth, grain boundary embrittlement and activated sintering - that have
   defied mechanistic explanation for years. In this overview, we review
   the history and theory of grain boundary complexion transitions, their
   role in materials processing and their effect on materials properties.

Title = {{Chemical mixing and self-organization of Nb precipitates in Cu during
   severe plastic deformation}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{276-285}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Severe plastic deformation (SPD) of Cu, Ag and Nb ternary alloys with
   average Nb concentrations of 5, 10 and 15 at.\% and an Ag concentration
   of 10 at.\% was studied using high resolution scanning electron
   microscopy, atom probe tomography and X-ray diffraction. Ball-milled
   powders were compacted, annealed at 600 or 950 degrees C and
   subsequently strained by high pressure torsion at room temperature. Ag
   redistributed homogeneously in the Cu matrix during SPD, but the Nb
   solubility increased by less than 1\%. The Nb precipitates, moreover,
   self-organized into a patterned microstructure, whereby their sizes all
   fell within a narrow distribution, centered on similar to 20 nm. This
   size was independent of the initial microstructure for a given alloy and
   insensitive to the Nb concentration. The size was also insensitive to
   the method of shearing. Since Nb diffusion is negligible in Cu at room
   temperature, these results establish that SPD alone can induce
   compositional patterning in highly immiscible alloys. We discuss the
   mechanisms responsible for this behavior. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

Title = {{Estimating the orientation of Stage I crack paths through the direction
   of maximum variance of the resolved shear stress}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{94-101}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Our formalisation of the Shear Stress-Maximum Variance Method takes as a
   starting point the hypothesis that, in ductile materials subjected to
   fatigue loading, the crack initiation planes, i.e. the so-called Stage I
   planes, are those containing the direction experiencing the maximum
   variance of the resolved shear stress. From a computational point of
   view, the most remarkable implication of the above assumption is that,
   as soon as the variance and covariance terms characterising the
   considered load history are known, the effective time needed to estimate
   the orientation of the critical plane does not depend on the length of
   the load history itself. Further, such a computational efficiency is
   seen to be associated with an high-level of accuracy in estimating
   fatigue lifetime of both plain and notched engineering components, this
   holding true under constant as well as under variable amplitude
   uniaxial/multiaxial fatigue loading. In this scenario, by assuming that
   the orientation of Stage I planes can directly be determined through the
   orientation of Stage II crack paths, the present paper investigates
   whether, independently from the degree of multiaxiality and
   non-proportionality of the applied loading history, the direction of
   maximum variance of the resolved shear stress is also capable of
   accurately estimating the orientation of Stage I crack paths. (C) 2013

Title = {{Looking forward through the past: identification of 50 priority research

Volume = {{102}},

Abstract = {{Priority question exercises are becoming an increasingly common tool to
   frame future agendas in conservation and ecological science. They are an
   effective way to identify research foci that advance the field and that
   also have high policy and conservation relevance. To date, there has
   been no coherent synthesis of key questions and priority research areas
   for palaeoecology, which combines biological, geochemical and molecular
   techniques in order to reconstruct past ecological and environmental
   systems on time-scales from decades to millions of years. We adapted a
   well-established methodology to identify 50 priority research questions
   in palaeoecology. Using a set of criteria designed to identify realistic
   and achievable research goals, we selected questions from a pool
   submitted by the international palaeoecology research community and
   relevant policy practitioners. The integration of online participation,
   both before and during the workshop, increased international engagement
   in question selection. The questions selected are structured around six
   themes: human-environment interactions in the Anthropocene;
   biodiversity, conservation and novel ecosystems; biodiversity over long
   time-scales; ecosystem processes and biogeochemical cycling; comparing,
   combining and synthesizing information from multiple records; and new
   developments in palaeoecology. Future opportunities in palaeoecology are
   related to improved incorporation of uncertainty into reconstructions,
   an enhanced understanding of ecological and evolutionary dynamics and
   processes and the continued application of long-term data for
   better-informed landscape management.Synthesis. Palaeoecology is a
   vibrant and thriving discipline, and these 50 priority questions
   highlight its potential for addressing both pure (e.g. ecological and
   evolutionary, methodological) and applied (e.g. environmental and
   conservation) issues related to ecological science and global change.}},

Abstract = {{According to the Taylor tool life equation, tool life reduces with
   increasing cutting speed following a power law. Additional factors can
   also be added, such as the feed rate, in Taylor-type models. Although
   these models are posed as deterministic equations, there is inherent
   uncertainty in the empirical constants and tool life is generally
   considered a stochastic process. In this work, Bayesian inference is
   applied to estimate model constants for both milling and turning
   operations while considering uncertainty.
   In Part 1 of the paper, a Taylor tool life model for milling that uses
   an exponent, n, and a constant, C, is developed. Bayesian inference is
   applied to estimate the two model constants using a discrete grid
   method. Tool wear tests are performed using an uncoated carbide tool and
   1018 steel work material. Test results are used to update initial
   beliefs about the constants and the updated beliefs are then used to
   predict tool life using a probability density function. In Part 2, an
   extended form of the Taylor tool life equation is implemented that
   includes the dependence on both cutting speed and feed for a turning
   operation. The dependence on cutting speed is quantified by an exponent,
   p, and the dependence on feed by an exponent, q; the model also includes
   a constant, C. Bayesian inference is applied to estimate these constants
   using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
   (MCMC) approach. Turning tests are performed using a carbide tool and
   MS309 steel work material. The test results are again used to update
   initial beliefs about the Taylor tool life constants and the updated
   beliefs are used to predict tool life via a probability density

Abstract = {{Through a systematic study of microgrooved brass surfaces, the effect of
   parallel, periodic microgroove geometry on the wettability is examined
   experimentally and compared to that of flat surfaces, where the drop
   size is comparable to the groove dimensions. A total of 18 brass samples
   are fabricated by micromachining without any chemical modification of
   the surface The substrates have groove depths in the range of 26 to 122
   mu m, groove widths of 27 to 187 mu m, and are about 45 mm x 45 mm in
   size, with a thickness about 3 mm. A high degree of wetting anisotropy
   is observed on most of the microgrooved surfaces. A significantly higher
   value of static contact angle (SCA) in the orthogonal direction (across
   the grooves) of the grooves is observed on the microgrooved surfaces
   compared to the contact angle on the flat baseline surfaces which are
   hydrophilic in nature. The contact angle also shows a significant
   dependence on droplet volume. The observed wetting behavior is
   attributed to the manner in which droplets rest on these surfaces,
   contact line pinning by the groove edges and texture and local variation
   of roughness of the micromachined brass surfaces. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Examining articulatory compensation has been important in understanding
   how the speech production system is organized, and how it relates to the
   acoustic and ultimately phonological levels. This paper offers a method
   that detects articulatory compensation in the acoustic signal, which is
   based on linear regression modeling of co-variation patterns between
   acoustic cues. We demonstrate the method on selected acoustic cues for
   spontaneously produced American English stop consonants. Compensatory
   patterns of cue variation were observed for voiced stops in some cue
   pairs, while uniform patterns of cue variation were found for stops as a

Abstract = {{Energy is becoming an increasingly important issue worldwide and forcing
   the world to develop more efficient ways to use energy. The emerging
   smart grids aim to create automated energy delivery systems with two-way
   flows of electricity and information that can improve energy efficiency.
   A key feature of smart grids is the automated control technology that
   allows system operators adjust and control millions of components in the
   system timely and efficiently. Optimal power flow (OPF) analysis has
   been widely used to accomplish the electrical and economic operational
   goals. This paper identifies the computational challenges in smart grid
   automated control process. Specifically, we discuss several new
   algorithms that speed up the computation of OPF in smart grid.}},

Abstract = {{The benefits of active learning have been demonstrated in recent
   research. Still, instructors of courses particularly in engineering
   hesitate in adopting such methods, teaching assistants included. This
   paper discusses an online survey sent to teaching assistants within the
   mechanical engineering department at a research university where
   information was collected regarding perspectives and practice of
   non-traditional teaching techniques. The survey contained eight items
   that included a mixture of selected response and open-ended response.
   Motivated by the outcomes of the survey, this paper then presents a
   variety of teaching activities tailored to overcome the barriers that
   teaching assistants face in incorporating diverse teaching methods. The
   `tricks of the trade' that are selected require modest preparation and
   few resources that instructors can easily incorporate into the lecture
   to break up the pace, regain focus, and strengthen the amount of
   information retained. At institutions where a smaller discussion section
   supplements a large lecture, the reduced class size is ideal for a
   novice instructor to introduce unfamiliar teaching methods. The included
   techniques (pauses, think pair share, minute papers, effective
   questions, and a flipped review session) are specifically adapted for
   use in engineering courses and personal examples from the classroom are
   given.}},

   enhance the student academic experience in a variety of ways and to
   better integrate the Grainger Engineering Library into the day-to-day
   lives of engineering students. The overarching goal is to provide
   enhanced student academic services, increase engineering student
   retention rates, provide peer mentoring and focused instructional
   assistance, provide increased contact with teaching assistants (TA),
   give students advanced collaborative resources and facilities, and
   better integrate the Grainger Engineering Library services with student
   needs. The Grainger Library has repurposed 3,966 feet of classroom and
   group study space, and 14,550 square feet of open study space to
   establish CARE. The space includes 14 group study rooms, 2 instructional
   classrooms, 2 storage rooms, and 1 office utilized by the CARE Program
   Coordinator - who is funded by the COE. CARE was initially funded by a
   combination of Library Student/IT Fee money, COE Student Fee funds, and
   COE foundation moneys. These funds were used for high-end engineering
   workstation equipment, projection equipment, furniture, digital signage,
   glass and whiteboard equipment, collaboration furniture, and computing

Abstract = {{The differences between successful and unsuccessful engineering teams
   seem quite stark on paper. The quality of deliverables like
   presentations or reports, the interactions of the team members, and the
   value of questions asked to instructors become increasingly worse as
   teams collapse. But are these teams really so different from their more
   successful peers? And what can instructors and the teams themselves do
   to mitigate difficulties and avoid complete team breakdown? To answer
   these questions, we investigated the engineering teams in a chemical
   engineering design capstone course for seniors. We assessed the
   possibility that the differences, rather than being due to team
   demographics or GPA discrepancies, were actually due to minute
   personality type differences among team members. We gave students the
   Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (R) (MBTI)(1) at the beginning of the
   course, but did not reveal their types to them so that they would not
   modify their behavior based on that knowledge. Throughout the course,
   the instructor kept notes on student interactions during team meetings
   and presentations. At the end of the course, we analyzed the
   instructor's team interaction notes, the students' peer evaluations of
   one another, and samples of student work for evidence of MBTI
   type-related difficulties over the course of the semester. We found that
   teams experienced difficulties related to all four of the MBTI
   dichotomies which proved to be detrimental to team success, both
   perceived and actual. Based on our results, we recommend familiarizing

Abstract = {{Research based on Self Determination Theory (SDT) focuses on autonomy
   and competence as the most important psychological needs in fostering
   intrinsic motivation. Although relatedness, a third psychological need
   central to SDT, plays a role in motivation, its importance is often
   considered tertiary. This study seeks to describe what events changed
   students' motivational orientations toward learning in a second-year
   engineering course that was redesigned to promote students' sense of
   autonomy and how the three psychological needs of SDT affected those
   events. After completing the redesigned course, students were
   interviewed to gain an understanding of their experience through the
   semester. Interviews were coded to capture students' motivational
   orientation changes during the course and the psychological needs they
   mentioned in relation to their experience. The analysis of students'
   descriptions overwhelmingly pointed to relatedness as key to their
   motivational orientation in the course. Contrary to expectations based
   on the SDT literature, the analysis revealed a lesser importance of
   competence and autonomy. Students' statements were coded least
   frequently as pertaining to autonomy out of the three psychological
   needs of SDT, even though the course was specifically redesigned to
   support autonomy. Engineering educators should consider creating
   relatedness-supportive pedagogies and researchers should explore how the
   social context of large engineering courses may create a deep need for
   supporting relatedness.}},

Abstract = {{The Strategic Instructional Initiatives Program (SIIP) is a college-wide
   effort to promote the sustainable adoption of evidence-based pedagogies
   in the College of Engineering. Rather than rely on solitary faculty
   champions to initiate reforms, SIIP aims to improve the sustainability
   of reforms by forming Communities of Practice (CoPs) consisting of
   instructors who are committed to the reform effort. This model of
   collaborative development provides avenues to secure faculty buy-in,
   organically spread effective practices, facilitate evaluation, and
   provide just-in-time training for faculty. This paper describes the
   rationale for the CoP-based reform model and presents a case study for
   how this model was used to drive the reform of the course Introductory
   Dynamics. This course was redesigned to achieve three goals: (1) improve
   students' low engagement and enthusiasm, (2) improve instructors'
   experience and reduce their high workload, and (3) maintain and elevate
   the current standards for content. Introductory Dynamics is one of the
   core second-year mechanics courses in our engineering curriculum,
   serving approximately 800 students per year. Course revisions have led
   to the adoption of a spectrum of evidence-based practices such as
   context-rich, collaborative problem-solving sessions, and classroom
   response systems. These efforts have improved student satisfaction with
   the course and have stimulated additional reform efforts of other
   high-enrollment mechanics courses.}},

Abstract = {{Data parallel languages such as CUDA and OpenCL efficiently describe
   many parallel threads of computation, and HLS tools can effectively
   translate these descriptions into independent optimized cores. As the
   number of instantiated cores grows, average external memory access
   latency can be a significant factor in system performance. However,
   although each core produces outputs independently, the cores often
   heavily share input data. Exploiting on-chip data sharing both reduces
   external bandwidth demand and improves the average memory access
   latency, allowing the system to improve performance at the same number
   of cores. In this paper, we develop a network-on-chip coupled with
   computation cores synthesized from CUDA for FPGAs that enables on-chip
   data sharing. We demonstrate reduced external bandwidth demand by up to
   60\% (average 56\%) and total application latency in cycles by up to
   43\% (average 27\%).}},

Abstract = {{In mission-based mobile environments such as airplane maintenance,
   workflow-based mobile sensor networks emerge, where mobile users (MUs)
   with sensing devices visit sequences of mission-driven locations defined
   by workflows, and demand the gathering of sensory data within mission
   durations. To satisfy this demand in a cost-efficient manner, mobile
   access point (AP) deployment needs to be part of the overall solution.
   Therefore, we study the mobile AP deployment in workflow-based mobile
   sensor networks. We categorize MUs' workflows according to a priori
   knowledge of MUs' staying durations at mission locations into complete
   and incomplete information workflows. In both categories, we formulate
   the cost-minimizing mobile AP deployment problem into multiple (mixed)
   integer optimization problems, satisfying MUs' QoS constraints. We prove
   that the formulated optimization problems are NP-hard and design
   approximation algorithms with guaranteed approximation ratios. We
   demonstrate using simulations that the AP deployment cost calculated
   using our algorithms is 50-60\% less than the stationary baseline
   approach and fairly close to the optimal AP deployment cost. In
   addition, the run times of our approximation algorithms are only 10-25\%
   of those of the branch-and-bound algorithm used to derive the optimal AP
   deployment cost.}},

Abstract = {{We present in-depth quantum efficiency analyses of of Cu(In,Ga)Se-2
   (CIGS) solar cells. Ex-situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) analysis is
   applied to partially and fully completed solar cells with standard
   thickness and thin CIGS absorbers. Optical properties and multilayer
   structural data are deduced and used to predict the maximum obtainable
   quantum efficiency spectra and short-circuit current densities (J(sc)).
   We validate optical model development and the resulting quantum
   efficiency (QE) simulations with experimental results for CIGS solar
   cells incorporating standard 2.2 um thick absorbers. We find that both
   the bulk CIGS layer and the CdS-CIGS interface layer serve as active
   layer components and together contribute 100\% of the photo-generated
   current. Thus, essentially all photogenerated carriers are collected
   from these layers. Solar cells with thin absorbers were also fabricated
   and efficiencies of 13.2\% at 0.73 mu m CIGS thickness, 10.1\% at 0.50
   mu m and 8.0\% at 0.36 um were obtained. Although J(sc) is expected to
   decrease with decreasing absorber thickness due to reduced optical
   collection, modeling results suggest that electronic losses are also
   occurring upon thinning the absorber, ranging from similar to 1.3 to 1.9
   mA/cm(2) for cells with CIGS thicknesses from 0.73 to 0.36 mu m,

Abstract = {{Mapping spectroscopic ellipsometry (M-SE) has been applied for
   optimization of polycrystalline CdS/CdTe solar cell fabrication on
   transparent conducting oxide (TCO) coated glass superstrates. During
   fabrication of these solar cells, the structure undergoes key processing
   steps after the sputter-deposition of the CdS/CdTe. These steps include
   CdCl2 treatment of the CdTe layer and subsequent deposition of ultrathin
   Cu. Additional steps involve final metal back contact layer deposition
   and an anneal for Cu diffusion that completes the device. In this study,
   we have fabricated cells with variable absorber thickness, ranging from
   0.5 to 2.5 mu m, and variable CdCl2 treatment time, ranging from 5 to 30
   min. Because both CdS window and Cu back contact layers are critical for
   determining device performance, an understanding of their deposition
   processes and process-property-performance relationships is important
   for device optimization. We have applied M-SE to map the effective
   thickness (volume/area) of the CdS and Cu films over 1 5 cm x 1 5 cm
   substrates prior to the fabrication of 1 6 x 1 6 arrays of dot cells.
   The model for M-SE analysis has been established using single-spot real
   time SE (RT-SE). We report correlations of cell performance parameters
   with the CdCl2 treatment time and with the effective thicknesses from
   M-SE analysis. We demonstrate that correlations between
   optical/structural parameters extracted from M-SE analysis and device
   performance parameters facilitate process optimization.}},

   (a-Si1-xCx:H:B) layers deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor
   deposition (PECVD) under conditions that yield efficient hydrogenated
   amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) p-i-n solar cells have been applied as back
   contacts to sputter-deposited CdTe superstrate solar cells. We report a
   maximum observed V-oc of 0.78 V and a best initial efficiency of similar
   to 7.7 \% (relative to an similar to 12\% standard cell baseline)
   without the introduction of Cu into the back contact region. We studied
   the stability of the best performing cells over a two year time period
   and found that although V-oc is relatively stable, the series resistance
   of the cells increased significantly leading to fill-factor degradation.
   The role of hydrogen loss from the back contact layer via diffusion into
   the CdTe absorber is explored as a possible cause of this degradation.
   In related investigations, we have found that the effect of in-diffusing
   H on the CdTe solar cell performance is detrimental, as observed from a
   brief (similar to 15 s) exposure of CdTe to a low power H-2 plasma
   between the treatment by CdCl2 and the application of standard Cu/Au
   back contacts. This detrimental effect of H in the fabrication of the
   back contact layer from hydride gases, and the subsequent instability of
   the back contact itself, were found to be significant challenges
   encountered in this investigation.}},

   conductive CIS offers many potential uses, including as a stable Cu-

   junctions in CIS devices. In an attempt to produce consistent, highly
   conductive, thin CIS films we introduced N (2) during the deposition

Abstract = {{First generation photovoltaics have made significant progress and are
   nearing their maximum potential. This has largely been accomplished
   because the materials are well understood, allowing present simulation
   tools, such as AMPS, wxAMPS, SCAPS, AFORS-HET, and ADEPT to describe
   their behaviors well. In more complicated materials, the device may
   physically change during use, as debated concerning CIGS
   metastabilities, making it difficult to model and design. Even more
   troublesome are organic photovoltaics that exhibit highly dispersive
   transport and critical sensitivity to interface recombination and charge
   transport. The fixed nature of the present photovoltaic simulation tools
   provides limited insight into experimental results. This paper describes
   a new software tool based on a stochastic approach to improve modeling
   of these complex devices.}},

   specify selected interactions that are under control. We investigate the
   control model from two perspectives: one is from the view of classic
   control theory while the other is from the view of decentralized
   formation control. We show that the model, when treated as a centralized
   control system, is approximately path-controllable. We establish this
   result by identifying the control model with a related control-affine
   system, and then verifying the Lie algebra rank condition. After that,
   we look into the control model as a decentralized control system. A
   particular pattern of information flow will be considered and a
   decentralized solution that relates to a gradient-like flow will be

Abstract = {{By an undirected rigid formation of mobile autonomous agents is meant a
   formation based on graph rigidity in which each pair of
   ``neighboring{''} agents is responsible for maintaining a prescribed
   target distance between them. In a recent paper, a systematic method was
   proposed for devising gradient control laws for asymptotically
   stabilizing a large class of rigid, undirected formations in
   two-dimensional space assuming all agents are described by kinematic
   point models. The aim of this paper is to explain what happens to such
   formations if neighboring agents have slightly different understandings
   of what the desired distance between them is supposed to be, or
   equivalently, if neighboring agents have differing estimates of what the
   actual distance between them is. In either case, what one would expect
   would be a gradual distortion of the formation from its target shape as
   discrepancies in desired or sensed distances increase. While this is
   observed for the gradient laws in question, something else quite
   unexpected happens at the same time. It is shown that for any
   rigidity-based, undirected formation which is comprised of three or more
   agents, that if some neighboring agents have slightly different
   understandings of what the desired distances between them are suppose to
   be, then almost for certain, the trajectory of the resulting distorted
   but rigid formation will converge exponentially fast to a closed
   circular orbit in two-dimensional space which is traversed periodically
   at a constant angular speed.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the problem of online learning for an ensemble of agents
   clustering incoming data, i. e., the problem of combining online local
   clustering decisions made by distributed agents to improve knowledge and
   accuracy of implicit clusters hidden in the incoming data streams. We
   focus on clustering using the well-known K-means algorithm for numerical
   data due to its efficiency in clustering large data sets. Nevertheless,
   our results can be straightforwardly extended to, e. g., the K-modes
   variant of the K-means algorithm to handle categorical data, as well as
   to other clustering algorithms. We show that the proposed ensemble
   online solutions, which are based on a simple majority-voting scheme,
   converge to the centralized solutions that would be made by a fusion
   center, that is, the solutions resulting from one agent with access to
   all information across agents. Given the dimensions of the clustering
   model, the aforementioned convergence is demonstrated to be achievable
   for relatively small sizes of the ensemble.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of approximately and efficiently computing
   saddle-point values for zero-sum matrix games. This problem arises in
   scenarios where the game's exact value is hard to compute, either
   because the columns of the matrix are revealed incrementally in time, or
   because the game's strategy space is too large for traditional methods
   (e.g., linear programming) to be effective in practice. We leverage the
   established adaptive multiplicative weights algorithm but introduce a
   novel simple criterion to determine whether the minimizer's best
   strategy needs to be approximately re-computed as a new column of the
   matrix is introduced. Our main results are two-fold. First, we show that
   our proposed incremental approach achieves the same accuracy as applying
   the adaptive multiplicative weights algorithm on the entire matrix, if
   known a priori. Secondly, we argue that our approach can be
   computationally more efficient than simply re-computing the minimizer's
   best strategy upon addition of every new column of the matrix.
   Specifically, for the case when the columns of the matrix are generated
   independently and from the same distribution, we characterize the
   probability that the expected number of times the best response is
   re-computed exceeds a given fraction of the total number of columns in
   the matrix. Numerical simulations indicate even more significant
   computational improvement as compared to the analytic result.}},

Abstract = {{In microgrids that are predominantly resistive, real and reactive power
   can be controlled by implementation of voltage and frequency droop laws
   respectively. However, the variable frequency displayed by such a system
   complicates analysis such that design approaches rely on approximations
   and linearized models. In this work, we present a modified form of droop
   control where only the voltage versus real power relationship is upheld
   and the frequency is held constant. Since the frequency is not
   explicitly controlled and the reactive power is not measured, the
   controller can be simplified. In such a setting, the only assumption we
   make is that all inverters have access to a common time-reference.
   Because fixed frequency operation is enforced by design, a variety of
   analytical tools can be leveraged to formulate a comprehensive
   analytical framework which facilitates a precise design methodology. In
   particular, closed-form expressions on the output current phase
   differences are obtained which yield practical selection guidelines on
   the voltage-power droop gains such that reactive flows between inverters
   are kept small. As a corollary, it is demonstrated that there are no
   reactive power flows in the presence of purely resistive loads. For the
   particular case of a single inverter, an almost exact solution
   describing the nonlinear dynamics of the inverter output voltage,
   current, and power are derived. Accompanying simulation results validate
   the analytical results and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
   control approach.}},

Abstract = {{Microgrids formed by a network of power sources and power consumers
   yield significant advantages over the conventional power grid including
   proximity of power consumption to power generation, distributed
   generation, resiliency against wide area blackouts and ease of
   incorporation of renewable energy sources. On the other hand, unlike the
   conventional grid, microgrids are compliant where a single load or a
   single generation unit can often form a significant fraction of the
   total generation capacity. Here large excursions from the nominal
   operating conditions are possible motivating the need for safety
   mechanisms which isolate power electronic equipment from damage.
   Breakers serve the purpose of protecting equipment from surge conditions
   by shutting off, for example, generation units. However in microgrids, a
   loss of a single generation unit can have catastrophic impact on the
   viability of the entire system. Here settings on breakers cannot be
   chosen too conservatively to protect the equipment at the expense of
   system viability or too liberally which will result in equipment damage.
   The ensuing problem of striking a suitable compromise tends to be
   combinatoric in nature due to numerous states of breakers which is
   further exacerbated by an uncertain load profile and nonlinear nature of
   system dynamics. In this article we provide a methodology to determine
   current thresholds and guard times, the time interval when current is
   allowed to exceed threshold value, for each inverter for fail-safe
   operation of microgrid. We employ a machine learning approach to address
   the problem where we first demonstrate that conventional support vector
   machine (SVM) methodology does not yield a satisfactory solution. We
   then develop a one-sided SVM method and generalize it to yield nonlinear
   support boundaries which captures the need for fail-safe operation
   against system blackouts while protecting equipment. A simulation engine
   is developed to model a real microgrid which is used to generate data
   for assessing and guiding our approach.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to gain insight into the equations arising in
   nonlinear filtering, as well as into the feedback particle filter
   introduced in recent research. The analysis is inspired by the optimal
   transportation literature and by prior work on variational formulation
   of nonlinear filtering. The construction involves a discrete-time
   recursion based on the successive solution of minimization problems
   involving the so-called forward variational representation of the
   elementary Bayes' formula. The construction shows that the dynamics of
   the nonlinear filter may be regarded as a gradient flow, or a steepest
   descent, for a certain energy functional with respect to the
   Kullback-Leibler divergence pseudo-metric. The feedback particle filter
   algorithm is obtained using similar analysis. This filter is a
   controlled system, where the control is obtained via consideration of
   the first order optimality conditions for the variational problem. The
   filter is shown to be exact, i. e., the posterior distribution of the
   particle matches exactly the true posterior, provided the filter is
   initialized with the true prior.}},

Abstract = {{The spread of contaminant into the environment due to a high volume of
   leakage from point sources is a very real threat in the modern world.
   Since the contaminant can often be dangerous to human operators,
   multiple robotic agents equipped with suitable sensors are playing an
   increasingly important role in the so-called contaminant detection
   problem than before. This paper proposes a contaminant detection
   methodology which can not only locate the (possibly multiple) source of
   the contaminant, but also estimate the intensity in an environment
   evolving over both space and time. The method can deal with measurement
   noise and does not need any gradient information.}},

Abstract = {{We consider stochastic variational inequality problems where the mapping
   is monotone over a compact convex set. We present two robust variants of
   stochastic extragradient algorithms for solving such problems. Of these,
   the first scheme employs an iterative averaging technique where we
   consider a generalized choice for the weights in the averaged sequence.
   Our first contribution is to show that using an appropriate choice for
   these weights, a suitably defined gap function attains the optimal rate
   of convergence of O (1/root k). In the second part of the paper, under
   an additional assumption of weak-sharpness, we update the stepsize
   sequence using a recursive rule that leverages problem parameters. The
   second contribution lies in showing that employing such a sequence, the
   extragradient algorithm possesses almost-sure convergence to the
   solution as well as convergence in a mean-squared sense to the solution
   of the problem at the rate O (1/k). Motivated by the absence of a
   Lipschitzian parameter, in both schemes we utilize a locally randomized
   smoothing scheme. Importantly, by approximating a smooth mapping, this
   scheme enables us to estimate the Lipschitzian parameter. The smoothing
   parameter is updated per iteration and we show convergence to the
   solution of the original problem in both algorithms.}},

   Our main contribution is a reduced sufficient condition for optimality
   that relies on the nonexistence of conjugate points. We derive
   coordinate formulae for computing conjugate points in the reduced
   Hamiltonian system, and we relate these conjugate points to local
   optimality in the original optimal control problem. These conditions are
   applied to an optimal control problem that can be used to model either a

Abstract = {{We address the problem of stabilizing a continuous-time linear
   time-invariant process under communication constraints. We assume that
   the sensor that measures the state is connected to the actuator through
   a finite capacity communication channel over which an encoder at the
   sensor sends symbols from a finite alphabet to a decoder at the
   actuator. We consider a situation where one symbol from the alphabet
   consumes no communication resources, whereas each of the others consumes
   one unit of communication resources to transmit. This paper explores how
   the imposition of limits on an encoder's bit-rate and average resource
   consumption affect the encoder/decoder/controller's ability to keep the
   process bounded. The main result is a necessary and sufficient condition
   for a bounding encoder/decoder/controller which depends on the encoder's
   bit-rate, its average resource consumption, and the unstable eigenvalues
   of the process.}},

Abstract = {{Triple patterning lithography (TPL) has been recognized as one of the
   most promising techniques for 14/10nm technology node. There are various
   concerns for TPL decompositions. For standard cell based designs,
   assigning the same pattern for the same type of cells is a desired
   property for TPL decomposition. It is more robust for process variations
   and gives the chip similar physical and electrical characteristics as
   well as more reliable and predictable performance. Assigning the same
   type of pattern for the same type of cell is called a constrained
   pattern assignment (CPA) problem. In this paper, we integrated the flow
   of detailed placement and TPL decompositions with CPA coloring
   constraints. We focused on refining a layout to make it CPA-friendly
   during the detailed placement stage while minimizing the area and HPWL
   (half perimeter wire length) overhead. A weighted partial MAX SAT
   approach is proposed which guarantees to obtain a CPA-friendly detailed
   placement result while minimizing the area overhead. An efficient graph

Abstract = {{Common-path-pessimism removal (CPPR) is a pivotal step to achieve
   accurate timing signoff. Unnecessary pessimism might arise
   quality-of-result (QoR) concerns such as reporting worse violations than
   the true timing properties owned by the physical circuit. In other
   words, signoff timing report will conclude a lower clock frequency at
   which circuits can operate than actual silicon implementations.
   Therefore, we introduce in this paper a fast path-based timing analysis
   for CPPR. Unlike existing approaches which are dominated by explicit
   path search, we perform implicit path representation which yields
   significantly smaller search space and faster runtime. Specifically, our
   algorithm is superior in both space and time saving, from which the
   memory storage and important timing quantities are available in constant
   space and constant time per path during the search. Experimental results
   on industrial benchmarks released from TAU 2014 timing analysis contest
   have shown that our algorithm won the first place and achieved the best
   result in terms of accuracy and runtime over all participating teams.}},

Abstract = {{The recent TAU computer-aided design (CAD) contest has aimed to seek
   novel ideas for accurate and fast clock network pessimism removal
   (CNPR). Unnecessary pessimism forces the static-timing analysis (STA)
   tool to report worse violation than the true timing properties owned by
   physical circuits, thereby misleading signoff timing into a lower clock
   frequency at which circuits can operate than actual silicon
   implementations. Therefore, we introduce in this paper UI-Timer, a
   powerful CNPR algorithm which achieves exact accuracy and ultra-fast
   runtime. Unlike existing approaches which are dominated by explicit path
   search, UI-Timer proves that by implicit path representation the amount
   of search effort can be significantly reduced. Our timer is superior in
   both space and time saving, from which memory storage and important
   timing quantities are available in constant space and constant time per
   path during the search. Experimental results on industrial benchmarks
   released from TAU 2014 CAD contest have justified that UI-Timer achieved
   the best result in terms of accuracy and runtime over all participating
   timers.}},

Abstract = {{Physically Asynchronous/Logically Synchronous (PALS) is an architecture
   pattern that allows developers to design and verify a system as though
   all nodes executed synchronously. The correctness of PALS protocol was
   formally verified. However, the implementation of PALS adds additional
   code that is otherwise not needed. In our case, we have a middleware
   (PALSWare) that supports PALS systems. In this paper, we introduce a
   verification framework that shows how we can apply Software Model
   Checking (SMC) to verify a PALS system at the source code level. SMC is
   an automated and exhaustive source code checking technology. Compared to
   verifying (hardware or software) models, verifying the actual source
   code is more useful because it minimizes any chance of false
   interpretation and eliminates the possibility of missing software bugs
   that were absent in the model but introduced during implementation. In
   other words, SMC reduces the semantic gap between what is verified and
   what is executed.
   Our approach is compositional, i.e., the verification of PALSWare is
   done separately from applications. Since PALSWare is inherently
   concurrent, to verify it via SMC we must overcome the statespace
   explosion problem, which arises from concurrency and asynchrony. To this
   end, we develop novel simplification abstractions, prove their
   soundness, and then use these abstractions to reduce the verification of
   a system with many threads to verifying a system with a relatively small
   number of threads. When verifying an application, we leverage the
   (already verified) synchronicity guarantees provided by the PALSWare to
   reduce the verification complexity significantly. Thus, our approach
   uses both ``abstraction{''} and ``composition{''}, the two main
   techniques to reduce statespace explosion. This separation between
   verification of PALSWare and applications also provides better
   management against upgrades to either. We validate our approach by
   verifying the current PALSWare implementation, and several
   PALSWare-based distributed real time applications.}},

   use a hierarchical architecture with intermediary nodes collecting and
   relaying the data securely from measurement devices back to the power
   operator. While the data collectors verify the integrity, they are not
   given access to the content, which may also pave the way for third party
   providers to deliver valueadded services or even the data collection
   itself. We also report some preliminary experimental results from a

Abstract = {{At the tipping of a paradigm shift in the way energy is produced,
   transmitted and delivered, the research efforts have not been paralleled
   by the curricular development. With rapid pace of changes in the field
   of Smart Grid (SG), the traditional research and educational efforts
   have been a major domain for electrical engineers. As a mode of
   discovery and education, interdisciplinarity facilitates broadened
   perspectives, ability to synthesize, analyze, integrate, and apply
   knowledge, and out-of-the-box thinking. The major contributions of this
   paper are discussion of requirements of the educational efforts in SG
   with special emphasis on multidisciplinarity, survey of the related
   work, which is the first in the literature to the best of our knowledge,
   and a discussion of the content for such an effort. A mixed team of
   power engineers and computer scientists are developing a layered
   curriculum starting from the introductory material from a variety of SG
   topics. A distinguishing advantage is the availability of many software
   tools and the state-of-the-art testbed as a result of years of research.}},

Abstract = {{The energy sector worldwide has embarked on a transformational process
   to modernize the over-a-century-old power grid under an umbrella term of
   the Smart Grid. This vast infrastructural upgrade and operational change
   involves integration of a variety of advanced digital computing,
   communications and industrial control technologies. This brings new
   capabilities, but also necessitates a re-education of the aging
   workforce and training of the emerging workforce. While training does
   exist, the training approach and the accessibility of that training is
   often at odds with the needs of the utilities.
   To support this education and training need, in this paper we introduce
   the beginning of a modular, hands-on and open Smart Grid cybersecurity
   educational training platform and supporting materials together with an
   assessment of a preliminary version leveraged at the Trustworthy Cyber
   Infrastructure for the Power Grid (TCIPG) Summer School held in 2013.
   We base pedagogical pillars onto: (1) Active Learning that promotes
   analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of the content from Bloom's
   taxonomy, (2) The theory of project-based learning, (3) Piaget's
   learn-by-doing posture, and (4) Constructivist perspective of education.
   The main goal of this effort is to develop a complete, phased, and
   modular learning platform to provide the essential base knowledge and
   hands-on training exercises for understanding and demonstrating
   competency in Smart Grid cybersecurity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the problem of placing small cell base
   stations (SCBSs) in adversarial heterogeneous wireless networks. We
   consider a continuum of wireless users facing potential eavesdropping
   and jamming attacks. For each such attack, we first propose a suitable
   utility function for the wireless users. Then, we propose a novel
   optimal placement algorithm for finding the optimal locations of the
   SCBSs given the underlying security considerations. In eavesdropping
   scenarios, we consider the prospective eavesdroppers to be spread over a
   given region. The SCBSs are then placed in such a way to minimize the
   eavesdroppers' effect without having any information about their exact
   locations. In jamming scenarios, we consider a cost constrained jammer
   to be present in the network. The SCBSs are then placed in order to
   minimize the effect of the jammer's signal on the quality of the user's
   transmission. We simulate the developed algorithm for both types of
   attacks and for various network configurations. Simulation results show
   that the proposed solution approach yields significant improvements in
   the spatial SINR of all users when compared with conventional placement
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Many techniques in signal and image processing exploit the sparsity of
   natural signals in a transform domain or dictionary. Adaptive synthesis
   dictionaries have been shown to be useful in applications such as signal
   denoising, and compressed sensing. More recently, the data-driven
   adaptation of sparsifying transforms has received some interest. The
   sparsifying transform model allows for exact and cheap computations. In
   this work, we propose a framework for online learning of square
   sparsifying transforms. Such online learning can be particularly useful
   when dealing with big data, and for signal processing applications such
   as real-time sparse representation and denoising. The proposed online
   transform learning algorithm is shown to have a much lower computational
   cost than online synthesis dictionary learning. The sequential learning
   of a sparsifying transform also typically converges faster than batch
   mode transform learning. Preliminary experiments show the usefulness of
   the proposed schemes for sparse representation, and denoising.}},

Abstract = {{Online learning on a graph is appealing due to its efficiency. However,
   existing online learning algorithms on a graph are limited to binary
   classification. Moreover, they require accessing the full label
   information, where the label oracle needs to return the true class label
   after the learner makes classification of each node. In many application
   scenarios, we only have access to partial label information, where the
   label oracle will return a single bit indicating whether the prediction
   is correct or not, instead of the true class label. This is also known
   as bandit feedback. In this paper, to overcome the above limitations of
   existing online learning algorithms on a graph, we study online learning
   on a graph for multi-class node classification, in both the full
   information setting and the partial information setting. First, we
   present an online multiclass classification algorithm in the full
   information setting. It is based on function learning on a graph using
   the spectral information of the graph Laplacian. We show that it attains
   O(cd log T) regret bound, where T is the number of rounds in online
   learning, c is the number of classes, and d is the number of
   eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian used for learning. Second, we
   present an online multi-class classification algorithm with bandit
   feedback. We use upper-confidence bound technique to trade off the
   exploration and exploitation of label information. We show that it
   attains O(cd root T log T) regret bound, which is only a root T factor
   worse than the proposed algorithm in the full information setting.
   Experiments on several benchmark graph datasets show that the proposed
   online multi-class classification algorithm beats the state-of-art
   baseline, and the proposed bandit algorithm is also much better than the
   bandit version of the baseline.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse matrix-vector and multi-vector multiplications (SpMV and SpMM)
   are performance bottlenecks operations in numerous HPC applications. A
   variety of SpMV GPU kernels using different matrix storage formats have
   been developed to accelerate these applications. Unlike SpMV, where
   matrix elements are accessed only once, multiplying by k vectors
   requires accessing matrix elements k times. In this paper we explore the
   design of efficient GPU SpMM kernels that exploit two common matrix
   sparsity patterns; diagonal matrices and matrices with uniform row
   lengths. Our kernels use GPU registers to exploit the potential data
   reuse in SpMM. For evaluating the performance of our SpMM kernels we use
   28 structured matrices and 29 matrices with uniform row lengths.
   Executing on the NVIDIAs Kepler-based Tesla K20 GPU and for structured
   grid matrices, the average speedup over the best performing state of the
   art SpMV kernel including NVIDIA's kernels is 2.3x and the maximum is
   4.6x. For unstructured mesh matrices, the average speedup is 2.6x and
   the maximum is 4.1x. Compared to NVIDIA's cuSPARSE SpMM kernel the
   average speedup is 1.8x and the maximum is 2.4x for structured grid

Abstract = {{The sparsity of images in a transform domain or dictionary has been
   widely exploited in image processing. Compared to the synthesis
   dictionary model, sparse coding in the (single) transform model is
   cheap. However, natural images typically contain diverse textures that
   cannot be sparsified well by a single transform. Hence, we propose a
   union of sparsifying transforms model, which is equivalent to an
   overcomplete transform model with block cosparsity (OCTOBOS). Our
   alternating algorithm for transform learning involves simple closed-form
   updates. When applied to images, our algorithm learns a collection of
   well-conditioned transforms, and a good clustering of the patches or
   textures. Our learnt transforms provide better image representations
   than learned square transforms. We also show the promising denoising
   performance and speedups provided by the proposed method compared to
   synthesis dictionary-based denoising.}},

   which can be viewed as a multi frame deconvolution problem involving
   multiple objects, is formulated as a maximum posterior estimation
   problem, and solved using a fixed-point algorithm. The performance of
   the proposed technique is illustrated for EUV spectral imaging through

   of his/her task-performances. First, we briefly introduce our assistive
   human-robot interaction (HRI) interface and a virtual fixture as
   backgrounds related to this research. The designed HRI interface
   provides assistance by actively constraining the user-control with a
   virtual fixture. Second, we discuss a way to model a user's
   driving-characteristics in a steering task. In modeling the
   driving-characteristics, we use techniques from inverse optimal control
   (IOC), where known basis functions (speed, steering, and proximities to
   inner/outer road boundary) are employed to design a cost function.
   Third, we describe the experimental setup and procedures to obtain
   user-demonstrated data from human subjects. Utilizing the obtained data
   sets, we infer the unknown parameter vector by solving inverse optimal
   control. Afterward, the user's driving-characteristics are expressed in
   terms of the balances of the inferred parameters, allowing us to find a
   relationship between the modeled driving-characteristics and
   task-completion time. Finally, we present a method to set a virtual

Abstract = {{We study the problem of minimizing the total distance incurred in
   assigning a group of mobile robots to an equal number of static targets.
   Assuming that the robots have limited, range-based communication and
   target-sensing capabilities, we present a necessary and sufficient
   condition for ensuring distance optimality when robots and targets are
   uniformly randomly distributed. We then provide an explicit,
   non-asymptotic formula for computing the number of robots needed for
   guaranteeing optimality in terms of the robots' sensing and
   communication capabilities with arbitrarily high probabilities. The
   bound given in the formula is also asymptotically tight. Due to the
   large number of robots needed for high-probability optimality guarantee,
   we continue to investigate strategies for cases in which the number of
   robots cannot be freely chosen. We show that a properly designed
   strategy can be asymptotically optimal or suboptimal with constant
   approximation ratios.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method on the motion and path planning for
   unicycle robots in environments with static circular obstacles. The
   method employs a family of 2-dimensional analytic vector fields, which
   have singular points of high-order type and whose integral curves
   exhibit various patterns depending on the value of a parameter lambda.
   More specifically, for a known value of lambda the vector field has a
   unique singular point of dipole type and its integral curves are
   suitable for steering the unicycle to a goal configuration. Furthermore,
   for the value of lambda that the vector field has a continuum of
   singular points, the integral curves can be used to define flows around
   circular obstacles. An almost global feedback motion plan is then
   constructed by suitably blending attractive and repulsive vector fields
   in a static obstacle environment. The proposed motion planning and
   control design is also extended to the multi-agent case, where each
   agent needs to converge to a desired configuration while avoiding
   collisions with other agents. The efficacy of the approach is
   demonstrated via simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the shape of a
   planar elastic rod (e. g., a thin flexible strip of metal) using images
   of the rod. This is done by treating configurations of the elastic rod
   as solutions of a geometric optimal control problem. The necessary
   conditions for optimality provide coordinates over which to perform
   inference, and the sufficient conditions provide the gradient of the
   shape of the rod with respect to these coordinates. This optimal control
   formulation allows for configurations of the rod to be represented as
   points in a finite-dimensional space without having to discretize the
   shape of the rod. We consider the estimation problem with and without
   fiducial markers attached to the rod. Results from both simulations and
   hardware experiments demonstrate the ability of our approach to track
   the shape of a deforming elastic rod.}},

Abstract = {{Inverse optimal control is the problem of computing a cost function with
   respect to which observed trajectories of a given dynamic system are
   optimal. In this paper, we present a new formulation of this problem for
   the case where the dynamic system is differentially flat. We show that a
   solution is easy to obtain in this case, in fact reducing to
   finite-dimensional linear least-squares minimization. We also show how
   to make this solution robust to model perturbation, sampled data, and
   measurement noise, as well as provide a recursive implementation for
   online learning. Finally, we apply our new formulation of inverse
   optimal control to model human locomotion during stair ascent. Given
   sparse observations of human walkers, our model predicts joint angle
   trajectories for novel stair heights that compare well to motion capture
   data (R-2 = 0.97; RMSE = 1.95 degrees). These exemplar trajectories are
   the basis for an automated method of tuning controller parameters for
   lower-limb prosthetic devices that extends to locomotion modes other

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of decentralized goal assignment and
   trajectory generation for multi-robot networks when only local
   communication is available, and proposes an approach based on methods
   related to switched systems and set invariance. A family of
   Lyapunov-like functions is employed to encode the (local) decision
   making among candidate goal assignments, under which the agents pick the
   assignment which results in the shortest total distance to the goals. An
   additional family of Lyapunov-like barrier functions is activated in the
   case when the optimal assignment may lead to colliding trajectories,
   thus maintaining system safety while preserving the convergence
   guarantees. The proposed switching strategies give rise to feedback
   control policies which are scalable as the number of agents increases,
   and therefore are suitable for applications including first-response
   deployment of robotic networks under limited information sharing.
   Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{To facilitate more efficient control, massive amounts of sensors or
   measurement devices will be deployed in the Smart Grid. Data collection
   then becomes non-trivial. In this paper, we study the scenario where a
   data collector is responsible for collecting data from multiple
   measurement devices, but only some of them can communicate with the data
   collector directly. Others have to rely on other devices to relay the
   data. We first develop a communication protocol so that the data
   reported by each device is protected again honest-but-curious data
   collector and devices. To reduce the time to collect data from all
   devices within a certain security level, we formulate our approach as an
   integer linear programming problem. As the problem is NP-hard, obtaining
   the optimal solution in a large network is not very feasible. We thus
   develop an approximation algorithm to solve the problem. We test the
   performance of our algorithm using real topologies. The results show
   that our algorithm successfully identifies good solutions within
   reasonable amount of time.}},

Abstract = {{The growing reliance on Cyber technology for Smart Grid and other
   Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) applications increases high assurance
   challenges. Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is a critical part of
   smart grid and failure to address security risks in it might disrupt
   utilities in their mission to deliver power reliably. The objective of
   this paper is to find mitigation actions for attacks that might be
   launched against AMI. The paper introduces a tool called SecAMI that
   calculates the relationship between the speed at which an attack
   spreads, the speed at which it can be detected, and the consequences on
   the availability of the AMI. The results from SecAMI can be used as a
   performance metric to significantly improve the development and the
   deployment of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in an AMI environment.
   Experimental results with an IDS called Amilyzer show that centralized
   IDS might not work efficiently in scalable systems comparing with
   distributed IDS in term of detection time, especially with a Distributed
   Denial of Service (DDoS) attack or remote disconnects on the AMI.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple-target tracking with a microphone array is often addressed via
   the Bayesian filtering framework. For compact arrays, each source is
   represented by its direction-of-arrival (DOA), which evolves on the unit
   sphere. The unique topology of this space leads to analytical
   intractabilities that are often resolved via costly particle-based
   methods.
   In this paper, we derive a novel, deterministic inference algorithm
   called the von Mises-Fisher Filter (vMFF) for a dynamical system model
   defined on the sphere, and extend it to the multi-source scenario in the
   Factorial vMFF (FvMFF). We apply sensor fusion and probabilistic data
   association techniques to handle clutter and data association
   ambiguities in the observation set. We show that the vMFF combines the
   computational efficiency of a Kalman filter with the tracking accuracy
   of a particle filter to perform well across all noise levels. Finally,
   we apply the FvMFF to track multiple speakers in a reverberant
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a coupled small-scale electrothermal model for
   characterizing AlGaN/GaN HEMTs under direct current (DC) and alternating
   current (AC) power conditions for various duty cycles. The calculated
   electrostatic potential and internal heat generation data are then used
   in a large-scale mechanics model to determine the development of stress
   due to the inverse piezoelectric and thermal expansion effects. The
   electrical characteristics of the modeled device were compared to
   experimental measurements for validation as well as existing simulation
   data from literature. The results show that the operating conditions
   (bias applied and AC duty cycle) strongly impact the temperature within
   the device and the stress fluctuations during cyclic pulsing conditions.
   The peak stress from the inverse piezoelectric effect develops rapidly
   with applied bias and slowly relaxes as the joule heating increases the
   device temperature during the on state of the pulse leading to cyclic
   stresses in operation of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns about climate change and energy costs are key drivers in the
   growth of Battery Vehicle (BV) utilization. In the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)
   paradigm, an aggregation of BVs is used for the provision of energy and
   capacity services, including ancillary services to the grid.
   Participation in the V2G framework may entail additional charge and
   discharge of the BV batteries, leading to reduced life. In this paper,
   we discuss the formulation of an effective strategy for the aggregator,
   whose role in the effective implementation of the V2G framework is
   pivotal, to manage the aggregated vehicles, so as to maximize the total
   lifetimes of all the batteries in the aggregated BVs.
   The proposed management strategy makes use of both the state of charge
   (s.o.c.) and the state of health (s.o.h.) as key variables in the
   allocation of the service request to the BV batteries. Each service
   request is considered in terms of its impacts on both the individual and
   the entire BV aggregation battery health, so to allocate the service
   provision in the configuration that determines the least decrement in
   battery life. We explicitly assume the aggregator is responsible for the
   acquisition and maintenance of the batteries of the aggregated BVs and
   so the maximization of the aggregation battery life is simply the
   preservation of the value of the aggregator's assets. We illustrate the
   effectiveness of the approach with simulation results that indicate the
   success in battery life preservation, with notable improvement over the
   cases based solely on the use of s.o.c. as the key variable.}},

Abstract = {{The recent, deepening penetration of variable energy resources (VERs)
   subjects power systems to the highly variable, rapidly changing and
   uncertain generation outputs that the operators must manage effectively
   to provide reliable service. Such variability poses additional
   challenges to the management of the continual variability in system
   loads. Consequently, the frequency regulation service requirements are
   substantially increased over those for systems without these VERs. The
   attractive rapid response and fast ramping capability characteristics of
   flywheel energy storage (FES) technology can be exploited in the FES
   deployment for frequency regulation service provision. Such deployment
   requires the effective management of the limited FES capacity and
   storage capability. In this paper, we construct optimized frequency
   regulation service offer strategies for an FES unit into the day-ahead
   markets (DAMs) and their associated real-time markets (RTMs). An
   independent grid operator (IGO) procures the service competitively
   through such offers. The FES offer strategies are obtained from the
   deployment of a robust optimization approach, which explicitly considers
   the uncertain nature of automatic generation control (AGC) signals and
   the amount of FES stored energy. The optimization objective is to
   maximize the FES service provision into the DAMs and the RTMs. To meet
   this objective, the FES offers only into particular DAMs and provides
   additional frequency regulation service in the RTMs by taking advantage
   of the most recent information of FES stored energy, even in those hours
   in which the FES does not participate in the DAMs. A salient
   characteristic of the proposed offer strategies is that all offered
   services are guaranteed to be provided, regardless of the actual AGC
   signals. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies with
   simulation studies that use PJM Interconnection historical AGC signal
   data. Representative results indicate that the proposed FES offer
   strategies result in guaranteed service provision without any
   exceptions. Such service provision represents a major improvement over
   that under the conventional strategy that offers the full FES capacity
   into each DAM but satisfies, on average, only 47.7 \% of the regulation
   service requests. We also study the impacts of the Federal Energy
   Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order No. 764 that allows DAM periods
   shorter than one hour. Specifically, we quantify the significant
   benefits emanating from the flexibility for limited storage capability
   devices such as FES units in frequency regulation service provision via
   simulation studies.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism by which fracture partitions between intergranular and
   ``quasi-cleavage{''} in a hydrogen embrittled lath martensitic steel has
   been examined. Intense plasticity is found under both intergranular and
   ``quasi-cleavage{''} fracture surfaces with differencing slip band
   orientation relative to lath structures. In the intergranular fracture
   case, slip bands are parallel to the longitudinal direction of laths and
   the intersection between the slip bands and the interface is inclined to
   the prior austenite grain boundary, whereas in the ``quasi-cleavage{''}
   fracture case, slip bands are inclined to the longitudinal direction of
   laths and the intersection is inclined with respect to the lath
   boundaries. Further, greater hydrogen accumulation is visualized in the
   vicinity of a grain boundary on a ``quasi-cleavage{''} fracture surface.
   It is posited that local stress and hydrogen concentration provide for
   hydrogen-enhanced and plasticity-mediated failure by decohesion at prior
   austenite grain and lath boundaries. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of anisotropy on fatigue crack growth was studied using the
   stress intensity factor range in single crystal specimens. The material
   tested was the nickel based superalloy Haynes 230. Two different crystal
   orientations were cyclically loaded. Once a crack was observed, the
   entire loading and unloading process was optically recorded and the
   evolution of the displacements around the crack tip was obtained in
   terms of digital image correlation. Stress intensity factor ranges
   (Delta K-I and ), together with T-stress, were extracted using a
   least-squares regression algorithm, based on the theoretical crack tip
   displacement in an anisotropc body. DIC displacements included crack
   closure effects, allowing the direct measurement of the effective stress
   intensity factor ranges. Crack propagation in the {[}001] crystal was
   only driven by Delta K-I, since the displacement field around the crack
   tip was symmetric and no AKii was measured On the other hand, the
   displacement field around crack tip in {[}111] crystal showed an
   asymmetric displacement profile, highlighting the presence of Mode II
   sliding. As expected, Delta K-II measured by regression was found to be
   higher than Delta K-I: this result was due to the crack angle, which was
   55 degrees. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{As software evolves, problematic changes can significantly degrade
   software performance, i.e., ntroducing performance regression.
   Performance regression testing is an effective way to reveal such issues
   in early stages. Yet because of its high overhead, this activity is
   usually performed infrequently. Consequently, when performance
   regression issue is spotted at a certain point, multiple commits might
   have been merged since last testing. Developers have to spend extra time
   and efforts narrowing down which commit caused the problem. Existing
   efforts try to improve performance regression testing efficiency through
   test case reduction or prioritization.
   In this paper, we propose a new lightweight and white-box approach,
   performance risk analysis (PRA), to improve performance regression
   testing efficiency via testing target prioritization. The analysis
   statically evaluates a given source code commit's risk in introducing
   performance regression. Performance regression testing can leverage the
   analysis result to test commits with high risks first while delaying or
   skipping testing on low-risk commits.
   To validate this idea's feasibility, we conduct a study on 100
   real-world performance regression issues from three widely used,
   open-source software. Guided by insights from the study, we design PRA
   and build a tool, PerfScope. Evaluation on the examined problematic
   commits shows our tool can successfully alarm 91\% of them. Moreover, on
   600 randomly picked new commits from six large-scale software, with our
   tool, developers just need to test only 1422\% of the 600 commits and
   will still be able to alert 87-95\% of the commits with performance
   regression.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure sensitive paint (PSP) is useful for measurements of wall
   pressure in high speed flows, but can be used in an alternative manner
   in low-speed flows as a gas species concentration detector. Film cooling
   technology studies have been greatly aided by this use of PSP through
   use of a mass transfer analogy to determine the adiabatic film cooling
   effectiveness. The PSP technique allows measurements that have high
   spatial resolution at high enough sampling rate that a good statistical
   mean can be determined rapidly. Due to the potential of this technique
   to deliver high quality adiabatic effectiveness measurements, a detailed
   analysis of its associated uncertainty is presented herein. In this
   study, an ambient temperature low speed wind tunnel drives air as the
   main flow while carbon dioxide (CO2, DR=1.5) is used as the
   ``coolant{''} gas, though the experiments are done under isothermal
   conditions. A detailed analysis of the technique is performed here with
   focus on the measurement uncertainty and process uncertainty for a film
   cooling study using an array of five cylindrical holes spaced across the
   span of a flat test plate at a spacing of three diameters
   center-to-center. The final analysis indicates that the total
   uncertainty depends strongly on the local behavior of the coolant, with
   near-field uncertainty as high as 5\% at isolated points. In the
   far-field, the total uncertainty is more uniform throughout the
   measurement domain and generally lower, at about 3\%.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes a micromechanics methodology based upon a local
   failure criterion incorporating the strong effects of plastic strain on
   cleavage fracture coupled with statistics of microcracks. A central
   objective is to gain some understanding on the role of plastic strain on
   cleavage fracture by means of a probabilistic fracture parameter and how
   it contributes to the cleavage failure probability. A parameter analysis
   is conducted to assess the general effects of plastic strain on fracture
   toughness correlations for conventional SE(B) specimens with varying
   crack size over specimen width ratios. Another objetive is to evaluate
   the effectiveness of the modified Weibull stress ((sigma) over tilde
   (w)) model to correct effects of constraint loss in PCVN specimens which
   serve to deteiniine the indexing temperature, T-0, based on the Master
   Curve methodology. Fracture toughness testing conducted on an A285 Grade
   C pressure vessel steel provides the cleavage fracture resistance (J(c))
   data needed to estimate T-0. Very detailed non-linear finite element
   analyses for 3-D models of plane-sided SE(B) and PCVN specimens provide
   the evolution of near-tip stress field with increased macroscopic load
   (in terms of the J-integral) to define the relationship between (sigma)
   over tilde (w) and J. For the tested material, the Weibull stress
   methodology yields estimates for the reference temperature, T-0, from
   small fracture specimens which are in good agreement with the
   corresponding estimates derived from testing of much larger crack
   configurations.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to introduce the constrained
   discrete-time state dependent Riccati equation (CD-SDRE) technique for
   decentralized multi-agent systems. First, a D-SDRE for tracking control
   is derived analytically. Then, the latter is utilized in formulating the
   distributed D-SDRE control law. The constraint problem of the
   D-SDRE/distribued D-SDRE is then addressed by recasting it into a model
   predictive control (MPC) problem. Solution of the latter is then carried
   out using particle swarm optimization (PSO), which facilitates
   estimation of the states and control inputs for the D-SDRE control law
   calculation. The use of decentralized CD-SDRE scheme in a networked
   system in the presence of constraints is then systematically
   demonstrated by applying this scheme to reconfiguration problems of
   spacecraft formation flying under constrained actuation. Simulation
   results demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed CD-SDRE
   in the decentralized control of the spacecraft formation flying.}},

Abstract = {{There are many challenging aspects of the design of multiple flyby,
   low-thrust trajectories. One of the most significant, from the point of
   view of a numerical optimizer, can be the characteristic time scale of
   the dynamical system. Trajectories in a setting with a short
   characteristic time scale (i.e. those occurring in the vicinity of
   Mercury or the Jovian moons) are more challenging to optimize than those
   with a longer time scale (i.e. trajectories to the outer solar system)
   because the spacecraft must often perform many revolutions about the
   central body as well as several flyby maneuvers. This paper introduces
   modifications that can be made to a multiple flyby trajectory optimizer
   employing the Sims-Flanagan transcription to improve its performance on
   challenging problems. These improvements include full specification of
   the problem Jacobian sparsity pattern and analytical expressions for
   many of its entries as well as refinements to how the problem
   constraints are scaled. The improvements are then quantified by solving
   two challenging problems: a Jovian moon rendezvous and a notional solar
   electric mission to Mercury.}},

Abstract = {{In the code area, crash barrier walls on city bridges suffer from severe
   exposure to concrete aggressive substances such as de-icing salts,
   freezing and thawing cyclic action and impact like action. Such elements
   often show insufficient durability when built using conventional
   reinforced concrete. First, this article conducts an on-the-spot
   investigation of the current situation of reinforced concrete crash
   barrier walls on Harbin city bridges, which are of different ages, and
   puts forward a design concept of fabricated protective plate based on
   rapid repair of concrete crash barrier walls on city bridges. It gives
   the design size of protective plates, the basic requirements of
   performance target design, material mixing and the implementation of the
   installation technology for the protective plates. The new protection
   method will provide references for the high speed retrofitting of
   reinforced concrete crash barrier walls for city bridges in this code

Abstract = {{Universal outlier hypothesis testing is studied in a sequential setting.
   Multiple observation sequences are collected, a small subset of which
   are outliers. A sequence is considered an outlier if the observations in
   that sequence are generated by an ``outlier{''} distribution, distinct
   from a common ``typical{''} distribution governing the majority of the
   sequences. Apart from being distinct, the outlier and typical
   distributions can be arbitrarily close. The goal is to design a
   universal test to best discern all the outlier sequences. A universal
   test with the flavor of the repeated significance test is proposed and
   its asymptotic performance is characterized under various universal
   settings. The proposed test is shown to be universally consistent. For
   the model with identical outliers, the test is shown to be
   asymptotically optimal universally when the number of outliers is the
   largest possible and with the typical distribution being known, and its
   asymptotic performance otherwise is also characterized. An extension of
   the findings to the model with multiple distinct outliers is also
   discussed. In all cases, it is shown that the asymptotic performance
   guarantees for the proposed test when neither the outlier nor typical
   distribution is known converge to those when the typical distribution is
   known.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider resource allocation in the 3GPP Long Term
   Evolution (LTE) cellular uplink (UL), which will be the most widely
   deployed next generation cellular uplink. The key features of the 3GPP
   LTE uplink are that it is based on a modified form of the orthogonal
   frequency division multiplexing-based multiple access (OFDMA), which
   enables channel dependent frequency selective scheduling, and that it
   allows for multiuser (MU) scheduling wherein multiple users can be
   assigned the same time-frequency resource. In addition to the
   considerable spectral efficiency improvements that are possible by
   exploiting these two features, the LTE UL allows for transmit antenna
   selection together with the possibility to employ advanced receivers at
   the base-station, which promise further gains. However, several
   practical constraints that seek to maintain a low signaling overhead are
   also imposed. In this paper, we show that the resulting resource
   allocation problem is APX-hard and then propose a local ratio test
   (LRT)-based constant-factor polynomial-time approximation algorithm. We
   then propose two enhancements to this algorithm as well as a sequential
   LRT-based MU scheduling algorithm that offers a constant-factor
   approximation and is another useful choice in the complexity versus
   performance tradeoff. Further, user preselection, wherein a smaller pool
   of good users is preselected and a sophisticated scheduling algorithm is
   then employed on the selected pool, is also examined. We suggest several
   such user preselection algorithms, some of which are shown to offer
   constant-factor approximations to the preselection problem. Detailed
   evaluations reveal that the proposed algorithms and their enhancements
   offer significant gains.}},

   during the evolution of the system and a dynamic quantizer is used. It
   is proved that if the quantization error is small enough then the
   proposed controller ensures convergence of the state of a
   hyper-minimum-phase system to an arbitrarily small vicinity of the

Abstract = {{Fabrication of nano/micro-scale functional devices oftentimes involves
   multiple steps. In the context of a continuous or semi-continuous
   manufacturing process, each fabrication step is performed successively
   in multiple localized zones. As the substrate or the web traverses
   downstream in the process flow, proper registration of the pre-existing
   features is necessary prior to entering the next fabrication zone in
   order to accurately complement previous manufacturing steps. By
   performing a direct observation of the pre-existing feature using
   machine vision, the uncertainty of the feature location can be
   circumvented. In this paper, a two-layer feedback architecture with a
   vision sensor in the outer loops is used to visually servo the
   pre-existing feature on the web. Additionally, the feedback controller
   is augmented with Norm Optimal Iterative Learning Control (NOILC) to
   improve the position tracking and tension regulation of the web.
   Simulation and experimental results show the advantages of implementing
   NOILC in the R2R system.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of using either grouped observations of a
   counting process over a period or prescribed constant mean counts to
   create an intensity function for a Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process
   (NHPP) that estimates the observed process, and satisfies several
   constraints. First, we require that the estimator's mean value over an
   observation interval be equal to the mean number of observations in that
   interval; second, we require that the intensity function be continuous;
   third, we require that the function be piecewise linear. Optionally, we
   may also require that the intensity value at the end of the period be
   identical to the intensity value at the beginning of the period, for
   application in contexts in which the period of interest is inherently
   cyclic, e.g., a day, or a week. An objective of the estimator is that it
   should be ``smooth,{''} which will be defined subsequently. Our approach
   is to define a class of continuous piecewise-linear intensity functions
   and formulate the problem as a constrained quadratic programming
   problem, approachable through the solution of a simultaneous set of
   linear equations. We describe the method, identify conditions under
   which feasible solutions are assured to exist, and study the behavior of
   the solutions on an example problem.}},

   minimizes the value gap. We investigate the effects of the
   organization's risk aversion, the number of potential decision
   alternatives, and the distribution of the alternatives on both the value
   gap and the optimal target. The distribution of the alternatives is
   modeled with a copula based method. The results show that the optimal
   target (i) decreases as the risk aversion increases; (ii) increases as
   the number of available alternatives increase; and (iii) decreases as
   the alternatives approach some efficient frontier. We discuss the
   rationale and implications for the simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Computer exploits often involve an attacker being able to compromise a
   sequence of hosts, creating a chain of ``stepping stones{''} from his
   source to ultimate target. Stepping stones are usually necessary to
   access well-protected resources, and also serve to mask the attacker's
   location. This paper describes means of constructing models of networks
   and the access control mechanisms they employ to approach the problem of
   finding which stepping stone paths are easiest for an attacker to find.
   While the simplest formulation of the problem can be addressed with
   deterministic shortest-path algorithms, we argue that consideration of
   what and how an attacker may (or may not) launch from a compromised host
   pushes one towards solutions based on Monte Carlo sampling. We describe
   the sampling algorithm and some preliminary results obtained using it.}},

   distribution in model-based methods, and then use a direct gradient
   search on the parameter space to update the sampling distribution. To
   improve the computational efficiency, we further develop a two-timescale
   updating scheme that updates the parameter on a slow timescale and
   estimates the quantities involved in the parameter updating on a fast
   timescale. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) concept has been around for some time and
   applications such as transportation, health-care, education, travel,
   smart grid, retail, are and will be major benefactors of this concept.
   However, only recently, due to technological advances in sensor devices
   and rich wireless connectivity, Internet of Things at scale is becoming
   reality. For example, Cisco's Internet of Things Group predicts over 50
   billion connected sensory devices by 2020.
   In this talk, we will discuss the Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT) since
   several game-changing technological advances happened on mobile things'
   such as mobile phones, trains, and cars, where rich sets of sensors,
   connected via diverse sets of wireless Internet technologies, are
   changing and influencing how people communicate, move, and download and
   distribute information. In this space, challenges come from the needs to
   determine (1) contextual information such as location, duration of
   contact, density of devices, utilizing networked sensory information;
   (2) higher level knowledge such as users' activity detection, mood
   detection, applications usage pattern detection and user interactions on
   `mobile things', utilizing contextual information; and (3) adaptive and
   real-time parallel and distributed architectures that integrate context,
   activity, mood, usage patterns into mobile application services on
   mobile `things'. Solving these challenges will provide enormous
   opportunities to improve the utility of mobile `things', optimizing
   scarce resources on mobile `things' such as energy, memory, and
   bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{GPU performance depends not only on thread/warp level parallelism (TLP)
   but also on instruction-level parallelism (ILP). It is not enough to
   schedule instructions within basic blocks, it is also necessary to
   exploit opportunities for ILP optimization beyond branch boundaries.
   Unfortunately, modern GPUs cannot dynamically carry out such
   optimizations because they lack hardware branch prediction and cannot
   speculatively execute instructions beyond a branch.
   We propose to circumvent these limitations by adapting Trace Scheduling,
   a technique originally developed for microcode optimization. Trace
   Scheduling divides code into traces (or paths), and optimizes each trace
   in a context-independent way. Adapting Trace Scheduling to GPU code
   requires revisiting and revising each step of microcode Trace Scheduling
   to attend to branch and warp behavior, identifying instructions on the
   critical path, avoiding warp divergence, and reducing divergence time.
   Here, we propose ``Warp-Aware Trace Scheduling{''} for GPUs. As
   evaluated on the Rodinia Benchmark Suite using dynamic profiling, our
   fully-automatic optimization achieves a geometric mean speedup of 1.10x
   on a real system by increasing instructions executed per cycle (IPC) by
   a harmonic mean of 1.12x and reducing instruction serialization and
   total instructions executed.}},

Abstract = {{Predictive design analytics is a new paradigm to enable design engineers
   to extract knowledge from large-scale, multidimensional, unstructured,
   volatile data, and transform the knowledge and its trend into design
   decision making. Predictive, data driven family design (PDFD) is
   proposed as one of the predictive design analytics methods to tackle
   some issues in family design. First, a number and specifications of
   product architectures are determined by data (not by pre-defined market
   segments) in order to maximize expected profit. A trade-off between
   price and cost in terms of the quantity and specifications of
   architectures helps to set the target in the enterprise level. k-means
   clustering is used to find architectures that minimize within
   architecture sum of squared errors. Second, a price prediction method as
   a function of product performance and deviations between performance and
   customer requirements is suggested with exponential smoothing based on
   innovations state space models. Regression coefficients are treated as
   customer preferences over product performance, and analyzed as a time
   series. Prediction intervals are proposed to show market uncertainties.
   Third, multiple values for common parameters in family design can be
   identified using the expectation maximization clustering so that
   multiple platform design can be explored. Last, large-scale data can be
   handled by the PDFD algorithm. A data set which contains a total of 14
   million instances is used in the case study. The design of a family of
   universal electronic motors demonstrates the proposed approach and
   highlights its benefits and limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Systems that can be, reconfigured are valuable in situations where a
   single artifact must perform several different functions well, and are
   especially important in cases where system demands are not known a
   priori. Design of reconfigurable systems present unique challenges
   compared to fixed system design. Increasing reconfigurable capability
   improves system utility, but also increases system complexity and cost.
   In this article a new design strategy is presented for the design of
   reconfigurable systems for multiability. This study is limited to
   systems where all system functions are known a priori, and only
   continuous means of reconfiguration are considered. Designing such a
   system requires determination of (1) what system features should be re
   configurable, and (2) what should the range of reconfigurability of
   these features be. The new design strategy is illustrated using a
   reconfigurable delta robot, which is a parallel manipulator that can be
   adapted to perform a variety of manufacturing operations. In this case
   study the tradeoff between end effector stiffness and speed is
   considered over two separate manipulation tasks.}},

   seasonal period analysis, segmentation analysis, time series analysis,
   and predictive LCA. A newly developed segmentation algorithm can

Abstract = {{In this computational study, a light-weight dynamic device is
   investigated for passive energy reversal from the lowest frequency mode
   to the high frequency modes of a large-scale frame structure for rapid
   shock mitigation. The device is based on the single-sided vibro-impact
   mechanism. It has two functions for passive energy transfer: a nonlinear
   energy sink (NES) for local energy dissipation and an energy pump to
   high frequency modes where a significant amount of the shock energy is
   rapidly dissipated. As a result, a significant portion of the shock
   energy induced into the linear dynamic structure can be passively
   reversed from the lowest frequency mode to the high frequency modes and
   rapidly dissipated by their modal damping. The amount of the energy
   dissipated by the modal damping of the high frequency modes can be
   controlled by the amount of inherent damping in the device. Ideally, the
   device can passively reverse up to 80\% of the input shock energy from
   the lowest frequency mode to the high frequency modes when its damping
   is assumed to be zero and its impact coefficient of restitution is equal
   to unity. The shock energy redistribution between this device and the
   high frequency modes is found to be efficient for rapid shock Mitigation
   in the considered 9-story dynamic structure.}},

Abstract = {{Rotational nonlinear energy sinks (NESs) have been proposed to mitigate
   the response of underlying primary structures subjected to shock
   loading. This type of NES, which is composed of a passive mass that is
   free to rotate, has the potential to be easier to realize and more
   compact than other types of NESs. Like other types of NESs, these
   devices engage in targeted energy transfer, which allows for the
   broadband transfer of energy from the primary structure to the NES where
   it can be rapidly dissipated. Additionally, these devices can couple the
   dynamics of the primary structure and facilitate the transfer of energy
   from lower modes to higher modes, where it can be dissipated at a faster
   rate. This paper experimentally investigates the performance of this
   type of NES by using the results from tests of a rotational NES attached
   to a small-scale two-story structure. For these experiments, a shock
   load is provided to the primary structure using a shake-table-produced
   impulse-like ground motion. Additionally, by varying the amplitude of
   the input ground motion, the energy dependency of the performance of
   these devices can be investigated. The results of these experiments show
   that this type of NES can attenuate the response of a structure by
   responding in a highly effective rotational mode.}},

Abstract = {{Designers frequently use examples during the design process as a way to
   provide a visual framework, allow for reinterpretation and allow for
   evaluation of design ideas. Although the use of examples is an important
   part of the design process, little is known about how designers retrieve
   these examples or the characteristics of the example set designers
   collect for a given project. Knowledge of this behavior is important, as
   research has shown that using examples too similar to the design problem
   or too familiar to the designer can cause design fixation and hinder
   creativity. Therefore, the current study was conducted to provide
   insights into these example retrieval processes by monitoring 18
   professional designers during a 90-minute design task complemented by
   surveys and interviews for an in-depth understanding of user behavior.
   We relate our results to research on design fixation and provide
   implications for the development of example finding tools.}},

   similar to 50 mu m and in the range 55 similar to 65 mu m, respectively.
   It is also found that the average indentation modulus of old ITZ is
   70\%similar to 80\% of that of old paste matrix, while the average
   indentation modulus of new ITZ is 80\%similar to 90\% of that of new
   paste matrix. Additionally, the influences of mix proportion, aggregate
   types and hydration age on the properties of ITZs in RAC are discussed
   in this study. With the increase of hydration age, the new ITZ thickness
   appears to be reduced and the nanomechanical properties at new ITZ tends
   to became higher because of the development of hydrates with the age.}},

Abstract = {{Many sparse matrix computations can be speeded up if the matrix is first
   reordered. Reordering was originally developed for direct methods but it
   has recently become popular for improving the cache locality of parallel
   iterative solvers since reordering the matrix to reduce bandwidth and
   wavefront can improve the locality of reference of sparse matrix-vector
   multiplication (SpMV), the key kernel in iterative solvers.
   In this paper, we present the first parallel implementations of two
   widely used reordering algorithms: Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) and
   Sloan. On 16 cores of the Stampede supercomputer, our parallel RCM is
   5.56 times faster on the average than a state-of-the-art sequential
   implementation of RCM in the HSL library. Sloan is significantly more
   constrained than RCM, but our parallel implementation achieves a speedup
   of 2.88X on the average over sequential HSL-Sloan. Reordering the matrix
   using our parallel RCM and then performing 100 SpMV iterations is twice
   as fast as using HSL-RCM and then performing the SpMV iterations; it is
   also 1.5 times faster than performing the SpMV iterations without
   reordering the matrix.}},

Abstract = {{High-frequency ultrasound is a promising method for non-invasive
   characterization of cartilage degeneration. Surface reflection and
   integrated spectral parameters are often used. In the work described
   here, human cartilage samples with varying degrees of degeneration were
   measured using a 40-MHz transducer. Backscatter signals originating from
   the superficial and transitional zones of cartilage were analyzed using
   amplitude, spectral and envelope statistical parameters and related to
   degenerative changes of the matrix given by the Mankin score. The
   results indicate an increased sensitivity of spectral slope and envelope
   statistical parameters to early matrix degeneration compared with
   conventional amplitude parameters. Furthermore, moderate correlations of
   chondrocyte number with backscatter amplitude and envelope statistics
   were observed, suggesting that at high frequencies, cells are one
   important scattering source in cartilage. An application of spectral and
   envelope statistical parameters to intra-articular ultrasound
   arthroscopy is conceivable and could improve the diagnostic potential of
   these examinations. Future studies are necessary to clarify the
   contributions of chondrocytes, extracellular matrix and collagen content
   to ultrasound backscatter to further improve the diagnostic potential of
   ultrasound for cartilage assessment. (C) 2014 World Federation for

Abstract = {{Novel manufacturing process are more and more used to produce advanced
   structural materials such as the gamma titanium aluminide alloys
   (gamma-TiAl). In this work we examine a Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb alloy obtained
   with an additive manufacturing technique by Electron Beam Melting (EBM)
   by conducting monotonic and cyclic loading experiments both on tension
   and compression samples to investigate the influence of the
   microstructure in strain accumulation process by fatigue loading. The
   residual strain maps corresponding to different applied stress levels,
   number of cycles and microstructures are obtained through the use of
   high resolution Digital Image Correlation (DIC). The strain maps were
   overlaid with the images of the microstructure and detailed analyses
   were performed to investigate the features of the microstructure where
   high local strain heterogeneities arise. Such experiments, conducted
   ex-situ at room temperature, allow to characterize the effect of
   different microstructures on the strain accumulation process, providing
   additional information into the effect of the lamellar and equiaxed
   grains and also to capture the evolution of the local deformation
   process for TiAl. The measure of the residual strains provides further
   information on the role of the intermetallic phases on the fatigue
   behavior of gamma-TiAl alloys. The comparison with the strain
   accumulation in fully lamellar microstructure with larger grain size
   permits to highlight the influence of the position of grain boundaries
   and the orientation of the lamellae for the onset of fatigue cracking.
   The analysis and comparison of the strain maps provide information for
   the selection of the microstructural parameters during material design
   (i.e. grain size and lamellar grains volume fraction). (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Analyses of nuclear reactor safety have increasingly required coupling
   of full three dimensional neutron kinetics (NK) core models with system
   transient thermal-hydraulics (TH) codes. In order to produce results
   within a reasonable computing time, the coupled codes use two different
   spatial description of the reactor core. The TH code uses few, typically
   5-20 TH channels, to represent the core. The NK code uses one explicit
   node for each fuel assembly. Therefore, a spatial mapping of a coarse
   grid TH and a fine grid NK domain is necessary. However, improper
   mappings may result in loss of valuable information, thus causing
   inaccurate prediction of safety parameters. In this article the study of
   the effectiveness of spatial coupling (channel -refinement and spatial
   mapping) and developed recommendations for NK/TH mapping are presented.
   The sensitivity of stability (measured by Decay Ratio and Frequency) to
   the different types of mapping schemes is analyzed against OECD/NEA
   Ringhals-1 Stability Benchmark data. Additionally, to increase the
   efficiency and applicability of spatial mapping convergence, a new
   mapping methodology is proposed. The new mapping approach is based on
   hierarchical clustering method; the method of unsupervised learning that
   is adopted in many different scientific fields, thanks to its
   flexibility and robustness. The proposed new mapping method is shown to
   be very successful for spatial coupling problem and can be fully
   automated allowing for significant time reduction in input preparation
   and mapping convergence study. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Passivated n-p co-doping of niobium and nitrogen was successfully
   incorporated into self-organized TiO2 nanotube arrays by anodizing Ti-Nb
   alloys, followed with the heat treatment in a flow of ammonia gas. Nb
   was doped into TiO2 nanotube arrays during the anodization by
   substituting Ti4+ with Nb5+, while Nb was doped into TiO2 nanotube
   arrays during the heat treatment by substituting O2- with N3-. Since Nb
   in TiO2 enhanced the adsorption of NH3 molecules onto the nanotube
   arrays, Nb doping was found to promote the subsequent N doping into the
   anatase lattice. As predicted by first-principles band structure
   calculations, Nb/N co-doped titanium oxide nanotube arrays demonstrated
   a largely enhanced visible light response and visible light
   photocatalytic performance on the degradation of methylene blue,
   compared to TiO2 nanotube arrays or TiO2 nanotube arrays with either
   dopant. The passivated n-p co-doping approach may also be applied to
   other material systems and promise a wide range of technical
   applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{295-302}},

Abstract = {{Recent measurements of nano-aluminum combustion in which burning time
   and peak particle temperature are measured simultaneously have suggested
   that heat transfer models currently used for burning nanoparticles may
   significantly overestimate heat losses during combustion. By applying
   conventional non-continuum heat transfer correlations to burning
   nano-aluminum particles, the observed peak temperatures, which greatly
   exceed the ambient temperature, should only be observable if the burning
   time were very short, of the order of 1 mu s, whereas the observed
   burning time is two orders of magnitude larger. These observations can
   be reconciled if the energy accommodation coefficient for these
   conditions is of the order of 0.005, which is the value suggested by
   Altman, instead of approximately unity, which is the common assumption.
   Experimental data obtained in the heterogeneous shock tube under a wide
   array of conditions are compared with basic heat transfer models, and
   the agreement of both peak temperature values and emission intensity
   traces for low energy accommodation coefficients supports the hypothesis
   of Altman and co-workers. (C) 2013 The Combustion Institute. Published

Journal = {{MATERIALS LETTERS}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Diluted magnetic semiconductors have attracted considerable attention
   for potential applications in spintronics. Morphology and microstructure
   exert strong, but complicated, effects upon ferromagnetic behavior. To
   partially unravel such effects, the present work compares room
   temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) in Mn-doped anatase TiO2 films
   synthesized by two different atomic layer deposition protocols, leading
   to either nanopillars or more conventional columnar grains. RTFM is
   largely unaffected by this difference for undoped material, but
   nanopillaring greatly increases both the coercive field (100 Oe) and
   saturation magnetization (14-21 emu/cm(3)) for Mn doping up to 2.7 at\%.
   Nanopillaring seems to enhance the congregation of defect-related bound
   magnetic polarons near grain boundaries, thereby increasing RTFM. (C)

Title = {{Development of plastic nonlinear waves in one-dimensional ductile
   granular chains under impact loading}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{29-37}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A modified split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) was used to load
   one-dimensional ``granular chains of metallic spheres under impact
   loading rates. These homogeneous chains, comprised of brass spherical
   beads ranging from a single sphere to a chain of sixteen, are of
   interest because of their unique wave propagation characteristics. In
   the elastic range, for loads around 10 s of N, nonlinear elastic
   solitary waves have been observed to form. In this work, loading
   magnitudes spanning from 9 kN to 40 kN - considerably higher than most
   previous works on these systems which have been conducted in the elastic
   regime - cause the granular chains to severely deform plastically. The
   aim of this study is to identify whether a nonlinear solitary-type wave
   will be generated under such high load levels, and if so, under what
   conditions (e.g., chain length, load level, etc.) it will do so. The
   propagating pulse was found to assume a distinctive shape after
   travelling through five beads, similar to the elastic case where
   solitary waves are realized with a traveling wavelength of five bead
   diameters. The wave speed of the plastic pulses observed here was seen
   to depend on maximum force, indicating that indeed it is a nonlinear
   wave in nature and is comparable to the elastic solitary wave. Locally,
   the plastic dissipation at every contact point through the chains was
   studied by measuring the residual plastic contact area. It was found
   that after the formation of the plastic nonlinear solitary wave had
   occurred there is also decreasing plastic deformation along the chain
   length except at the end beads in contact with the SHPB, which rebound
   into the SHPB bar causing larger plastic dissipation locally. To our
   knowledge this research is the first effort to investigate in detail the
   development and evolution of solitary-like waves in the plastic regime
   and will form the basis of future work in this area. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Pages = {{50-60}},

Abstract = {{A real space approach is developed based on template matching for
   quantitative lattice analysis using atomic resolution Z-contrast images.
   The method, called TeMA, uses the template of an atomic column, or a
   group of atomic columns, to transform the image into a lattice of
   correlation peaks. This is helped by using a local intensity adjusted
   correlation and by the design of templates. Lattice analysis is
   performed on the correlation peaks. A reference lattice is used to
   correct for scan noise and scan distortions in the recorded images.
   Using these methods, we demonstrate that a precision of few picometers
   is achievable in lattice measurement using aberration corrected
   Z-contrast images. For application, we apply the methods to strain
   analysis of a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) grown LaMnO3 and SrMnO3
   superlattice. The results show alternating epitaxial strain inside the
   superlattice and its variations across interfaces at the spatial
   resolution of a single perovskite unit cell. Our methods are general,
   model free and provide high spatial resolution for lattice analysis. (C)

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Several methods have been used to introduce sulfur containing groups in
   glass fiber supported activated carbon fibers (ACFs). The chemical and
   physical properties of these sulfur treated ACFs have been evaluated to
   determine their mercury adsorption capacities. Although sulfur
   impregnations decreased surface area and pore volume of ACFs, Hg uptake
   capacities increased when compared to raw ACF samples. For our
   sulfur-treated samples, sulfur atoms were incorporated into the carbon
   matrix in the form of sulfide and sulfate. The sulfide groups appeared
   to be more effective for mercury removal than sulfate. A possible
   mechanism for mercury adsorption, which is likely to involve the
   oxidation process of Hg degrees, is also discussed. Besides the effects

Abstract = {{This article describes the application of an absorbing boundary
   condition for truncating finite element meshes in the analysis of
   phased-array antennas. For a plane wave incident on a planar boundary at
   a certain specified angle, this boundary condition can be tuned to be
   reflectionless for all frequencies and polarizations. To demonstrate its
   application, this boundary condition is implemented in the dual-primal
   finite-element tearing and interconnecting method for simulation of
   large-scale phased-array antennas. A good performance is achieved in
   terms of accuracy and convergence of the numerical solution. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new loss function for neural network
   classification, inspired by the recently proposed similarity measure
   called Correntropy. We show that this function essentially behaves like
   the conventional square loss for samples that are well within the
   decision boundary and have small errors, and L-o or counting norm for
   samples that are outliers or are difficult to classify. Depending on the
   value of the kernel size parameter, the proposed loss function moves
   smoothly from convex to non-convex and becomes a close approximation to
   the misclassification loss (ideal 0-1 loss). We show that the
   discriminant function obtained by optimizing the proposed loss function
   in the neighborhood of the ideal 0-1 loss function to train a neural
   network is immune to overfitting, more robust to outliers, and has
   consistent and better generalization performance as compared to other
   commonly used loss functions, even after prolonged training. The results
   also show that it is a close competitor to the SVM. Since the proposed
   method is compatible with simple gradient based online learning, it is a
   practical way of improving the performance of neural network
   classifiers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present an exact and efficient algorithm for
   reaction-diffusion-nucleation processes on a 2D-lattice. The algorithm
   makes use of first passage time (FPT) to replace the computationally
   intensive simulation of diffusion hops in KMC by larger jumps when
   particles are far away from step-edges or other particles. Our approach
   computes exact probability distributions of jump times and target
   locations in a closed-form formula, based on the eigenvectors and
   eigenvalues of the corresponding 1D transition matrix, maintaining
   atomic-scale resolution of resulting shapes of deposit islands. We have
   applied our method to three different test cases of electrodeposition:
   pure diffusional aggregation for large ranges of diffusivity rates and
   for simulation domain sizes of up to 4096 x 4096 sites, the effect of
   diffusivity on island shapes and sizes in combination with a KMC edge
   diffusion, and the calculation of an exclusion zone in front of a
   step-edge, confirming statistical equivalence to standard KMC
   simulations. The algorithm achieves significant speedup compared to
   standard KMC for cases where particles diffuse over long distances
   before nucleating with other particles or being captured by larger
   islands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To understand how thermocapillary forces manipulate the droplet motion
   in a confined microchannel, a lattice Boltzmann phase-field model is
   developed to simulate immiscible thermocapillary flows with
   consideration of fluid-surface interactions. Based on our recent work of
   Liu et al., 2013 {[}54], an interfacial force of potential form is
   proposed to model the interfacial tension force and the Marangoni
   stress. As only the first-order derivatives are involved, the proposed
   interfacial force is easily combined with the wetting boundary condition
   to account for fluid-surface interactions. The hydrodynamic equations
   are solved using a multiple-relaxation-time algorithm with the
   interfacial force treated as a forcing term, while an additional
   convection-diffusion equation is solved by a passive-scalar approach to
   obtain the temperature field, which is coupled to the interfacial
   tension by an equation of state. The model is first validated against
   analytical solutions for the thermocapillary-driven convection in two
   superimposed fluids at negligibly small Reynolds and Marangoni numbers.
   It is then demonstrated to produce the correct equilibrium contact angle
   for a binary fluid with different viscosities when a constant
   interfacial tension is taken into account. Finally, we numerically
   simulate the thermocapillary flows for a microfluidic droplet adhering
   on a solid wall and subject to a simple shear flow when a laser is
   applied to locally heat the fluids, and investigate the influence of
   contact angle and fluid viscosity ratio on the droplet dynamical
   behavior. The droplet motion can be completely blocked provided that the
   contact angle exceeds a threshold value, below which the droplet motion
   successively undergoes four stages: constant velocity, deceleration,
   acceleration, and approximately constant velocity. When the droplet
   motion is completely blocked, three steady vortices are clearly visible,
   and the droplet is fully filled by two counter-rotating vortices with
   the smaller one close to the external vortex. The thermocapillary
   convection is strengthened with decreasing viscosity ratio of the
   droplet to the carrier fluid. For low viscosity ratios, the droplet
   motion is completely blocked and exhibits the similar behavior, but the
   structure of the internal vortices is more complicated at the lowest
   viscosity ratio. For high viscosity ratios, the droplet motion is
   partially blocked and undergoes a series of complex transitions, which
   can be explained as a result of the dynamically varying Marangoni
   forces. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluidic platforms provide several advantages for liquid-liquid
   extraction (LLE) processes over conventional methods, for example with
   respect to lower consumption of solvents and enhanced extraction
   efficiencies due to the inherent shorter diffusional distances. Here, we
   report the development of polymer-based parallel-flow microfluidic
   platforms for LLE. To date, parallel-flow microfluidic platforms have
   predominantly been made out of silicon or glass due to their
   compatibility with most organic solvents used for LLE. Fabrication of
   silicon and glass-based LLE platforms typically requires extensive use
   of photolithography, plasma or laser-based etching, high temperature
   (anodic) bonding, and/or wet etching with KOH or HF solutions. In
   contrast, polymeric microfluidic platforms can be fabricated using less
   involved processes, typically photolithography in combination with
   replica molding, hot embossing, and/or bonding at much lower
   temperatures. Here we report the fabrication and testing of microfluidic
   LLE platforms comprised of thiolene or a perfluoropolyether-based
   material, SIFEL, where the choice of materials was mainly guided by the
   need for solvent compatibility and fabrication amenability. Suitable
   designs for polymer-based LLE platforms that maximize extraction
   efficiencies within the constraints of the fabrication methods and
   feasible operational conditions were obtained using analytical modeling.
   To optimize the performance of the polymer-based LLE platforms, we
   systematically studied the effect of surface functionalization and of
   microstructures on the stability of the liquid-liquid interface and on
   the ability to separate the phases. As demonstrative examples, we report
   (i) a thiolene-based platform to determine the lipophilicity of caffeine
   and (ii) a SIFEL-based platform to extract radioactive copper from an
   acidic aqueous solution. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   The process initiates through the reduction of alpha-Fe2O3 to

   to nanocrystalline BCC Fe. During delithiation, the reactions proceed
   via conversion of Fe to Fe2O3. However, a nanocrystalline structure

Abstract = {{Hardness, oxidation resistance and adhesion have traditionally been the
   most important parameters for material selection and optimization of
   hard, wear resistant coatings. More recently, thermal conductivity has
   become a focus of research, as it has the potential to have a
   significant effect on coating performance. Even though new experimental
   methods have become available to characterize thermal conductivity,
   recent studies focused on existing material systems, and there have been
   few attempts to design coating thermal conductivity for specific
   applications. We study thermal conductivity of arc evaporation
   oxynitride coatings with the composition CrN1 - xOx and TiN1 - xOx (x =
   0 ... 0.4). With increasing substitution of nitrogen by oxygen, thermal
   conductivity could gradually be reduced from 9W m(-1) K-1 to 2.5W m(-1)
   K-1 in CrN1 - xOx and from 35 to 5W m(-1) K-1 in TiN1 - xOx. A model
   that assumes a constant phonon scattering cross-section of the oxygen
   concentration can explain the observed functional relationship. Other
   properties such as thermal stability, oxidation resistance and hardness
   of these oxynitrides show little variation with oxygen concentration,
   clearing the way to design functional coatings with specific thermal
   properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{The electrostatic potential profile of a spherical soft particle is
   derived by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equations on a spherical system
   both numerically and analytically. The soft particle is assumed to
   consist of an ion-permeable charged outer layer and a non-permeable
   charged core with constant charged density. The contribution of the core
   to the potential profile is calculated for different charges and
   dielectric constants. Our results show that the charged core heavily
   influences the local potential within the soft particle. By contrast,
   the potential distribution outside the particle in the salt solution is
   found to be weakly dependent on the core features. These findings are
   consistent with previous experiments showing the minor impact of the

Abstract = {{Biodegradable polymer microparticles are promising delivery depots for
   protein therapeutics due to their relatively simple fabrication and
   facile administration. Double-wall microspheres (DWMS) comprising a core
   and shell made of two distinct polymers may provide enhanced control of
   the drug release profiles. Using precision particle fabrication (PPF)
   technology, monodisperse DWMS were fabricated with model protein bovine
   serum albumin (BSA)-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) core and
   drug-free poly(D, L-lactic acid) (PDLL) shell of uniform thickness.
   Monolithic single-wall microspheres were also fabricated to mimic the
   BSA-loaded PLG core. Using ethyl acetate and dichloromethane as
   shell-and core-phase solvents, respectively, BSA was encapsulated
   selectively in the core region within DWMS with higher loading and
   encapsulation efficiency compared to using dichloromethane as core and
   shell solvents. BSA in vitro release rates were retarded by the presence
   of the drug-free PDLL shell. Moreover, increasing PDLL shell thickness
   resulted in decreasing BSA release rate. With a 14-mu m thick PDLL
   shell, an extended period of constant-rate release was achieved. (C)

Abstract = {{The Center for Plasma-Material Interaction (CPMI) has developed
   innovative coating method of evaporative coating at atmospheric pressure
   (ECAP). This new idea is an atmospheric-pressure-based process.
   Following the similar concept as the laser-assisted plasma coating at
   atmospheric pressure (LAPCAP) {[}1], the material captured by the plasma
   plume is atomic in nature (the evaporated metal atom) and should
   therefore end up deposited molecule-by-molecule as in a PVD fashion. By
   using the thermal energy from the microwave plasma, solid 99.99\% +
   purity aluminum were evaporated and then produce a PVD-like alumina
   coating on a work piece. The aluminum target was inserted in the center
   of the microwave torch feeding a melt pool and evaporated into the
   surrounding plasma plume. A bottle neck was made in the antenna and
   could reduce the heat loss by 84\%, thus allowing higher temperatures to
   exist in the sample-holder antenna tip. Gas shielding was used to keep
   the work gas pure. The film was deposited as Al2O3 using oxygen from the
   environment. Deposition rate was around 2 mu m/min. Gas flow rate around
   the antenna tip was about 0.9 m/s, and the temperature of the plasma was
   about 1400 degrees C at 1350 W input power from simulations. Alpha and
   other metastable phases of aluminum oxide were found on the deposited
   films. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pyroelectric materials have been widely used for a range of
   thermal-related applications including thermal imaging/sensing, waste
   heat energy conversion, and electron emission. In general, the figures
   of merit for applications of pyroelectric materials are proportional to
   the pyroelectric coefficient and inversely proportional to the
   dielectric permittivity. In this context, we explore single-layer and
   compositionally graded PbZr1-xTixO3 thin-film heterostructures as a way
   to independently engineer the pyroelectric coefficient and dielectric
   permittivity of materials and increase overall performance.
   Compositional gradients in thin films are found to produce large strain
   gradients which generate large built-in potentials in the films that can
   reduce the permittivity while maintaining large pyroelectric response.
   Routes to enhance the figures of merit of pyroelectric materials by 3-12
   times are reported, and comparisons to standard materials are made.}},

Abstract = {{We present the mechanical properties of H2O(n)@C60 under hydrostatic

   we performed mechanical tests under both tension and compression. The
   bulk modulus and elastic modulus increase as the number of water
   molecules increases. For fracture behavior, two mechanisms are observed:
   First, under compression, due to the interaction and bond formation
   between water and C60, structures with more water molecules begin to
   exhibit fracture at a lower strain. Second, under tension, fracture is
   initiated from the bond dissociation of C-C bonds on the C60 surface.

   tube confinement and interchain entanglement elasticity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{The phenomenological reptation-tube model is based on a single chain
   perspective and was originally proposed to explain the remarkable
   viscoelastic properties of dense entangled polymer liquids. However,
   simulations over the last two decades have revealed a fundamental
   tension in the model: it assumes that bonded, single-chain backbone
   stresses are the sole polymer contribution to the slowly relaxing
   component of stress storage and elasticity, but mounting evidence
   suggests that at the local level of forces it is interchain
   contributions that dominate, as in simple liquids. Here we show that
   based on a chain model constructed at the level of self-consistently
   determined primitive paths, an explicit force-level treatment of the
   correlated intermolecular contributions to stress that arise from chain
   uncrossability can essentially quantitatively predict the entanglement
   plateau modulus associated with the soft rubbery response of polymer
   liquids. Analogies to transient localization and elasticity in
   glass-forming liquids are identified. Predictions for the effect of
   macroscopic deformation and anisotropic orientational order on the tube
   diameter are also made. Based on the interchain stress perspective the
   theory reproduces some aspects of the rheological response to shear and
   extensional deformations associated with the single chain tube model.

Title = {{Azimuthal anisotropy of pi(0) and eta mesons in Au plus Au collisions at
   root s(NN)=200 GeV}},

Abstract = {{The azimuthal anisotropy coefficients v2 and v4 of p 0 and. mesons are
   measured in Au + Au collisions at root s(NN) = 200 GeV as a function of
   transverse momentum p(T) (1-14 GeV/c) and centrality. The extracted v(2)
   coefficients are found to be consistent between the two meson species
   over the measured p(T) range. The ratio of v(4)/v(2)(2) for pi(0) mesons
   is found to be independent of p(T) for 1- 9 GeV/c, implying a lack of
   sensitivity of the ratio to the change of underlying physics with p(T).
   Furthermore, the ratio of v(4)/v(2)(2) is systematically larger in
   central collisions, which may reflect the combined effects of
   fluctuations in the initial collision geometry and finite viscosity in
   the evolving medium.}},

Abstract = {{Grain boundaries induce heterogeneities in the deformation response of
   polycrystals. Studying these local variations in response, measured
   through high resolution strain measurement techniques, is important and
   can improve our understanding of fatigue damage initiation in the
   vicinity of grain boundaries and material hardening. In this work,
   strain fields across grain boundaries were measured using advanced
   digital image correlation techniques. In conjunction with strain
   measurements, grain orientations from electron back-scattered
   diffraction were used to establish the dislocation reactions at each
   boundary, providing the corresponding residual Burgers vectors due to
   slip transmission across the interfaces. A close correlation was found
   between the magnitude of the residual Burgers vector and the local
   strain change across the boundary. When the residual Burgers vector
   magnitude (with respect to the lattice spacing) exceeds 1.0, the high
   strains on one side of the boundary are paired with low strains across
   the boundary, indicating the difficulties for slip dislocations to
   penetrate the grain interfaces. When the residual Burgers vector
   approaches zero, the strain fields vary smoothly across the boundary due
   to limited resistance to slip transmission. The results suggest that the
   residual Burgers vector magnitude, which relates to the GB (Grain
   Boundary) resistance to slip transmission, enables a quantitative
   analysis of the accumulation of strain at the microstructural level and
   the development of strain heterogeneities across grain boundaries. The
   results are presented for FeCr bcc alloy which exhibits single slip per
   grain making the measurements and dislocation reactions rather
   straightforward. The work points to the need to incorporate details of
   slip dislocation grain boundary interaction (slip transmission) in
   modeling research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When inserted into lipid bilayers, synthetic channels formed by cyclic
   peptides of alternated D- and L-alpha-amino acids have been shown to
   modulate the permeability of the cell wall, thereby endowing them with
   potential bactericidal capability. Details of the underlying energetics
   of the permeation events remain, however, only fragmentary. Water
   conduction in a peptide nanotube formed by eight cyclo-(LW)(4) subunits
   embedded in a fully hydrated palmitoyloleylphosphatidylcholine bilayer
   has been investigated using molecular-dynamics simulations with a
   time-dependent bias. The topology of the reconstructed free-energy
   landscape delineating the transport of water mirrors the arrangement of
   the cyclic peptides in the open-ended tubular structure. Within the
   nanotube, the small, periodic free-energy barriers, on the order of
   k(B)T, arising between adjacent peptide subunits, are suggestive of
   unhampered translocation. It still remains that translational diffusion
   of water in the hollow cylindrical cavity is necessarily affected by its
   interaction with the accessible polar moieties of the constituent D- and
   L-alpha-amino acids. By combining diffusivity measurements with the
   free-energy landscape, we put forth a reaction-rate theory to describe
   the conduction kinetics of water inside the peptide nanotube.}},

Abstract = {{Polymeric composite microspheres consisting of a
   poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) core surrounded by a
   poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PDLLA) shell layer were successfully fabricated
   by coaxial electrohydrodynamic atomization (CEHDA) process. Process
   conditions, including nozzle voltage and polymer solution flow rates, as
   well as solution parameters, such as polymer concentrations, were
   investigated to ensure the formation of composite microspheres with a
   doxorubicin-loaded PLGA core surrounded by a relatively drug-free PDLLA
   shell layer. Various microsphere formulations were fabricated and
   characterized in terms of their drug distribution, encapsulation
   efficiency and in vitro release. Numerical simulation of CEHDA process
   was performed based on a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model in
   Fluent by employing the process conditions and fluid properties used in
   the experiments. The simulation results were compared with the
   experimental work to illustrate the capability of the CFD model to
   predict the production of consistent compound droplets, and hence, the
   expected core-shell structured microspheres. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Woody biochar monolith with ultra-high carbon content and highly ordered
   macropores has been prepared via one-pot pyrolysis and carbonization of
   red cedar wood at 750 degrees C without the need of post-treatment.
   Energy-dispersive spectroscope (EDX) and scanning electron microscope
   (SEM) studies show that the original biochar has a carbon content of 98
   wt\% with oxygen as the only detectable impurity and highly ordered
   macroporous texture characterized by alternating regular macroporous
   regions and narrow porous regions. Moreover, the hierarchically porous
   biochar monolith has a high BET specific surface area of approximately
   400 m(2) g(-1). We have studied the monolith material as supercapacitor
   electrodes under acidic environment using electrochemical and surface
   characterization techniques. Electrochemical measurements show that the
   original biochar electrodes have a potential window of about 1.3 V and
   exhibit typical rectangular-shape voltammetric responses and fast
   charging-discharging behavior with a gravimetric capacitance of about 14
   F g(-1). Simple activation of biochar in diluted nitric acid at room
   temperature leads to 7 times increase in the capacitance (115 F g(-1)).
   Because the HNO3-activation slightly decreases rather than increases the
   BET surface area of the biochar, an increase in the coverage of surface
   oxygen groups is the most likely origin of the substantial capacitance
   improvement. This is supported by EDX, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS), and Raman measurements. Preliminary life-time studies show that
   biochar supercapacitors using the original and HNO3-activated electrodes
   are stable over 5000 cycles without performance decays. These facts
   indicate that the use of woody biochar is promising for its low cost and
   it can be a good performance electrode with low environmental impacts
   for supercapacitor applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Vegetative Filter Strips (VFS) have long been used to control the
   movement of agricultural nutrients and prevent them from reaching
   receiving waters. Earlier studies have shown that VFS also dramatically
   reduce both the kinetics and extent of Cryptosporidium parvum (C parvum)
   oocysts overland transport. In this study, we investigated possible
   mechanisms responsible for the ability of VFS to reduce oocyst overland
   transport. Measurement of the kinetics of C. parvum adhesion to
   individual sand, silt, and clay soil particles revealed that oocysts
   associate over time, albeit relatively slow, with clay but not silt or
   sand particles. Measurement of oocyst overland transport kinetics, soil
   infiltration depth, distance of travel, and adhesion to vegetation on
   bare and vegetated soil surfaces indicate that oocysts move more slowly,
   and penetrate the soil profile to a greater extent on a vegetated
   surface than on a bare soil surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate a small
   fraction of the oocysts become attached to vegetation at the
   soil-vegetation interface on VFS. These results suggest VFS function to
   reduce oocyst overland transport by primarily decreasing oocyst surface
   flow enough to allow penetration within the soil profile followed by
   subsequent adhesion to or entrapment within clay particle aggregates,
   and to a lesser extent, adhesion to the surface vegetation. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A fundamental question connecting terrestrial ecology and global climate
   change is the sensitivity of key terrestrial biomes to climatic
   variability and change. The Amazon region is such a key biome: it
   contains unparalleled biological diversity, a globally significant store
   of organic carbon, and it is a potent engine driving global cycles of
   water and energy. The importance of understanding how land surface
   dynamics of the Amazon region respond to climatic variability and change
   is widely appreciated, but despite significant recent advances, large
   gaps in our understanding remain. Understanding of energy and carbon
   exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere can be
   improved through direct observations and experiments, as well as through
   modeling activities. Land surface/ecosystem models have become important
   tools for extrapolating local observations and understanding to much
   larger terrestrial regions. They are also valuable tools to test
   hypothesis on ecosystem functioning. Funded by NASA under the auspices
   of the LBA (the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in
   Amazonia), the LBA Data Model Intercomparison Project (LBA-DMIP) uses a
   comprehensive data set from an observational network of flux towers
   across the Amazon, and an ecosystem modeling community engaged in
   ongoing studies using a suite of different land surface and terrestrial
   ecosystem models to understand Amazon forest function. Here an overview
   of this project is presented accompanied by a description of the
   measurement sites, data, models and protocol. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This study analyzes the inter-annual variability (IAV) of simulations of
   21 different land surface model formulations, driven by meteorological
   conditions measured at 8 flux towers, located in rain forest,
   forest-savanna ecotone and pasture sites in Amazonia, and one in savanna
   site in Southeastern Brazil. Annual totals of net ecosystem exchange
   (NEE) of carbon and evapotranspiration (ET), measured and simulated by
   each model for each site-year, were compared in terms of year-to-year
   variability and possible relation to climate drivers. Results have shown
   that most of models simulations for annual totals of NEE and ET, and IAV
   of these fluxes, are frequently different from measurements. The average
   of the model simulations of annual fluxes tend to respond to climatic
   drivers similarly to the observations, but with noticeable
   discrepancies. Annual measurements of NEE are negatively correlated to
   annual rainfall in the forest sites group. Although the ensemble of all
   models yields a similar result, only three model formulations reproduce
   a significant negative correlation of simulated NEE with rainfall. For
   the IAV of ET, tower measurements are controlled by annual variations of
   radiation and this feature is captured by the ensemble of the models,
   both at individual sites and when all forest sites are grouped. However,
   simulated ET values are also significantly correlated to the amount of
   precipitation in many models and in the model ensemble, while there is
   no significant correlation in the observations. In general, the surface
   models are able to reproduce the responses of fluxes to climatic
   drivers, but improvements are still needed to better capture their
   inter-annual variability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Improved statistical models for limited datasets in uncertainty
   quantification using stochastic collocation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{255}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a data-driven framework for performing uncertainty
   quantification (UQ) by choosing a stochastic model that accurately
   describes the sources of uncertainty in a system. This model is
   propagated through an appropriate response surface function that
   approximates the behavior of this system using stochastic collocation.
   Given a sample of data describing the uncertainty in the inputs, our
   goal is to estimate a probability density function (PDF) using the
   kernel moment matching (KMM) method so that this PDF can be used to
   accurately reproduce statistics like mean and variance of the response
   surface function. Instead of constraining the PDF to be optimal for a
   particular response function, we show that we can use the properties of
   stochastic collocation to make the estimated PDF optimal for a wide
   variety of response functions. We contrast this method with other
   traditional procedures that rely on the Maximum Likelihood approach,
   like kernel density estimation (KDE) and its adaptive modification
   (AKDE). We argue that this modified KMM method tries to preserve what is
   known from the given data and is the better approach when the available
   data is limited in quantity. We test the performance of these methods
   for both univariate and multivariate density estimation by sampling
   random datasets from known PDFs and then measuring the accuracy of the
   estimated PDFs, using the known PDF as a reference. Comparing the output
   mean and variance estimated with the empirical moments using the raw
   data sample as well as the actual moments using the known PDF, we show
   that the KMM method performs better than KDE and AKDE in predicting
   these moments with greater accuracy. This improvement in accuracy is
   also demonstrated for the case of UQ in electrostatic and
   electrothermomechanical microactuators. We show how our framework
   results in the accurate computation of statistics in micromechanical
   systems. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Yarrowia lipolytica lipase Lip2 (YlLip2) is a highly versatile
   biocatalyst. However, its practical use is often hampered by its low
   stability. Here three complementary protein engineering strategies were
   used to improve the thermostability of this enzyme. The first strategy
   was error-prone PCR based directed evolution, which resulted in a YlLip2
   variant with a 2.5-fold longer half-life of thermal inactivation at 50
   degrees C compared to the wild-type enzyme. The second strategy was
   semi-rational design using the so-called B-factor iterative test
   (B-FIT), which led to the discovery of two thermostable YlLip2 variants
   that showed a half-life of thermal inactivation 2-fold and 5-fold longer
   than that of the wild-type enzyme, respectively, at 50 degrees C. The
   third strategy was to use site-directed mutagenesis to combinatorially
   combine all three thermostabilizing mutations identified in the first
   two strategies, which improved the half-life of thermal inactivation of
   YlLip2 by 7-fold compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. Such
   engineered lipases provide not only new insights on the protein
   structure and function relationship but also potentially useful
   catalysts for practical applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL) spectra from aqueous sulfuric acid
   solutions containing dissolved neon show widely varying emission despite
   being similar in chemical composition. From a 65 wt \% solution,
   emission from hydroxyl radicals is observed, with the rovibronic
   progression being well-described by a single temperature of 7600 K. From
   an 80 wt \% solution, however, emission spectra reveal vibrationally hot
   sulfur monoxide (SO; T-v = 2400 K) that is also rotationally cold (T-r =
   280 K). Further, the SO vibrational population distribution is
   best-described by a non-Boltzmann distribution. Excited neon atom
   emission observed from the 80 wt \% solution gives an estimated
   temperature of only 3400 K, indicative of emission from a cool outer
   shell at the interfacial region. The neon atom excited-state population
   is also best-described by a non-Boltzmann distribution. These
   observations are consistent with SBSL emission having both a spatial and
   temporal component, and the implications for these effects are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A measurement of jet shapes in top-quark pair events using 1.8 fb(-1) of
   pp collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC is
   presented. Samples of top-quark pair events are selected in both the
   single-lepton and dilepton final states. The differential and integrated
   shapes of the jets initiated by bottom-quarks from the top-quark decays
   are compared with those of the jets originated by light-quarks from the
   hadronic W-boson decays in the single-lepton channel. The light-quark
   jets are found to have a narrower distribution of the momentum flow
   inside the jet area than b-quark jets.}},

Abstract = {{The Moho is not always a sharp interface: but seismic phase SsPmp yields
   robust, physically averaged estimates of crustal thickness (virtual deep
   seismic sounding, VDSS). In S. Tibet where the Moho is as deep as 75 km,
   bimodal distribution of earthquake depths, with one peak in the upper
   crust and the other below the Moho, generated much interest in how
   lithological contrast affects seismicity and rheology. Generally
   seismicity is limited by distinct temperatures (Tc): 350 +/- 50 degrees
   C in the crust and 700 +/- 100 degrees C in the mantle (Earthquake
   Thermometry). Laboratory experiments show that distinct Tc reflect the
   onset of substantial crystal plasticity in major crustal and mantle
   minerals, respectively. Above these Tc, frictional instability ends due
   to velocity weakening of slip. So the seismic to aseismic transition is
   closely linked with brittle-ductile transitions in the crust and in the
   uppermost mantle, where the strength of the continental lithosphere is
   expected to peak ({''}Jelly Sandwich{''}). Plasticity depends
   exponentially on temperature (which evolves overtime), so interplay
   between the geotherm and crustal thickness could result in concentrated
   seismicity in the upper crust the only portion of a very warm
   lithosphere where temperature is below similar to 350 degrees C
   ({''}Creme Brulee{''}). Conversely, where the entire crust is below
   similar to 350 degrees C (and the uppermost mantle is also below similar
   to 700 degrees C), then earthquakes could occur over a wide range of
   depths, including the entire crust and the uppermost mantle ({''}Caramel
   Slab{''}). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A search is presented for direct chargino production based on a
   disappearing-track signature using 20.3 fb(-1) of proton-proton
   collisions at root s = 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS experiment at the
   LHC. In anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models, the
   lightest chargino is nearly mass degenerate with the lightest neutralino
   and its lifetime is long enough to be detected in the tracking detectors
   by identifying decays that result in tracks with no associated hits in
   the outer region of the tracking system. Some models with supersymmetry
   also predict charginos with a significant lifetime. This analysis
   attains sensitivity for charginos with a lifetime between 0.1 and 10 ns,
   and significantly surpasses the reach of the LEP experiments. No
   significant excess above the background expectation is observed for
   candidate tracks with large transverse momentum, and constraints on
   chargino properties are obtained. In the AMSB scenarios, a chargino mass
   below 270 GeV is excluded at 95\% confidence level.}},

Abstract = {{This Letter presents measurements of the polarization of the top quark
   in top-antitop quark pair events, using 4: 7 fb(-1) of proton-proton
   collision data recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron
   Collider at root s = 7 TeV. Final states containing one or two isolated
   leptons ( electrons or muons) and jets are considered. Two measurements
   of alpha P-l, the product of the leptonic spin-analyzing power and the
   top quark polarization, are performed assuming that the polarization is
   introduced by either a CP conserving or a maximally CP violating
   production process. The measurements obtained, alpha P-l(CPC) = -0: 035
   +/- 0: 014(stat) +/- 0: 037(syst) and alpha P-l(CPV) = 0: 020 +/- 0:
   016(stat)(-0.017)(+0.013)(syst), are in good agreement with the standard
   model prediction of negligible top quark polarization.}},

Abstract = {{Mutational escape from vaccine-induced immune responses has thwarted the
   development of a successful vaccine against AIDS, whose causative agent
   is HIV, a highly mutable virus. Knowing the virus' fitness as a function
   of its proteomic sequence can enable rational design of potent vaccines,
   as this information can focus vaccine-induced immune responses to target
   mutational vulnerabilities of the virus. Spin models have been proposed
   as a means to infer intrinsic fitness landscapes of HIV proteins from
   patient-derived viral protein sequences. These sequences are the product
   of nonequilibrium viral evolution driven by patient-specific immune
   responses and are subject to phylogenetic constraints. How can such
   sequence data allow inference of intrinsic fitness landscapes? We
   combined computer simulations and variational theory a la Feynman to
   show that, in most circumstances, spin models inferred from
   patient-derived viral sequences reflect the correct rank order of the
   fitness of mutant viral strains. Our findings are relevant for diverse
   viruses.}},

Title = {{Microfluidic CD4(+) and CD8(+) T Lymphocyte Counters for Point-of-Care
   HIV Diagnostics Using Whole Blood}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{214}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Roughly 33 million people worldwide are infected with HIV; disease
   burden is highest in resource-limited settings. One important diagnostic
   in HIV disease management is the absolute count of lymphocytes
   expressing the CD4(+) and CD8(+) receptors. The current diagnostic
   instruments and procedures require expensive equipment and trained
   technicians. In response, we have developed microfluidic biochips that
   count CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes in whole blood samples, without the
   need for off-chip sample preparation. The device is based on
   differential electrical counting and relies on five on-chip modules
   that, in sequence, chemically lyses erythrocytes, quenches lysis to
   preserve leukocytes, enumerates cells electrically, depletes the target
   cells (CD4 or CD8) with antibodies, and enumerates the remaining cells
   electrically. We demonstrate application of this chip using blood from
   healthy and HIV-infected subjects. Erythrocyte lysis and quenching
   durations were optimized to create pure leukocyte populations in less
   than 1 min. Target cell depletion was accomplished through shear
   stress-based immunocapture, using antibody-coated microposts to increase
   the contact surface area and enhance depletion efficiency. With the
   differential electrical counting method, device-based CD4(+) and CD8(+)
   T cell counts closely matched control counts obtained from flow
   cytometry, over a dynamic range of 40 to 1000 cells/mu l. By providing
   accurate cell counts in less than 20 min, from samples obtained from one
   drop of whole blood, this approach has the potential to be realized as a
   handheld, battery-powered instrument that would deliver simple HIV
   diagnostics to patients anywhere in the world, regardless of geography
   or socioeconomic status.}},

Abstract = {{An updated search is performed for gluino, top squark, or bottom squark
   R-hadrons that have come to rest within the ATLAS calorimeter, and decay
   at some later time to hadronic jets and a neutralino, using 5.0 and 22.9
   fb(-1) of pp collisions at 7 and 8 TeV, respectively. Candidate decay
   events are triggered in selected empty bunch crossings of the LHC in
   order to remove pp collision backgrounds. Selections based on jet shape
   and muon system activity are applied to discriminate signal events from
   cosmic ray and beam-halo muon backgrounds. In the absence of an excess
   of events, improved limits are set on gluino, stop, and sbottom masses
   for different decays, lifetimes, and neutralino masses. With a
   neutralino of mass 100 GeV, the analysis excludes gluinos with mass
   below 832 GeV (with an expected lower limit of 731 GeV), for a gluino
   lifetime between 10 mu s and 1000 s in the generic R-hadron model with
   equal branching ratios for decays to q (q) over bar(chi) over tilde (0)
   and g (chi) over tilde (0). Under the same assumptions for the
   neutralino mass and squark lifetime, top squarks and bottom squarks in
   the Regge R-hadron model are excluded with masses below 379 and 344 GeV,
   respectively.}},

Title = {{Mechanisms of MS2 Bacteriophage Removal by Fouled Ultrafiltration
   Membrane Subjected to Different Cleaning Methods}},

Abstract = {{An ultrafiltration unit with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane
   of 40 nm nominal pore size was used to study bacteriophage MS2 removal
   under different membrane conditions: pristine membrane, membrane fouled
   by soluble microbial product (SMP) extracted from membrane bioreactor
   (MBR) feedwater, backwashed membrane, and chemically cleaned membrane.
   The order of MS2 removal by these membranes was as follows: fouled
   membrane > backwashed membrane > chemically cleaned membrane approximate
   to pristine membrane. A linear correlation between membrane relative
   permeability and MS2 removal was found. Mass balance analysis showed a
   high percentage of MS2 in the concentrate for the fouled membrane as
   compared with the pristine membrane. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)
   results showed faster kinetics of MS2 adhesion to the pristine membrane
   than to the SMP-fouled membrane. In agreement with QCM results, an
   attractive force between MS2 and the pristine membrane was detected
   using an atomic force microscope (AFM), whereas a repulsive force was
   detected for the interaction between MS2 and the fouled membrane. The
   presence of SMP on the membrane surface led to higher rejection of MS2
   due to both pore blocking and repulsion between MS2 and the SMP layer.
   Chemical cleaning removed most of the SMP foulant and as a result led to
   a lower MS2 removal.}},

Abstract = {{Broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies effective against the

   a computational methodology to predict key residues constituting the

   neutralization activity data. Our approach does not require the
   availability of structural information for either the antibody or
   antigen. Predictions of the conformational epitopes of ten broadly
   neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies are shown to be in good agreement with new

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},

Abstract = {{Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is an established paradigm for
   measuring biomechanical properties of tissues and cells noninvasively,
   in real time, and with high resolution. We present a different
   development of a spectral domain OCE technique that enables simultaneous
   measurements of multiple biomechanical parameters of biological tissues.
   Our approach extends the capabilities of magnetomotive OCE (MM-OCE),
   which utilizes iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) distributed and
   embedded in the specimens as transducers for inducing motion. Step-wise
   application of an external magnetic field results in displacements in
   the tissue specimens that are deduced from sensitive phase measurements
   made with the MM-OCE system. We analyzed freshly excised rabbit lung and
   muscle tissues. We observe that while they present some similarities,
   rabbit lung and muscle tissue displacements display characteristic
   differentiating features. Both tissue types undergo a fast initial
   displacement followed by a rapidly damped oscillation and the onset of
   creep. However, the damping is faster in muscle compared to lung tissue,
   while the creep is steeper in muscle. This approach has the potential to
   become a novel way of performing real-time measurements of biomechanical
   properties of tissues and to enable the development of different
   diagnostic and monitoring tools in biology and medicine. (C) The

   at a water-to-binder ratio of 0.4, and heat-cured at 75 degrees C to
   accelerate the strength development. The hydration progress was
   monitored using X-ray diffraction, and morphological examination was
   performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM). Ettringite and calcium aluminosilicate

Abstract = {{Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most commonly used
   statistical procedures with a wide range of applications. This paper
   considers both minimax and adaptive estimation of the principal subspace
   in the high dimensional setting. Under mild technical conditions, we
   first establish the optimal rates of convergence for estimating the
   principal subspace which are sharp with respect to all the parameters,
   thus providing a complete characterization of the difficulty of the
   estimation problem in term of the convergence rate. The lower bound is
   obtained by calculating the local metric entropy and an application of
   Fano's lemma. The rate optimal estimator is constructed using
   aggregation, which, however, might not be computationally feasible.
   We then introduce an adaptive procedure for estimating the principal
   subspace which is fully data driven and can be computed efficiently. It
   is shown that the estimator attains the optimal rates of convergence
   simultaneously over a large collection of the parameter spaces. A key
   idea in our construction is a reduction scheme which reduces the sparse
   PCA problem to a high-dimensional multivariate regression problem. This
   method is potentially also useful for other related problems.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{177-188}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Smart outrigger damping systems have been proposed as a novel energy
   dissipation system to protect high-rise buildings from severe
   earthquakes and strong winds. In these damping systems, devices such as
   magnetorheological (MR) dampers are installed vertically between the
   outrigger and perimeter columns to achieve large and adaptable energy
   dissipation. To complement the high performance shown in previous
   theoretical studies, this control approach needs to be experimentally
   verified. To examine a smart outrigger damping system experimentally,
   real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) provides an alternative where the
   damping devices can be experimentally tested, while the remaining
   components in the structural system are simultaneously tested through
   numerical simulation. The focus of this study is to experimentally
   investigate and verify smart outrigger damping systems for high-rise
   buildings subject to scaled El Centro and Kobe earthquake records using
   RTHS. Through RTHS, the efficacy of the smart outrigger damping system
   is demonstrated for two historical earthquakes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental and numerical investigation of the
   flow maldistribution caused by the pressure drop in headers and its
   impact on the performance of a rnicrochannel evaporator with horizontal
   headers and vertically oriented tubes. Experimental results show that
   the flash gas bypass method almost eliminates the quality induced
   maldistribution. However, refrigerant flow maldistribution caused by the
   header pressure drop still exists. This is mainly because the pressure
   drop along the headers results in uneven pressure difference and
   therefore non-uniform liquid refrigerant mass flow rate across each
   microchannel tube. A microchannel evaporator model validated by
   experimental results is employed to quantify header pressure drop
   induced flow maldistribution. Parametric analysis reveals that such
   maldistribution impact is significantly reduced by enlarging the outlet
   header size, increasing heat exchanger aspect ratio, or reducing the
   microchannel size while other parameters are kept constant. When ratio
   of outlet header to the total evaporator pressure drop is less than
   30\%, the cooling capacity reduction is limited below 3\%. Published by

   flow microchannel evaporator was presented in earlier IJR paper by the
   authors. An experimental comparison of the A/C system with new approach
   to an FGB system revealed that vapor venting provided a 5\% increase of
   cooling capacity and 3\% of COP when operated at identical test
   conditions, while the maximum COP improvement was approximately
   10\%-12\% when capacity is matched by reduction of compressor speed. The
   improvement compared to direct expansion system was significantly
   higher. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the R410A adiabatic upward flow in three vertical
   headers of microchannel heat exchangers. All microchannel tubes are
   inserted into the half depth. The objectives are to explore what affects
   R410A distribution and attempt to predict the distribution. R410A is
   circulated into the header through the (5 or 10) tubes in the bottom
   pass and exits through the (5 or 10) tubes in the top pass. It
   represents the flow in the outdoor heat exchanger (usually used as the
   condenser) when it is used as the evaporator in the heat pump mode of
   reversible systems. The quality was typically varied from 0.2 to 0.8 and
   the mass flow rate from 1.5 to 4.5 kg h(-1) per tube. The best
   distribution was observed at high mass flux and low quality. The
   experiment and visualization reveals the flow pattern effects in terms
   of homogeneity and momentum. The chum flow had better distribution since
   the two-phase mixture was more homogenous and the distribution was
   better at high mass flux in the header because the higher momentum
   liquid was able to reach the top exit tube. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and

Abstract = {{The thermal decomposition behavior of two microalgae, Chlorella
   pyrenoidosa (CP) and Spirulina platensis (SP), were investigated on a
   thermogravimetric analyzer under non-isothermal conditions.
   Iso-conversional Vyazovkin approach was used to calculate the kinetic
   parameters, and the universal integral method was applied to evaluate
   the most probable mechanisms for thermal degradation of the two
   feedstocks. The differential equations deduced from the models were
   compared with experimental data. For the range of conversion fraction
   investigated (20-80\%), the thermal decomposition process of CP could be
   described by the reaction order model (F3), which can be calculated by
   the integral equation of G(alpha) = {[}(1 - alpha)(-2) - 1]/2. And the
   apparent activation energy was in the range of 58.85-114.5 kJ/mol. As
   for SP, it can be described by the reaction order model (F2), which can
   be calculated by the integral equation of G(alpha) = (1 - alpha)(-1) -
   1, and the range of apparent activation energy was 74.35-140.1 kJ/mol.

Abstract = {{Gelatin nanoparticles coated with Cathepsin D-specific peptides were
   developed as a vehicle for the targeted delivery of the cancer drug
   doxorubicin (DOX) to treat breast malignancy. Cathepsin D, a breast
   cancer cell secretion enzyme, triggered the release of DOX by digesting
   the protective peptide-coating layer of nanoparticles. Fabricated
   nanoparticles were successfully detected with ultrasound imaging in both
   in vitro conditions and in vivo mouse cancer models. Cell viability
   experiments were conducted to determine the efficacy of biomarker
   activation specific to breast cancer cell lines. These experimental
   results were compared with the outcome of a viability experiment
   conducted on noncancerous cells. Viability decreased in human MCF7
   mammary adenocarcinoma and mouse 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells, while that
   of noncancerous 3T3 fibroblast cells remained unaffected. Next, a
   real-time video of nanoparticle flow in mouse models was obtained using
   in vivo ultrasound imaging. The fluorescent profile of DOX was used as a
   means to examine nanoparticle localization in vivo. Results show the
   distribution of nanoparticles concentrated primarily within bladder and
   tumor sites of subject mice bodies. These findings support the use of
   biomarker coated nanoparticles in target specific therapy for breast
   cancer treatment.}},

Volume = {{265}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the seismic response analysis of an internal
   shearwall of a typical Indian reactor resting on a medium dense sandy
   silty soil, incorporating the nonlinear behavior of the soil-foundation
   interface. The modeling is done in an open-source finite element
   framework, OpenSees, where the soil-structure interaction (SSI) is
   modeled using a Beam-on-Nonlinear-Winkler-Foundation (BNWF) approach.
   Static pushover analysis and cyclic analysis are performed followed by
   an incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) with 30 recorded ground motions.
   For performing IDA, the spectral acceleration of each motion
   corresponding to the fundamental period, S-a(T-1)is incremented from 0.1
   g to 1.0 g with an increment step of 0.1 g. It is observed from the
   cyclic analysis that the equivalent viscous damping of the system
   increases upto twice upon incorporation of inelastic SSI. The IDA
   results demonstrate that the average peak base shear, base moment and
   displacement ductility demand reduces as much as 62\%, 40\%, and 35\%,
   respectively, whereas the roof drift demand increases up to 25\% upon
   consideration of foundation nonlinearity for the highest intensity
   motion. These observations indicate the need of critical consideration
   of nonlinear soil-structure interaction as any deficient modeling of the
   same may lead to an inaccurate estimation of the seismic demands of the
   structure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report a high-statistics measurement of the differential cross
   section of the process gamma gamma -> (KSKS0)-K-0 in the range 1.05 GeV
   <= W <= 4.00 GeV, where W is the center-of-mass energy of the colliding
   photons, using 972 fb(-1) of data collected with the Belle detector at
   the KEKB asymmetric-energy e(+)e(-) collider operated at and near the
   Upsilon-resonance region. The differential cross section is fitted by
   parameterized S-, D-0-, D-2-, G(0)-, and G(2)-wave amplitudes. In the
   D-2 wave, the f(2)(1270), a(2)(1320), and f(2)'(1525) are dominant and a
   resonance, the f(2)(2200), is also present. The f(0)(1710) and possibly
   the f(0)(2500) are seen in the S wave. The mass, total width, and
   product of the two-photon partial decay width and decay branching
   fraction to the K (K) over bar state Gamma(gamma gamma) B(K (K) over
   bar) are extracted for the f(2)'(1525), f(0)(1710), f(2)(2200), and
   f(0)(2500). The destructive interference between the f(2)(1270) and
   a(2)(1320) is confirmed by measuring their relative phase. The
   parameters of the charmonium states chi(c0) and chi(c2) are updated.
   Possible contributions from the chi(c0)(2P) and chi(c2)(2P) states are
   discussed. A new upper limit for the branching fraction of the P- and
   CP-violating decay channel eta(c) -> (KSKS0)-K-0 is reported. The
   detailed behavior of the cross section is updated and compared with
   QCD-based calculations.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of three-dimensional flow in submarine channel bends is
   poorly understood, largely due to the absence of detailed data from
   natural channels. Herein, data from density-driven flows in a large
   reservoir on the Huanghe (Yellow) River are presented showing the
   spatio-temporal variation of flow around a subaqueous bend. The data
   demonstrate for the first time that reversed helical flow, relative to
   that found in river channel bends, can occur from the centrifugal
   forcing of flow, even when the Coriolis force acts in the opposite
   direction. The data also suggest that reversed helical flow fields in
   submarine channels may be more frequent than currently estimated,
   notably for bends where Coriolis and centrifugal forces combine in the
   same direction. In addition, this study provides the first field
   evidence suggesting that sinuous submarine channels can exhibit an
   asymmetry in helical flow orientation between left and right-turning
   bends, which will have major implications for the morphodynamics of
   submarine channels, their resultant patterns of sedimentation and,
   ultimately, the distribution of depositional units across submarine fan
   systems.}},

Title = {{An improved pore-scale biofilm model and comparison with a microfluidic
   flow cell experiment}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{8370-8382}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a pore-scale biofilm model that solves the flow field
   using the lattice Boltzmann method, the concentration field of chemical
   species using the finite difference method, and biofilm development
   using the cellular automaton method. We adapt the model from a previous
   work and expand it by implementing biofilm shrinkage in the cellular
   automaton method. The new pore-scale biofilm model is then evaluated
   against a previously published pore-scale biofilm experiment, in which
   two microfluidic flow cells, one with a homogeneous pore network and the
   other with an aggregate pore network, were tested for aerobic
   degradation of a herbicide. The simulated biofilm distribution and
   morphology, biomass accumulation, and contaminant removal are generally
   consistent with the experimental data. Biofilm detachment in this model
   occurs when the local shear stress is above a critical value. We use the
   critical value from our previously published modeling study and find it
   works well in this case, even though we now have a different pore
   network and a different microbial species. We also use the model to show
   that the interaction between flow and biofilm growth is important to
   predict contaminant removal. The computational time of the new model is
   reduced 90\% compared to our prior work due to implementation of biofilm
   shrinkage in the cellular automaton method. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first time that biofilm shrinkage has been
   incorporated into a pore-scale model for simulation of pollutant
   biodegradation in porous media.}},

   requirements (e. g., response time) are ensured. Furthermore, the
   dynamic nature of both demand pattern and infrastructure cost favors a
   dynamic solution to this problem. Currently most of the existing
   solutions for service placement have either ignored dynamics, or
   provided solutions inadequate to achieve this objective. In this paper,
   we present a framework for dynamic service placement problems based on
   control-and game-theoretic models. In particular, we present a solution
   that optimizes the hosting cost dynamically over time according to both
   demand and resource price fluctuations. We further consider the case
   where multiple service providers compete for resources in a dynamic
   manner. This paper extends our previous work {[}1] by analyzing the
   outcome of the competition in terms of both price of stability and price
   of anarchy. Our analysis suggests that in an uncoordinated scenario
   where service providers behave in a selfish manner, the resulting Nash
   equilibrium can be arbitrarily worse than the optimal centralized
   solution in terms of social welfare. Based on this observation, we
   present a coordination mechanism that can be employed by the
   infrastructure provider to maximize the social welfare of the system.
   Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions using
   realistic simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Barchan dunes are bed forms found in many sedimentary environments with
   a limited supply of sediment, and may occur in isolation or in more
   complex dune fields. Barchans have a crescentic planform morphology with
   horns elongated in the downflow direction. To study flow over barchan
   dunes, we performed large eddy simulations in a channel with different
   interdune spacings at a flow Reynolds number, Re similar or equal to
   26,000 (based on the free stream velocity and channel height). The
   largest interdune spacing (2.38, where is the wavelength of the barchan
   dune) presents similar characteristics to a solitary dune in isolation,
   indicating that, at this distance, the sheltering effect of the upstream
   dune is rather weak. Barchan dunes induce two counterrotating streamwise
   vortices, one along each of the horns, which direct high-momentum fluid
   toward the symmetry plane and low-momentum fluid near the bed away from
   the centerline. The flow close to the centerline plane separates at the
   crest, but away from the centerline plane, and along the horns, flow
   separation occurs intermittently. The flow in the separation bubble is
   directed toward the horns and leaves the dune at its tips. The internal
   boundary layer developing on the bed downstream of the reattachment
   region develops similarly for various interdune spacings; the
   development slows down 14.5 dune heights downstream. The turbulent
   kinetic energy budgets show the importance of pressure transport and
   mean flow advection in transferring energy from the overlying wake layer
   to the internal boundary layer over the stoss side. For closely spaced
   dunes, the bed shear stress is 30\% larger than at the largest spacing,
   and instantaneous coherent high- and low-speed streaks are shorter but
   stronger. Coherent eddies in the separated shear layer are generated
   more frequently for smaller interdune spacing, where they move farther
   away from the bed, toward the free surface, and remain located between
   the horns.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the natural process of river meandering is captured in a
   computational model that considers the effects of bank erosion, the
   process of land accretion along the inner banks of meander bends, and
   the formation of channel cutoffs. The methodology for predicting bank
   erosion explicitly includes a submodel treating the formation and
   eventual removal of slump blocks. The accretion of bank material on the
   inner bank is modeled by defining the time scale over which areas that
   are originally channel become land. Channel cutoff formation is treated
   relatively simply by recomputing the channel alignment at a single model
   time step when migrating banks meet. The model is used to compute
   meandering processes in both steady and unsteady flows. The key features
   of this new model are the ability (a) to describe bank depositional and
   bank erosional responses separately, (b) to couple them to bed
   morphodynamics, and thus (c) to describe coevolving river width and
   sinuosity. Two cases of steady flow are considered, one with a larger
   discharge (i.e., bankfull) and one with a smaller discharge (i.e., low
   flow). In the former case, the shear stress is well above the critical
   shear stress, but in the latter case, it is initially below it. In at
   least one case of constant discharge, the planform pattern can develop
   some sinuosity, but the pattern appears to deviate somewhat from that
   observed in natural meandering channels. For the case of unsteady flow,
   discharge variation is modeled in the simplest possible manner by
   cyclically alternating the two discharges used in the steady flow
   computations. This model produces a rich pattern of meander planform
   evolution that is consistent with that observed in natural rivers. Also,
   the relationship between the meandering evolution and the return time
   scale of floods is investigated by the model under the several unsteady
   flow patterns. The results indicate that meandering planforms have
   different shapes depending on the values of these two scales. In
   predicting meander evolution, it is important to consider the ratio of
   these two time scales in addition to such factors as bank erosion, slump
   block formation and decay, bar accretion, and cutoff formation, which
   are also included in the model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper documents the three-dimensional structure of flow and bed
   morphology of two developing chute cutoffs on a single meander bend on
   the lower Wabash River, USA, and relates the flow structure to patterns
   of morphologic change in the evolving cutoff channels. The upstream end
   of the cutoff channels is characterized by: (1) a zone of flow velocity
   reduction/stagnation and bar development in the main channel across from
   the cutoff entrance, (2) flow separation and bar development along the
   inner (left) bank of the cutoff channel immediately downstream from the
   cutoff entrance, and (3) helical motion and outward advection of flow
   momentum entering the cutoff channel, leading to erosion of the outer
   (right) bank of the cutoff channel. At the downstream end of the cutoff
   channels, the major hydrodynamic and morphologic features are: (1) flow
   stagnation along the bank of the main channel immediately upstream of
   the cutoff channel mouth, (2) convergence of flows from the cutoff and
   main channels, (3) helical motion of flow from the cutoff, (4) a zone of
   reduced velocity along the bank of the main channel immediately
   downstream from the cutoff channel mouth, and (5) development of a
   prominent bar complex that penetrates into the main channel and extends
   from the stagnation zone upstream to downstream of the cutoff mouth.
   These results provide the basis for a conceptual model of chute-cutoff
   dynamics in which the upstream and downstream ends of a cutoff channel
   are treated as a bifurcation and confluence, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) and warm mix asphalt (WMA) have become
   the primary methods for enhancing sustainability in the asphalt industry
   in recent years. To further enhance sustainability benefits, asphalt
   producers have begun using RAP and WMA in combination. Research to date
   has focused on evaluating WMA-RAP mixtures in terms of moisture
   sensitivity and permanent deformation characteristics as measured in
   laboratory performance tests. In the present paper, the authors
   investigate a set of WMA mixtures that encompass a variety of variables,
   including four WMA additives (Evotherm 3G, Rediset LQ, Sasobit, and
   Advera) and three RAP contents (0, 15, and 45\%). A common belief among
   practitioners is that the reduced aging in the asphalt binder associated
   with lower production temperatures in WMA mixtures leaves additional
   headroom for the incorporation of higher amounts of RAP, which is
   generally a stiffer, more brittle material. To fully characterize the
   performance of WMA-RAP mixtures, the authors evaluated the
   low-temperature, cracking behavior of these mixtures in conjunction with
   moisture and rutting resistance characterization. They achieved the low
   temperature testing of WMA-RAP mixtures through the disk-shaped compact
   tension {[}DC(T)], indirect tension (IDT) creep compliance, and acoustic
   emission (AE) tests. Test results showed that chemical additives
   improved moisture susceptibility according to the AASHTO T 283 standard
   test and fracture and bulk stress relaxation characteristics using the
   DC(T) and IDT tests, respectively. The organic Fischer-Tropsch
   wax-modified WMA mixtures performed the best among the WMA mixtures in
   terms of rutting resistance. The introduction of RAP led to the
   increased resistance to permanent deformation and moisture damage.
   Conversely, RAP reduced thermal cracking resistance according to the
   low-temperature performance tests in both HMA and WMA. The authors
   observed the same trend in AE test results as WMA-RAP mixtures exhibited
   warmer embrittlement temperatures as compared with control mixtures and
   are therefore expected to be more prone to thermal cracking. On the
   basis of these findings, thermal cracking resistance remains an issue to
   be considered in WMA mixtures containing RAP. Additionally, performance
   testing has shown to be a valuable tool for the evaluation of RAP and
   WMA mix designs to avoid performance issues in the field. (C) 2013

Title = {{On the solution of affine generalized Nash equilibrium problems with
   shared constraints by Lemke's method}},

Abstract = {{Affine generalized Nash equilibrium problems (AGNEPs) represent a class
   of non-cooperative games in which players solve convex quadratic
   programs with a set of (linear) constraints that couple the players'
   variables. The generalized Nash equilibria (GNE) associated with such
   games are given by solutions to a linear complementarity problem (LCP).
   This paper treats a large subclass of AGNEPs wherein the coupled
   constraints are shared by, i.e., common to, the players. Specifically,
   we present several avenues for computing structurally different GNE
   based on varying consistency requirements on the Lagrange multipliers
   associated with the shared constraints. Traditionally, variational
   equilibria (VE) have been amongst the more well-studied GNE and are
   characterized by a requirement that the shared constraint multipliers be
   identical across players. We present and analyze a modification to
   Lemke's method that allows us to compute GNE that are not necessarily
   VE. If successful, the modified method computes a partial variational
   equilibrium characterized by the property that some shared constraints
   are imposed to have common multipliers across the players while other
   are not so imposed. Trajectories arising from regularizing the LCP
   formulations of AGNEPs are shown to converge to a particular type of GNE
   more general than Rosen's normalized equilibrium that in turn includes a
   variational equilibrium as a special case. A third avenue for
   constructing alternate GNE arises from employing a novel constraint
   reformulation and parameterization technique. The associated parametric
   solution method is capable of identifying continuous manifolds of
   equilibria. Numerical results suggest that the modified Lemke's method
   is more robust than the standard version of the method and entails only
   a modest increase in computational effort on the problems tested.
   Finally, we show that the conditions for applying the modified Lemke's
   scheme are readily satisfied in a breadth of application problems drawn
   from communication networks, environmental pollution games, and power
   markets.}},

Abstract = {{A new Variational Multiscale framework for finite strain incompressible
   elasticity is presented. Significant contributions in this work are: (i)
   a systematic derivation of multiscale formulations that include the
   classical (F) over bar method as a particular subclass, (ii) an error
   estimation procedure for nonlinear elasticity that emanates naturally
   from within the present multiscale framework, and (iii) robust
   performance of linear triangular and tetrahedral elements for modeling
   nearly incompressible materials in the finite strain range. When viewed
   from the Variational Multiscale perspective, the classical (F) over bar
   method is shown to include only a volumetric or diagonal fine-scale
   deformation gradient while the proposed formulation includes the full
   spectrum of inter-scale coupling effects. Also, the error estimation
   procedure readily carries over from developments conducted for small
   strain linear problems. The formulation is presented first in the
   context of displacement-based methods and then extended to more general
   mixed methods accommodating arbitrary combinations of
   displacement-pressure interpolations. An extensive set of benchmark
   problems is investigated to show the performance of the method for a
   variety of hyperelastic materials exhibiting incompressible response.

Abstract = {{Ultrasmooth, highly spherical monocrystalline gold particles were
   prepared by a cyclic process of slow growth followed by slow chemical
   etching, which selectively removes edges and vertices. The etching
   process effectively makes the surface tension isotropic, so that spheres
   are favored under quasi-static conditions. It is scalable up to particle
   sizes of 200 nm or more. The resulting spherical crystals display
   uniform scattering spectra and consistent optical coupling at small
   separations, even showing Fano-like resonances in small clusters. The
   high monodispersity of the particles we demonstrate should facilitate
   the self-assembly of nanoparticle clusters with uniform optical
   resonances, which could in turn be used to fabricate optical metafluids.
   Narrow size distributions are required to control not only the spectral
   features but also the morphology and yield of clusters in certain
   assembly schemes.}},

Abstract = {{A laboratory-based closure study was completed to compare measured and
   modeled optical properties and their dependence on controlled relative
   humidity (RH) for inorganic salts, dicarboxylic acids, and their
   mixtures. The closure between measured and modeled values of the light
   scattering coefficients were evaluated by calculating the average
   relative difference CARD) values, which revealed agreement within 8.0\%
   for the total scattering (sigma(sp)) and 14.8\% for the back scattering
   (sigma(bsp)) values at dry RH conditions for all test aerosols. These
   ARID values were less than the total relative uncertainty based on the
   measurement and modeling approaches, indicating the achievement of
   closure for sigma(sp) and sigma(bsp) Optical properties derived from
   sigma(sp) including: (1) the hygroscopic growth factor, f sigma(sp), (2)
   the backscatter ratio, b, and (3) the Angstrom exponent, (\$) over
   circle, were also compared with measured values. The ARD values between
   corresponding measured and modeled results for these derived optical
   parameters ranged from 0.1\% to 30.8\%. The impact of particulate
   organic matter (POM) on optical and hygroscopic properties of the
   aerosols tested here was also compared to the aerosol optical and
   composition measurements that occurred during the New England Air
   Quality Study-Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation
   field campaign. Such comparison confirmed that a larger POM mass
   fraction resulted in less hygroscopicity for both the ambient and the
   laboratory aerosols. This study evaluated closure between laboratory
   measurements and model calculations and validated the reliability of the
   measured and modeled results with the closure analysis. Therefore,
   Mie-Lorentz model can be used to calculate the optical properties and
   their dependence on RH for other aerosols with more confidence. (C) 2013

Title = {{Vendors' incentives to invest in software quality in enterprise systems}},
Journal = {{DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{27-36}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the enterprise system market, software quality is often unobservable
   at the contracting stage between the vendor and the customer. Two
   factors complicate the vendor's derision to invest in software quality.
   First, as a required part of the transaction, services such as
   installation and maintenance are bundled with the product. Second, the
   vendor's cost of delivering these services is directly affected by
   quality of the software. Incorporating these factors, we develop an
   analytical framework to examine when vendors of enterprise systems have
   an incentive to invest in software quality under different market
   structures and market participant behaviors. We also investigate
   economic consequences of such quality decisions by enterprise software
   vendors, highlighting certain unique characteristics of these markets.
   We consider a duopoly setting, with simultaneous and sequential moves of
   the vendors. Our results show that in the duopoly market, even when
   customers are uninformed about quality, an investment-equilibrium
   exists. We find that there exist conditions under which customers might
   have reasons to trust that vendors would invest in high software
   quality. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A heated rapid compression machine has been used to investigate the
   autoignition behavior of JP-5 and camelina-based hydrotreated renewable

   lean (phi = 0.25 and 0.50) and stoichiometric mixtures in air. The HRJ-5
   fuel, which is 99\% paraffinic, exhibited greater reactivity than the
   JP-5 fuel in the form of shorter ignition delays. The HRJ-5 fuel also
   exhibited transition into the negative temperature coefficient region at
   a lower compressed temperature (T-c = 675 K) than the JP-5 fuel (T-c =
   700 K). Two surrogate fuel blends and kinetic models intended for Jet-A
   and kerosene-type fuels are evaluated for their ability to predict JP-5.
   ignition delay tunes because JP-5 and Jet-A ignition delay times showed
   close resemblance. The models reproduced the-qualitative trend in the
   data, including an accurate representation of when the negative
   temperature coefficient behavior appears. The best agreement between the
   data and predictions was obtained at p(c) = 5 bar and phi = 1.0, but
   outside of this region, the disparity was often 2-fold or greater.}},

Abstract = {{The development of an efficient catalyst system for the electrochemical
   reduction of carbon dioxide into energy-rich products is a major
   research topic. Here we report the catalytic ability of
   polyacrylonitrile-based heteroatomic carbon nanofibres for carbon
   dioxide reduction into carbon monoxide, via a metal-free, renewable and
   cost-effective route. The carbon nanofibre catalyst exhibits negligible
   overpotential (0.17 V) for carbon dioxide reduction and more than an
   order of magnitude higher current density compared with the silver
   catalyst under similar experimental conditions. The carbon dioxide
   reduction ability of carbon nanofibres is attributed to the reduced
   carbons rather than to electronegative nitrogen atoms. The superior
   performance is credited to the nanofibrillar structure and high binding
   energy of key intermediates to the carbon nanofibre surfaces. The
   finding may lead to a new generation of metal-free and non-precious
   catalysts with much greater efficiency than the existing noble metal
   catalysts.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PTMs) are a widely distributed class
   of natural products with important biological activities. However, many
   of these PTMs have not been characterized. Here we apply a plug-and-play
   synthetic biology strategy to activate a cryptic PTM biosynthetic gene
   cluster SGR810-815 from Streptomyces griseus and discover three new
   PTMs. This gene cluster is highly conserved in phylogenetically diverse
   bacterial strains and contains an unusual hybrid polyketide
   synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase, which resembles iterative
   polyketide synthases known in fungi. To further characterize this gene
   cluster, we use the same synthetic biology approach to create a series
   of gene deletion constructs and elucidate the biosynthetic steps for the
   formation of the polycyclic system. The strategy we employ bypasses the
   traditional laborious processes to elicit gene cluster expression and
   should be generally applicable to many other silent or cryptic gene
   clusters for discovery and characterization of new natural products.}},

Title = {{Co-operativity in a nanocrystalline solid-state transition}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Co-operativity is a remarkable phenomenon mostly seen in biology, where
   initial reaction events significantly alter the propensity of subsequent
   reaction events, giving rise to a nonlinear tightly regulated
   synergistic response. Here we have found unique evidence of atomic level
   co-operativity in an inorganic material. A thousand-atom nanocrystal
   (NC) of the inorganic solid cadmium selenide exhibits strong positive
   co-operativity in its reaction with copper ions. A NC doped with a few
   copper impurities becomes highly prone to be doped even further, driving
   an abrupt transition of the entire NC to the copper selenide phase, as
   manifested by a strongly sigmoidal response in optical spectroscopy and
   electron diffraction measurements. The examples presented here suggest
   that cooperative phenomena may have an important role in the solid
   state, especially in the nucleation of new chemical phases, crystal
   growth, and other materials' transformations.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the advantage of imaging
   swallow function at any anatomical level without changing the position
   of patient, which can provide detailed information than modified barium
   swallow, by far the gold standard of swallow evaluation.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate the use of real-time MRI in the evaluation of
   swallow function of patients with tongue cancer.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Real-time MRI experiments were
   performed on a Signa Excite HD 1.5-T scanner (GE Healthcare), with
   gradients capable of 40-mT/m (milli-Tesla per meter) amplitudes and
   150-mT/m/ms (mT/m per millisecond) slew rates. The sequence used was
   spiral fast gradient echo sequence. Four men with base of tongue or oral
   tongue squamous cell carcinoma and 3 age-matched healthy men with normal
   swallowing participated in the experiment.
   INTERVENTIONS Real-time MRI of the midsagittal plane was collected
   during swallowing. Coronal planes between the oral tongue and base of
   tongue and through the middle of the larynx were collected from 1 of the
   patients.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Oral transit time, pharyngeal transit time,
   submental muscle length change, and the distance change between the
   hyoid bone and anterior boundary of the thyroid cartilage were measured
   frame by frame during swallowing.
   RESULTS All the measurable oral transit and pharyngeal transit times of
   the patients with cancer were significantly longer than the ones of the
   healthy participants. The changes in submental muscle length and the
   distance between the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage happened in
   concert for all 60 normal swallows; however, the pattern differed for
   each patient with cancer. To our knowledge, the coronal view of the
   tongue and larynx revealed information that has not been previously
   reported.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study has demonstrated the potential of
   real-time MRI to reveal critical information beyond the capacity of
   traditional videofluoroscopy. Further investigation is needed to fully
   consider the technique, procedure, and standard scope of applying MRI to
   evaluate swallow function of patients with cancer in research and clinic
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-beam incoherent scatter radar technique has been developed at
   the Jicamarca Radio Observatory in order to maximize the number of
   ionospheric parameters that can be estimated simultaneously. The
   technique interleaves radar observations with antenna beams pointing
   perpendicular and oblique to the Earth's magnetic field. For the
   estimation of the ionospheric parameters, we have modeled the magnetic
   aspect angle variations of the signal power and cross-correlation data
   measured in multiple directions. The data model, formulated in terms of
   soft-target radar equations, was built based on the theories of
   incoherent scattering and magneto-ionic propagation. Applying a
   nonlinear least-squares inversion algorithm, we have succeeded in
   measuring simultaneously ionospheric electron densities N-e,
   electron-to-ion temperature ratios T-e/T-i as well as vertical and zonal
   plasma drifts. In the past, radar users had to choose between either
   perpendicular-to-B or oblique modes, thus, the application of this
   technique extends the current capabilities of the Jicamarca radar. (C)

Abstract = {{As the health care industry shifts into the digital age, patients are
   increasingly being provided with access to electronic personal health
   records (PHRs) that are tethered to their provider-maintained electronic
   health records. This unprecedented access to personal health information
   can enable patients to more effectively manage their health, but little
   is actually known about patients' ability to successfully use a PHR to
   perform health management tasks or the individual factors that influence
   task performance. This study evaluated the ability of 56 middle-aged
   adults (40-59 years) and 51 older adults (60-85 years) to use a
   simulated PHR to perform 15 common health management tasks encompassing
   medication management, review/interpretation of lab/test results, and
   health maintenance activities. Results indicated that participants in
   both age groups experienced significant difficulties in using the PHR to
   complete routine health management tasks. Data also showed that older
   adults, particularly those with lower numeracy and technology
   experience, encountered greater problems using the system. Furthermore,
   data revealed that the cognitive abilities predicting one's task
   performance varied according to the complexity of the task. Results from
   this study identify important factors to consider in the design of PHRs
   so that they meet the needs of middle-aged and older adults. As
   deployment of PHRs is on the rise, knowledge of the individual factors
   that impact effective PHR use is critical to preventing an increase in
   health care disparities between those who are able to use a PHR and
   those who are not.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of three-dimensional
   hydrogel scaffolds for cell instruction. However, the control of gel
   architectures in cell-friendly conditions remains a challenge. Here, we
   report a novel method to generate unique three-dimensional collagen gel
   structures for the modulation of cell phenotypes. This was achieved by
   directing collagen self-assembly with unreactive hydrophilic
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains. Our approach allowed the fiber sizes
   and mechanics of three-dimensional collagen gels to be readily
   controlled. It also enabled the recapitulation of distinctive structures
   such as large perimysial collagen cables. Through different experiments,
   we elucidated the underlying mechanism for this PEG-mediated
   thermodynamic regulation of gel structure. We further used these
   cell-instructive three-dimensional gels to bring about pronounced
   morphological changes in encapsulated fibroblasts and their activation
   to form contractile bundles. Overall, our platform fills a gap in the
   existing array of collagen scaffolds and can potentially be adapted to a
   variety of self-assembling systems.}},

Journal = {{BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{149}},
Pages = {{126-135}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL)
   on the fate of bioactive compounds (BACs) often present with wet
   biosolids from wastewater, manure, or algae. Tracking radiolabeled C-14
   for two BACs showed that 60-79\% of the carbon was transferred to the
   HTL raw oil product, and most of the rest was found in the aqueous
   product. In the presence of both swine manure and Spirulina biomass
   feedstocks, HTL provided essentially complete removal of three BACs when
   operated at 300 degrees C for >= 30 min. Experiments with both natural
   transformation and high-efficiency transformation showed that HTL
   provided complete deactivation of antibiotic resistant genes for all
   tested HTL conditions (250-300 degrees C, 15-60 min reaction time).
   Thus, incorporating HTL into wastewater treatment systems can
   simultaneously produce valuable bio-crude oil, provide effective removal
   of BACs and disrupt the natural pathways for antibiotic resistant gene
   transfer from manure and wastewater biosolids to the environment.

Title = {{Perchlorate Reduction From a Highly Contaminated Groundwater in the
   Presence of Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria in a Hydrogen-Fed Biofilm}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We used a hydrogen (H-2)-based biofilm to treat a groundwater
   contaminated with perchlorate (ClO4-) at approximate to 10mg/L, an
   unusually high concentration. To enhance ClO4- removal, we either
   increased the H-2 pressure or decreased the electron-acceptor surface
   loading. The ClO4- removal increased from 94\% to 98\% when the H-2
   pressure was increased from 1.3 to 1.7atm when the total acceptor
   surface loading was 0.49gH(2)/m(2)day. We then decreased the acceptor
   surface loading stepwise from 0.49 to 0.07gH(2)/m(2)day, and the ClO4-
   removal improved to 99.6\%, giving an effluent ClO4- concentration of 41
   mu g/L. However, the tradeoff was that sulfate (SO42-) reduction
   occurred, reaching 85\% conversion at the lowest acceptor surface
   loading (0.07gH(2)/m(2)day). In two steady states with the highest ClO4-
   reduction, we assayed for the presence of perchlorate-reducing bacteria
   (PRB), denitrifying bacteria (DB), and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB)
   by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting
   characteristic reductases. The qPCR results documented competition
   between PRB and SRB for space within the biofilm. A simple model
   analysis for a steady-state biofilm suggests that competition from SRB
   pushed the PRB to locations having a higher detachment rate, which
   prevented them from driving the ClO4- concentration below 41 mu g/L.

Abstract = {{Orthopedic interfaces such as the tendon-bone junction (TBJ) present
   unique challenges for biomaterials development. Here we describe a
   multi-compartment collagen-GAG scaffold fabricated via lyophilization
   that contains discrete mineralized (CGCaP) and non-mineralized (CG)
   regions joined by a continuous interface. Modifying CGCaP preparation
   approaches, we demonstrated scaffold variants of increasing mineral
   content (40 vs. 80 wt\% CaP). We report the impact of fabrication
   parameters on microstructure, composition, elastic modulus, and
   permeability of the entire multi-compartment scaffold as well as
   discrete mineralized and non-mineralized compartments. Notably,
   individual mineralized and non-mineralized compartments differentially
   impacted the global properties of the multi-compartment composite. Of
   particular interest for the development of mechanically-loaded
   multi-compartment composites, the elastic modulus and permeability of
   the entire construct were governed primarily by the non-mineralized and
   mineralized compartments, respectively. Based on these results we
   hypothesize spatial variations in scaffold structural, compositional,
   and mechanical properties may be an important design parameter in
   orthopedic interface repair. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A computational multiscale model of damage mechanisms and strength of
   lamellar bone is presented. The analysis incorporates the hierarchical
   structure of bone spanning the nanoscale (mineralized collagen fibril),
   the sub-microscale (single lamella) and the micro-scale (lamellar
   structure) levels. Due to the presence of several constituents
   (collagen, hydroxyapatite minerals, and non-collagenous proteins) and
   the different microstructural features at each scale, various
   deformation and failure mechanisms occur in bone at its several levels
   of hierarchy. The model takes into account the dominant damage
   mechanisms at the above mentioned three scales and predicts the strength
   of bone by using a cohesive finite element method. Elastic moduli of
   bone at these three different scales are also obtained as part of these
   calculations. The obtained modeling results compare well with other
   theoretical and experimental data available in the literature. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We present an optofluidic sensor based on an elastomeric two-dimensional
   (2D) grating integrated inside a hemispherical fluid chamber. A laser
   beam is diffracted before (reflection) and after (transmission) going
   through the grating and liquid in the dome chamber. The sensing
   mechanism is investigated and simulated with a finite-difference
   time-domain-based electromagnetic method. For the experiment, by
   analyzing the size, power, and shape of the 2D diffraction patterns, we
   can retrieve multiple parameters of the liquid, including the refractive
   index, pressure, and opacity with high sensitivity. We demonstrate that
   the glucose concentration can be monitored when mixed in a different
   concentrated phosphate-buffered saline solution. The free-solution
   binding of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and anti-BSA IgG is detected with
   this optical sensor. This low-cost, multifunctional, and reliable

Abstract = {{Directed self-assembly of block copolymers has received a great deal of
   research attention as a promising nanolithography to complement the
   intrinsic limitations of conventional photolithography. In this review,
   we highlight the recent progress in the development of the directed
   self-assembly process for practical utilization in semiconductor
   applications. Various advanced directed self-assembly approaches are
   examined, in which block copolymer self-assembly is synergistically
   integrated with conventional photolithography, such as ArF lithography
   or I-line lithography, via either epitaxial self-assembly or the
   graphoepitaxy principle. We focus on the practical advantages
   anticipated from directed self-assembly integration, such as pattern
   density multiplication, feature size uniformity improvement, line edge
   roughness reduction, as well as cost reduction. Additionally, a
   direction for future research on directed self-assembly is suggested
   with diverse potential applications.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of carbon nanotube network (CNN) devices is usually
   limited by the high resistance of individual nanotube junctions (NJs).
   We present a novel method to reduce this resistance through a nanoscale
   chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. By passing current through the
   devices in the presence of a gaseous CVD precursor, localized nanoscale
   Joule heating induced at the NJs stimulates the selective and
   self-limiting deposition of metallic nano-solder. The effectiveness of
   this nanosoldering process depends on the work function of the deposited
   metal (here Pd or HfB2), and it can improve the on/off current ratio of
   a CNN device by nearly an order of magnitude. This nanosoldering
   technique could also be applied to other device types where nanoscale
   resistance components limit overall device performance.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effect of geometrical parameters of gas
   coolers on system performance and the optimal discharge pressure with a
   developed and experimentally validated numerical model of an air-source
   transcritical CO2 heat pump water heater system. This model fully
   considered actual heat transfer process in the gas cooler and
   characteristics of major components adopted in the prototype system.
   Simulation results showed a good agreement with experimental results in
   terms of heat yields, COP and the optimal discharge pressure. Parametric
   analysis reveals that a larger heat transfer area of the gas cooler
   increases heat yields but decreases the optimal discharge pressure while
   other components in the system remain unchanged. In addition, at the
   same operating condition with the same heat transfer area, heat yields
   increase with CO2 mass fluxes by reducing tube diameters and flow
   passages of gas coolers, and beyond certain range of mass fluxes, the
   optimal discharge pressure increases sharply. As one result, the optimal
   range of CO2 mass flux in heat exchange tubes should be the range of
   155-325 kg m(-2) s(-1) at given condition in this paper. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, which is part of a collection in honour of Noel Clark's
   remarkable career on liquid crystal (LC) and soft matter research, we
   present examples of biologically inspired systems, which form LC phases
   with their LC nature impacting biological function in cells or being
   important in biomedical applications. One area focuses on understanding
   network and bundle formation of cytoskeletal polyampholytes (filamentous
   actin, microtubules and neurofilaments (NFs)). Here, we describe studies
   on NFs, the intermediate filaments of neurons, which form open network
   nematic LC hydrogels in axons. Synchrotron small-angle-X-ray scattering
   studies of NF protein dilution experiments and NF hydrogels subjected to
   osmotic stress show that NF networks are stabilised by competing
   long-range repulsion and attractions mediated by the NF's polyampholytic
   sidearms. The attractions are present both at very large inter-filament
   spacings, in the weak sidearm-interpenetrating regime, and at smaller
   inter-filament spacings, in the strong sidearm-interpenetrating regime.
   A second series of experiments will describe the structure and
   properties of cationic liposomes (CLs) complexed with nucleic acids
   (NAs). CL-NA complexes form liquid crystalline phases, which interact in
   a structure-dependent manner with cellular membranes enabling the design
   of complexes for efficient delivery of NA (DNA and RNA) in therapeutic
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To refine the Transfer Assessment Instrument (TAI 2.0),
   develop a training program for the TAX, and analyze the basic
   psychometric properties of the TAI 3.0, including reliability, standard
   error of measurement (SEM), minimal detectable change (MDC), and
   construct validity.
   Design: Repeated measures.
   Setting: A winter sports clinic for disabled veterans.
   Participants: Wheelchair users (N=41) who perform sitting-pivot or
   standing-pivot transfers.
   Intervention: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: TAI version 3.0, intraclass correlation
   coefficients, SEMs, and MDCs for reliable measurement of raters'
   responses. Spearman correlation coefficient, 1-way analysis of variance,
   and independent t tests to evaluate construct validity.
   Results: TAI 3.0 had acceptable to high levels of reliability (range,
   .74.88). The SEMs for part 1, part 2, and final scores ranged from .45
   to .75. The MDC was 1.5 points on the 10-point scale for the final
   score. There were weak correlations (p range, .13 to.25; P>.11) between
   TAI final scores and subjects' characteristics (eg, sex, body mass
   index, age, type of disability, length of wheelchair use, grip and elbow
   strength, sitting balance).
   Conclusions: With comprehensive training, the refined TAI 3.0 yields
   high reliability among raters of different clinical backgrounds and
   experience. TAI 3.0 was unbiased toward certain physical characteristics
   that may influence transfer. TAI fills a void in the field by providing
   a quantitative measurement of transfers and a tool that can be used to
   detect problems and guide transfer training. Archives of Physical
   Medicine and Rehabilitation 2013;94:2456-64 (C) 2013 by the American

Abstract = {{Dynamic construction site layout planning is a complex optimization
   problem that is characterized by nonlinear objectives and constraints,
   which impose great challenges in obtaining global and feasible
   solutions. This paper presents and compares between two global
   optimization models of dynamic site layout planning that were developed
   to overcome the limitation of previous models in the literature. The
   first model utilizes Genetic Algorithms (GA) while the second model
   utilizes Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP). The performance of these
   two optimization models is analyzed in terms of the effectiveness of
   reaching optimum solutions and the efficiency of reducing the
   computational time. This analysis is performed using a designed set of
   problems of dynamic site layout planning with changing size and
   complexity. It was found that ADP outperformed GAs in terms of
   effectiveness and efficiency. However, GAs still prove to be a viable
   optimization tool because of its simplicity and multi-objective
   optimization capabilities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation was conducted on a direct injection (DI)
   diesel engine with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), coupled with port
   fuel injection (PFI) of n-butanol. Effects of butanol concentration and
   EGR rate on combustion, efficiency, and emissions of the tested engine
   were evaluated, and also compared to a DI mode of diesel-butanol blended
   fuel. The results show butanol concentration and EGR rate have a coupled
   impact on combustion process. Under low EGR rate condition, both the
   peak cylinder pressure and the peak heat release rate increase with
   increased butanol concentration, but no visible influence was found on
   the ignition delay. Under high EGR rate condition, however, the peak
   cylinder pressure and the peak heat release rate both decrease with
   increased butanol concentration, accompanied by longer ignition delay
   and longer combustion duration. As regard to the regulated emissions, HC
   and CO emissions increase with increased butanol concentration, causing
   higher indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC) and lower indicated
   thermal efficiency (ITE). It is also noted that butanol PFI in
   combination with EGR can change the trade-off relationship between NOx
   and soot, and simultaneously reduce both into a very low level. Compared
   with the DI mode of diesel-butanol blended fuel, however, the DI diesel
   engine with butanol PFI has higher HC and CO emissions and lower ITE.
   Therefore, future research should be focused on overcoming the
   identified shortcomings by an improved injection strategy of butanol
   PFI. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology is presented for the expedient statistical analysis of the
   electromagnetic attributes of passive microwave structures exhibiting
   manufacturing uncertainty in geometric and material parameters. In the
   proposed approach, the computational complexity stemming from the high
   dimensionality of the random space that describes the uncertainty in the
   electromagnetic analysis of the structure is mitigated by employing a
   principal component analysis with sensitivity assessment in combination
   with an adaptive sparse grid collocation scheme. The method exploits the
   inherent dependencies between random parameters to reduce the number of
   simulations needed to extract the statistics of the desired output
   response. This leads to the expedient estimation of production yield by
   means of the cross-entropy algorithm, which provides for fast
   calculation of the failure probability for a given functionality
   criterion. The proposed methodology is demonstrated through its
   application to the analysis of crosstalk in coupled microstrip lines
   exhibiting manufacturing variability and the investigation of the
   variation the bandwidth characteristics of a bandpass filter in the
   presence of uncertainty in geometric and/or material parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a laterally graded-channel pseudo-junctionless
   (GPJL) MOSFET for analog/RF applications. We examine the dynamical
   performance of GPJL MOSFET and compare it with the common junctionless
   (JL) MOSFET architecture using a 2-D full-band electron Monte Carlo
   simulator (MC) with quantum correction. Our results indicate that the
   GPJL MOSFET outperforms the conventional JL MOSFET, yielding higher
   values of drain current (I-ds), transconductance (g(m)), and cutoff
   frequency (f(t)). Further, the emerging electric field and velocity
   distributions, as a consequence of the channel engineering introduced by
   the GPJL MOSFET, result in lower output conductance (g(ds)) and higher
   early voltage (V-ea). The preeminence of the GPJL transistor over the JL
   transistor is further illustrated by showing improvements on the
   intrinsic voltage gain (A(vo)) in the subthreshold regime, to as high as
   61 \%. These results indicate that our proposed GPJL MOSFET yields
   improvement in the analog/RF performance metrics as compared to JL

Title = {{An evaluation of Sherwood-Gilland models for NAPL dissolution and their
   relationship to soil properties}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{87-98}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the longevity of non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) source zones
   has proven to be a difficult modeling problem that has yet to be
   resolved. Research efforts towards understanding NAPL depletion have
   focused on developing empirical models that relate lumped mass transfer
   rates to velocities and organic saturations. These empirical models are
   often unable to predict NAPL dissolution for systems different from
   those used to calibrate them, indicating that system-specific factors
   important for dissolution are not considered. This introduces the need
   for a calibration step before these models can be reliably used to
   predict NAPL dissolution for systems of arbitrary characteristics.
   In this paper, five published Sherwood-Gilland models are evaluated
   using experimental observations from the dissolution of two
   laboratory-scale complex three-dimensional NAPL source zones. It is
   shown that the relative behavior of the five models depends on the
   system and source zone characteristics. Through a theoretical analysis,
   comparing Sherwood-Gilland type models to a process-based, thermodynamic
   dissolution model, it is shown that the coefficients of the
   Sherwood-Gilland models can be related to measurable soil properties.
   The derived dissolution model with soil-dependent coefficients predicts
   concentrations identical to those predicted by the thermodynamic
   dissolution model for cases with negligible hysteresis. This
   correspondence breaks down when hysteresis has a significant impact on
   interfacial areas. In such cases, the derived dissolution model will
   slightly underestimate dissolved concentrations at later times, but is
   more likely to capture system-specific dissolution rates than
   Sherwood-Gilland models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The rise of optogenetics provides unique opportunities to advance
   materials and biomedical engineering, as well as fundamental
   understanding in neuroscience. This protocol describes the fabrication
   of optoelectronic devices for studying intact neural systems. Unlike
   optogenetic approaches that rely on rigid fiber optics tethered to
   external light sources, these novel devices carry wirelessly powered
   microscale, inorganic light-emitting diodes (mu-ILEDs) and multimodal
   sensors inside the brain. We describe the technical procedures for
   construction of these devices, their corresponding radiofrequency power
   scavengers and their implementation in vivo for experimental
   application. In total, the timeline of the procedure, including device
   fabrication, implantation and preparation to begin in vivo
   experimentation, can be completed in similar to 3-8 weeks.
   Implementation of these devices allows for chronic (tested for up to 6
   months) wireless optogenetic manipulation of neural circuitry in animals
   navigating complex natural or home-cage environments, interacting
   socially, and experiencing other freely moving behaviors.}},

   single-crystal thin films individually using 1MeV Kr ions and 150keV Xe

   examination, diffraction contrast imaging and high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), has confirmed that the
   irradiation-induced dislocation loops in CeO2 were Frank loops, having
   an interstitial nature with \{111\} habit planes and a 1/3 < 111 >
   Burgers vector. Dislocation loops were confirmed to be a stacking fault
   in nature through TEM observations of the interference fringes inside
   the loop periphery.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a framework to study the impact of stochastic active/reactive
   power injections on power system dynamics with a focus on time scales
   involving electromechanical phenomena. In this framework, the
   active/reactive power injections evolve according to a continuous-time
   Markov chain (CTMC), while the power system dynamics are described by
   the standard differential algebraic equation (DAE) model. The DAE model
   is linearized around a nominal set of active/reactive power injections,
   and the combination of the linearized DAE model and the CTMC forms a
   stochastic process known as a stochastic hybrid system (SHS). The
   extended generator of the SHS yields a system of ordinary differential
   equations that governs the evolution of the power system dynamic and
   algebraic state moments. We illustrate the application of the framework
   to the computation of long-term power system state statistics, and to
   short-term probabilistic dynamic performance/reliability assessment.}},

Abstract = {{The two-way wiretap channel is considered in this paper. Two legitimate
   users, Alice and Bob, wish to exchange messages securely in the presence
   of a passive eavesdropper Eve. In the full-duplex scenario, where each
   node can transmit and receive simultaneously, new achievable secrecy
   rate regions are obtained based on the idea of allowing the two users to
   jointly optimize their channel prefixing distributions and binning
   codebooks in addition to key sharing. The new regions are shown to be
   strictly larger than the known ones for a wide class of discrete
   memoryless and Gaussian channels. In the half-duplex case, where a user
   can only transmit or receive on any given degree of freedom, the idea of
   randomized scheduling is introduced and shown to offer a significant
   gain in terms of the achievable secrecy sum-rate. A practical setup is
   further developed based on a near field wireless communication scenario,
   and it is shown that one can exploit the two-way nature of the
   communication, via appropriately randomizing the transmit power levels
   and transmission schedule, to introduce significant ambiguity at a
   noiseless Eve.}},

Abstract = {{The small sample universal hypothesis testing problem is investigated in
   this paper, in which the number of samples n is smaller than the number
   of possible outcomes m. The goal of this paper is to find an appropriate
   criterion to analyze statistical tests in this setting. A suitable model
   for analysis is the high-dimensional model in which both n and m
   increase to infinity, and n = o(m). A new performance criterion based on
   large deviations analysis is proposed and it generalizes the classical
   error exponent applicable for large sample problems (in which m = O(n)).
   This generalized error exponent criterion provides insights that are not
   available from asymptotic consistency or central limit theorem analysis.
   The following results are established for the uniform null distribution:
   1) The best achievable probability of error P-e decays as P-e =
   exp\{-(n(2/)m)j(1 + o(1))\} for some j > 0. 2) A class of tests based on
   separable statistics, including the coincidence-based test, attains the
   optimal generalized error exponents. 3) Pearson's chi-square test has a
   zero generalized error exponent and thus its probability of error is
   asymptotically larger than the optimal test.}},

Abstract = {{The ensemble properties of random vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks
   for limited-feedback beam forming in multiinput multioutput (MIMO)
   systems are studied with the metrics of interest being the received loss
   and mutual information loss, both relative to a perfect channel state
   information (CSI) benchmark. The simplest case of unskewed codebooks is
   first studied in the correlated MIMO setting and these loss metrics are
   computed as a function of the number of bits of feedback (B), transmit
   antenna dimension (N-t), and spatial correlation. In particular, it is
   established that: 1) the loss metrics are a product of two components-a
   quantization component and a channel-dependent component; 2) the
   quantization component, which is also common to analysis of channels
   with i.i.d. fading, decays as B increases at the rate 2(-B/(Nt-1)) ; 3)
   the channel-dependent component reflects the condition number of the
   channel. Further, the precise connection between the received loss and
   the squared singular values of the channel is shown to be a Schur-convex
   majorization relationship. Finally, the ensemble properties of skewed
   codebooks that are generated by skewing RVQ codebooks with an
   appropriately designed fixed skewing matrix are studied. Based on an
   estimate of the loss expression for skewed codebooks, it is established
   that the structure of a good skewing matrix is critically dependent on
   the condition numbers of the effective channel (product of the true
   channel and the skewing matrix) and the skewing matrix.}},

Title = {{Decomposition and solubility of H2O2: implications in exhaled breath
   condensate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BREATH RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is one of the metabolic end products present in
   exhaled breath. High levels of H2O2 found in breath condensate are an
   indicator of airway inflammation and could be used for monitoring the
   condition of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
   However, sampling conditions such as breath temperature, condensing
   temperature, flow rate and collection time can affect the intrinsic
   properties of H2O2-its solubility, volatility, and decomposition rate.
   Sudden decreases to H2O2 concentration may be due to the sampling
   conditions instead of the patient's health status. The decomposition
   rate and Henry's law constant for saturated H2O2 vapor (RH > 95\%)
   within 22-42 degrees C, which correlates to room temperature and range
   of human breath temperatures, are needed for better understanding and
   standardization of breath collection. In this study, we determined the
   effects of initial H2O2 concentration, temperature, and sampling time on
   the decomposition rate by comparing electrochemical measurements of H2O2
   in simulated breath samples. The experimental results showed the
   decomposition rate of H2O2 increased as the breath temperature and
   sampling time increased and the solubility of H2O2 increased with
   increasing flow rate and condensing temperature during sampling.
   Prediction models for H2O2 sensing in exhaled breath sample were
   developed that could be used in the standardization of exhaled breath
   condensate collection. These experimental findings need to be further
   verified with human/animal breath samples.}},

   and developed an optimization framework determining the optimal
   assignment for track class based upon the characteristics of the track,
   traffic demand, and maintenance budget. We also presented a solution

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{6371-6386}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recently, sparsity-based algorithms are proposed for super-resolution
   spectrum estimation. However, to achieve adequately high resolution in
   real-world signal analysis, the dictionary atoms have to be close to
   each other in frequency, thereby resulting in a coherent design. The
   popular convex compressed sensing methods break down in presence of high
   coherence and large noise. We propose a new regularization approach to
   handle model collinearity and obtain parsimonious frequency selection
   simultaneously. It takes advantage of the pairing structure of sine and
   cosine atoms in the frequency dictionary. A probabilistic spectrum
   screening is also developed for fast computation in high dimensions. A
   data-resampling version of high-dimensional Bayesian Information
   Criterion is used to determine the regularization parameters.
   Experiments show the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed algorithms
   in challenging situations with small sample size, high frequency
   resolution, and low signal-to-noise ratio.}},

Title = {{Aluminum Alloying Effects on Lattice Types, Microstructures, and
   Mechanical Behavior of High-Entropy Alloys Systems}},
Journal = {{JOM}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1848-1858}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The crystal lattice type is one of the dominant factors for controlling
   the mechanical behavior of high-entropy alloys (HEAs). For example, the
   yield strength at room temperature varies from 300 MPa for the
   face-centered-cubic (fcc) structured alloys, such as the CoCrCuFeNiTi
   (x) system, to about 3,000 MPa for the body-centered-cubic (bcc)
   structured alloys, such as the AlCoCrFeNiTi (x) system. The values of
   Vickers hardness range from 100 to 900, depending on lattice types and
   microstructures. As in conventional alloys with one or two principal
   elements, the addition of minor alloying elements to HEAs can further
   alter their mechanical properties, such as strength, plasticity,
   hardness, etc. Excessive alloying may even result in the change of
   lattice types of HEAs. In this report, we first review alloying effects
   on lattice types and properties of HEAs in five Al-containing HEA
   systems: Al (x) CoCrCuFeNi, Al (x) CoCrFeNi, Al (x) CrFe1.5MnNi0.5, Al
   (x) CoCrFeNiTi, and Al (x) CrCuFeNi2. It is found that Al acts as a
   strong bcc stabilizer, and its addition enhances the strength of the
   alloy at the cost of reduced ductility. The origins of such effects are
   then qualitatively discussed from the viewpoints of lattice-strain
   energies and electronic bonds. Quantification of the interaction between
   Al and 3d transition metals in fcc, bcc, and intermetallic compounds is
   illustrated in the thermodynamic modeling using the CALculation of PHAse
   Diagram method.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a serious concern for
   patients in the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit (NSICU). The risks to
   patients are significant and the monetary costs are astronomical. We
   review a multimodality approach that substantially reduced VAP rate in
   our ICU
   Methods. Data from all patients admitted to the NSICU between January
   2005 and April 2010 were reviewed. All ventilated patients were treated
   according to a multimodality YAP assessment and prevention protocol,
   implementation of which began in August of 2008 and was completed by
   March, 2009. Rates of YAP before, during, and after implementation of
   the protocol are compared. VAP rates are also compared to national rates
   as obtained from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).
   Results. In the pre-implementation period, the YAP rate was 11.6 per
   1000 ventilator days. This rate was twice the national average. In the
   post implementation period, the YAP rate was 5.5/1000 ventilator days.
   YAP rate dropped precipitously after full compliance with the protocol
   was achieved.
   Conclusion. Although intubated patients in the NSICU are at high risk
   for VAP, a significant reduction in YAP-related morbidity and monetary
   costs can be obtained with multimodality prevention and testing
   protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate segmentation of knee cartilage is required to obtain
   quantitative cartilage measurements, which is crucial for the assessment
   of knee pathology caused by musculoskeletal diseases or sudden injuries.
   This paper presents an automatic knee cartilage segmentation technique
   which exploits a rich set of image features from multi-contrast magnetic
   resonance (MR) images and the spatial dependencies between neighbouring
   voxels. The image features and the spatial dependencies are modelled
   into a support vector machine (SVM)-based association potential and a
   discriminative random field (DRF)-based interaction potential.
   Subsequently, both potentials are incorporated into an inference
   graphical model such that the knee cartilage segmentation is cast into
   an optimal labelling problem which can be efficiently solved by loopy
   belief propagation. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is
   validated on a database of multi-contrast MR images. The experimental
   results show that using diverse forms of image and anatomical structure
   information as the features are helpful in improving the segmentation,
   and the joint SVM-DRF model is superior to the classification models
   based solely on DRF or SVM in terms of accuracy when the same features
   are used. The developed segmentation technique achieves good performance
   compared with gold standard segmentations and obtained higher average
   DSC values than the state-of-the-art automatic cartilage segmentation
   studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional tissue engineered constructs provide a platform to
   examine how the local extracellular matrix (ECM) contributes to the
   malignancy of cancers such as human glioblastoma multiforme. Improved
   resolution of how local matrix biophysical features impact glioma
   proliferation, genomic and signal transduction paths, as well as
   phenotypic malignancy markers would complement recent improvements in
   our understanding of molecular mechanisms associated with enhanced
   malignancy. Here, we report the use of a gelatin methacrylate (GelMA)
   platform to create libraries of three-dimensional biomaterials to
   identify combinations of biophysical features that promote malignant
   phenotypes of human U87MG glioma cells. We noted key biophysical
   properties, namely matrix density, crosslinking density, and
   biodegradability, that significantly impact glioma cell morphology,
   proliferation, and motility. Gene expression profiles and secreted
   markers of increased malignancy, notably VEGF, MMP-2, MMP-9, HIF-1, and
   the ECM protein fibronectin, were also significantly impacted by the
   local biophysical environment as well as matrix-induced deficits in
   diffusion-mediated oxygen and nutrient biotransport. Overall, this
   biomaterial system provides a flexible platform to explore the role
   biophysical factors play in the etiology, growth, and subsequent
   invasive spreading of gliomas. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional (3D), multiphase lattice Boltzmann approach is used
   to study a pressure-driven displacement flow of two immiscible liquids
   of different densities and viscosities in a square duct. A

   effects of channel inclination, viscosity, and density contrasts are
   investigated. The contours of the density and the average viscosity
   profiles in different planes are plotted and compared with those
   obtained in a two-dimensional (2D) channel. We demonstrate that the flow
   dynamics in a 3D channel is quite different as compared to that of a 2D
   channel. We found that the flow is relatively more coherent in a 3D

Abstract = {{Currently, the evaluation of thyroid cancer relies on the use of
   fine-needle aspiration biopsy, as non-invasive imaging methods do not
   provide sufficient levels of accuracy for the diagnosis of this disease.
   In this study, the potential of quantitative ultrasound methods for
   characterization of thyroid tissues was studied using a rodent model ex
   vivo. A high-frequency ultrasonic scanning system (40 MHz) was used to
   scan thyroids extracted from mice that had spontaneously developed
   thyroid lesions (cancerous or benign). Three sets of mice were acquired
   having different predispositions to developing three thyroid anomalies:
   C-cell adenoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and follicular variant
   papillary thyroid carcinoma (FV-PTC). A fourth set of mice that did not
   develop thyroid anomalies (normal mice) were used as controls. The
   backscatter coefficient was estimated from excised thyroid lobes the
   different mice. From the backscatter coefficient versus frequency (25-45
   MHz), the effective scatterer diameter (ESD) and effective acoustic
   concentration (EAC) were estimated. From the envelope of the
   back-scattered signal, the homodyned K distribution was used to estimate
   the k parameter (ratio of coherent to incoherent signal energy) and the
   mu parameter (number of scatterers per resolution cell). Statistically
   significant differences were observed between cancerous thyroids and
   normal thyroids based on the ESD, EAC and mu parameters. The mean ESD
   values were 18.0 +/- 0.92, 15.9 +/- 0.81 and 21.5 +/- 1.80 mu m for the
   PTC, FV-PTC and normal thyroids, respectively. The mean EAC values were
   59.4 +/- 1.74, 62.7 +/- 1.61 and 52.9 +/- 3.42 dB (mm(-3)) for the PTC,
   FV-PTC and normal thyroids, respectively. The mean mu values were 2.55
   +/- 0.37, 2.59 +/- 0.43 and 1.56 +/- 0.99 for the PTC, FV-PTC and normal
   thyroids, respectively. Statistically significant differences were
   observed between cancerous thyroids and C-cell adenomas based on the ESD
   and EAC parameters, with an estimated ESD value of 21.3 +/- 1.50 mu m
   and EAC value of 54.7 +/- 2.24 dB mm(-3) for C-cell adenomas. These
   results suggest that high-frequency quantitative ultrasound may enhance
   the ability to detect and classify diseased thyroid tissues. (E-mail:

Title = {{Differentially private histogram publication}},
Journal = {{VLDB JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{797-822}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Differential privacy (DP) is a promising scheme for releasing the
   results of statistical queries on sensitive data, with strong privacy
   guarantees against adversaries with arbitrary background knowledge.
   Existing studies on differential privacy mostly focus on simple
   aggregations such as counts. This paper investigates the publication of
   DP-compliant histograms, which is an important analytical tool for
   showing the distribution of a random variable, e.g., hospital bill size
   for certain patients. Compared to simple aggregations whose results are
   purely numerical, a histogram query is inherently more complex, since it
   must also determine its structure, i.e., the ranges of the bins. As we
   demonstrate in the paper, a DP-compliant histogram with finer bins may
   actually lead to significantly lower accuracy than a coarser one, since
   the former requires stronger perturbations in order to satisfy DP.
   Moreover, the histogram structure itself may reveal sensitive
   information, which further complicates the problem. Motivated by this,
   we propose two novel mechanisms, namely NoiseFirst and StructureFirst,
   for computing DP-compliant histograms. Their main difference lies in the
   relative order of the noise injection and the histogram structure
   computation steps. NoiseFirst has the additional benefit that it can
   improve the accuracy of an already published DP-compliant histogram
   computed using a naive method. For each of proposed mechanisms, we
   design algorithms for computing the optimal histogram structure with two
   different objectives: minimizing the mean square error and the mean
   absolute error, respectively. Going one step further, we extend both
   mechanisms to answer arbitrary range queries. Extensive experiments,
   using several real datasets, confirm that our two proposals output
   highly accurate query answers and consistently outperform existing
   competitors.}},

Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers four types of error measures, each tailored to the
   generalized finite element method. Particular attention is given to
   two-dimensional elasticity problems with singular stress fields. The
   first error measure is obtained using the equilibrated element residual
   method. The other three estimators overcome the necessity of
   equilibrating the residue by employing a subdomain strategy. In this
   strategy, the partition of unity (PoU) property is used to decompose the
   error problem into local contributions over each patch of elements. The
   residual functional of the error problem is the same for the subdomain
   estimators, but the bi-linear form is different for each one of them. In
   the second estimator, the bi-linear form is weighted by the PoU
   functions associated with the patch over which the error problem is
   stated. No weighting appears in the bi-linear form of the third
   estimator. The fourth measure is proposed as an alternative strategy, in
   which the products of the PoU functions and test functions are
   introduced as weights in the weighted integral statement of the
   differential equation describing the error problem. The linear form of
   the local error problem is then identical to that of the other subdomain
   techniques, while the bi-linear form is stated differently, with the PoU
   functions directly multiplying the test functions. The goal of this
   study is to investigate the performance of the four estimators in
   two-dimensional elasticity problems with geometries that produce
   singularities in the stress field and concentration of the error in the
   numerical solution.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce visual phrases, complex visual composites
   like ``a person riding a horse.{''} Visual phrases often display
   significantly reduced visual complexity compared to their component
   objects because the appearance of those objects can change profoundly
   when they participate in relations. We introduce a dataset suitable for
   phrasal recognition that uses familiar PASCAL object categories, and
   demonstrate significant experimental gains resulting from exploiting
   visual phrases. We show that a visual phrase detector significantly
   outperforms a baseline which detects component objects and reasons about
   relations, even though visual phrase training sets tend to be smaller
   than those for objects. We argue that any multiclass detection system
   must decode detector outputs to produce final results; this is usually
   done with nonmaximum suppression. We describe a novel decoding procedure
   that can account accurately for local context without solving difficult
   inference problems. We show this decoding procedure outperforms the
   state of the art. Finally, we show that decoding a combination of
   phrasal and object detectors produces real improvements in detector
   results.}},

   on the long wavelength fundamental mode. All lasers show profound impact
   of the current induced self-heating. In order to elucidate this impact,
   we improve the existing rate equation model by considering nonuniform
   longitudinal temperature distribution and adding the gain and refractive
   index temperature dependencies. We are able to reproduce the
   experimentally observed switchings between different longitudinal modes,
   as well as all the three different types of modal behavior.}},

Abstract = {{As analysts are expected to process a greater amount of information in a
   shorter amount of time, creators of big data software are challenged
   with the need for improved efficiency. Ray, our group's usable, scalable
   genome assembler, addresses big data problems by using optimal resources
   and producing one, correct and conservative, timely solution. Only by
   abstracting the size of the data from both the computers and the humans
   can the real scientific question, often complex in itself, eventually be
   solved. To draw a curtain over the specific computational machinery of
   big data, we developed RayPlatform, a programming framework that allows
   users to concentrate on their domain-specific problems. RayPlatform is a
   parallel message-passing software framework that runs on clouds,
   supercomputers, and desktops alike. Using established technologies such
   as C++ and MPI (message-passing interface), we handle the genomes of
   hundreds of species, from viruses to plants, using machines ranging from
   desktop computers to supercomputers. From this experience, we present
   insights on making computer time more useful-and user time much more

Journal = {{GRANULAR MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{747-758}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Due to the nonlinear nature of the inter-particle contact, granular
   chains made of elastic spheres are known to transmit solitary waves
   under impulse loading. However, the localized contact between spherical
   granules leads to stress concentration, resulting in plastic behavior
   even for small forces. In this work, we investigate the effects of
   plasticity in wave propagation in elasto-plastic granular systems. In
   the first part of this work, a force-displacement law between contacting
   elastic-perfectly plastic spheres is developed using a nonlinear finite
   element analysis. In the second part, this force-displacement law is
   used to simulate wave propagation in one-dimensional granular chains. In
   elasto-plastic chains, energy dissipation leads to the formation and
   merging of wave trains, which have characteristics very different from
   those of elastic chains. Scaling laws for peak force at each contact
   point along the chain, velocity of the leading wave, local contact and
   total dissipation are developed.}},

Abstract = {{Crystal acoustics is a field that has engaged the attention of
   theoreticians and experimentalists alike for decades and more. Many
   striking effects have been revealed, and elegant analytical techniques
   applied to their interpretation. This article is oriented towards the
   experimental aspects of the field and the interpretation of the
   phenomena that have been observed. Particular attention is given to
   reviewing the techniques that have probed the intricacy of acoustic wave
   propagation in crystals, including phonon imaging, laser- and
   capillary-fracture-generated ultrasound, transmission acoustic
   microscopy and surface Brillouin scattering, and a selection of results
   obtained with these techniques is presented. Some of these studies
   pertain to bulk waves and others to surface acoustic waves. The
   interpretation of far-field observations is carried out within the ray
   approximation, and elastodynamic Green's functions are invoked in the
   interpretation of near-field results. Extensive use is made of the
   acoustic-slowness and wave surfaces, in particular features such as
   acoustic axes, with their attendant polarization singularities, and
   folds in the wave surface. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel amorphous cobalt potassium phosphate hydrate compound (KCoPO4.
   H2O) is identified to be active photocatalyst for oxygen evolution
   reaction (OER) to facilitate hydrogen generation from water photolysis.
   It has been synthesized through a facile and cost-effective
   solution-based precipitation method using earth-abundant materials. Its
   highly porous structure and large surface areas are found to be
   responsible for the excellent electrochemical performance featuring a
   low OER onset at similar to 550 rnVscE and high current density in
   alkaline condition. Unlike traditional cobalt-based spinel oxides
   (Co3O4, NiCo2O4) and phosphate (Co Pi, Co(PO3)(2)) electrocatalysts,
   with proper energy band alignment for lightassisted water oxidation,
   cobalt potassium phosphate hydrate also exhibits robust visible-light
   response, generating a photocurrent density of 200 mu A cm(-2) at 0.7
   VscE. This catalyst could thus be considered as a promising candidate to
   perform photoelectrochemical water splitting. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In Part I of this article, the role of the Zn content in the development
   of solidification microstructures in Al-Zn alloys was investigated
   experimentally using X-ray tomographic microscopy. The transition region
   between dendrites found at low Zn content and dendrites found at high Zn
   content was characterized by textured seaweed-type structures. This
   Dendrite Orientation Transition (DOT) was explained by the effect of the
   Zn content on the weak anisotropy of the solid-liquid interfacial energy
   of Al. In order to further support this interpretation and to elucidate
   the growth mechanisms of the complex structures that form in the DOT
   region, a detailed phase-field study exploring anisotropy parameters'
   space is presented in this paper. For equiaxed growth, our results
   essentially recapitulate those of Haxhimali et al.{[}1] in simulations
   for pure materials. We find distinct regions of the parameter space
   associated with and dendrites, separated by a region where hyperbranched
   dendrites are observed. In simulations of directional solidification, we
   find similar behavior at the extrema, but in this case, the anisotropy
   parameters corresponding to the hyperbranched region produce textured
   seaweeds. As noted in the experimental work reported in Part I, these
   structures are actually dendrites that prefer to grow misaligned with
   respect to the thermal gradient direction. We also show that in this
   region, the dendrites grow with a blunted tip that oscillates and
   splits, resulting in an oriented trunk that continuously emits side
   branches in other directions. We conclude by making a correlation
   between the alloy composition and surface energy anisotropy parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The sparsity of images in a transform domain or dictionary has been
   exploited in many applications in image processing. For example,
   analytical sparsifying transforms, such as wavelets and discrete cosine
   transform (DCT), have been extensively used in compression standards.
   Recently, synthesis sparsifying dictionaries that are directly adapted
   to the data have become popular especially in applications such as image
   denoising. Following up on our recent research, where we introduced the
   idea of learning square sparsifying transforms, we propose here novel
   problem formulations for learning doubly sparse transforms for signals
   or image patches. These transforms are a product of a fixed, fast
   analytic transform such as the DCT, and an adaptive matrix constrained
   to be sparse. Such transforms can be learnt, stored, and implemented
   efficiently. We show the superior promise of our learnt transforms as
   compared with analytical sparsifying transforms such as the DCT for
   image representation. We also show promising performance in image
   denoising that compares favorably with approaches involving learnt
   synthesis dictionaries such as the K-SVD algorithm. The proposed
   approach is also much faster than K-SVD denoising.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new upsampling method to enhance the spatial resolution of
   depth images. Given a low-resolution depth image from an active depth
   sensor and a potentially high-resolution color image from a passive RGB
   camera, we formulate it as an adaptive cost aggregation problem and
   solve it using the bilateral filter. The formulation synergistically
   combines the median and bilateral filters thus it better preserves the
   depth edges and is more robust to noise. Numerical and visual
   evaluations on a total of 37 Middlebury data sets demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our method. A real-time high-resolution depth capturing
   system is also developed using commercial active depth sensor based on
   the proposed upsampling method.}},

Abstract = {{A Green's function solution method is implemented to study sound
   attenuation in single-inlet/double-outlet (SIDO) and
   double-inlet/single-outlet (DISO) circular chamber mufflers. The
   mufflers are modeled as piston driven rigid circular chambers containing
   a stationary fluid. The pistons are assumed to perform simple harmonic
   motion with uniform velocities. Velocity potential in the chamber is
   derived as a superposition of three dimensional velocity potential due
   to each piston. Pressure field in the chamber is calculated from the
   velocity potential through conservation of linear momentum equation.
   Acoustic pressure acting on each piston is calculated by averaging over
   the surface of the piston. Transmission loss (TL) is evaluated from
   incident and transmitted acoustic energy. TL curves for various
   inlet/outlet orientations derived from this method is validated with
   results obtained from the literature. The effect of locations of
   inlet/outlet on TL is studied. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Plug-in vehicles can behave either as loads or as a distributed energy
   and power resource in a concept known as vehicle-to-grid (V2G)
   connection. This paper reviews the current status and implementation
   impact of V2G/grid-to-vehicle (G2V) technologies on distributed systems,
   requirements, benefits, challenges, and strategies for V2G interfaces of
   both individual vehicles and fleets. The V2G concept can improve the
   performance of the electricity grid in areas such as efficiency,
   stability, and reliability. A V2G-capable vehicle offers reactive power
   support, active power regulation, tracking of variable renewable energy
   sources, load balancing, and current harmonic filtering. These
   technologies can enable ancillary services, such as voltage and
   frequency control and spinning reserve. Costs of V2G include battery
   degradation, the need for intensive communication between the vehicles
   and the grid, effects on grid distribution equipment, infrastructure
   changes, and social, political, cultural, and technical obstacles.
   Although V2G operation can reduce the lifetime of vehicle batteries, it
   is projected to become economical for vehicle owners and grid operators.
   Components and unidirectional/bidirectional power flow technologies of
   V2G systems, individual and aggregated structures, and
   charging/recharging frequency and strategies (uncoordinated/coordinated
   smart) are addressed. Three elements are required for successful V2G
   operation: power connection to the grid, control and communication
   between vehicles and the grid operator, and on-board/off-board
   intelligent metering. Success of the V2G concept depends on
   standardization of requirements and infrastructure decisions, battery
   technology, and efficient and smart scheduling of limited fast-charge
   infrastructure. A charging/discharging infrastructure must be deployed.
   Economic benefits of V2G technologies depend on vehicle aggregation and
   charging/recharging frequency and strategies. The benefits will receive
   increased attention from grid operators and vehicle owners in the
   future.}},

Title = {{TWO-SCALE 3D ANALYSIS OF REFLECTIVE CRACKS IN AIRFIELD PAVEMENTS}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Prediction and simulation of load-related reflective cracking in
   airfield pavements require 3D models in order to accurately capture the
   effects of gear loads on crack initiation and propagation. Furthermore,
   the size relations between aircraft landing gear, pavement area and
   reflective cracks make this a multi-scale problem. This paper presents a
   generalized finite element method (GFEM) based on the solution of
   interdependent global and local problems. The macro-scale component of
   the solution is approximated by a finite element global model, while the
   fine-scale is addressed by a local model. This allows accurate modeling
   of cracks in airfield pavements that are orders of magnitude larger than
   the critical zones in which the initiation of reflective cracking
   occurs. Two 3D pavement models are created for this study. The first
   model is subjected to the gear loading of a Boeing 777 aircraft. This
   example demonstrates the accuracy of solving a multi-scale pavement
   problem with a GFEM enriched with local problem solutions. The second
   problem studies the effect of the size of the local domain on the
   accuracy of the GFEM solution. The numerical simulations show that 3D
   multi-scale problems such as reflective cracks in airfield pavements,
   can be efficiently solved by a GFEM based on interdependent global and
   local problems.}},

Abstract = {{In this article the financial/ownership structures of agribusiness
   cooperatives are analyzed to examine whether new cooperative models
   perform better than the more traditional ones. The assessment procedure
   introduces a new financial decision-aid approach, which is based on
   data-analysis techniques in combination with a preference ranking
   organization method of enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE II). The
   application of this multicriteria decision-aid approach allows the rank
   ordering of cooperatives based on the most prominent financial ratios.
   The financial ratios were selected using principal component analysis.
   This analytical procedure reduces the dimensionality of large numbers of
   interrelated financial performance measures. We assess the financial
   success of Dutch agribusiness cooperatives for the period 19992010.
   Results show that there is no clear-cut evidence that cooperative models
   used to attract extra members investments and/or outside equity perform
   better than the more traditional models. This suggests that ownership
   structure of cooperatives is not always a decisive factor for their
   financial success. {[}EconLit citations: Q130, G320, C440]. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This study presents the superior structural versatility of strained
   silicon nitride (SiNx) membranes as a platform for three-dimensional
   (3D) hierarchical tubular architectures. The effects of compressive and
   tensile stressed SiNx layer thickness on the self-rolled-up tube
   curvature, the sacrificial layer etching anisotropy on rolling direction
   and chirality, and stress engineering by localized thickness control or
   thermal treatment, are explored systematically. Using strained SiNx
   membranes as an electrically insulating and optically transparent
   mechanical support, compact 3D hierarchical architectures involving
   carbon nanotube arrays and passive electronic components are
   demonstrated by releasing the functional structures deposited and
   patterned in 2D. These examples highlight the uniqueness of this
   platform that exploits 2D processing and self-assembly to achieve highly
   functional 3D structures.}},

Abstract = {{Microparticles capable of releasing protein drugs are often incorporated
   into injectable hydrogels to minimize their displacement at an
   implantation site, reduce initial drug burst, and further control drug
   release rates over a broader range. However, there is still a need to
   develop methods for releasing drug molecules over extended periods of
   time, in order to sustain the bioactivity of drug molecules at an
   implantation site. In this study, we hypothesized that a hydrogel formed
   through the cross-linking of pyrrole units linked to a hydrophilic
   polymer would release protein drugs in a more sustained manner, because
   of an enhanced association between crosslinked pyrrole groups and the
   drug molecules. To examine this hypothesis, we prepared hydrogels of
   alginate substituted with pyrrole groups, alginate-g-pyrrole, through a
   horse-radish peroxidase (HRP)-activated cross-linking of the pyrrole
   groups. The hydrogels were encapsulated with poly(lactic-co-glycolic
   acid) (PLGA) microparticles loaded with vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF). The resulting hydrogel system released VEGF in a more
   sustained manner than Ca2+ alginate or Ca2+ alginate-g-pyrrole gel
   systems. Finally, implantations of the VEGF-releasing HRP-activated
   alginate-g-pyrrole hydrogel system on chicken chorioallantoic membranes
   resulted in the formation of blood vessels in higher densities and with
   larger diameters, compared to other control conditions. Overall, the
   drug releasing system developed in this study will be broadly useful for
   regulating release rates of a wide array of protein drugs, and further
   enhance the quality of protein drug-based therapies. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   results. Changes in tropospheric O-3 burdens range from 2.3 Tg-O-3/Tg-N

   and methane radiative forcings range from -8.3 to -12.5 mW/m(2) for the
   2006 aviation emissions. As a group, the chemistry transport models tend
   to have similar responses while the fully coupled models tend to

   excitations proposed and/or observed. These nanoscale defects have a
   very low surface energy (22-210 m Jm(-2)), with twins favorable to the
   mesoscale. Defects exhibit smaller moments confined near their
   boundaries-making a uniform-moment picture inappropriate for long-range
   magnetic order in real samples. Nanotwins explain features in measured
   pair distribution functions so should be considered when analyzing
   scattering data. All these defects can be weakly mobile and/or can have

Abstract = {{This paper describes the preparation and understanding of helical
   peanut-shaped ribbons of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) by a magnetic
   field-assisted electrospinning method. The relative humidity is found to
   significantly influence the morphology of PVP fibers. The morphology
   changed from straight rods to helical ribbons as relative humidity
   decreased. The percentage of helical ribbons increased dramatically as
   well. At the same time, the cross-section of electrospun fibers changed
   from circle, to ellipse, and to peanut shape. Formation of helical
   ribbons is attributed to the synergistic interaction of bending
   instability and rigidity of the polymers during the electrospinning
   process. These fibers had different mechanical properties and the
   helical ribbons were shown to have the largest ultimate elongation. (C)

Abstract = {{Matrix mechanics controls cell fate by modulating the bonds between
   integrins and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. However, it remains
   unclear how fibronectin (FN), type 1 collagen, and their receptor
   integrin subtypes distinctly control force transmission to regulate
   focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity, a crucial molecular signal
   governing cell adhesion/migration. Here we showed, using a genetically
   encoded FAK biosensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer,
   that FN-mediated FAK activation is dependent on the mechanical tension,
   which may expose its otherwise hidden FN synergy site to integrin alpha
   5. In sharp contrast, the ligation between the constitutively exposed
   binding motif of type 1 collagen and its receptor integrin alpha 2 was
   surprisingly tension-independent to induce sufficient FAK activation.
   Although integrin alpha subunit determines mechanosensitivity, the
   ligation between alpha subunit and the ECM proteins converges at the
   integrin beta 1 activation to induce FAK activation. We further
   discovered that the interaction of the N-terminal protein
   4.1/ezrin/redixin/moesin basic patch with phosphatidylinositol
   4,5-biphosphate is crucial during cell adhesion to maintain the FAK
   activation from the inhibitory effect of nearby protein
   4.1/ezrin/redixin/moesin acidic sites. Therefore, different ECM proteins
   either can transmit or can shield from mechanical forces to regulate
   cellular functions, with the accessibility of ECM binding motifs by
   their specific integrin alpha subunits determining the biophysical
   mechanisms of FAK activation during mechanotransduction.}},

Abstract = {{Time-dependent mechanochemical activation of spiropyran (SP)
   mechanophores in cross-linked PMMA under creep loading is examined. In
   contrast to monotonic torsion (constant strain rate) results, the
   desired force-induced electrocyclic ring-opening of SP to the
   fluorescent merocyanine (MC) form is achieved at creep stress levels
   less than the yield stress of the bulk polymer. Lower values of stress
   require longer time, but much smaller strains for initiation of
   activation. Additionally, the first measurable detection of the reaction
   corresponds closely to the maximum creep strain rate, revealing
   mechanophore activation occurs near the onset of strain hardening, when
   polymer mobility is highest. The strong correlation between mechanical
   activation of the spiropyran and the rate of deformation suggests the
   potential for SP mechanophores as molecular probes of polymer relaxation
   and flow.}},

Abstract = {{Interaction forces between rotavirus and Suwanee River natural organic
   matter (SRNOM) or Colorado River NOM (CRNOM) were studied by atomic
   force microscopy (AFM) in NaCl solutions and at unadjusted pH (5.7-5.9).
   Compared to CRNOM, SRNOM has more aromatic carbon and
   phenolic/carboxylic functional groups. CRNOM is characterized with
   aliphatic structure and considerable presence of polysaccharide moieties
   rich in hydroxyl functional groups. Strong repulsive forces were
   observed between rotavirus and silica or mica or SRNOM. The interaction
   decay length derived from the approaching curves for these systems
   involving rotavirus in high ionic strength solution was significantly
   higher than the theoretical Debye length. While no adhesion was observed
   for rotavirus and SRNOM, attraction was observed between CRNOM and
   rotavirus during approach and adhesion during retraction. Moreover,
   these adhesion forces decreased with increasing ionic strength.
   Interactions due to ionic hydrogen bonding between deprotonated carboxyl
   groups on rotavirus and hydroxyl functional groups on CRNOM were
   suggested as the dominant interaction mechanisms between rotavirus and
   CRNOM.}},

Abstract = {{The distributions of event-by-event harmonic flow coefficients v (n) for
   n = 2- 4 are measured in = 2.76 TeV Pb + Pb collisions using the ATLAS
   detector at the LHC. The measurements are performed using charged
   particles with transverse momentum p (T) > 0.5 GeV and in the
   pseudorapidity range |eta| < 2.5 in a dataset of approximately 7 mu
   b(-1) recorded in 2010. The shapes of the v (n) distributions suggest
   that the associated flow vectors are described by a two-dimensional
   Gaussian function in central collisions for v (2) and over most of the
   measured centrality range for v (3) and v (4). Significant deviations
   from this function are observed for v (2) in mid-central and peripheral
   collisions, and a small deviation is observed for v (3) in mid-central
   collisions. In order to be sensitive to these deviations, it is shown
   that the commonly used multi-particle cumulants, involving four
   particles or more, need to be measured with a precision better than a
   few percent. The v (n) distributions are also measured independently for
   charged particles with 0.5 < p (T) < 1 GeV and p (T) > 1 GeV. When these
   distributions are rescaled to the same mean values, the adjusted shapes
   are found to be nearly the same for these two p (T) ranges. The v (n)
   distributions are compared with the eccentricity distributions from two
   models for the initial collision geometry: a Glauber model and a model
   that includes corrections to the initial geometry due to gluon
   saturation effects. Both models fail to describe the experimental data
   consistently over most of the measured centrality range.}},

Title = {{Comment on ``Hydrodynamics of fractal continuum flow{''} and ``Map of

Abstract = {{In two recent papers {[}Phys. Rev. E 85, 025302(R) (2012) and Phys. Rev.
   E 85, 056314 (2012)], the authors proposed fractal continuum
   hydrodynamics and its application to model fluid flows in fractally
   permeable reservoirs. While in general providing a certain advancement
   of continuum mechanics modeling of fractal media to fluid flows, some
   results and statements to previous works need clarification. We first
   show that the nonlocal character those authors alleged in our paper
   {[}Proc. R. Soc. A 465, 2521 (2009)] actually does not exist; instead,
   all those works are in the same general representation of derivative
   operators differing by specific forms of the line coefficient c(1).
   Next, the claimed generalization of the volumetric coefficient c(3) is,
   in fact, equivalent to previously proposed product measures when
   considering together the separate decomposition of c(3) on each
   coordinate. Furthermore, the modified Jacobian proposed in the two
   commented papers does not relate the volume element between the current
   and initial configurations, which henceforth leads to a correction of
   the Reynolds' transport theorem. Finally, we point out that the
   asymmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor resulting from the conservation of
   the angular momentum must not be ignored; this aspect motivates a more
   complete formulation of fractal continuum models within a micropolar
   framework.}},

Abstract = {{The PHENIX collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
   reports measurements of azimuthal dihadron correlations near midrapidity
   in d + Au collisions at root s(NN) = 200 GeV. These measurements
   complement recent analyses by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider
   (LHC) involving central p + Pb collisions at root s(NN) = 5.02 TeV,
   which have indicated strong anisotropic long-range correlations in
   angular distributions of hadron pairs. The origin of these anisotropies
   is currently unknown. Various competing explanations include parton
   saturation and hydrodynamic flow. We observe qualitatively similar, but
   larger, anisotropies in d + Au collisions at RHIC compared to those seen
   in p + Pb collisions at the LHC. The larger extracted upsilon(2) values
   in d + Au are consistent with expectations from hydrodynamic
   calculations owing to the larger expected initial-state eccentricity
   compared with that from p + Pb collisions. When both are divided by an
   estimate of the initial-state eccentricity the scaled anisotropies
   follow a common trend with multiplicity that may extend to heavy ion
   data at RHIC and the LHC, where the anisotropies are widely thought to
   arise from hydrodynamic flow.}},

Title = {{Probing plasma-surface interactions with the transmission electron

Abstract = {{Two platforms developed to probe the plasma-solid interface are briefly
   reviewed here. A sensitive diagnostic of the interaction between a
   low-temperature plasma and a silicon surface is provided by the plasma
   bipolar junction transistor (PBJT) in which e(-)-h(+) (semiconductor)
   and e(-)-ion (gas phase) plasmas are separated by a nanoscale potential
   barrier but coupled by a strong (>1 V mu m(-1)) electric field.
   Electrical properties of the Si base-collector plasma interface are
   controlled by the bias applied to the PBJT emitter-base junction, as
   well as the morphology and electronic structure of the base surface
   facing the collector plasma. Recent experiments are described in which
   the Si(100) surface of the PBJT base is transformed into black Si, a
   nanostructured array comprising similar to 3 x 10(9) nanocones. Each
   cone is similar to 100 nm in height and has a radius of curvature at its
   tip of <1 nm. Altering the base surface so as to intentionally enhance
   field emission results in burst-mode operation of the PBJT in which the
   collector current oscillates as a result of the periodic contraction (or
   collapse) and revival of the plasma sheath. The observed oscillation
   frequencies (3.6-13 kHz) are consistent with the transit time of ions
   across the sheath. Integration of a microplasma device with a
   transmission electron microscope has also been realized recently (Tai et
   al 2013 Sci. Rep. 3 1325). This diagnostic tool allows plasma-surface
   interactions to be observed in real-time with a spatial resolution <100
   nm. Although initial experiments concerned the growth of Au islands in a
   dc plasma, the extension of this probe to nanostructured and spatially
   modulated surfaces is proposed.}},

Title = {{Investigating xylose metabolism in recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae
   via C-13 metabolic flux analysis}},
Journal = {{MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: To engineer Saccharomyces cerevisiae for efficient xylose
   utilization, a fungal pathway consisting of xylose reductase, xylitol
   dehydrogenase, and xylulose kinase is often introduced to the host
   strain. Despite extensive in vitro studies on the xylose pathway, the
   intracellular metabolism rewiring in response to the heterologous xylose
   pathway remains largely unknown. In this study, we applied C-13
   metabolic flux analysis and stoichiometric modeling to systemically
   investigate the flux distributions in a series of xylose utilizing S.
   cerevisiae strains.
   Results: As revealed by C-13 metabolic flux analysis, the oxidative
   pentose phosphate pathway was actively used for producing NADPH required
   by the fungal xylose pathway during xylose utilization of recombinant S.
   cerevisiae strains. The TCA cycle activity was found to be tightly
   correlated with the requirements of maintenance energy and biomass
   yield. Based on in silico simulations of metabolic fluxes, reducing the
   cell maintenance energy was found crucial to achieve the optimal
   xylose-based ethanol production. The stoichiometric modeling also
   suggested that both the cofactor-imbalanced and cofactor-balanced
   pathways could lead to optimal ethanol production, by flexibly adjusting
   the metabolic fluxes in futile cycle. However, compared to the
   cofactor-imbalanced pathway, the cofactor-balanced xylose pathway can
   lead to optimal ethanol production in a wider range of fermentation
   conditions.
   Conclusions: By applying C-13-MFA and in silico flux balance analysis to
   a series of recombinant xylose-utilizing S. cerevisiae strains, this
   work brings new knowledge about xylose utilization in two aspects.
   First, the interplays between the fungal xylose pathway and the native
   host metabolism were uncovered. Specifically, we found that the high
   cell maintenance energy was one of the key factors involved in xylose
   utilization. Potential strategies to reduce the cell maintenance energy,
   such as adding exogenous nutrients and evolutionary adaptation, were
   suggested based on the in vivo and in silico flux analysis in this
   study. In addition, the impacts of cofactor balance issues on xylose
   utilization were systemically investigated. The futile pathways were
   identified as the key factor to adapt to different degrees of cofactor
   imbalances and suggested as the targets for further engineering to
   tackle cofactor-balance issues.}},

Abstract = {{Aerosolized or aspirated manufactured carbon nanotubes have been shown
   to be cytotoxic, cause pulmonary lesions, and demonstrate
   immunomodulatory properties. CD-1 mice were used to assess pulmonary
   toxicity of helical carbon nanotubes (HCNTs) and alterations of the
   immune response to subsequent infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in
   mice. HCNTs provoked a mild inflammatory response following either a
   single exposure or 2X/week for three weeks (multiple exposures) but were
   not significantly toxic. Administering HCNTs 2X/week for three weeks
   resulted in pulmonary lesions including granulomas and goblet cell
   hyperplasia. Mice exposed to HCNTs and subsequently infected by P.
   aeruginosa demonstrated an enhanced inflammatory response to P.
   aeruginosa and phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages was inhibited.
   However, clearance of P. aeruginosa was not affected. HCNT exposed mice
   depleted of neutrophils were more effective in clearing P. aeruginosa
   compared to neutrophil-depleted control mice, accompanied by an influx
   of macrophages. Depletion of systemic macrophages resulted in slightly
   inhibited bacterial clearance by HCNT treated mice. Our data indicate
   that pulmonary exposure to HCNTs results in lesions similar to those
   caused by other nanotubes and pre-exposure to HCNTs inhibit alveolar
   macrophage phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa. However, clearance was not
   affected as exposure to HCNTs primed the immune system for an enhanced
   inflammatory response to pulmonary infection consisting of an influx of
   neutrophils and macrophages.}},

Abstract = {{Airflow is a critical factor that influences air quality, airborne
   contaminant distribution, and disease transmission in commercial
   airliner cabins. The general aircraft-cabin air-contaminant transport
   effect model seeks to build exposure-spatial relationships between
   contaminant sources and receptors, quantify the uncertainty, and provide
   a platform for incorporation of data from a variety of studies.
   Knowledge of infection risk to flight crews and passengers is needed to
   form a coherent response to an unfolding epidemic, and infection risk
   may have an airborne pathogen exposure component. The general
   aircraft-cabin air-contaminant transport effect model was applied to
   datasets from the University of Illinois and Kansas State University and
   also to case study information from a flight with probable severe acute
   respiratory syndrome transmission. Data were fit to regression curves,
   where the dependent variable was contaminant concentration (normalized
   for source strength and ventilation rate), and the independent variable
   was distance between source and measurement locations. The data-driven
   model showed exposure to viable small droplets and post-evaporation
   nuclei at a source distance of several rows in a mock-up of a twin-aisle
   airliner with seven seats per row. Similar behavior was observed in
   tracer gas, particle experiments, and flight infection data for severe
   acute respiratory syndrome. The study supports the airborne pathway as
   part of the matrix of possible disease transmission modes in aircraft
   cabins.}},

Abstract = {{Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements of hydrogen
   segregation at dislocations in heavily deformed single crystal Pd have
   been performed at very low solute concentration (PdH0.0016) at
   equilibrium with respect to hydrogen gas at 295 K. The net (the
   without-hydrogen measurement subtracted from with-hydrogen measurement)
   absolute differential macroscopic scattering cross section has been fit
   with a cylindrical form factor to represent the Cottrell atmosphere,
   yielding local trapped concentration delta similar to 0.06 {[}H]/{[}Pd],
   local volumetric dilatation f similar to 1.01, and trapping radius R 4 A
   of the segregated hydrogen. This measurement augments SANS results below
   ambient temperature {[}B.J. Heuser, H. Ju, Phys. Rev. B 83 (2011)
   094103]. The temperature dependence of the measured radius is confirmed
   by a Fourier transform of hydrogen occupation at dislocations based on
   an elastic continuum treatment {[}Trinkle et al., Phys. Rev. B 83 (2011)
   174116]. The measured trapping parameters are consistent with a
   depopulation of weak long-range dislocation strain fields at ambient
   temperature; hydrogen binding to stronger core dislocation sites
   persists at 295 K and results in the measured net scattering. The local
   solute concentration and trapping radius (less than two Burgers vectors
   in Pd), are both too small to support optic mode dispersion due to
   inter-hydrogen interactions. This result supports the conclusion that
   trapped hydrogen undergoes a hydride to solid solution phase
   transformation between 200 and 300 K based on hydrogen vibration density
   of states measurements using incoherent inelastic neutron scattering

Title = {{A numerical framework for diffusion-controlled bimolecular-reactive
   systems to enforce maximum principles and the non-negative constraint}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel computational framework for diffusive-reactive
   systems that satisfies the non-negative constraint and maximum
   principles on general computational grids. The governing equations for
   the concentration of reactants and product are written in terms of
   tensorial diffusion-reaction equations. We restrict our studies to fast
   irreversible bimolecular reactions. If one assumes that the reaction is
   diffusion-limited and all chemical species have the same diffusion
   coefficient, one can employ a linear transformation to rewrite the
   governing equations in terms of invariants, which are unaffected by the
   reaction. This results in two uncoupled tensorial diffusion equations in
   terms of these invariants, which are solved using a novel non-negative
   solver for tensorial diffusion-type equations. The concentrations of the
   reactants and the product are then calculated from invariants using
   algebraic manipulations. The novel aspect of the proposed computational
   framework is that it will always produce physically meaningful
   non-negative values for the concentrations of all chemical species.
   Several representative numerical examples are presented to illustrate
   the robustness, convergence, and the numerical performance of the
   proposed computational framework. We will also compare the proposed
   framework with other popular formulations. In particular, we will show
   that the Galerkin formulation (which is the standard single-field
   formulation) does not produce reliable solutions, and the reason can be
   attributed to the fact that the single-field formulation does not
   guarantee non-negative solutions. We will also show that the clipping
   procedure (which produces non-negative solutions but is considered as a
   variational crime) does not give accurate results when compared with the
   proposed computational framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Limitations in anode performance have been a major obstacle to
   widespread alkaline fuel cell usage. In contrast to water management in
   acidic cathodes, water management in alkaline anodes has not received a
   lot of attention. Here, we use a methodology based on individual
   electrode plots to analyze and improve anode performance, especially by
   changing the hydrophobicity. Specifically, we determine the role of
   hydrophobicity as it affects performance for backing layers, catalyst
   layers, and catalyst binders. We use both individual electrode plots and
   recirculating experiments to determine the optimal PTFE loading was 20
   wt\% in alkaline media. We investigated PTFE and Fumion binders,
   determining that their use yields higher overpotentials than when using
   Nafion in alkaline media. Furthermore, we determined that Nafion
   alternatives for application in alkaline media would require significant
   hydrophilicity and anion-conductivity to result in good fuel cell
   performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A multiplexed microfluidic platform for rapid antibiotic susceptibility
   testing}},
Journal = {{BIOSENSORS \& BIOELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{118-125}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Effective treatment of clinical infections is critically dependent on
   the ability to rapidly screen patient samples to identify antibiograms
   of infecting pathogens. Existing methods for antibiotic susceptibility
   testing suffer from several disadvantages, including long turnaround
   times, excess sample and reagent consumption, poor detection
   sensitivity, and limited combinatorial capabilities. Unfortunately,
   these factors preclude the timely administration of appropriate
   antibiotics, complicating management of infections and exacerbating the
   development of antibiotic resistance. Here, we seek to address these
   issues by developing a microfluidic platform that relies on fluorescence
   detection of bacteria that express green fluorescent protein for highly
   sensitive and rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing. This platform
   possesses several advantages compared to conventional methods: (1)
   analysis of antibiotic action in two to four hours, (2) enhanced
   detection sensitivity (approximate to 1 cell), (3) minimal consumption
   of cell samples and antibiotic reagents ( <6 mu L), and (4) improved
   portability through the implementation of normally closed valves. We
   employed this platform to quantify the effects of four antibiotics
   (ampicillin, cefalexin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline) and their
   combinations on Escherichia coli. Within four hours, the susceptibility
   of bacteria to antibiotics can be determined by detecting variations in
   maxima of local fluorescence intensity over time. As expected, cell
   density is a major determinant of antibiotic efficacy. Our results also
   revealed that combinations of three or more antibiotics are not
   necessarily better for eradicating pathogens compared to pairs of
   antibiotics. Overall, this microfluidic based biosensor technology has
   the potential to provide rapid and precise guidance in clinical
   therapies by identifying the antibiograms of pathogens. (C) 2013
