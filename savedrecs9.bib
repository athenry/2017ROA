Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline silver dressings are widely known to be potent
   antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents and have long been used to
   treat topical wounds. Gold is known to be a strong anti-inflammatory
   agent and has been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis for >70
   years. The purpose of this work was to study the effect of incorporating
   gold into nanocrystalline silver dressings from antimicrobial and
   anti-inflammatory perspectives. Gold and silver dressing alloys were
   created by direct current magnetron sputtering and compared with pure
   silver nanocrystalline dressings using conventional biological (log
   reduction and corrected zone of inhibition) and physical (X-ray
   diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy
   and scanning electron microscopy) characterisation techniques. While the
   gold/silver dressings were slightly weaker antimicrobials than the pure
   silver nanocrystalline structures, the addition of gold to the
   nanostructure reduces the minimum crystallite size from 17 to 4 nm. This
   difference increases the number of grain boundary atoms from 12\% to
   40\% which could augment the anti-inflammatory properties of the
   dressings. The formation of gold oxide (Au2O3) was thought to be
   responsible for the observed decrease in crystallite size.}},

Title = {{Systolic and Diastolic Function Assessment in Fabry Disease Patients
   Using Speckle-Tracking Imaging and Comparison with Conventional
   Echocardiographic Measurements}},

Abstract = {{Background: Fabry cardiomyopathy is characterized by progressive left
   ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) associated with diastolic dysfunction and
   is the most common cause of death in Fabry disease (FD). However, LVH is
   not present in all subjects, particularly early in disease progression
   and in female patients. Direct assessment of myocardial deformation by
   strain and strain rate (SR) analysis may be sensitive to detect
   subclinical Fabry cardiomyopathy independent of the presence of LVH.
   Methods: Systolic (longitudinal, circumferential, and radial systolic
   strain and SR) and diastolic (SR during isovolumic relaxation {[}SRIVR]
   and early diastole and strain at peak transmitral E wave) function was
   assessed in 16 patients with FD using two-dimensional speckle-tracking
   echocardiography. In addition, mean S' and E' mitral annular velocities
   by Doppler tissue imaging were measured. Diastolic filling indices,
   including E/SRIVR and E/E' ratios, were calculated. The patients were
   compared with 24 healthy age-matched and gender-matched controls.
   Results: All 16 patients with FD had normal left ventricular ejection
   fractions, and nine patients had LVH. Compared with controls, patients
   with FD had reduced longitudinal systolic strain (P < .001) and systolic
   SR (P = .007), while there were no differences in circumferential
   systolic strain and S'. Diastolic function assessment showed reduced
   longitudinal early diastolic SR (P = .001), SRIVR (P < .001), and
   E/SRIVR (P < .001), while radial and circumferential diastolic function
   was not affected. Of the conventional diastolic function indices,
   reductions were seen in E (P = .006), E' (P = .021), and E/E' ratio (P <
   .001). After correcting for LVH, only SRIVR (P < .001) and E/SRIVR (P =
   .025) remained significantly different between patients with FD and
   controls, with sensitivity of 94\% and specificity of 92\% for SRIVR of
   0.235 sec(-1) (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve,
   0.953).
   Conclusions: Strain and SR analysis is useful in identifying patients
   with FD with reduced myocardial function, with longitudinal systolic
   strain and diastolic isovolumic SR being superior to the other
   echocardiographic measurements of myocardial contraction and relaxation
   and independent of LVH.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate an extremely efficient technique of
   diagnosing dengue virus non-structural protein (NS1) using Micro-Spot
   with Integrated Pillars (MSIP). Detection using MSIP is performed by
   employing fluorescence immunoassay specific to dengue virus NS1. MSIPs
   are chemically modified to ensure efficient covalent binding of
   antibodies on the micropillars, whereas the enormous increase in the
   surface area (available for the reaction) induced by the micropillars
   amplifies the apparent rate, which enhances the signal intensity.
   Therefore, the detection response of a MSIP, quantified by the intensity
   of the fluorescence signal, is found to be almost five times magnified
   than the response of a similar size micro-spot without micropillars. The
   response of the micropillars also depend on the pillar arrangement,
   since for identical concentration of dengue NS1 antigen, a stronger
   intensity signal is obtained for a hexagonal close packed array
   (staggered) pillar arrangement as compared to a square array
   arrangement.}},

Abstract = {{Force sensors have been reported to be reliable for monitoring spinal
   orthosis compliance in the treatment of scoliosis. However, the current
   force sensor used for these compliance monitors has certain limitations
   and drawbacks. A lower cost force sensor with a 55\% larger operating
   force range was chosen for this application, with modifications required
   to increase its contact surface, improve comfort, and reduce the
   manufacturing time. Different designs have been considered and described
   in this paper. A final prototype using a rubberlike material housing
   with a stiff nub over the sensing area of the original sensor produced a
   linear, highly sensitive, large surface area, reliable, and robust
   sensor. It has a sensitivity of 315 mV/N, accuracy 1.9\%, repeatability
   0.6\%, linearity 0.7\%, hysteresis 0.8\%, dead band 0.0\%, point drift
   0.5\%, temperature drift 2.2\% for the temperature range 25 degrees C-
   35 degrees C, and reproducibility 1.3\%. These properties are adequate
   for measuring forces in a spinal orthosis. The total cost of the sensor
   with housing is \$46 when ordered in quantities of 1000, which reduces
   the price of the existing sensor by 34\%. The manufacturing time of the
   new sensor was reduced and a preliminary subject trial demonstrated that
   the new sensor did not have significant temperature effect. This will
   make force systems more affordable and adaptable for the effective
   treatment of scoliosis.}},

Abstract = {{The robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) problem for general-rank signal
   model with an additional positive semi-definite constraint is
   considered. Using the principle of the worst-case performance
   optimization, such RAB problem leads to a difference-of-convex functions
   (DC) optimization problem. The existing approaches for solving the
   resulted non-convex DC problem are based on approximations and find only
   suboptimal solutions. Here, we aim at finding the globally optimal
   solution for the non-convex DC problem and clarify the conditions under
   which the solution is guaranteed to be globally optimal. Particularly,
   we rewrite the problem as the minimization of a one-dimensional optimal
   value function (OVF). Then, the OVF is replaced with another equivalent
   one, for which the corresponding optimization problem is convex. The new
   one-dimensional OVF is minimized iteratively via polynomial time DC
   (POTDC) algorithm. We show that the POTDC converges to a point that
   satisfies Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions, and such point
   is the global optimum under certain conditions. Towards this conclusion,
   we prove that the proposed algorithm finds the globally optimal solution
   if the presumed norm of the mismatch matrix that corresponds to the
   desired signal covariance matrix is sufficiently small. The new RAB
   method shows superior performance compared to the other state-of-the-art
   general-rank RAB methods.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Age-related thinning of the cortical mantle varies regionally, leading
   to hemispheric asymmetries in cortical thickness that may emerge at
   various stages of development and aging. Cortical asymmetry may play a
   role in modulating the functional maturation (or degradation) of
   language and cognition in humans, but its evolution over the lifespan is
   unknown. Here cortical thickness was negatively correlated with age in
   274 5-59 year old, right-handed healthy participants. Pre-adolescents
   showed limited regions of cortical asymmetry focused on medial occipital
   lobe (R > L) and inferior frontal gyrus (R > L), namely vision and
   language relevant areas. More extensive frontal (lateral R > L, medial L
   > R) and parietal lobe (lateral L > R, medial R > L) asymmetries emerged
   after adolescence, and increased during aging. Changes of cortical
   asymmetry in these regions may be linked to specialization of the brain

Abstract = {{This article reports our recent studies on WC-4.3 wt\% MgO composites
   with a particular interest in the effect of grain-growth inhibitors (VC
   and Cr3C2) addition on its resistance to erosive wear. It is shown that
   the maximum erosion rate of the WC-MgO composite occurred at an
   impingement angle of 90A degrees. With the addition of the grain-growth
   inhibitors (0.25 wt\% VC and 0.25 wt\% Cr3C2), the erosion resistance
   increased, particularly profound at the impingement angle of 90A
   degrees, due to refined microstructures with improved mechanical
   properties. In addition, computational simulation based on a microscale
   dynamic model was conducted to investigate the effects of the grain
   boundary strength and grain size on the erosion resistance of the WC-MgO
   composites in order to better understand the microstructural effect on
   the erosive performance of the composites. It is demonstrated that the
   grain refinement with weak grain boundary strength has a negative effect
   on the erosion resistance.}},

Abstract = {{In the realm of decision making under uncertainty, the general approach
   is the use of the utility theories. The main disadvantage of this
   approach is that it is based on an evaluation of a vector-valued
   alternative by means of a scalar-valued quantity. This transformation is
   counterintuitive and leads to loss of information. The latter is related
   to restrictive assumptions on preferences underlying utility models like
   independence, completeness, transitivity etc. Relaxation of these
   assumptions results into more adequate but less tractable models. In
   contrast, humans conduct direct comparison of alternatives as vectors of
   attributes' values and don't use artificial scalar values. Although
   vector-valued utility function-based methods exist, a fundamental
   axiomatic theory is absent and the problem of a direct comparison of
   vectors remains a challenge with a wide scope of research and
   applications. In the realm of multicriteria decision making there exist
   approaches like TOPSIS and AHP to various extent utilizing
   components-wise comparison of vectors. Basic principle of such
   comparison is the Pareto optimality which is based on a counterintuitive
   assumption that all alternatives within a Pareto optimal set are
   considered equally optimal. The above mentioned mandates necessity to
   develop new decision approaches based on direct comparison of
   vector-valued alternatives. In this paper we suggest a fuzzy Pareto
   optimality (FPO) based approach to decision making with fuzzy
   probabilities representing linguistic decision-relevant information. We
   use FPO concept to differentiate ``more optimal{''} solutions from
   ``less optimal{''} solutions. This is intuitive, especially when dealing
   with imperfect information. An example is solved to show the validity of
   the suggested ideas.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose two subspace-projection-based precoding
   schemes, namely, full-projection (FP)-and partial-projection (PP)-based
   precoding, for a cognitive radio multiple-input multiple-output
   (CR-MIMO) network to mitigate its interference to a primary
   time-division-duplexing (TDD) system. The proposed precoding schemes are
   capable of estimating interference channels between CR and primary
   networks, and incorporating the interference from the primary to the CR
   system into CR precoding via a novel sensing approach. Then, the CR
   performance and resulting interference of the proposed precoding schemes
   are analyzed and evaluated. By fully projecting the CR transmission onto
   a null space of the interference channels, the FP-based precoding scheme
   can effectively avoid interfering the primary system with boosted CR
   throughput. While, the PP-based scheme is able to further improve the CR
   throughput by partially projecting its transmission onto the null space.

Abstract = {{Porous titanium alloy-bioactive glass composite coatings were produced
   via flame spray deposition. The porous coatings, targeted for bone
   fixation and orthodontic devices, were made from bioactive glass (45S5)
   powder blended with one of two titanium powders: commercially pure
   titanium (Cp-Ti) or titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V). The coatings were
   characterized by cross-sectional quantitative metallography, optical
   microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The porosity and glassy phase
   distributions were determined by image analysis of optical micrographs,
   in accordance with ASTM Standard E2109. Selection of Cp-Ti or Ti-6Al-4V
   alloy, along with alteration of the particle size distribution of
   bioactive glass, dramatically changed the morphology and phases present
   within each coating. The consequences on the bioactive response were
   characterized with immersion testing in simulated body fluid for up to
   14 d. The coatings were analyzed for the presence of hydroxyapatite (HA)
   after testing; HA formation was observed as soon as 7 d for
   Ti-6Al-4V-based composites, while no formation occurred on Cp-Ti-based
   composites. HA formation on the negative Ti-6Al-4V control coating was
   observed after 14 d, while formation was not observed on the Cp-Ti
   coating, suggesting that the incorporation of bioactive glass into
   flame-sprayed Ti-6Al-4V alloy coatings enhances bioactivity.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which have been widely used to solve
   various scientific and engineering optimization problems, are
   essentially stochastic search algorithms operating in the overall
   solution space. However, such random search mechanism may lead to some
   disadvantages such as a long computing time and premature convergence.
   In this study, we propose a space search optimization algorithm (SSOA)
   with accelerated convergence strategies to alleviate the drawbacks of
   the purely random search mechanism. The overall framework of the SSOA
   involves three main search mechanisms: local space search, global space
   search, and opposition-based search. The local space search that aims to
   form new solutions approaching the local optimum is realized based on
   the concept of augmented simplex method, which exhibits significant
   search abilities realized in some local space. The global space search
   is completed by Cauchy searching, where the approach itself is based on
   the Cauchy mutation. This operation can help the method avoid of being
   trapped in local optima and in this way alleviate premature convergence.
   An opposition-based search is exploited to accelerate the convergence of
   space search. This operator can effectively reduce a substantial
   computational overhead encountered in evolutionary algorithms (EAs).
   With the use of them SSOA realizes an effective search process. To
   evaluate the performance of the method, the proposed SSOA is contrasted
   with a method of differential evolution (DE), which is a wellknown space
   concept-based evolutionary algorithm. When tested against benchmark
   functions, the SSOA exhibits a competitive performance vis-a-vis
   performance of some other competitive schemes of differential evolution
   in terms of accuracy and speed of convergence, especially in case of
   high-dimensional continuous optimization problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents modeling, analysis, and suppression of the impact of
   a voltage-source converter (VSC)-based full-scale wind turbine (FSWT) on
   subsynchronous damping in power systems. First, a detailed output
   impedance model of the grid-interfacing VSC is presented and analyzed
   under different converter operating modes, control functions, and
   variations in operating point. Second, the output impedance model is
   used to analyze the impact of the grid-interfacing VSC on the electrical
   damping characteristics in the subsynchronous frequency range and
   interactions with an electrically nearby synchronous generator. The IEEE
   first benchmark for subsynchronous resonance studies is used for
   theoretical analysis and simulation results. It is found that the
   grid-interfacing VSC of the FSWT can have a negative impact on overall
   electrical damping and there is a risk of subsynchronous torsional
   oscillation especially at lower frequency modes. Third, to mitigate such
   interactions, an active damping controller is developed to reshape the
   output impedance of the interfacing VSC and yield positive electrical
   damping at torsional modes. Time-domain simulation results are presented
   to validate the theoretical analysis and show the effectiveness of the
   proposed active damping controller.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between DNA and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been
   widely studied in recent years. The binding process of DNA with CNT as
   well as the electronic properties of DNA/CNT hybrids constitutes an
   interesting yet complicated problem. The binding energy (BE) of the
   hybridization is one of the most extensively studied parameters for the
   problem. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) was used to
   perform geometry optimization of neutral nucleobases including adenine,
   cytosine, guanine and thymine absorbed on a zigzag (7,0) single-walled
   CNT and to evaluate the basis set superposition error corrected BE of
   the optimized configuration. All OFT calculations were performed using
   the M05-2X functional. The 6-31G(d) basis set was used for the
   optimization step and single point energy calculations were done using
   the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. For each nucleobase, we examined the influence
   of the initial configuration (IC) on the BE value. In particular, we
   considered 24 different ICs for each nucleobase, and each IC was
   subjected to an independent optimization and BE calculation. Our results
   showed that different ICs result in very different BE values and can
   even change the order of the BE corresponding to different nucleobases.
   The difference in the BE for a particular nucleobase caused by changes
   in its IC can be comparable to the difference in the BE between
   different nucleobases at the same initial position relative to the CNT.
   This provides an explanation for the discrepancies that exist in the
   literature on the nucleobase/CNT BE, and suggests that the potential
   energy surface between the nucleobases and the CNT can have many local
   minima and care should be exercised in the calculation and
   interpretation of the BE. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Robustness is typically understood as an ability of adaptive beamforming
   algorithm to achieve high performance in the situations with imperfect,
   incomplete, or erroneous knowledge about the source, propagation media,
   and antenna array. It is also desired to achieve high performance with
   as little as possible prior information. In the last decade, several
   fruitful principles to minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR)
   robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) design have been developed and
   successfully applied to solve a number of problems in a wide range of
   applications. Such principles of MVDR RAB design are summarized here in
   a single paper. Prof. Gershman has actively participated in the
   development and applications of a number of such MVDR RAB design
   principles. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of ecosystem carbon fluxes is crucial for
   understanding the feedbacks between the terrestrial biosphere and the
   atmosphere and for making climate-policy decisions. A statistical model
   is developed to estimate the gross primary production (GPP) of
   coniferous forests of northeastern USA using remotely sensed (RS)
   radiation (land surface temperature and near-infra red albedo) and
   ecosystem variables (enhanced vegetation index and global vegetation
   moisture index) acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. This GPP model (called R-GPP-Coni),
   based only on remotely sensed data, was first calibrated with GPP
   estimates derived from the eddy covariance flux tower of the Howland
   forest main tower site and then successfully transferred and validated
   at three other coniferous sites: the Howland forest west tower site,
   Duke pine forest and North Carolina loblolly pine site, which
   demonstrate its transferability to other coniferous ecoregions of
   northeastern USA. The proposed model captured the seasonal dynamics of
   the observed 8-day GPP successfully by explaining 84-94\% of the
   observed variations with a root mean squared error (RMSE) ranging from
   1.10 to 1.64 g C/m(2)/day over the 4 study sites and outperformed the
   primary RS-based GPP algorithm of MODIS. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{A mechanistic study on thiosulfate-enhanced passivity degradation of

Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{510-525}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports thiosulfate-enhanced effect of chloride ions on the
   passivity degradation of Alloy 800 and discusses how thiosulfate
   influences the semiconductor properties as well as breakdown of the
   passive films. Experimental results reveal that in concentrations of
   10(-6) to 0.075 mol/L, thiosulfate lowers the breakdown potential of
   Alloy 800 by 100-400 mV in solutions containing 0.6 mol/L chloride ions.
   This degradation is further verified by polarization resistance and
   noise resistance obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS) and micro-nanoscale electrochemical noise (EN) data, respectively.
   Mott-Schottky analysis is employed to explore the corrosion mechanism
   and the results show that the passive film exhibits as p-type
   semiconductivity in a thiosulfate-only solution and n-type
   semiconductivity in a chloride-only solution, and the addition of
   thiosulfate into chloride solutions increases the concentration of
   oxygen vacancies in the passive film at the potential close to the
   pitting potential. Thiosulfate cannot be easily reduced on
   well-passivated surfaces in chloride-free solutions but can be readily
   reduced to sulfide in chloride solutions at active sites when the
   passive film breaks down - the reduced sulfur retards the healing
   process of repassivation, leading to an increase in oxygen vacancies.

Abstract = {{This study examined the continuous performance of air cathode MFC stacks
   for domestic wastewater treatments at two different temperatures (23 +/-
   3 degrees C and 30 +/- 1 degrees C) and organic loading rates to

   mode on the stack performance. The power density and process stability
   were affected significantly by the electrode connection type, flow mode,
   and operating parameters. The parallel electrode connection system (in
   series flow mode) had benefits of COD removal, Coulombic efficiency and
   maximal power density due to the higher stability of the ORP in overall
   cells. The highest power density of 420 mW/m(2) (12.8 W/m(3)) was
   achieved in series flow and parallel connection mode at an organic
   loading rate of 25.6 g COD/L-d (HRT of 0.33 h) under mesophilic
   conditions, achieving a COD removal of 44\%. The results highlight the

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1318}},

Abstract = {{We explored four different inorganic oxides and determined their merits
   in miniaturized planar chromatography. Despite progression of
   chromatographic techniques over several decades, such alternatives to
   traditional planar silica gel stationary phases have not been fully
   evaluated. Glancing angle deposition (GLAD) provided an excellent
   platform for engineering nanostructured thin films in these materials
   for ultrathin-layer chromatography (UTLC). Separations of carotenoids
   and synthetic food dyes were used to investigate the attributes of SiO2,
   Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2 GLAD UTLC media. These anisotropic high surface
   area thin films possessed similar channel-like features but different
   chromatographic properties. TiO2 and ZrO2 media were especially
   interesting since analyte retention could be modified through simple
   oxidation heat treatments and UV irradiation. Generally, oxidation
   reduced analyte retention while UV exposure increased retention. Changes
   in retention factor as large as Delta hR(F)similar to 40 (for Acid Red
   14 on titanium oxide) were achieved. Food dye mixtures were applied
   using consumer inkjet printers as per the Office Chromatography concept
   and separation performance was quantified using advanced video
   instrumentation designed for miniaturized plates. Enhanced time-resolved
   UTLC methods were used to calculate figures of merit from recorded dye
   separation videos. Small theoretical plate heights (<4 mu m) and low
   limits of detection (<2 ng per zone for the food dye tartrazine) were
   measured. The combination of engineered GLAD UTLC plates, inkjet
   application of analyte spots, time-resolved UTLC, and custom analysis
   algorithms enabled some of the best performance achieved on GLAD UTLC
   layers. Separations on the inorganic oxide thin films were also
   successfully hyphenated with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
   for the first time. This investigation demonstrates the utility of
   alternative inorganic oxide GLAD UTLC media and probes avenues of
   expanding the capabilities of miniaturized planar chromatography. (C)

Abstract = {{Chemotherapy is an effective approach to curb uncontrolled proliferation
   of malignant cells. However, most drugs rapidly lose their efficacy as a
   result of resistance development. We explored the potential of
   combinational siRNA silencing to prevent growth of drug-resistant breast
   cancer cells independent of chemotherapy. Resistance was induced in two
   breast cancer lines by chronic exposure to doxorubicin. Microarray
   analysis of apoptosis-related proteins showed Bcl2, survivin, NF B, and
   Mcl1 to be prominently up-regulated in drug-resistant cells. Human siRNA
   libraries against apoptosis-related proteins and kinases were screened
   using lipid-substituted polymers as non-viral carrier, and siRNAs were
   selected to diminish cell growth without affecting growth of skin
   fibroblasts. Surprisingly, the selected siRNAs led to similar responses
   in wild-type and drug-resistant cells, despite their phenotypic
   differences. Promising kinase siRNAs were co-delivered with
   anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 siRNA and Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase (RPS6KA5) was
   found the most promising candidate for simultaneous silencing with
   Mcl-1. In both MDA435 wild type (WT) and MDA435 resistant (R) xenografts
   in nude mice, double silencing of Mcl-1/RPS6KA5 also led to improved
   inhibition of tumor growth in the absence of chemotherapy. We conclude
   that combinational silencing of well-selected targets could be a
   feasible therapeutic strategy in the absence of drug therapy and could
   provide a new avenue for therapy of drug-resistant breast cancers. (C)

Abstract = {{With the merging of operating conditions for proposed high-temperature
   production and refining processes for heavy oil and bitumen, there is a
   growing interest in the phase behavior, thermophysical properties and
   reaction outcomes for water + heavy hydrocarbon resource mixtures at
   elevated temperatures and pressures. Athabasca bitumen, from Canada, is
   a commercially exploited hydrocarbon resource where 50 wt.\% of the
   material possesses a nominal boiling point exceeding 797 K. In a prior
   publication, the phase behavior type of the Athabasca bitumen + water
   binary was identified experimentally as Type IIIb, according to the
   vanKonynenburg and Scott naming scheme. The present contribution focuses
   on the volume of mixing and the solubility of water in the Athabasca
   bitumen-rich liquid phase over the temperature interval 523-644 K and
   over the pressure interval 3.9-26.2 MPa. The measurements were obtained
   using a high-pressure variable-volume beryllium-walled view-cell,
   equipped with non-intrusive X-ray transmission tomography. X-ray
   tomography permits visual observation of the number of coexisting
   phases, and their corresponding volumes. Phase volume and density
   measurements were validated by reproducing published values for 1-methyl
   naphthalene up to 573.8 K. Water solubility values were validated by
   reproducing data for the 1-methyl naphthalene + water and toluene +
   water binaries up to 573.2 K and 553.2 K, respectively. Measured
   solubility and excess volume values are also placed in a broader context
   by comparison with pertinent literature data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Characterization of reservoir fluids using an EOS based on perturbation
   from n-alkanes}},
Journal = {{FLUID PHASE EQUILIBRIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{358}},
Pages = {{250-271}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Characterization of reservoir fluids using a cubic equation of state
   (EOS) is conducted under unavoidable uncertainties in
   pressure-temperature-composition (P-T-x) space. The implicit, non-linear
   relationship between phase behavior predictions and adjustment
   parameters also makes fluid characterization non-unique and subjective.
   Although P-T-x space that phase behavior spans is continuous, different
   characterization methods have been proposed for different types of
   reservoir fluids.
   In our previous research, a method was developed for heavy-oil
   characterization using the Peng-Robinson (PR) EOS with the van der Waals
   mixing rules without volume shift. Uncertainty issues in heavy-oil
   characterization were addressed based on the concept of perturbation
   from n-alkanes (the PnA method). Pseudo components were initially
   assigned critical parameters that were optimized for n-alkanes in terms
   of liquid densities and vapor pressures using the PR EOS. The optimized
   reference values allowed for well-defined directions for perturbation of
   pseudo components' critical parameters to match available experimental
   data. The robust regression algorithm required only three perturbation
   parameters.
   In this paper, we extend the PnA method to lighter fluids, such as gas
   condensates, volatile oils, and near-critical fluids. The main novelty
   of the new PnA method is that it considers proper interrelationship (psi
   = a/b(2)) between the attraction (a) and covolume (b) parameters of
   pseudo components. The regression algorithm developed in this research
   controls the trend of the psi parameter with respect to molecular weight
   using a fourth adjustment parameter gamma. The psi and gamma parameters
   become more important for characterizing lighter fluids. For extra heavy
   oils, the new PnA method naturally reduces to the previous PnA method,
   where gamma is zero.
   Case studies using 77 different reservoir fluids demonstrate the
   universal applicability, reliability, robustness, and efficiency of the
   new PnA method. The fluids used consist of 34 heavy and black oils, 12
   volatile oils, and 31 gas condensates. Six fluids are near critical
   among them. The PnA method controls phase behavior predictions
   monotonically with parameter adjustments and systematically in P-T-x
   space. This is demonstrated by quantitative prediction of
   condensation/vaporization behavior of gas condensates and light oils and
   minimum miscibility pressures for various oil displacements. The PnA
   method requires no change in the thermodynamic model used, i.e., it can
   be readily implemented in existing software based on the PR EOS with the
   van der Waals mixing rules.
   We also explain how volume-shift parameters affect compositional phase
   behavior predictions when used as regression parameters in fluid
   characterization. The PnA method uses no volume shift, and properly
   couples volumetric and compositional phase behaviors. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Assessment of semantic similarity of concepts defined in ontology}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{250}},
Pages = {{21-39}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{ways of processing and analyzing data. One of the most common activities
   performed by these processes is comparison of data - it is done to find
   something new or confirm things we already know. In each case there is a
   need for determining similarity between different objects and pieces of
   information. The process of determining similarity seems to be
   relatively easy when it is done for a numerical data, but it is not so
   in case of a symbolic data. At the same time, the development of Web
   technologies has led to the introduction of XML-based formats of data
   representation on the Web, Resource Description Framework (RDF) and
   ontology. This paper proposes a method for determining semantic
   similarity between concepts defined in ontology. In contrast to other
   techniques that use ontological definition of concepts for similarity
   assessment, the proposed approach focuses on the relations between
   concepts and their semantics. The presented method is able to determine
   similarity not only at the definition/abstract level, but also is able
   to evaluate similarity of concrete pieces of information that are
   instances of concepts. In addition, the method allows for context-aware
   similarity assessment when only specific sets of relations, identified
   by the context, are taken into consideration. Experimental comparison of
   our similarity assessment approach against other techniques known in the
   literature shows satisfying results. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Arsenic pollution in groundwater is a worldwide concern due to its
   chronic effects on human health. Numerous studies have been carried out
   to obtain cost-effective arsenic removal method. Adsorption using
   natural materials or its treated forms is found to be cost-effective
   technology. Raw laterite (RL) or its treated form (TL) is studied
   recently as arsenic adsorbent for aqueous system. Laterite composition
   varies with geographical location and extent of lateritization. The
   study on effects of arsenic adsorption with varying composition of
   laterite is not explored yet. Four laterite samples with different
   compositions are examined to remove arsenic from water. These laterite
   samples are activated using an optimized acid followed by base treatment
   method in order to determine the effects of RI composition on arsenic
   adsorption behavior of TL Higher iron and aluminum containing RI samples
   show higher arsenic adsorption behavior. Similarly, TL obtained from
   higher iron and aluminum containing RL sample shows the higher specific
   surface area (130-180 m(2) g(-1)) and pore volume (0.28-0.35 mLg(-1)).
   Two household filters using TL are deployed in arsenic affected area of

Abstract = {{RATIONALESurface mining of bitumen in Northern Alberta, Canada, results
   in large volumes of toxic oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) that
   must be contained in tailings ponds. Ozonation has shown great promise
   as an OSPW treatment process, by decreasing its toxicity and increasing
   its biodegradability, but the effect of ozonation on the thousands of
   dissolved organic chemical groups has not yet been examined.
   METHODSReversed-phase liquid chromatography with ultrahigh-resolution
   linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometry was applied to the
   characterization of treated (utilized ozone doses of 20 and 50 mg O-3/L)
   and untreated OSPW. The analysis was performed in positive and negative
   electrospray ionization modes for each sample (ESI+/ESI-).
   RESULTSSemi-quantitative analysis of ozonated and unozonated samples
   allowed degradation to be monitored for naphthenic acids (i.e. O-2
   species in ESI- mode) and >2000 other organic species belonging to
   various heteroatom-containing classes: O-x (where x=1 to 6), NOx (where
   x=1 to 4), SOx (where x=1 to 4), NO2S, N, and S. No chlorinated
   byproducts were detected in any treated sample, but at the low dose (20
   mg O-3/L) some compound classes increased in abundance (e.g. the O-5
   class), indicating that they were formed as byproducts at faster rates
   than they were degraded. Nevertheless, all organic compound classes
   subsequently diminished at the higher dose (50 mg O-3/L). For several
   O-x and SOx classes, species observed in ESI+ mode (e.g. O-2(+) species)
   were often more recalcitrant to ozonation than the corresponding species
   detected in ESI- mode (e.g. O-2(-) species; naphthenic acids).
   CONCLUSIONSOzonation appears to be a very suitable treatment option for
   OSPW, but the more recalcitrant groups of compounds may help to explain
   the residual toxicity of ozonated OSPW. Analysis of OSPW constituents in
   both ionization modes is warranted in all future OSPW fate studies.

Abstract = {{Atomic force microscopy (AFM) in conjunction with a bioprobe developed
   using a polydopamine wet adhesive was used to directly measure the
   adhesive force between bacteria and different polymeric membrane
   surfaces. Bacterial cells of Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis
   were immobilized onto the tip of a standard AFM cantilever, and force
   measurements made using the modified cantilever on various membranes.
   Interaction forces measured with the bacterial probe were compared,
   qualitatively, to predictions by the extended
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theory with steric interactions
   included. The XDLVO theory predicted attractive interactions between low
   energy hydrophobic membranes with high energy hydrophilic bacterium (P.
   putida). It also predicted a shallow primary maximum with the most
   hydrophilic bacterium, B. subtilis. Discrepancies between predictions
   using the XDLVO theory and theory require involvement of factors such as
   bridging effects. Differences in interaction between P. putida and B.
   subtilis are attributed to acid-base interactions and steric
   interactions. P. putida is Gram negative with lipopolysaccharides
   present in the outer cell membrane. A variation in forces of adhesion
   for bacteria on polymeric membranes studied was interpreted in terms of
   hydrophilicity and interfacial surface potential calculated from
   physicochemical properties.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we introduce a new design methodology of
   granular-oriented self-organizing Hybrid Fuzzy polynomial neural
   networks (HFPNN) that is based on multi-layer perceptron with
   context-based polynomial neurons (CPNs) or polynomial neurons (PNs). In
   contrast to the typical architectures encountered in polynomial neural
   networks (PNN), our main objective is to develop a design strategy of
   HFPNN as follows: (a) The first layer of the proposed network consists
   of context-based polynomial neuron (CPN). Here CPN is fully reflective
   of the structure encountered in numeric data which are granulated with
   the aid of context-based fuzzy c-means (C-FCM) clustering method. The
   context-based clustering supporting the design of information granules
   is completed in the space of the input data (input variables) while the
   formation of the clusters here is guided by a collection of some
   predefined fuzzy sets (so-called contexts) specified in the output
   space. (b) The proposed design procedure being applied to each layer of
   HFPNN leads to the selection of the preferred nodes of the network (CPNs
   or PNs) whose local characteristics (such as the number of contexts, the
   number of clusters, a collection of the specific subset of input
   variables, and the order of the polynomial) can be easily adjusted.
   These options contribute to the flexibility as well as simplicity and
   compactness of the resulting architecture of the network. For the
   evaluation of the performance of the proposed HFPNN, we use well-known
   machine learning data coming from the machine learning repository. (C)

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{4768-4779}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We derive uniform approximations (UAs) for typical performance measures
   such as error probability, outage probability and capacity of wireless
   transmissions over flat fading channels impaired by noise. Uniform
   refers to the fact that these approximations are accurate over the whole
   range (low to high) of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. First, the
   high-SNR results of Wang and Giannakis {[}2] are generalized and unified
   for an arbitrary performance measure. Second, we develop a
   Mellin-transform-based procedure to construct low-and high-SNR
   asymptotics of error probability or outage. Specifically, these
   asymptotics are related to the left-and right-sided poles of a Mellin
   product with respect to its fundamental strip. Third, by using multiple
   low-SNR terms and a single high-SNR term, UAs for the error probability
   of coherent modulation are constructed for Rayleigh fading,
   maximal-ratio-combining (MRC), selection-combining (SC), dual hop
   relaying, and co-channel interference. UAs are also developed for the
   error probability of single- and multi-channel differential modulation,
   the product of two Q functions, and the miss probability of energy
   detection. By using a single low-SNR term and multiple high-SNR terms,
   the outage probability UA is also developed. Finally, since the capacity
   measure is not an exponentially decaying function, we derive a UA for an
   intermediate function which is based on the moment-generating function
   (MGF) and ultimately, the resulting approximation for the capacity.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{1718-1727}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The behaviour of partially encased composite columns under eccentric and
   concentric axial loading tends to be complex because of the interaction
   of the concrete with the thin-walled steel section. When constructed
   with high strength concrete, developing numerical simulations of the
   response of these columns under load is particularly challenging. In
   this paper, a finite element model capable of simulating this response
   is presented. A constitutive model that has the capability of predicting
   the overall stress-strain behaviour of high strength concrete, including
   the post-peak softening branch and residual strength, is selected. The
   finite element model has been validated by conducting simulations of the
   behaviour of partially encased composite test columns with high strength
   concrete. The load-deformation response, ultimate capacity, and failure
   mode are predicted accurately by the model for both concentric and
   eccentric axial loading conditions. Finally, a parametric study is
   presented that uses the validated finite element model to identify the
   key differences in strength and failure behaviour of partially encased
   composite columns when using high strength instead of normal strength
   concrete. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   geometries were tested: A310, Rushton and Intermig. This paper presents
   the following hydrodynamic characteristics of the CIST: power number,
   flow number, momentum number, velocity profiles at different locations
   in the tank and the transition point from fully turbulent to
   transitional flow. Based on the scaled velocity profiles, the CIST was
   able to keep the flow turbulent at Re <2000 for Rushton turbines and
   3200 for Intermigs. The ratio epsilon(max)/epsilon(average) was lower
   for the CIST than for a conventional stirred tank, indicating that the
   energy dissipation is more uniformly distributed in the CIST. The CIST
   consistently maintains turbulent flow down to a Reynolds number 10x

Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{145-163}},

Abstract = {{The force distribution on a surface-piercing yawed cylinder surface
   differs significantly from that on a surface-piercing vertical cylinder.
   The established numerical model for flow past the surface-piercing yawed
   cylinder with yaw angles from -45 degrees to 45 degrees was solved by
   the standard large-eddy simulation (LES) methodology. Six cases at
   intervals of +/- 15 degrees relative to the vertical were studied at the
   Reynolds number of 27 000 and the Froude number of 0.8 based on the
   cylinder diameter and free-stream velocity, among which the drag forces
   on four cylinders with yaw angles from -15 degrees to 30 degrees were
   tested for the validation of the LES approach. The results revealed that
   the time-averaged total drag coefficient for all cases increases with
   the increase of yaw angle compared to that of the surface-piercing
   vertical cylinder, even over 2.5 for the +/- 45 degrees-yawed cylinders.
   The sectional drag coefficients for the negatively yawed cylinders are
   much greater than that for the vertical cylinder, and much less for the
   positively yawed cylinders. The unbalanced hydrostatic pressures on the
   inclined section are mainly responsible for those increment and
   decrement. Once the hydrostatic pressure was removed, the sectional drag
   coefficient on the mid-span of the positively yawed cylinder increases
   from the top section to the bottom, and decreases for the negatively
   yawed cylinder. The corresponding integrated total drag coefficient
   decreases with the increase of the yaw angle to +/- 15 degrees, then
   increases with the further increase of the magnitude of yaw angle. (C)

   geostatistical framework. The authors develop a numerical and analytical
   methodology that is tested on synthetic and real petroleum case studies.
   The implementation is straightforward, and the results are promising.
   A methodology is developed to assist in delineation-well placement.
   Decisions for new-well locations are assisted with a quantitative
   measure of the expected reduction in global uncertainty in the volume of
   original oil in place (OOIP). The available realizations are analyzed
   and processed to quantify the impact of well placement. Variograms and
   other required statistics are inferred from the realizations. As a
   result, a gridded map of impact values is produced, from which locations
   with the highest impact are suggested for new-well locations. Numerical
   and analytical approaches for the impact-map calculation are proposed
   and compared. Pros and cons of each approach are summarized The
   numerical approach requires a large number of realizations for effective
   implementation of the impact map, which might not be practically
   achievable. On the other hand, the analytical approach does not require
   many realizations and produces stable results. In most cases, only
   variogram models and current well locations are needed for the
   analytical impact-map computation. Although computational time of this
   approach largely depends on the model size, some options are suggested
   to reduce the cost. The analytical impact calculation is developed for
   the OOLP model response, in which the petroleum reservoir is defined as
   a complex geological architecture with multiple structural surface
   constraints. Several case studies, including a real-petroleum-reservoir
   example, demonstrate the use of the impact map for the assessment of new
   delineation-well locations. The developed tool is of significant help
   for well placement.}},

Abstract = {{This work considers heat and fluid flow past ellipsoidal and cubic
   particles at different angles of attack. Although numerous works have
   investigated drag forces for spherical and non-spherical particles,
   there are very few works about Nusselt number relations for such
   particles, especially in cases where the particles are not oriented in a
   streamwise direction. Motivated by this fact, three-dimensional
   numerical simulations of heat and fluid flow past non-spherical
   particles at different angles of attack were performed. In particular, a
   laminar-steady flow past ellipsoidal and cubic particles was considered
   and the results compared against those for a spherical particle. In
   order to take into account the angle of attack in semi-empirical models,
   new correlations for the drag, lift and torque coefficients and for the
   Nusselt number were developed and the accuracy of the closures is
   discussed in comparison with published models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Control loop diagnosis has become an increasingly important tool for
   improving the efficiency, reliability and safety for a variety of
   processes. While a number of model-based diagnosis methods have been
   proposed, constructing models may be a difficult task. An alternative
   approach is to use data-driven control-loop diagnosis, a family of
   diagnosis methods that make use of historical data for training the
   diagnostic models. Bayesian methods have been applied to data-driven
   control loop diagnosis to combine prior process knowledge with
   historical data, and can be used to assign probabilities to different
   modes (or operation statuses) after combination. However, one difficulty
   with Bayesian methods is that there must be exact knowledge of the
   underlying mode so that the corresponding monitor readings in the
   historical data can be used. If there is uncertainty about the
   underlying mode, the mode becomes ambiguous, which Bayesian methods do
   not deal with. An alternative method is proposed in this paper that
   exploits the properties of data-driven Bayesian methods, and can be
   applied for diagnosis in the presence of ambiguity. The proposed method
   is evaluated through simulation examples as well as applied to
   industrial process data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1480-1496}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with system identification of general nonlinear
   dynamical systems with an uncertain scheduling variable. A multi model
   approach is developed; wherein, a set of local auto regressive exogenous
   (ARX) models are first identified at different process operating points,
   and are then combined to describe the complete dynamics of a nonlinear
   system. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used for
   simultaneous identification of local ARX models, and for computing the
   probability associated with each of the local ARX models taking effect.
   A smoothing algorithm is used to estimate the distribution of the hidden
   scheduling variables in the EM algorithm. If the dynamics of the
   scheduling variables are linear, Kalman smoother is used; whereas, if
   the dynamics are nonlinear, sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) method is used.
   Several simulation examples, including a continuous stirred tank reactor
   (CSTR) and a distillation column, are considered to illustrate the
   efficacy of the proposed method. Furthermore, to highlight the practical
   utility of the developed identification method, an experimental study on
   a pilot-scale hybrid tank system is also provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Face recognition based on local descriptors has been recently recognized
   as the state-of-the-art design framework for problems of facial
   identification and verification. Given the diversity of the existing
   approaches, the main objective of this paper is to present a
   comprehensive, in-depth comparative analysis of the recent face
   recognition methodologies based on local descriptors. We carefully
   review and contrast a suite of commonly encountered local descriptors.
   In particular, we highlight their main features in the setting of
   problems of facial recognition. The main advantages and limitations of
   the discussed methods are identified. Furthermore a carefully structured
   taxonomy of the existing approaches is presented We show that the
   presented techniques are particularly suitable for large scale facial
   authentication systems in which the training stage with the use of the
   overall face database might be computationally prohibited. A variety of
   approaches being used to realize a fusion of the local descriptions into
   the global ones are discussed along with their pros and cons.
   Furthermore different similarity measures and possible extensions and
   hybridizations with statistical learning techniques are elaborated on as
   well. Experimental results obtained for the FERET database are carefully
   assessed and compared. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the potential impact of OSPW (oil sands
   processed water) in terms of naphthenic acids (NAs) in the event that
   OSPW which contain NAs were discharged to a stretch of the Athabasca
   River of Alberta, Canada. A one-dimensional model WASP7 (water quality
   analysis simulation programme) was hydro-dynamically calibrated and
   validated for the data 1999-2008. The model represented the field data
   quite well except frozen seasons. The sensitivity analysis showed that
   the concentrations of NAs in the Athabasca River due to OSPW discharged
   to the river will be most sensitive to changes in the discharge rate of
   OSPW and concentrations of NAs in the OSPW. The WASP7 was applied to
   investigate how to achieve acceptable concentrations of NAs (<= 0.15
   mg/L) along the river, assuming NAs are degraded by natural dilution,
   biodegradation, sorption, photodegradation or combinations of these
   processes. If only the dilution effect is considered for an OSPW
   discharged at 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 m(3)/s (initial NAs concentration of 120
   mg/L) to the river, respectively, all the NAs concentrations simulated
   would exceed an allowable limit of <= 0.15 mg/L, which indicates that
   dilution effect alone is not sufficient to decrease the concentration of
   NAs in the river. Similarly, by only considering a photodegradation rate
   of 0.005/day, the concentrations of NAs would decrease by approximately
   0.1-3 \%. However, by only considering a maximum biodegradation rate of
   0.4/day, NAs discharged to the river can be decreased by 5-90 \%. If a
   more moderate biodegradation rate of 0.2/day is assumed but
   photodegradation is also considered at 0.0025/day, then for the same
   three discharge rates of OSPW to the river, the allowable OSPW NAs have
   to be limited to 8.02, 4.09 and 2.77 mg/L to limit NAs at 0.15 mg/L.
   This implies that high biodegradation itself is more effective than a
   combination of moderate biodegradation and photodegradation in degrading
   NAs. Through multiple numerical experiments with WASP7, it seems that to
   limit the concentrations of the final NAs in the Athabasca River within
   0.15 mg/L, it will be crucial to limit the OSPW NAs and the OSPW
   discharge rate to the river.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to compare the life cycle costs of
   lightweight and thermally massive building enclosures designed to meet
   the prescriptive requirements of the 2011 National Energy Code of Canada
   for Buildings (NECB) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Nine enclosure
   systems matched to three buildings (office, school, and apartment) were
   designed to meet the NECB requirements. Energy costs were estimated from
   local energy prices and hygrothermal analyses conducted using WUFI Plus.
   Construction and maintenance costs were estimated using ``bids{''} from
   local contractors and RS Means cost data. Life cycle cost analysis
   (LCCA) was carried out and the enclosures were compared based on
   equivalent annual cost. LCCA demonstrated that the high initial cost of
   heavier materials is largely offset by greater durability and reduced
   sensitivity to moisture. Despite relatively low initial costs, EIFS on
   stud framing was shown to have very high life cycle costs if not
   properly maintained. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal upgrading of bitumen at lower temperature can increase the
   overall liquid yield; however, from a practical point of view,
   decreasing the temperature leads to a lower reaction rate, eroding its
   industrial value. In order to increase pyrolysis rate at lower
   temperatures, copyrolysis of bitumen with potentially more reactive
   oxygenate-containing materials was proposed. The overall aim was to
   increase liquid yield and decrease gas yield and coke production, while
   increasing the pyrolysis rate. The oxygenate-containing materials that
   were investigated were partially oxidized bitumen, coals of different
   rank (lignite, subbituminous, and bituminous) and biomass-derived
   components (cellulose and lignin). No detectable increase in propagation
   rate, or decrease in the onset temperature of pyrolysis were observed
   due to addition of the oxygenate-containg materials. However, synergism
   with respect to a decrease in gas yield and organic residue was found
   during copyrolysis with some of the materials. There was meaningful
   synergism during copyrolysis with bituminous coal and lignin.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{We adapted the previously introduced SOS-FR (Steam-Over-Solvent
   Injection in Fractured Reservoirs) method and conducted 12 experiments
   using preserved core samples from the Grosmont formation. The method
   applied in this study is based on soaking rather than continuous
   injection. The samples were immersed in hot water (90 degrees C), first
   to mimic low-temperature presteaming to condition the reservoir for
   solvent injection. This was followed by a solvent soaking period under
   varying conditions (duration, solvent type, etc.). Heptane and the
   distillate obtained from a heavy oil upgrading facility were used as
   solvents. Finally, the core samples were soaked in hot water again. Oil
   recoveries varied between 40\% and 90\% OOIP, with a mean value of 68\%.
   Asphaltene precipitation, as a percentage of original oil in place
   (OOIP), was measured between 6.5 wt \% and 33 wt \%. The oil recovery
   and asphaltene precipitation depended on the solvent type, the solvent
   exposure duration, the position of matrix rock (horizontal or vertical),
   and the duration and number of solvent/hot water cycles. Most
   importantly, the last phase (hot water immersion) yielded substantial
   recovery of solvent diffused into matrix oil by applying a temperature
   value close to the boiling point of the solvent. The solvent retrieval
   was extremely fast and varied between 62\% and 82\% of the solvent
   diffused into the core during solvent exposure. Experimental
   observations look promising for further applications, as indicated by
   the high recovery values. The important aspects are that the solvent
   from readily available distillates used for transportation of heavy oil
   are very responsive and the temperature requirement for final hot water
   injection applied to retrieve solvent was <100 degrees C. Solvent
   retrieval was extremely quick and reasonably high, which is more likely
   to make the process economical.}},

Title = {{Suppression of Addition Reactions during Thermal Cracking Using Hydrogen

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{6637-6645}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Due to the complexity of the vacuum residue fraction of petroleum and
   bitumen, a model compound was used to probe cracking and addition
   reactions in the liquid phase. Hydrogenation reactions were conducted in
   a batch microreactor at 430 degrees C, 13.9 MPa H2 for 30 min using a
   solution of 1,3,6,8-tetrahexylpyrene (THP) in tetralin. Sulfided iron
   was prepared on alpha-alumina, gamma-alumina, and glass beads as support
   materials. The hypothesis of this study was that addition reactions can
   be suppressed under hydrogenation conditions by using iron sulfide as a
   low-activity catalyst in the presence of hydrogen gas and a hydrogen
   donor solvent, by saturating olefin intermediates. The products were
   analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography,
   matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, and
   proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate conversion
   and product distribution for different catalysts and without added
   catalyst. The results show that sulfided iron can give significant
   suppression of addition reactions, decreasing from 63 mol \% for the
   noncatalytic reaction to 13 mol \% under catalytic conditions, and
   shifting the selectivity toward cracking, without competitive
   hydrogenation of the aromatics. The catalysts were characterized by
   measuring bulk and surface composition, and by scanning electron
   microscopy before and after the reaction. The data show that catalyst
   does not have an impact on conversion; therefore, the data do not
   support the claim that free radicals are efficiently hydrogenated. The
   results confirm the presence of iron sulfide on the catalyst surface and
   a change in its crystalline structure from pyrite to pyrrhotite during
   reaction. This study shows the value of using a low-cost iron catalyst,
   as compared to the commercial nickel-based catalysts, as an additive to
   reduce the amount of coke formation in thermal cracking processes
   conducted in the presence of hydrogen.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling of geometallurgical variables is becoming increasingly
   important for improved management of mineral resources. Mineral
   processing circuits are complex and depend on the interaction of a large
   number of properties of the ore feed. At the Olympic Dam mine in South
   Australia, plant performance variables of interest include the recovery
   of Cu and U3O8, acid consumption, net recovery, drop weight index, and
   bond mill work index. There are an insufficient number of pilot plant
   trials (841) to consider direct three-dimensional spatial modeling for
   the entire deposit. The more extensively sampled head grades, mineral
   associations, grain sizes, and mineralogy variables are modeled and used
   to predict plant performance. A two-stage linear regression model of the
   available data is developed and provides a predictive model with
   correlations to the plant performance variables ranging from 0.65-0.90.
   There are a total of 204 variables that have sufficient sampling to be
   considered in this regression model. After developing the relationships
   between the 204 input variables and the six performance variables, the
   input variables are simulated with sequential Gaussian simulation and
   used to generate models of recovery of Cu and U3O8, acid consumption,
   net recovery, drop weight index, and bond mill work index. These final
   models are suitable for mine and plant optimization.}},

Abstract = {{The oil sands industry faces significant challenges in developing
   effective remediation technologies for process-affected water stored in
   tailings ponds. Naphthenic acids, a complex mixture of cycloaliphatic
   carboxylic acids, have been of particular concern because they
   concentrate in tailings ponds and are a component of the acutely toxic
   fraction of process water. Ozone treatment has been demonstrated as an
   effective means of rapidly degrading naphthenic acids, reducing process
   water toxicity, and increasing its biodegradability following seeding
   with the endogenous process water bacteria. This study is the first to
   examine subsequent in situ biodegradation following ozone pretreatment.
   Two aged oil sands process-affected waters from experimental reclamation
   tailings ponds were ozonated to reduce the dissolved organic carbon, to
   which naphthenic acids contributed minimally (<1 mg L-1). Treatment with
   an ozone dose of 50 mg L-1 improved the 84 d biodegradability of
   remaining dissolved organic carbon during subsequent aerobic incubation
   (11-13 mg L-1 removed from aged process-affected waters versus 5 mg L-1
   when not pretreated with ozone). The ozone-treated indigenous microbial
   communities were as capable of degrading organic matter as the same
   community not exposed to ozone. This supports ozonation coupled with
   biodegradation as an effective and feasible treatment option. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The impact of beacon misdetection on the aggregate interference from a
   hybrid underlay-interweave network is analyzed, for a Poisson field of
   cognitive radio (CR) nodes distributed over an annular region. This
   network consists of two types of nodes: underlay, and interweave. The
   underlay nodes are allowed to transmit anytime, whereas the interweave
   nodes must first sense an out-of-band beacon. When this sensing is
   erroneous, interweave node transmissions increase the interference. We
   analyze the interference statistics by deriving the exact moment
   generating function, the mean, and the outage probability of the primary
   receiver, for path loss and Rayleigh fading. Our analysis suggests that
   hybrid underlay-interweave CR systems are more suitable for areas with
   low path loss exponents such as rural/suburban environments.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{233}},
Pages = {{39-46}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Current mathematical models for estimating the fluence delivery in an
   annular ultraviolet (UV) disinfection reactor are not adequate because
   some critical input parameters (e.g., lamp output, sleeve transmittance,
   and water temperature) concerning various reactor characteristics are
   difficult to quantify. In this study, a fluence rate (FR) model (UVCalc
   (R) version 2A), combined with experimental measurements using an FR
   detector, namely a 360-degree response micro-fluorescent silica detector
   (MFSD), was used as a new method to determine the practical fluence. The
   FR values at representative test points were measured by the MFSD in the
   temperature range of 10-30 degrees C and water transmittance range of
   85-95\% (per cm). The radius-weighted average of the measured to model
   FR ratios at these test points was adopted as a `correction factor' to
   calibrate the model fluence (i.e., reference fluence) to the practical
   fluence at a certain water temperature and UV transmittance. The
   fluences estimated by the `detector-model' combination method agreed
   well with those determined by biodosimetry. This fast and cost-effective
   method has potential applications for estimation and on-site inspection
   of the practical fluence in UV facilities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) allows detection of unique
   signatures of molecular vibrations, which identify molecules adsorbed on
   nanostructured substrates. However, for SERS detection techniques to be
   reproducible, highly regular metallic nanostructures must be fabricated.
   In this work, the authors have optimized high resolution electron beam
   lithography (EBL) to fabricate gold nanostructures on fused silica
   substrates for efficient SERS biodetection. 30 keV EBL exposures
   employing an appropriate anticharging scheme followed by development
   have been used to fabricate arrays of nanopits in PMMA on a fused silica
   substrate, with subsequent evaporation of Au and lift-off to obtain
   arrays of Au dots. The EBL process has been tuned to obtain arrays of
   dots with a 50 nm pitch and different interdot gaps. The SERS substrates
   have been biofunctionalized by self-assembled monolayers (of
   11-mercaptoundecanoic acid) and a biological analyte protein A
   immobilized on the substrates. In order to detect the protein in its
   natural environment, the biofunctionalized samples were maintained in
   deionized water. SERS spectra of protein A were subsequently acquired
   allowing detection of many vibrational modes of protein A in aqueous
   solution. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{Ionic self-complementary peptides are considered an important class of
   self-assembling peptides. In particular, RADARADARADARADA (RADA(4)) is
   wellknown to form a relatively regular nanofiber structure that has been
   primarily studied in terms of its physicochemical properties, as related
   to its biomedical applications. However, the molecular level
   interactions that are involved in promoting the self-assembly of this
   peptide into nanofibers have not been fully elucidated. Herein, a
   thermodynamic analysis of the influences of peptide chemistry upon
   self-assembly is discussed for RADA, RADA(4)-K-5, and RADA(4)-S-5. The
   regular nanofiber structure of the assembled peptides makes it a good
   candidate for isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies for
   determining the propensity for self-assembly, the critical assembly
   concentration (CAC), and the role hydration and ion content play in the
   assembly of these peptides. First, solutions containing only RADA(4)-K-5
   did not self-assemble; illustrating even slight alterations in the
   asymmetric terminal amino acid chemistry affects assembly. The CAC of
   the remaining self-assembling peptides was between similar to 0.1 and
   similar to 0.15 mM. Interestingly, we found that self-assembly was
   entropically driven with hydrophobic forces being the main driving force
   for RADA(4) and hydrogen bonding for RADA(4)-S-5. The role of water
   molecules and counterions in self-assembly was also highlighted:
   assembly of RADA(4) led to desolvation of interfacial surfaces, whereas
   the net number of water molecules in the assembled complex increased
   upon RADA(4)-S-5 self-assembly. Moreover, it was found that counterions
   did not seem to contribute significantly to self-assembly: a result in
   contrast to current concepts regarding the role of electrostatic
   interactions in self-assembly of RADA(4)-like peptides. A molecular
   level understanding of peptide self-assembly will allow for further
   engineering of peptides for a vast array of biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Friction stir processing (FSP) was applied to modify the microstructure

   SiC composites increased from 130 HV and 145 HV to 171 HV and 177 HV
   respectively. The increase was accounted for by the severe deformation
   occurring during FSP which uniformly distributed the SiC particles. The
   composites containing 16 vol\% SiC could not be fully consolidated using
   FSP, and contained residual pores and lack of consolidation which
   originated from the as-received sintered microstructure. The hardness
   correlated well with the mean inter-particle spacing for the SiC
   particles in the case of composites containing 4 and 8 vol\% SiC. (C)

Abstract = {{Automatic image annotation is concerned with the task of assigning one
   or more semantic concepts to a given image. It is a typical multi-label
   classification problem. This paper presents a novel multi-label
   classification framework MLNRS based on neighborhood rough sets for
   automatic image annotation which considers the uncertainty of the
   mapping from visual feature space to semantic concepts space. Given a
   new instances, its neighbors in the training set are firstly identified.
   After that, based on the concept of upper and lower approximations of
   neighborhood rough sets, all possible labels of the given instance are
   found. Then, based on the statistical information gained from the label
   sets of the neighbors, maximum a posteriori (MAP) principle is utilized
   to determine the label set for the given instance. Experiments completed
   for three different image datasets show that MLNRS achieves more
   promising performance in comparison with to some well-known multi-label
   learning algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Self-healing is a major driving force in the smart grid vision. This
   paper proposes a comprehensive design and operational planning framework
   to generate optimum self-healing control actions in a distribution
   system. For this purpose, a distribution system with optimally allocated

   high self-adequacy through allocation of distributed energy storage
   resources (DESRs) and distributed reactive sources (DRSs). Afterwards,
   by using the predicted load and generation of renewable-based
   distributed generators for the next hour of the day and other important
   factors (self-adequacy in the unfaulted microgrids, total distribution
   system's energy losses and the total supplied loads according to their
   requested reliability), the optimum self-healing strategy is planned for
   the system for all possible future faults. The IEEE 123-bus distribution
   system is selected as the test system; optimum microgrids are designed
   and several case studies are presented to demonstrate the effects of
   optimization coefficients on the optimum self-healing control actions.}},

Title = {{Turbulent structure of high-amplitude pressure peaks within the
   turbulent boundary layer}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{735}},
Pages = {{381-426}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The positive and negative high-amplitude pressure peaks (HAPP) are
   investigated in a turbulent boundary layer at Re-theta = 1900 in order
   to identify their turbulent structure. The three-dimensional velocity
   field is measured within the inner layer of the turbulent boundary layer
   using tomographic particle image velocimetry (tomo-PIV). The
   measurements are performed at an acquisition frequency of 10 000 Hz and
   over a volume of 418 x 149 x 621 wall units in the streamwise,
   wall-normal and spanwise directions, respectively. The time-resolved
   velocity fields are applied to obtain the material derivative using the
   Lagrangian method followed by integration of the Poisson pressure
   equation to obtain the three-dimensional unsteady pressure field. The
   simultaneous volumetric velocity, acceleration, and pressure data are
   conditionally sampled based on local maxima and minima of wall pressure
   to analyse the three-dimensional turbulent structure of the HAPPs.
   Analysis has associated the positive HAPPs to the shear layer structures
   formed by an upstream sweep of high-speed flow opposing a downstream
   ejection event. The sweep event is initiated in the outer layer while
   the ejection of near-wall fluid is formed by the hairpin category of
   vortices. The shear layers were observed to be asymmetric in the
   instantaneous visualizations of the velocity and acceleration fields.
   The asymmetric pattern originates from the spanwise component of
   temporal acceleration of the ejection event downstream of the shear
   layer. The analysis also demonstrated a significant contribution of the
   pressure transport term to the budget of the turbulent kinetic energy in
   the shear layers. Investigation of the conditional averages and the
   orientation of the vortices showed that the negative HAPPs are linked to
   both the spanwise and quasi-streamwise vortices of the turbulent
   boundary layer. The quasi-streamwise vortices can be associated with the
   hairpin category of vortices or the isolated quasi-streamwise vortices
   of the inner layer. A bi-directional analysis of the link between the
   HAPPs and the hairpin paradigm is also conducted by conditionally
   averaging the pressure field based on the detection of hairpin vortices
   using strong ejection events. The results demonstrated positive pressure
   in the shear layer region of the hairpin model and negative pressure
   overlapping with the vortex core.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous paper (Dehghanpour et al., Phys Rev E 83:065302, 2011a),
   we showed that relative permeability of mobilized oil, , measured during
   tertiary gravity drainage, is significantly higher than that of the same
   oil saturation in other tests where oil is initially a continuous phase.
   We also showed that tertiary strongly correlates to both water
   saturation, , water flux (water relative permeability), , and the change
   in water saturation with time, . To develop a model and understanding of
   the enhanced oil transport, identifying which of these parameters (, or
   ) plays the controlling role is necessary, but in the previous
   experiments these could not be deconvolved. To answer the remaining
   question, we conduct specific three-phase displacement experiments in
   which is controlled by applying a fixed water influx, and develops
   naturally. We obtain by using the saturation data measured in time and
   space. The results suggest that steady-state water influx, in contrast
   to transient water displacement, does not enhance . Instead, reducing
   water influx rate results in excess oil flow. Furthermore, according to
   our pore scale hydraulic conductivity calculations, viscous coupling and
   fluid positioning do not sufficiently explain the observed correlation
   between and . We conclude that tertiary is controlled by the oil
   mobilization rate, which in turn is linked to the rate of water
   saturation decrease with time, . Finally, we develop a simple model
   which relates tertiary to transient two-phase gas/water relative
   permeability.}},

Abstract = {{The motivation for this article comes from our development of soft
   sensors for chemical processes where several challenges are encountered.
   For example, quality variables in chemical processes are often measured
   off-line through laboratory analysis. Collection of samples and
   subsequent analyses inevitably introduce uncertain time delays
   associated with the irregularly sampled quality variables, which add
   significant difficulty in identification of process with multirate (MR)
   data. Considering the MR system with random sampling delays described by
   a finite impulse response (FIR) model, an Expectation-Maximization
   (EM)-based algorithm to estimate its parameters along with the time
   delays is developed. Based on the identified FIR model, two algorithms
   are proposed to recover the approximate output error (OE) or transfer
   function model. Two simulation examples as well as a pilot-scale
   experiment are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   methods. (c) 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 59:

   invariant properties of the initial solution ensemble. Subsequently, the
   Karhunen-Loeve decomposition is applied to the solution ensemble on
   fixed spatial domain resulting in a set of optimal eigenfunctions.
   Further, the low dimensional set of empirical eigenfunctions is mapped
   on the original time-varying domain by an appropriate mapping, resulting
   in the basis for the construction of the reduced-order model of the
   parabolic PDE system with time-varying domain. This methodology is used
   in three representative cases, one- and two-dimensional (1-D and 2-D)
   models of nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems with analytically defined
   domain evolutions, and the 2-D model of the Czochralski crystal growth
   process with nontrivial geometry. (c) 2013 American Institute of

Abstract = {{In this work, we consider moving horizon state estimation (MHE)-based
   model predictive control (MPC) of nonlinear systems. Specifically, we
   consider the Lyapunov-based MPC (LMPC) developed in (Mhaskar et al.,
   IEEE Trans Autom Control. 2005;50:1670-1680; Syst Control Lett.
   2006;55:650-659) and the robust MHE (RMHE) developed in (Liu J, Chem Eng
   Sci. 2013;93:376-386). First, we focus on the case that the RMHE and the
   LMPC are evaluated every sampling time. An estimate of the stability
   region of the output control system is first established; and then
   sufficient conditions under which the closed-loop system is guaranteed
   to be stable are derived. Subsequently, we propose a triggered
   implementation strategy for the RMHE-based LMPC to reduce its
   computational load. The triggering condition is designed based on
   measurements of the output and its time derivatives. To ensure the
   closed-loop stability, the formulations of the RMHE and the LMPC are
   also modified accordingly to account for the potential open-loop
   operation. A chemical process is used to illustrate the proposed
   approaches. (c) 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J,

Title = {{Techno-economic assessment of hydrogen production from underground coal
   gasification (UCG) in Western Canada with carbon capture and

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the techno-economic viability of hydrogen production
   from underground coal gasification (UCG) in Western Canada, for the
   servicing of the oil sands bitumen upgrading industry. Hydrogen
   production for bitumen upgrading is predominantly achieved via steam
   methane reforming (SMR); which involves significant greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions along with considerable feedstock (natural gas) cost
   volatility. UCG is a formidable candidate for cost-competitive
   environmentally sustainable hydrogen production; given its negligible
   feedstock cost, the enormity of deep coal reserves in Western Canada and
   the favourable CO2 sequestration characteristics of potential UCG sites
   in the Western Canadian sedimentary basin (WCSB). Techno-economic models
   were developed for UCG and SMR with and without CCS, to estimate the
   cost of hydrogen production including delivery to a bitumen upgrader. In
   this paper, at base case conditions, a 5\% internal rate of return (IRR)
   differential between UCG and SMR was considered so as to account for the
   increased investment risk associated with UCG. The cost of UCG hydrogen
   production without CCS is estimated to be \$1.78/kg of H-2. With CCS,
   this increases to range of \$2.11 \$2.70/kg of H-2, depending on the
   distance of the site for CO2 sequestration from the UCG plant. The SMR
   hydrogen production cost without CCS is estimated to be \$1.73/kg of
   H-2. In similar fashion to UCG, this rises to a range of \$2.14 to
   \$2.41/kg of H-2 with the consideration of CCS. Lastly, for hydrogen
   production without CCS, UCG has a superior cost competitiveness in
   comparison to SMR for an IRR differential less than 4.6\%. This
   competitive threshold rises to 5.4\% for hydrogen production with CCS.

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the development of human brain organization is critical
   for gaining insight into how the enhancement of cognitive processes is
   related to the fine-tuning of the brain network. However, the
   developmental trajectory of the large-scale white matter (WM) network is
   not fully understood. Here, using graph theory, we examine developmental
   changes in the organization of WM networks in 180 typically-developing
   participants. WM networks were constructed using whole brain
   tractography and 78 cortical regions of interest were extracted from
   each participant. The subjects were first divided into 5 equal sample
   size (n = 36) groups (early childhood: 6.0-9.7 years; late childhood:
   9.8-12.7 years; adolescence: 12.9-17.5 years; young adult: 17.6-21.8
   years; adult: 21.9-29.6 years). Most prominent changes in the
   topological properties of developing brain networks occur at late
   childhood and adolescence. During late childhood period, the structural
   brain network showed significant increase in the global efficiency but
   decrease in modularity, suggesting a shift of topological organization
   toward a more randomized configuration. However, while preserving most
   topological features, there was a significant increase in the local
   efficiency at adolescence, suggesting the dynamic process of rewiring
   and rebalancing brain connections at different growth stages. In
   addition, several pivotal hubs were identified that are vital for the
   global coordination of information flow over the whole brain network
   across all age groups. Significant increases of nodal efficiency were
   present in several regions such as precuneus at late childhood. Finally,
   a stable and functionally/anatomically related modular organization was
   identified throughout the development of the WM network. This study used
   network analysis to elucidate the topological changes in brain
   maturation, paving the way for developing novel methods for analyzing
   disrupted brain connectivity in neurodevelopmental disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Transverse relaxation (T-2) mapping has many applications, including
   imaging of iron accumulation in grey matter. Using the typical multiecho
   spin-echo sequence with long echo trains, stimulated echo compensation
   can enable T-2 fitting under conditions of variable radio frequency
   homogeneity arising from slice profile and in-plane radio frequency
   variation. Substantial reduction in the number of refocusing pulses
   could enable use at high magnetic fields where specific absorption rate
   is a major limitation, and enable multislice use with reduced incidental
   magnetization transfer at all field strengths. We examine the effect of
   reduced echo train lengths and multislice imaging on T-2 fitting using
   stimulated echo compensation applied to iron-rich subcortical grey
   matter in human brain at 4.7 T. Our findings indicate that reducing from
   20 echoes to as few as four echoes can maintain consistent T-2 values
   when using stimulated echo compensation in grey and white matter, but
   not for cerebrospinal fluid. All territories produce marginal results
   when using standard exponential fitting. Savings from reduced echoes can
   be used to substantially increase slice coverage. In multislice mode,
   the resulting incidental magnetization transfer decreased brain signal
   but had minimal effect on measured T-2 values. Magn Reson Med

Abstract = {{Magnesium has attracted considerable attention from industry especially
   from the transportation sector due to its high strength-to-weight ratio.
   However, poor wear resistance and especially low corrosion resistance of
   Mg are barriers to extensive use of Mg alloys. Yttrium is one of the
   rare-earth elements, which has been demonstrated effective in improving
   the corrosion resistance and tribological properties of some metallic
   alloys. In this work, effects of yttrium on wear, corrosion and
   corrosive wear of as-cast Mg-3\%Al alloy were investigated. It was shown
   that the added Y increased the wear resistance of the alloy through the
   formation of a harder second phase, Al2Y. In the case of corrosion, a
   small amount of added Y improved the corrosion resistance but such
   benefit decreased when the yttrium contents was higher than 2 wt\%Y.
   When worn in tap water involving corrosion, yttrium also improved the
   performance of Mg-3\%Al alloy. Possible mechanisms responsible for these
   changes are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Alberta oil sands}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{148-157}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Alberta oil sands ores are a combination of four petrologically
   different kinds of rocks, called ``end members{''}, deposited in marine
   and estuarine sedimentary environments. The combination of the different
   end members affects the properties of the oil sands. Applying organic
   solvents for bitumen extraction from the oil sands is an alternative to
   the current commercial hot water extraction process. Certain minerals
   (mainly clay minerals) in the oil sands may affect processability of the
   ore during non-aqueous extraction.
   The aim of the present study was to perform mineral and chemical
   characterization of the four end members in order to better understand
   the mineralogical and geochemical factors affecting bitumen extraction
   and subsequent solvent recovery from the extraction tailings.
   The as-received end members and their different size fractions were
   examined using XRD, QXRD, FTIR, ICP-MS and C, H, N and S content
   analysis. The results revealed variable amounts of toluene insoluble
   organic carbon in the samples after bitumen removal. The amount was
   higher in the finer size fractions, indicating its association mainly
   with the clay minerals. Bitumen removal was the most effective in the
   coarse grained quartz-rich samples containing a minimal amount of the
   clay minerals. The four end members consisted of quartz, clay minerals
   (kaolinite, illite, mixed layer illite-smectite and chlorite),
   carbonates (calcite, dolomite and siderite), K-feldspar, TiO2 minerals
   (anatase and rutile) and pyrite. The highest relative amount of mixed
   layer illite-smectite was found in the finest fractions (<0.2 mu m). The
   expandability (SXRD) of illite-smectite was 10 +/- 2\%. The quantitative
   mineralogical analysis correlated well with chemical composition
   analysis of the petrologic end members of the oil sands. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The detection of direct causality, as opposed to indirect causality, is
   an important and challenging problem in root cause and hazard
   propagation analysis. Several methods provide effective solutions to
   this problem when linear relationships between variables are involved.
   For nonlinear relationships, currently only overall causality analysis
   can be conducted, but direct causality cannot be identified for such
   processes. In this paper, we describe a direct causality detection
   approach suitable for both linear and nonlinear connections. Based on an
   extension of the transfer entropy approach, a direct transfer entropy
   (DTE) concept is proposed to detect whether there is a direct
   information flow pathway from one variable to another. Especially, a
   differential direct transfer entropy concept is defined for continuous
   random variables, and a normalization method for the differential direct
   transfer entropy is presented to determine the connectivity strength of
   direct causality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
   illustrated by several examples, including one experimental case study
   and one industrial case study.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of Cr3C2 and VC addition on the microstructure and
   mechanical properties of WC-Mg composites hot-pressed at 1650 degrees C
   for 90 min was comprehensively investigated. The grain growth of WC was
   significantly retarded and the homogeneity of MgO particulate dispersion
   was effectively improved with the addition of 0.5 wt.\% Cr3C2 or 0.5
   wt.\% VC. The indentation size effect (ISE) on hardness was restrained
   and the load-independent hardness was increased by doping grain growth
   inhibitors. Improvements on fracture toughness of hot-pressed samples
   were also observed due to the refined WC grains and uniformly dispersed
   MgO particulates. In addition, experimental results demonstrated that
   Niihara's equation was preferable for estimating the indentation
   fracture toughness, by comparing the fracture toughness evaluated using
   the single-edge V-notch beam (SEVNB) method with the values estimated
   through the Vickers indentation technique. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A better understanding of osteogenesis at genetic and biochemical levels
   is yielding new molecular entities that can modulate bone regeneration
   and potentially act as novel therapies in a clinical setting. These new
   entities are motivating alternative approaches for bone repair by
   utilizing DNA-derived expression systems, as well as RNA-based
   regulatory molecules controlling the fate of cells involved in
   osteogenesis. These sophisticated mediators of osteogenesis, however,
   pose unique delivery challenges that are not obvious in deployment of
   conventional therapeutic agents. Viral and nonviral delivery systems are
   actively pursued in preclinical animal models to realize the potential
   of the gene-based medicines. This article will summarize promising
   bone-inducing molecular agents on the horizon as well as provide a
   critical review of delivery systems employed for their administration.
   Special attention was paid to synthetic (nonviral) delivery systems
   because they are more likely to be adopted for clinical testing because
   of safety considerations. We present a comparative analysis of
   dose-response relationships, as well as pharmacokinetic and
   pharmacodynamic features of various approaches, with the purpose of
   clearly defining the current frontier in the field. We conclude with the
   authors' perspective on the future of gene-based therapy of bone
   defects, articulating promising research avenues to advance the field of
   clinical bone repair. (c) 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral

Title = {{Mass-Mobility Measurements Using a Centrifugal Particle Mass Analyzer
   and Differential Mobility Spectrometer}},
Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1215-1225}},

Abstract = {{Mass-mobility measurements using a centrifugal particle mass analyzer
   (CPMA) and differential mobility spectrometer (DMS) are demonstrated.
   The CPMA, which classifies an aerosol by mass-to-charge ratio, is used
   upstream of a DMS, which measures the mobility size distribution of the
   mass-classified particles in real-time. This system allows for
   mass-mobility measurements to be made on transient sources at one
   particle mass or an entire effective density distribution for steady
   state sources in minutes. Since the CPMA classifies particles by
   mass-to-charge ratio and multiply charged particles are present,
   particles of several different masses will be measured by the DMS.
   Therefore, a correction scheme is required to make accurate
   measurements. To validate this measurement scheme, two different
   CPMA-DMS systems were used to measure the known density of
   di(2ethylhexyl) sebacate (DEHS). The first system consisted of a CPMA
   and standard DMS500 (Cambustion). This system measured an average
   effective density of 1027kg/m(3) or within 12.6\% of the accepted value
   with an estimated uncertainty of 30.1\% (with 95\% confidence). The
   second system consisted of a CPMA and modified DMS. The modified DMS was
   a DMS500 with the corona charger disabled and sample and sheath flow
   rates lowered, decreasing the uncertainty in the mobility measurement.
   This system measured an average effective density of 964kg/m(3) or
   within 5.7\% of the accepted value with an uncertainty of 9.5-10.4\%
   depending on particle mobility size. Finally, it was determined that
   multiple-charge correction and size calibration were required, with each
   correction causing a maximum change in measured effective density
   greater than 10\%.}},

Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{4118-4132}},

Abstract = {{Radially polarized piezoelectric fibers are now considered to be used in
   smart composites. The piezoelectric layers in these fibers are generally
   anisotropic in the transverse direction and therefore difficult to
   analyze when dynamic loads are involved. The present paper presents a
   theoretical study of the dynamic behavior of radially polarized
   cylindrical piezoelectric layers between isotropic elastic media. A new
   interphase model is developed to provide simple yet accurate evaluation
   of the dynamic response of such anisotropic elastic layers. Unlike the
   traditional interface-spring model, the current interphase model
   satisfies the equations of motion of the layers and can provide reliable
   prediction of the stress and displacement. A comparison between the
   developed model, the interface-spring model and the finite element
   analysis is conducted. The results clearly show the advantages of the
   current model over the traditional interface-spring model in simulating
   anisotropic layers. Numerical examples based on this interphase model
   for different interphase thicknesses, loading frequencies and material
   combinations are presented to evaluate the dynamic behavior of
   multilayered elastic media. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Locking plate fixation of proximal humeral fractures with impaction of

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Despite the advent of locking plate techniques, proximal
   humeral fracture fixation can fail due to varus collapse, especially in
   osteoporotic bone with medial cortex comminution. This study
   investigated the effect of restoring the integrity of the medial column
   by fracture impaction and shaft medialization with locking plate
   fixation. This construct was compared with a traditional locking plate
   construct under conditions of varus cyclical loading.
   Materials and methods: Proximal humeral fractures with medial
   comminution were simulated by performing wedge-shaped osteotomies at the
   surgical neck in cadaveric specimens and removing 1 cm of medial cortex.
   For each cadaver (n = 6), 1 humeral fracture was fixed with a
   traditional locking plate construct. The other was fixed with the
   locking plate construct plus fracture impaction and shaft medialization,
   resulting in medial column restoration. The humeral head was
   immobilized, and a repetitive, varus force was applied to the humeral
   shaft until construct collapse or until 25,000 cycles were completed.
   Results: None of the constructs with fracture impaction collapsed,
   whereas 5 of 6 of the nonaugmented constructs collapsed before reaching
   25,000 cycles (P = .008). Collapse of the 5 nonimpacted constructs that
   failed occurred after an average of 11,470 +/- 3589 cycles.
   Conclusion: Fracture impaction increased the ability of the locking
   plate to withstand repetitive varus loading. This technique provides a
   construct biomechanically superior to locking plate fixation alone. (c)

Abstract = {{Freeway service patrol (FSP) is a low-cost but effective method to
   identify and clear incidents quickly on freeways, and it has been widely
   implemented in United States. Most of the related literature focuses on
   evaluating the reduction of travel delay and secondary collision because
   of a quicker incident clearance. Although such measures are major
   concerns in urban areas, they may be of less concern in low-traffic
   areas. A major function of FSP in low-traffic areas is to assist stalled
   vehicles, protect stranded drivers, and provide free road assistance
   services, but its major benefit is to bring direct savings to stranded
   drivers. This paper presents a new benchmark to evaluate the
   benefit-cost ratio of FSP in low-traffic areas based on a customized
   event-driven simulation model. The event-driven simulation model is
   better than the analytical models and microscopic simulation in this
   context in that it can accommodate more details than an analytical model
   while achieve a faster simulating speed than microscopic simulations
   when the road network is large and the simulation period is long.
   Lastly, the Safety Assistance for Freeway Emergencies (SAFE) Patrol in
   Kentucky is evaluated by using the method in this paper to evaluate and
   estimate the benefit-cost ratios of SAFE Patrol under different
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the deformation and damage mechanisms of 3D
   orthogonal woven composite (3DOWC) under three-point bending based on
   finite element analysis (FEA) at micro/meso/macro-scale level. One type
   of micro-scale repeating unit cell model (micro-RUC) has been
   established with the same fiber volume fraction of the 3DOWC. Two types
   of meso-scale repeating unit cell models, surface meso-RUC and inner
   meso-RUC, were established from fiber bundles structures. Combined with
   the smeared crack failure modes, the mechanical properties of fiber
   bundles which including the longitudinal and transverse ultimate
   strengths have been obtained based on properties of the fibers and the
   resins. Then the ultimate strengths of the surface layer and inner layer
   of the 3DOWC have been calculated based on the damaged surface meso-RUC
   and the inner meso-RUC with developed smeared cracks. Finally the 3DOWC
   beam was modeled with two types of elements, i.e., the surface layer
   elements and the inner layer elements, at the macro-scale level. The
   global and local responses of the beam under three-point bending, and
   the damage initiation and propagation, have been predicted at the full
   scale beam level. The numerical results were compared with the
   experimental results and good agreement was found. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

Abstract = {{Time of flight based methods are extensively used for detecting,
   locating and sizing faults in ultrasonic non-destructive testing and
   evaluation. In this paper, we investigate model-based estimation of the
   ultrasonic time of flight using B-scan signals. The Cramer-Rao bounds on
   the time of flight estimator for B-scan signals are derived and then
   compared to the Cramer-Rao bounds on the time of flight estimator for
   A-scan signals. Through this theoretical analysis, we show that the
   estimation based on B-scan signals significantly reduces the Cramer-Rao
   bound on the time of flight estimator. In addition, the resulting
   theoretical equation allows evaluating the improvement in the accuracy
   of estimating the time of flight. The theoretical lower bound is then
   compared to the variance of a maximum likelihood estimator which is
   obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the
   maximum likelihood estimator can achieve the lower bound on the variance
   of the time of flight estimator and hence it is an efficient estimator.
   This numerical result will complement the theoretical analysis by
   showing that the Cramer-Rao bound can be reached if a proper estimator
   is selected. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, ash-free coal (AFC) was extracted from low-rank Canadian
   coals with mean maximum vitrinite reflectance (MMVR) in the range of
   038-0.69 using non-polar organic solvent, organic solvent combination
   (polar-nonpolar solvent mixture), and with and without hydro-treated
   heavy aromatic hydrocarbon solvents from coal-tar industry to study the
   effect of type of coal and solvent type on the production yield of AFC.
   High temperature solvent extraction was carried out in 0.5 L autoclave
   in the temperature range of 473 to 723 K. It was observed that
   1-methylnaphthalene (1-MN), a non-polar solvent did not give any
   significant difference in yields {[}similar to 30\% (daf)]. However, an
   extraction yield of 73\% (daf) AFC was achieved using hydrotreated
   aromatic hydrocarbons at 673 K. The performance of extraction yields was
   correlated by the vitrinite content and MMVR of the coal and it was
   observed that higher proportions of vitrinite and a lower MMVR value of
   coal produced higher extraction yield. Proximate and ultimate analysis,
   FTIR, ICP-MS, C-13 CP/MAS NMR, thermogravimetric analysis and particle
   size distribution were used to characterize AFC. The heating value of
   the AFC was estimated to be in the range of 36-37 MJ/kg and a
   substantial decrease of sulfur content (ca. 12.5-61.1\%) is also
   observed in AFC. AFC showed a narrower particle size distribution with a
   d(50) of 7.0 mu m. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC) susceptibility in the heat-affected zone
   (HAZ) was investigated and modeled using implant static tensile limit
   stress (sigma(imp)) and maximum hardness of the HAZ (HV10MAX). C-Mn and
   high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steels were used as base metals with a
   carbon equivalent (CE) ranging from 0.38 to 0.48\% and 0.52 to 0.69\%,
   respectively. The shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) and gas metal arc
   welding (GMAW) processes with CO2 shielding gas were used. The
   diffusible hydrogen (H) content was varied taking the values between 2
   and 40 mL/100 g. sigma(imp) and HV10MAX were the two measures used to
   evaluate the weldment susceptibility to HIC. Using Pearson's
   product-moment coefficient (P-pm) and the developed analysis of HIC
   susceptibility, two simplified models were developed using simple
   mechanistic models, linear and logarithmic, to simulate sigma(imp) and
   HV10MAX. sigma(imp) was modeled as a function of HV10MAX and H, while
   HV10MAX was modeled as a function of CE and t(800/500). The two new
   simplified models were capable of accurately simulating both sigma(imp)
   and HV10MAX. The newly developed models form a simplified tool that can
   be used to assess HIC susceptibility in steel weldments.}},

Abstract = {{Group decision making is a type of derision problem in which multiple
   experts acting collectively, analyze problems, evaluate alternatives,
   and select a solution from a collection of alternatives. As the natural
   language is the standard representation of those concepts that humans
   use for communication, it seems natural that they use words (linguistic
   terms) instead of numerical values to provide their opinions. However,
   while linguistic information is readily available, it is not operational
   and thus it has to be made usable though expressing it in terms of
   information granules. To do so, Granular Computing, which has emerged as
   a unified and coherent framework of designing, processing, and
   interpretation of information granules, can be used. The aim of this
   paper is to present an information granulation of the linguistic
   information used in group decision making problems defined in
   heterogeneous contexts, i.e., where the experts have associated
   importance degrees reflecting their ability to handle the problem. The
   granulation of the linguistic terms is formulated as an optimization
   problem, solved by using the particle swarm optimization, in which a
   Performance index is maximized by a suitable mapping of the linguistic
   terms on information granules formalized as sets. This performance index
   is expressed as a weighted aggregation of the individual consistency
   achieved by each expert. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In many industrial environments, maintenance is performed during
   successive mission breaks. In these conditions, it may not be feasible
   to perform all possible maintenance actions due to limited maintenance
   resources such as time, budget, repairman availability, etc. A subset of
   maintenance actions is then performed on selected components such that
   the system is able to meet the next mission requirement. Such a
   maintenance policy is called selective maintenance. In this article, a
   selective maintenance strategy is developed for a MultiState System
   (MSS). The system can have several finite levels of performance in an
   MSS. Previous studies on selective maintenance have solely focused on
   MSSs with binary components. However, components in an MSS may be in
   more than two possible states. Hence, a series-parallel MSS that
   consists of multistate components is considered in this article.
   Imperfect maintenance of a component is considered to be a maintenance
   option, along with the replacement and the do-nothing options.
   Maintenance resources need to be allocated such that maximum system
   reliability during the next mission is ensured. A universal generating
   function is used to determine system reliability. An illustrative
   example is presented that depicts the advantages of utilizing imperfect
   maintenance/repair options.}},

Abstract = {{In order to address the load sharing problem in islanding microgrids,
   this paper proposes an enhanced distributed generation (DG) unit virtual
   impedance control approach. The proposed method can realize accurate
   regulation of DG unit equivalent impedance at both fundamental and
   selected harmonic frequencies. In contrast to conventional virtual
   impedance control methods, where only a line current feed-forward term
   is added to the DG voltage reference, the proposed virtual impedance at
   fundamental and harmonic frequencies is regulated using DG line current
   and point of common coupling (PCC) voltage feed-forward terms,
   respectively. With this modification, the impacts of mismatched physical
   feeder impedances are compensated. Thus, better reactive and harmonic
   power sharing can be realized. Additionally, this paper also
   demonstrates that PCC harmonic voltages can be mitigated by reducing the
   magnitude of DG unit equivalent harmonic impedance. Finally, in order to
   alleviate the computing load at DG unit local controller, this paper
   further exploits the band-pass capability of conventionally resonant
   controllers. With the implementation of proposed resonant controller,
   accurate power sharing and PCC harmonic voltage compensation are
   achieved without using any fundamental and harmonic components
   extractions. Experimental results from a scaled single-phase microgrid
   prototype are provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed
   virtual impedance control approach.}},

Abstract = {{Deposition of copper, silver and gold from aqueous solutions onto
   germanium substrates is studied in this work. For this purpose both
   acidic and alkaline solutions were used. All investigated metals can
   successfully be deposited via the galvanic displacement reaction. These
   deposits are porous and with different surface morphologies which
   depended on the type (p- or n-) of the Ge substrate used in the
   experiments and on pH. Prolonged times of immersion of Ge substrates
   into investigated solutions may lead to a formation of more porous
   coatings and even powders, as successfully demonstrated on the example

Abstract = {{Previously, we reported that Ag-ETS-10 can be used to separate air, and
   produce argon free oxygen. It was reported that high purity oxygen
   (99+\%) was generated using a bed of Ag-ETS-10 granules to separate air
   (78.0\% N-2, 21.0\% O-2, 1.0\% Ar) at 25 degrees C and 100 kPa, with an
   O-2 recovery larger than 30\%. In this study, a higher oxygen recovery
   was achieved by enhancing the capacity of the adsorbent material and by
   improving the packing efficiency of the adsorbent within the granules.
   The packing efficiency of the bed was increased through the combination
   of two different granule sizes. Here we report a lab scale demonstration
   of high purity oxygen (99+\%) production by adsorptive air separation
   (78.0\% N-2, 21.0\% O-2, 1.0\% Ar) with an O-2 recovery approaching
   40\%. Further improvements in oxygen recovery are possible due to the
   exceptional crystalline density of Ag-ETS-10 (similar to 3.84 g/cm(3)).

Title = {{Predictive correlations for ideal gas heat capacities of pure

Abstract = {{The development of continuous predictive correlations for the
   temperature dependence of the ideal gas heat capacity for hydrocarbons
   and substituted hydrocarbons valid over a wide range of elemental
   compositions (CHNOS), molecular structures, and temperatures
   (298.15-1500 K) is reported. The correlations are functions of
   temperature, elemental composition, and 10 (naphthenic hydrocarbons) or
   12 (aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons) universal coefficients. There
   are no compound specific coefficients. The variables are absolute
   temperature and a similarity variable, which possesses a value
   proportional to the number of atoms in a molecule, irrespective of their
   nature, divided by molecular mass. Different data sets obtained from the
   NIST TRC Ideal Gas Database 88 were used to evaluate parameters, and to
   test the predictive nature of the correlations. Detailed comparisons
   between predicted ideal gas heat capacities (c(p)(g0)) obtained in this
   work and values obtained using four Lee-Kesler correlations, and the
   Harrison-Seaton correlation are presented. The present correlations are
   shown to be preferred over these other options on the basis of accuracy
   and range of application for general-purpose calculations, unless the
   fluid assignment (naphthenic vs. aromatic/aliphatic) is unknown and
   c(p)(g0) values are only required at set temperatures available for the
   Harrison-Seaton correlation. In this latter case, the Harrison-Seaton
   correlation is preferred. For large molecules, the universal
   correlations presented in this work approach the accuracy of the
   benchmark Benson method. The universal correlations are well suited for
   the determination of ideal gas heat capacities of large and complex
   molecules or mixtures, where more precise structure-property group
   contribution correlations are difficult to apply or are inapplicable
   because groups present are not defined in the correlations or are
   unknown. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of pure fluid confined in a cone is investigated using
   thermodynamic stability analysis. Four situations are explained on the
   basis of the initial confined phase (liquid/vapor) and its pressure
   (above/below the saturation pressure). Thermodynamic stability analysis
   (a plot of the free energy of the system versus the size of the new
   potential phase) reveals whether the phase transition is possible and,
   if so, the number and type (unstable/metastable/stable) of equilibrium
   states in each of these situations. Moreover we investigated the effect
   of the equilibrium contact angle and the cone angle (equivalent to the
   confinement's surface separation distance) on the free energy (potential
   equilibrium states). The results are then compared to our previous study
   of pure fluid confined in the gap between a sphere and a flat plate and
   the gap between two flat plates! Confined fluid behavior of the four
   possible situations (for these three geometries) can be explained in a
   unified framework under two categories based on only the meniscus shape
   (concave/convex). For systems with bulk-phase pressure imposed by a
   reservoir, the stable coexistence of pure liquid and vapor is possible
   only when the meniscus is concave.}},

Abstract = {{Influence of nano-scale grain boundaries (GB) on the mechanical behavior
   and Bauschinger's effect in copper during cyclic loading, in comparison
   with those of Cu single crystal (SC) and Cu with nano-scale twin
   boundaries (TW), was computationally investigated employing the
   molecular dynamics simulation technique. It was shown that Bauschinger's
   effect in the nano-systems was gradually weakened in the following
   order: SC, GB and TW. The annihilation of dislocations or partial
   dislocations with opposite signs and the shrinkage/extension of
   associated stacking faults upon stress reversal were mainly responsible
   for Bauschinger's effect in the nano-copper systems. The cyclic loading
   process increased the failure strain of the GB, TW and SC systems.
   However, the increase in the failure strain was less profound in the GB
   and TW systems. This could be attributed to the fact that both the grain
   and twin boundaries can block the dislocation movement and stacking
   fault extension, resulting in higher stress concentration at the
   boundaries to promote failure. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Sit-to-stand transfer (STS) is a common yet critical prerequisite for
   many daily tasks. Literature conducted on healthy STS often assume the
   body to behave symmetrically across the left and right side; yet only a
   few studies have been conducted to investigate this supposition. These
   studies have focused on a single numerical indicator such as peak joint
   moment (JM) values to describe symmetricity; however, STS is a dynamic
   and time dependent movement. This study addresses the validity of peak
   value analyses through the introduction of a time based peak-offset
   measure and proposes two time-dependent techniques to further
   characterize asymmetry and assesses their feasibility in ten (10)
   healthy male participants. JM and joint power (JP) over the whole STS
   movement was determined using motion capture and inverse dynamics. Using
   a paired one-tailed t-test differences were found in the time at which
   the left and right side reached peak values in all lower extremity
   joints (p < 0.05) with exception of the hip JM. Using a measure of JM
   and JP straight-difference it was determined that the ankle joint
   displayed the largest number of JM and JP development strategies of all
   the lower extremity joints. Finally, through numerical integration of
   the JM and JP data with respect to time, it was found that the longer
   one side spends dominating the movement, the larger the excess angular
   impulse and work that can be expected from that side. The results
   suggest that when analyzing STS movements, one must be aware of the
   potential asymmetry present even in healthy movements. Furthermore, a
   simple peak JM or JP analysis may not fully describe the extent of these
   asymmetries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Multimodal neuroimaging of frontal white matter microstructure in early
   phase schizophrenia: the impact of early adolescent cannabis use}},
Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: A disturbance in connectivity between different brain
   regions, rather than abnormalities within the separate regions
   themselves, could be responsible for the clinical symptoms and cognitive
   dysfunctions observed in schizophrenia. White matter, which comprises
   axons and their myelin sheaths, provides the physical foundation for
   functional connectivity in the brain. Myelin sheaths are located around
   the axons and provide insulation through the lipid membranes of
   oligodendrocytes. Empirical data suggests oligodendroglial dysfunction
   in schizophrenia, based on findings of abnormal myelin maintenance and
   repair in regions of deep white matter. The aim of this in vivo
   neuroimaging project is to assess the impact of early adolescent onset
   of regular cannabis use on brain white matter tissue integrity, and to
   differentiate this impact from the white matter abnormalities associated
   with schizophrenia. The ultimate goal is to determine the liability of
   early adolescent use of cannabis on brain white matter, in a vulnerable
   brain.
   Methods/Design: Young adults with schizophrenia at the early stage of
   the illness (less than 5 years since diagnosis) will be the focus of
   this project. Four magnetic resonance imaging measurements will be used
   to assess different cellular aspects of white matter: a) diffusion
   tensor imaging, b) localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy with
   a focus on the neurochemical N-acetylaspartate, c) the transverse
   relaxation time constants of regional tissue water, d) and of
   N-acetylaspartate. These four neuroimaging indices will be assessed
   within the same brain region of interest, that is, a large white matter
   fibre bundle located in the frontal region, the left superior
   longitudinal fasciculus.
   Discussion: We will expand our knowledge regarding current theoretical
   models of schizophrenia with a more comprehensive multimodal
   neuroimaging approach to studying the underlying cellular abnormalities
   of white matter, while taking into consideration the important
   confounding variable of early adolescent onset of regular cannabis use.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional heterogeneous computational fluid dynamics model was
   developed and validated to study the mass, heat, and momentum transport
   in a fixed-bed cylindrical adsorber during the adsorption of volatile
   organic compounds (VOCs) from a gas stream onto a fixed bed of beaded
   activated carbon (BAC). Experimental validation tests revealed that the
   model predicted the breakthrough curves for the studied VOCs (acetone,
   benzene, toluene, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene) as well as the pressure
   drop and temperature during benzene adsorption with a mean relative
   absolute error of 2.6, 11.8, and 0.8\%, respectively. Effects of varying
   adsorption process variables such as carrier gas temperature,
   superficial velocity, VOC loading, particle size, and channelling were
   investigated. The results obtained from this study are encouraging
   because they show that the model was able to accurately simulate the
   transport processes in an adsorber and can potentially be used for
   enhancing absorber design and operation.}},

Title = {{On the weak dependence of water diffusivity on the degree of
   hydrophobicity of acetylated hydroxypropyl xylan}},
Journal = {{CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{We used molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to study the diffusion of
   water at low concentrations in a series of chemically modified xylans, a
   major hemicellulose, including hydroxypropyl xylan (HPX) and
   acetoxypropyl xylan (APX) which is essentially acetylated HPX, with
   different degrees of acetylation (i.e., different degrees of
   hydrophobicity) at 400 K, a temperature well above the glass transition
   temperatures of the materials. We used one HPX and three APX models. The
   three APX models were constructed using the HPX model by substituting 1,
   2 or 3 hydroxyl moieties on its repeating units, respectively.
   The simulation results showed that the diffusivity of water at low
   concentrations in the chemically modified xylans decreased slightly
   (similar to 20\%) from HPX to APX with 3 acetylated hydroxyl moieties, a
   trend that has been experimentally observed for xylans and other
   cellulosic type materials. Further data analysis shows that acetylation
   decreases the ability of the xylan to form hydrogen bonds with water and
   its degree of swelling. And these two factors exert opposite effects on
   the diffusivity of water. In particular, the first factor increases the
   mobility (lower activation energy) of the water molecules, while the
   second factor reduces the free volumes available for diffusion, thereby
   decreasing the water mobility. This finding implies that it is not
   likely to obtain orders of magnitude change to the water diffusivity
   simply by the acetylation of all hydroxyl moieties on xylan. The high
   degree of swelling observed for HPX compared to those of APXs is
   attributed to the fact that many hydrogen bonds in HPx are broken by
   water. It is interesting to note that water in most of the hydrogen
   bonds formed between water and xylans acted as hydrogen bond acceptors
   rather than donors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{159-172}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates a parameter estimation problem for batch
   processes through the maximum likelihood method. In batch processes, the
   initial state usually relates to the states of previous batches. The
   proposed algorithm takes batch-to-batch correlations into account by
   employing an initial state transition equation to model the dynamics
   along the batch dimension. By treating the unmeasured states and the
   parameters as hidden variables, the maximum likelihood estimation is
   accomplished through the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, where
   the smoothing for the terminal state and the filtering for the initial
   state are specially considered. Due to the nonlinearity and
   non-Gaussianity in the state space model, particle filtering methods are
   employed for the implementation of filtering and smoothing. Through
   alternating between the expectation step and the maximization step, the
   unknown parameters along with states are estimated. Simulation examples
   demonstrate the proposed estimation approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) textile composites have great potential
   applications to aircrafts and high speed vehicles because of the high
   strength/weight ratios and the capabilities of manufacturing complex,
   net-shape preforms. This paper reports the nonlinear viscoelastic
   responses and damage mechanisms of one kind of 3D textile composites,
   named as 3D orthogonal woven composite (3DOWC) under quasi-static
   tensile loading based on a micro/meso-scale repetitive unit cells (RUCs)
   model. In the RUCs model, the resin is described with a nonlinear
   viscoelastic material and the fibers/tows with an elastic material. The
   damage initiation and propagation in resin are simulated by the
   post-damage constitutive models with maximum principal theory failure
   criteria. The fibers/tows impregnated with resin are defined by elastic
   transverse-isotropic material model with ultimate strengths failure of
   `expanded smeared crack' both along and perpendicular to fibers/tows
   axis direction. The engineering parameters and ultimate strengths of
   homogenized fibers/tows filled with matrix in meso-RUCs model are
   transferred from the numerical analysis of the micro-RUCs. The results
   are compared with experimental and theoretical values of RUC deformation
   and damage initiation and propagation under monotonic axial loading. The
   methodology of establishing the nonlinear visco-elastic multi-scale
   model of 3D textile composites without introducing the real fabric
   architecture in finite element analyses is explained. With the
   multi-scale RUCs model, the mechanical behaviors of other kinds of 3D
   textile composites can also be predicted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Natural fibers are seeing increased use in composite applications due to
   their reduced cost, low density, and environmental benefits (more
   sustainable and lower carbon footprint). Although many natural fiber
   systems have been examined over the last decade, there have been
   relatively few studies which have compared a variety of fiber types and
   processing methods directly in the same experimental set. In this study,
   natural fiber composites made from low density polyethylene (LDPE) and a
   variety of Canadian based fiber feedstocks were examined including hemp
   bast, flax bast, chemically pulped wood, wood chips, wheat straw, and
   mechanically pulped triticale. The effect of fiber type, fiber fraction
   and maleic anhydride polyethylene (MAPE) coupling agent on the
   mechanical properties and long-term moisture absorption behavior was
   quantified. In general, addition of natural fiber to LDPE results in an
   increase in modulus (stiffness) with a corresponding loss of material
   elongation and impact toughness. Of the fiber types tested, composites
   made from chemically pulped wood had the best mechanical properties and
   the least moisture absorption. However, the use of MAPE coupling agent
   was found to significantly increase the mechanical performance and
   reduce moisture absorption for all other natural fiber types. VC 2013

Abstract = {{Partitioning the universe of discourse and determining effective
   intervals are critical for forecasting in fuzzy time series. Equal
   length intervals used in most existing literatures are convenient but
   subjective to partition the universe of discourse. In this paper, we
   study how to partition the universe of discourse into intervals with
   unequal length to improve forecasting quality. First, we calculate the
   prototypes of data using fuzzy clustering, then form some subsets
   according to the prototypes. An unequal length partitioning method is
   proposed. We show that these intervals carry well-defined semantics. To
   verify the suitability and effectiveness of the approach, we apply the
   proposed method to forecast enrollment of students of Alabama University
   and Germany's DAX stock index monthly values. Empirical results show
   that the unequal length partitioning can greatly improve forecast
   accuracy. Further more, the proposed method is very robust and stable
   for forecasting in fuzzy time series. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Metal fiber sintered sheets (MFSSs) are a type of layered open cell
   porous materials and are transversely isotropic. Their stress-strain
   responses to uniaxial tension and compression and simple shear loading
   in different directions (i.e., in the in-plane and transverse
   directions) were measured. A set of characteristic stress and strain was
   defined and employed to formulate an elastoplastic constitutive model
   for the infinitesimal deformation of MFSSs subject to monotonic
   proportional loading. The elastoplastic potential in the constitutive
   model was calibrated with the measured stress-strain responses in terms
   of the defined characteristic stress and strain, without a need to know
   the yield surface and its evolution a priori. A successful application
   of the developed model to the multiaxial mechanical responses of MFSSs
   was demonstrated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we introduce a Fuzzy Time-dependent Project Scheduling
   Problem (FTPSP), in which activity duration times are represented in the
   form of fuzzy sets. The duration times are considered to be
   time-dependent as well. Under these circumstances, the resulting FTPSP
   becomes far more complex when compared with the existing project
   scheduling problems. The complexity stems from the fact of computing the
   completion time of the entire project, a core issue when dealing with
   project scheduling. problems. We first elaborate on the difficulties
   with the computing of the completion time. Subsequently, we develop a
   computational formula for estimating the overall completion time of
   FTPSP. Next, we formulate the FTPSP and propose three fuzzy programming
   models to address various requirements arising within this framework.
   The proposed models are handled through techniques that combine
   mechanisms of fuzzy simulation and genetic optimization. In this
   setting, fuzzy simulation is exploited to estimate the value of
   uncertain functions that do not exist in conventional certain project
   scheduling problems. Numerical experiments are included to illustrate
   the effectiveness of the algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Interaction Mechanism between Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Surfaces:
   Using Polystyrene and Mica as a Model System}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules,
   particles, or surfaces occur in many biological phenomena and industrial
   processes. In this work, polystyrene (PS) and mica were chosen as a
   model system to investigate the interaction mechanism between
   hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. Using a surface forces apparatus
   (SFA) coupled with a top-view optical microscope, interaction forces
   between PS and mica surfaces were directly probed in five different
   electrolyte solutions (i.e., NaCl, CaCl2, NaOH, HCI, and CH3COOH) of
   various concentrations. Long-range repulsion was observed in low
   electrolyte concentration (e.g., 0.001 M) which was mainly due to the
   presence of microscopic and submicroscopic bubbles on PS surface. A
   modified Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory well fits the
   interaction forces by taking into account the effect of bubbles on PS
   surface. The range of the repulsion was dramatically reduced in 1.0 M
   solutions of NaCl, CaCl2., and NaOH but did not significantly change in
   1.0 M HCI and CH3COOH, which was due to ion specificity effect on the
   formation and stability of bubbles on PS surface. The range of repulsion
   was also significantly reduced to <20 nm in degassed electrolyte
   solutions. UV-ozone treatment changed the hydrophobic attraction of the
   untreated PS-PS system to pure repulsion between untreated PS and
   treated PS, demonstrating the important role of surface hydrophobicity
   on the formation and stability of bubbles on substrates. Our results
   indicate that DLVO forces dominate the interaction between hydrophilic
   surface (i.e., mica) and hydrophobic polymer (i.e., PS), while the types
   of electrolytes (ion specificity), electrolyte concentration, degassing,
   and surface hydrophobicity can significantly affect the formation and
   stability of bubbles on the interacting surfaces, thus affecting the
   range and magnitude of the interaction forces.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Thiophosphorous compounds: diisobutyl dithiophosphate (DIBDTPA),
   diisobutyl dithiophosphinate (DIBDTPI), diisobutyl monothiophosphate
   (DIBMTPA) and diisobutyl monothiophosphinate (DIBMTPI) are widely used
   as flotation collectors and corrosion inhibitors, though the true nature
   of their bonding mechanisms to solid surfaces is still unclear. Using
   density functional theory (OFT) calculations, this study investigates
   the structure-reactivity relationship of these thiophosphorus molecules
   as flotation collectors with sulfide minerals. The results indicate that
   the 0 atom(s) bonded to the P atom in thiophosphorus molecules can
   significantly impact the chemical reactivity of the S atom(s) in the
   four reagents, and for DIBMTPA and DIBMTPI, they could even attend the
   chemical bond formation with metal atoms. The reactive power of the four
   compounds to mineral surfaces of Cu, Au, Ag and Pb sulfides is predicted
   to be DIBDTPI >> DIBMTPI >= DIBDTPA > DIBMTPA, and their flotation
   selectivity against pyrite and sphalerite is suggested as DIBDTPA <
   DIBDTPI < DIBMTPI < DIBMTPA. Moreover, the thione form of acid or ion
   species of DIBMTPA or DIBMTPI is more stable than its thiol form, and in
   aqueous phases, the ionized thione of the four thiophosphorus collectors
   exhibits the strongest affinity to mineral surfaces. The theoretical
   results provide an atomic level understanding of the adsorption activity
   and selectivity of the four thiophosphorus molecules to metal sulfide
   minerals and a potential approach to molecular design of new
   thiophosphorous compounds for improving the flotation recovery of them.

Abstract = {{In situ scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) was applied for the
   first time to study the copper activation and subsequent xanthate
   adsorption on sphalerite. The corresponding surface compositions were
   analyzed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS)
   and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The probe approach curve
   (PAC) using SECM shows that unactivated and activated sphalerite
   surfaces have negative current feedback and partially positive current
   feedback, respectively, suggesting that CuxS is formed on the sphalerite
   after copper activation. The copper activation of sphalerite strongly
   depends on the surface heterogeneity (e.g., presence of polishing
   defects, chemical composition), impacting the subsequent xanthate
   adsorption process. The SECM, ToF-SIMS, and XPS analyses show that
   during the copper activation the polishing defects, which have high
   excess surface energy, tend to consume more copper ions, resulting in
   Cu-rich regions by forming CuS-like species, while Fe oxide/hydroxide
   forms at Fe-rich regions. The XPS spectra further confirm that the
   CuS-like species involve Cu(I) and S(-I). The SECM imaging shows that
   after xanthate adsorption the current response at the Cu-rich regions
   decreases because of the formation of cuprous xanthate (CuX) and
   dixanthogen (X-2) while increases at the Fe-rich regions mainly due to
   the chemisorption of xanthate on Fe oxide/hydroxide. Our results shed
   light on the fundamental understanding of the electrochemical processes
   on sphalerite surface associated with its copper activation and
   subsequent xanthate adsorption in flotation.}},

Abstract = {{FTIR, XPS and zeta potential measurements were performed on pyrochlore
   and calcite to study the adsorption mechanisms of sodium
   hexametaphosphate (NaHMP). While no hexametaphosphate could be detected
   on the FTIR spectra of NaHMP treated pyrochlore or calcite, the observed
   chemical shifts of the binding energies of Ca 2p(5/2) (0.25 eV) and P 2p
   (0.20 eV) electrons indicated that the hexametaphosphate groups formed a
   complex with calcium on calcite. The complex seemed soluble in water
   leaving a low concentration of its residue on calcite surface after
   water washing, thus undetectable by FTIR. The binding energy shifts of
   Nb 3d(5/2) (0.13 eV) and Ca 2p(5/2) (0.10 eV) electrons on NaHMP-treated
   pyrochlore were within instrumental resolution, therefore, NaHMP was not
   strongly bound to pyrochlore. The zeta potentials of pyrochlore and
   calcite were both lowered in the presence of NaHMP. However, for
   pyrochlore, the zeta potential drop occurred mainly in the acidic pH
   range, while the drop for calcite was independent of pH, indicating
   possible chemisorption of NaHMP on calcite. The work explained the
   selective depressive function of NaHMP in the hydroxamic acid flotation
   of carbonatite niobium ores.}},

Title = {{Optimization of Steam-Over-Solvent Injection in Fractured Reservoirs
   (SOS-FR) method using hybrid techniques: Testing cyclic injection case}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{110}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Many processes and techniques have been proposed to improve the heavy
   oil recovery from fractured reservoirs. Such complex processes require
   careful design to achieve optimal efficiency with minimal costs and
   environmental impacts. Steam injection is one of the options for
   heavy-oil recovery from fractured reservoirs but significant steam
   requirement for effective matrix heating due to heterogeneous structure
   poses important challenges in terms of cost, water availability, and
   environment impacts due to water processing and steam generation.
   Al-Bahlani and Babadagli (2008, 2009a) proposed a new process called
   Steam-Over-Solvent in Fractured Reservoirs (SOS-FR) by adding solvent
   component to minimize the heat needed. The SOS-FR technique consists of
   a heating phase using steam injection, subsequent solvent injection, and
   low temperature steam injection for solvent retrieval and additional oil
   recovery. Optimization of this process is a critical step to determine
   optimal injection (and soaking) schedules as the heterogeneous structure
   of this kind of reservoirs may easily yield an inefficient process due
   to high cost and excessive use of steam and solvent. In this study, we
   adopted a global optimization scheme, where genetic algorithm is
   integrated with orthogonal arrays and response surface proxies for
   better convergence behavior and higher computational efficiency, to
   optimize the SOS-FR process for cyclic injection option. The results
   show that one may be able to double the profit obtained with the
   benchmark model using the optimal injection scheme suggested by our
   optimization procedure. The results are valid for models with low
   fracture density; further work should be performed using models with
   high fracture density and that the fracture orientation is not in the
   direction of the injector to the producer. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Hydrocarbon solvent injection into preheated reservoirs has been
   suggested as an alternative to sole injection of steam or solvent for
   heavy-oil recovery. But, this is a highly pressure and temperature
   sensitive process. This paper investigates this process through a
   numerical modeling exercise and formulates the optimal pressure and
   temperature conditions for maximized recovery and minimized asphaltene
   precipitation.
   We first report the results of numerical simulation of laboratory
   experiments, in which heavy-oil was exposed to solvent vapor at high
   temperatures. To achieve these results, a radial 3D numerical model of
   15 x 1 x 48 cells was constructed using a commercial numeric simulator.
   The injection of either propane or butane into sand packs or
   consolidated sandstones at elevated temperatures was simulated. A
   pressure-temperature sensitivity analysis was carried out for different
   core sizes to understand the dynamics of the gravity drainage process
   associated with asphaltene precipitation. Asphaltene pore plugging
   behavior was modeled and diffusion of solvent into the heavy-oil was
   analyzed to determine both ideal solvent type and optimal operating
   conditions for propane or butane injection in a temperature range of
   52-112 degrees C.
   Our results and observations showed that the solvent should be in the
   gas phase and its sensitivity to temperature and sample height (for
   effective gravity drainage) is more critical than the pressure. There
   also exists a critical temperature that yields a maximum recovery and
   this value was determined for the rock/reservoir types and solvents
   considered in this study. Solvents considered, i.e., propane and butane,
   behaved differently in terms of asphaltene precipitation and its effects
   on ultimate recovery. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an erasure multi-way relay channel (EMWRC) in which several
   users share their data through a relay over erasure links. Assuming no
   feedback channel between the users and the relay, we first identify the
   challenges for designing a data sharing scheme over an EMWRC. Then, to
   overcome these challenges, we propose practical low-latency and
   low-complexity data sharing schemes based on fountain coding. Later, we
   introduce the notion of end-to-end erasure rate (EEER) and analytically
   derive it for the proposed schemes. EEER is then used to calculate the
   achievable rate and transmission overhead of the proposed schemes. Using
   EEER and computer simulations, the achievable rates and transmission
   overhead of our proposed schemes are compared with the ones of one-way
   relaying. This comparison implies that when the number of users and the
   channel erasure rates are not large, our proposed schemes outperform
   one-way relaying. We also find an upper bound on the achievable rates of
   EMWRC and observe that depending on the number of users and channel
   erasure rates, our proposed solutions can perform very close to this
   bound.}},

Abstract = {{The indentation of small size soft particles is a widely used technique
   to evaluate the mechanical properties of such particles. In this paper,
   the particle is modeled as an inflated fluid-filled membrane structure.
   The proposed model is used to study the nonlinear deformations of the
   particle. We assume that the peripheral surface is a nonlinear
   hyperelastic, homogeneous and isotropic membrane, while the enclose
   fluid is incompressible. The particle is indented by frictionless rigid
   conical indenters, while supported by a flat plane. The equilibrium
   configurations are solved numerically to study the mechanical response
   of the particle. The indenter force, enclosed fluid pressure and stress
   distribution in the membrane are determined for various indenter shapes
   and initial inflations. This study provides a better understanding of
   the magnitude and location of the maximum stress in the membrane during
   indentation. The dependency of the indention force and fluid pressure on
   the material properties of the particle are also investigated. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose a distributed moving horizon state estimation
   (DMHE) design for a class of nonlinear systems with bounded output
   measurement noise and process disturbances. Specifically, we consider a
   class of nonlinear systems that are composed of several subsystems and
   the subsystems interact with each other via their subsystem states.
   First, a distributed estimation algorithm is designed which specifies
   the information exchange protocol between the subsystems and the
   implementation strategy of the DMHE. Subsequently, a local moving
   horizon estimation (MHE) scheme is designed for each subsystem. In the
   design of each subsystem MHE, an auxiliary nonlinear deterministic
   observer that can asymptotically track the corresponding nominal
   subsystem state when the subsystem interactions are absent is taken
   advantage of. For each subsystem, the nonlinear deterministic observer
   together with an error correction term is used to calculate a confidence
   region for the subsystem state every sampling time. Within the
   confidence region, the subsystem MHE is allowed to optimize its
   estimate. The proposed DMHE scheme is proved to give bounded estimation
   errors. It is also possible to tune the convergence rate of the state
   estimate given by the DMHE to the actual system state. The performance
   of the proposed DMHE is illustrated via the application to a
   reactor-separator process example. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study aims to present a fault detection and isolation (FDI)
   framework based on the marginalized likelihood ratio (MLR) approach
   using uniform priors for fault magnitudes in sensors and actuators. The
   existing methods in the literature use either flat priors with infinite
   support or the Gamma distribution as priors for the fault magnitudes. In
   the current study, it is assumed that the fault magnitude is a
   realization of a uniform prior with known upper and lower limits. The
   method presented in this study performs detection of time of occurrence
   of the fault and isolation of the fault type simultaneously while the
   estimation of the fault magnitude is achieved using a least squares
   based approach. The newly proposed method is evaluated by application to
   a benchmark CSTR problem using Monte Carlo simulations and the results
   reveal that this method can estimate the time of occurrence of the fault
   and the fault magnitude more accurately compared to a generalized
   likelihood ratio (GLR) based approach applied to the same benchmark
   problem. Simulation results on a benchmark problem also show
   significantly lower misclassification rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Low-rank coals are widely used as fuel in coal-fired power plants.
   However, feeding such a coal in addition to lower efficiency generates a
   variety of problems mostly associated with the ash-forming minerals. An
   efficient dry coal cleaning method can offer a solution while avoiding
   problems associated with wet methods and generates partially dried coal.
   Air dense medium fluidized bed (ADMFB) can be an efficient and
   economical dry ash removal technology, but the comprehensive
   understanding on its performance is not yet openly available. In the
   present work, a detail study of the factors affecting the beneficiation
   of a low-ash lignite coal using ADMFB is provided. Response surface
   methodology supported by a central composite experiment design method is
   employed to study the effect of superficial air velocity (V), residence
   time (T), and bed height (H) on the performance of a batch ADMFB
   separator at three levels. Also, the effects of sample weights and
   particle size of lignite coal are separately studied. The system was
   found to effectively decrease the ash content of the clean coal product.
   The organic material recovery to clean coal product was affected
   negatively by H, V, and T, while T, H, and V were found to affect the
   separation efficiency positively. Various levels of interactions between
   parameters were also revealed and discussed. The optimum operating
   condition for maximizing the recovery was found to be 15 cm/s, 90 s, and
   15 cm for V, T, and H, respectively. This condition led to a clean coal
   ash content, recovery, and separation efficiency of 10.6, 95.63, and
   15.29\%, respectively. The beneficiation test results also revealed that
   higher ash removal (23\%) and recoveries (86\%) are obtainable for
   coarser coal particles. Higher recovery and separation efficiency are
   achievable for larger sample weights (84.6 and 30.7\%, respectively).}},

Abstract = {{Low-rank coals are widely used as fuel in coal-fired power plants.
   Continuing the use of these fuels is under huge pressure because of
   stringent environmental regulations. The air dense medium fluidized bed
   (ADMFB), which is a dry physical coal beneficiation method, can offer an
   efficient and economical solution for ash removal. The performance of
   the ADMFB separator in preparing higher quality coals has been studied
   by detailed characterization of the ADMFB clean coal products with
   minimum ash content, maximum organic material recovery, or different
   feed particle sizes in the present work. The percentage of ash removal
   for the selected samples with particle size of 1-13.2 mm was between 9
   and 22\% with respect to the feed sample. An increase of all CHNS
   components and higher heating value (HHV), regardless of the coal
   particle size, and a very efficient mercury rejection of between 33.7
   and 48.6\% were observed for most of the beneficiated samples.
   Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis confirmed
   the decrease of most of the hazardous elements, such as Pb, Ag, Ba, Cu,
   Mn, Be, and K, indicating a positive affinity of these elements with the
   ash-forming minerals of the coal. Some elements, such as As, Se, and Sb,
   exhibited inconsistent results, which indicates various degrees of
   organic bonding for these elements. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis of
   the ashes of the beneficiated coals revealed different decreasing levels
   of Si, Al, and Mg oxides (main components of clay minerals) and an
   increase of Na, Ca, and Fe oxides. Lower viscosities, a lower reducing
   ash fusion temperature (< similar to 1250 degrees C), and consequently,
   an increased slagging propensity based on a number of simple slagging
   indices for beneficiated products were obtained. The change in the
   reactivity of the clean coal products was discussed on the basis of the
   maximum rate of weight loss (R-max) and the peak temperature (T-max)
   obtained by differential thermogravimetry (DTG). The fine and middle
   size beneficiated samples showed various degrees of reactivity
   improvement. R-max for the middle size was found to increase by at least
   84.5\%, and T-max for the same was found to decrease by at least 62
   degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{The dissolved oxygen concentration is an important index of water
   quality, and the atmosphere is one of the important sources of the
   dissolved oxygen. In this paper, the mass conservation law and the
   dimensional analysis method are employed to study the oxygen transfer
   under regular and non-breaking waves, and a unified oxygen transfer
   coefficient equation is obtained with consideration of the effect of
   kinetic energy and wave period. An oxygen transfer experiment for the
   intermediate depth water wave is performed to measure the wave
   parameters and the dissolved oxygen concentration. The experimental data
   and the least squares method are used to determine the constant in the
   oxygen transfer coefficient equation. The experimental data and the
   previous reported data are also used to further validate the oxygen
   transfer coefficient, and the agreement is satisfactory. The unified
   equation shows that the oxygen transfer coefficient increases with the
   increase of a parameter coupled with the wave height and the wave
   length, but it decreases with the increase of the wave period, which has
   a much greater influence on the oxygen transfer coefficient than the
   coupled parameter.}},

Abstract = {{Different-sized silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were functionalized by
   pH-responsive poly(2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDP) via
   surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The
   functionalized PDP-SiNPs were used to coat glass surfaces, polymeric
   nanofibers, and paper via simple coating methods such as dip, cast, and
   spray coating. A PDP-SiNPs mixture having different sizes was found to
   change the surface properties of the substrates remarkably, compared to
   one containing PDP-SiNPs with uniform sizes. High surface roughness was
   achieved with very little coating materials, which is beneficial from an
   economical point of view. Moreover, adsorption/desorption of PDP-SiNPs
   onto/from the substrates could be controlled by changing solution pH due
   to the protonation/deprotonation of the PDP. The surface properties of
   the coated substrates were analyzed by contact angle (CA) measurement,
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM). This inexpensive system provides a simple, quick, and effective

Abstract = {{Gecko-inspired surfaces are smart dry adhesive surfaces that have

   fabricated to successfully pick up and release light and fragile objects
   with a smooth upper surface, such as a silicon wafer. These results

Abstract = {{Nonspecific adsorption of proteins on biomaterial surfaces challenges
   the widespread application of engineered materials, and understanding
   the impact of secondary structure of proteins and peptides on their
   adsorption process is of both fundamental and practical importance in
   bioengineering. In this work, poly-L-lysine (PLL)-based alpha-helices
   and beta-sheets were chosen as a model system to investigate the effect
   of secondary structure on peptide interactions with substrates of
   various surface chemistries. Circular dichroism (CD) was used to confirm
   the presence of both alpha-helix and beta-sheet structured PLL in
   aqueous solutions and upon adsorption to quartz, where these secondary
   structures seemed to be preserved. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging
   showed different surface patterns for adsorbed alpha-helix and
   beta-sheet PLL. Interactions between PLL of different secondary
   structures and various substrates (i.e., PLL, Au, mica, and
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)) were directly measured using a surface
   forces apparatus (SFA). It was found that beta-sheet PLL films showed
   higher adsorbed layer thicknesses in general. Adhesion energies of
   beta-sheet versus Au and beta-sheet versus beta-sheet were considerably
   higher than that of alpha-helix versus Au and alpha-helix versus
   alpha-helix systems, respectively. Au and beta-sheet PLL interactions
   seemed to be more dependent on the salt concentration than that of
   alpha-helix, while the presence of a grafted PEG layer greatly
   diminished any attraction with either PLL structure. The molecular
   interaction mechanism of peptide in different secondary structures is
   discussed in terms of Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory,
   Alexander-de Gennes (AdG) steric model and hydrogen bonding, which
   provides important insight into the fundamental understanding of the
   interaction mechanism between proteins and biomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{The posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) derived in {[}1] provides a
   bound on the mean square error (MSE) obtained with any nonlinear state
   filter. Computing the PCRLB involves solving complex, multi-dimensional
   expectations, which do not lend themselves to an easy analytical
   solution. Furthermore, any attempt to approximate it using numerical or
   simulation-based approaches require a priori access to the true states,
   which may not be available, except in simulations or in carefully
   designed experiments. To allow recursive approximation of the PCRLB when
   the states are hidden or unmeasured, a new approach based on sequential
   Monte-Carlo (SMC) or particle filters (PFs) is proposed. The approach
   uses SMC methods to estimate the hidden states using a sequence of the
   available sensor measurements. The developed method is general and can
   be used to approximate the PCRLB in nonlinear systems with non-Gaussian
   state and sensor noise. The efficacy of the developed method is
   illustrated on two simulation examples, including a practical problem of
   ballistic target tracking at reentry phase.}},

Title = {{Structural Identification for Performance Prediction Considering
   Uncertainties: Case Study of a Movable Bridge}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{10, SI}},
Pages = {{1703-1715}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Structural identification (St-Id) can be described simply as estimating
   the properties of a structural system based on a correlation of inputs
   and outputs for decision making. For a complete St-Id process,
   establishing the decision-making needs, developing analytical and
   numerical models, and conducting field measurements, along with
   parameter identification using the experimental data for model
   calibration, are carried out. One important consideration is evaluation
   of the limitations and adequacy of using a single calibrated model
   before leveraging it for decision making, such as the reliability of the
   structural system for the remainder of its design life. The
   uncertainties in the data collected, determined by means of intermittent
   testing or monitoring; the limitations of the models; and the
   nonstationary nature of structural behavior need to be considered. These
   uncertainties can be incorporated by using of a family of parent and
   offspring models. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the use
   of a family of models that incorporates the uncertainties and makes
   predictions in terms of load rating and system-level reliability with
   the help of structural health monitoring (SHM) data. First, a
   finite-element (FE) model of a movable bridge is calibrated with SHM
   data, and parent FE models are created to best represent the
   measurements. At the same time, uncertainties in critical structural
   parameters such as boundary conditions are considered by offspring
   models. The family-of-models approach is employed to estimate load
   rating and system reliability by considering the probability of failure
   of the system with different correlations among the safety margins of
   the components. Finally, future performance of the movable bridge in the
   case of damage and deterioration is estimated for demonstration of
   structural identification for performance prediction by considering
   uncertainties. Such results are expected to provide a set of solutions
   for the performance of a structure for optimal decision making.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal regulation problem for a lithium ion (Li-ion) battery with
   boundary control actuation is considered. The model of the transient
   temperature dynamics of the battery is given by a nonhomogeneous
   parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) on a two-dimensional
   spatial domain which accounts for the time-varying heat generation
   during the battery discharge cycle. The spatial domain is given as a
   disk with radial and angular coordinates which captures the nonradially
   symmetric heat-transfer phenomena due to the application of the control
   input along a portion of the spatial domain boundary. The Li-ion battery
   model is formulated within an appropriately defined infinite-dimensional
   function space setting which is suitable for spectral controller
   synthesis. The key challenges in the output feedback model-based
   controller design addressed in this work are: the dependence of the
   state on time-varying system parameters, the restriction of the input
   along a portion of the battery domain boundary, the observer-based
   optimal boundary control design where the separation principle is
   utilized to demonstrate the stability of the closed loop system, and the
   realization of the outback feedback control problem based on state
   measurement and interpolation of the temperature field. Numerical
   results for simulation case studies are presented. (c) 2013 American

Abstract = {{The significant progress made in understanding the role of carbohydrates
   and carbohydrates based therapeutics at molecular level has highlighted
   the importance of carbohydrate bioconjugates in the field of biology,
   chemistry and therapeutics. The glycosylation of biomolecules is a
   nature-inspired approach, to impart structural and functional properties
   to the biomolecules. The availability of facile techniques to synthesize
   well-defined glycopolymers of varying molecular weights, compositions
   and shape and their facile conjugation with biomolecules of interest
   have helped researchers in understanding many aspects of their
   biological functions at the molecular level. This review focuses on the
   development of glycopolymer-bioconjugates and provides a comprehensive
   overview of the present bioconjugation tools for their synthesis. The
   glycosylation of biomolecules is achieved by either pre or
   post-polymerization modification approaches. The review high-lights the
   potential of living radical polymerization for the facile synthesis of
   glycopolymer bioconjugates using both pre and post-polymerization
   bioconjugation approaches, and without disrupting the native structure
   and functions of the biological molecules. Non-covalent
   carbohydrate-carbohydrate and carbohydrate-protein interactions play a
   significant role in many biological and pathological events. The
   non-covalent interactions of synthetic glycopolymers with biomolecules
   are also discussed in this review. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The existing methods of determining an alpha-cut of a fuzzy set to
   construct its underlying shadowed set do not fully comply with the
   concept of shadowed sets, namely, a retention of the total amount of
   fuzziness and its localized redistribution throughout a universe of
   discourse. Moreover, no closed formula to calculate the corresponding
   alpha-cut is available. This paper proposes analytical formulas to
   calculate threshold values required in the construction of shadowed
   sets. We introduce a new algorithm to design a shadowed set from a given
   fuzzy set. The proposed algorithm, which adheres to the main premise of
   shadowed sets of capturing the essence of fuzzy sets, helps localize
   fuzziness present in a given fuzzy set. We represent the fuzziness of a
   fuzzy set as a gradual number. Through defuzzification of the gradual
   number of fuzziness, we determine the required threshold (i.e., some
   alpha-cut) used in the formation of the shadowed set. We show that the
   shadowed set obtained in this way comes with a measure of fuzziness that
   is equal to the one characterizing the original fuzzy set.}},

Abstract = {{A class of clustering problems that is studied here is concerned with
   the development of a structure of a global nature given a collection of
   structures (clusters) constructed locally for data that are represented
   by several collections (blocks) of features. These blocks of features
   come with a well-defined semantics. For instance, in spatiotemporal
   data, a certain block of features concerns a spatial component of the
   data (say, x-y or x-y-z coordinates), while another one deals with the
   features that describe time series associated with the corresponding
   locations. The results of clustering that are being produced locally are
   reconciled by minimizing a distance between the proximity matrices that
   are formed at the higher conceptual level and induced by the individual
   partition matrices. The optimization problem is formulated and presented
   along with its iterative scheme.}},

Title = {{Automated Method for Checking Crane Paths for Heavy Lifts in Industrial
   Projects}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{At present, industrial projects are constructed primarily using a
   prefabricated approach. The modules are produced in an off-site facility
   and transported on transport trailers to the construction site where
   they are lifted by mobile cranes. One of the keys to the success of
   modular industrial projects is efficient crane planning, which includes
   path checking to find whether or not a crane has a feasible path through
   which to lift a module over obstructions in a congested plant. However,
   due to the large number of lifts, the manual path-checking practice is
   quite tedious and prone to error. In light of this problem, this paper
   proposes a methodology for automatically checking the lift paths for
   industrial projects. The proposed methodology simplifies and represents
   the three-dimensional site layout using project elevations. For each
   elevation, the crane feasible operation range (CFOR) is calculated based
   on the crane's capacity and clearances, as well as site constraints. The
   pick area (PA) is calculated by subtracting the ground obstruction areas
   from the CFOR. The relative positions of the module's set point, the
   CFOR, and the PA are checked to determine the feasibility of the lift
   path on each elevation, as well as the project elevation combination.
   This approach has been fully automated for path checking of entire
   sites, and the results are responsive to site changes over time as a
   project progresses. This proposed methodology is generic and thus can be
   easily applied to check lift paths for entire industrial plants or
   similar projects.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{WorkFace Planning (WFP) is a construction industry best practice aimed
   at improving productivity on industrial construction projects. It is now
   a common requirement in the construction contracts of industrial
   projects in Alberta. Since its debut, the implementation of WFP in
   different project contexts has not been formally studied. Construction
   project contexts differ greatly and have an impact on the effectiveness
   of implementation of any industry standard procedure. The purpose of
   this paper is to present a framework for identifying the context
   variables that warrant changes to the industry standard WFP procedures
   and to illustrate how these variables require the adaptation of WFP
   within an organization and on a project. The framework is illustrated
   with a case study of an organization and a project, which found that
   modifications to the standard WFP procedures were made at both the
   organization and project levels during implementation, based on certain
   organization and project characteristics. These modifications to the
   standard WFP procedures, coupled with the organization and project
   characteristics identified, are of value to the future implementation of
   WFP in specific contexts. Furthermore, the methodology used in this
   study to investigate the adaptation of WFP is useful in studying the
   adaptation of other industry best practices for different construction
   contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Iron pyrite is a promising material for photovoltaic power production
   due to low material extraction and processing costs and high optical
   absorption. Reliable production of photovoltaic grade iron pyrite thin
   films has, however, been challenging. One potential fabrication route is
   the direct conversion of iron-to-iron pyrite by sulfur annealing
   (sulfurization). Bulk iron thin films are used typically but they can
   suffer from cracking or delamination. Herein we report the sulfurization
   of porous, columnar Fe films deposited with Glancing Angle Deposition
   (GLAD), which allows us to control the inter-column spacing
   (voidfraction) of the precursor film. We show that the morphology and
   microstructure of the iron pyrite films are strongly affected by the
   void-fraction. By precisely tuning the void-fraction of the precursor
   film at 82 degrees oblique angle incidence deposition we can produce
   iron pyrite films with increased crystallite sizes > 100 nm with a
   uniform, crack-free, facetted granular microstructure. Large
   crystallites may reduce carrier recombination at grain boundaries, which
   is attractive for photovoltaic devices. Further increasing the
   void-fraction produces a columnar iron pyrite structure. We also report
   composition, electrical and optical characterization including a 27 ps
   lifetime of photocarriers measured with ultrafast opticalpump/THz-probe.
   Structured, porous precursors offer an alternate route to control
   microstructure and film stress during fabrication of iron pyrite thin
   films. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Evoked autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity may be an important
   modulator of rapid reactions, generated in the face of urgency and may
   serve to augment the parallel somatosensory processing to adjust speed
   of processing. The primary objective of the current study was to
   temporally pair auditory stimuli with whole body perturbations to
   determine if conditioning could `prime' the central nervous system (CNS)
   to respond faster and with greater ANS reactivity to the auditory
   stimulus alone. Healthy young participants (n = 19) were seated in a
   custom chair, which tilted backwards upon the release of an
   electromagnet and were instructed to reach to grasp a handle located in
   front of their arm as fast as possible following an auditory cue. Three
   conditions were completed in the following order: (1) baseline-auditory
   cue alone (5 trials); (2) paired-auditory cue, followed by a chair tilt
   110 ms later (20 trials); and (3) post-pairing-auditory cue alone (5
   trials). Participants were not informed of the switch from paired to
   auditory-only stimuli in the first trial of the post-pairing task
   condition. Reaction time was measured using electromyography, and
   autonomic nervous system activity was monitored via the electrodermal
   response (EDR). The first trial post-pairing had significantly faster
   reaction time (Delta = 21 ms) and significantly greater EDR amplitude
   compared to the last trial prior to pairing (baseline). The amplitude of
   contraction and overall time to handle contact were not significantly
   different between the first trial post-pairing and the last trial prior
   to pairing. This study demonstrates that the CNS can be `primed' to
   generate rapid reactions and an elevated autonomic response in the
   absence of whole body instability. This indicates that afferent volume
   generated following whole body instability is not the only determinant
   of rapid reactions and emphasizes the importance of physiologic measures
   of autonomic activity with respect to stimulus-evoked reaction time.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical interaction between the cell and its extracellular matrix
   (ECM) regulates cellular behaviors, including proliferation,
   differentiation, adhesion, and migration. Cells require the
   three-dimensional (3D) architectural support of the ECM to perform
   physiologically realistic functions. However, current understanding of
   cell-ECM and cell-cell mechanical interactions is largely derived from
   2D cell traction force microscopy, in which cells are cultured on a flat
   substrate. 3D cell traction microscopy is emerging for mapping traction
   fields of single animal cells embedded in either synthetic or natively
   derived fibrous gels. We discuss here the development of 3D cell
   traction microscopy, its current limitations, and perspectives on the
   future of this technology. Emphasis is placed on strategies for applying

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report the development of a flexible base array of
   penetrating electrodes which can be used to interface with the spinal
   cord. A customizable and feasible fabrication protocol is described. The
   flexible base arrays were fabricated and implanted into surrogate cords
   which were elongated by 12\%. The resulting strains were optically
   measured across the cord and compared to those associated with two types
   of electrodes arrays (one without a base and one with a rigid base
   connecting the electrodes). The deformation behavior of cords implanted
   with the flexible base arrays resembled the behavior of cords implanted
   with individual microwires that were not connected through a base. The
   results of the strain test were used to validate a 2-D finite element
   model. The validated model was used to assess the stresses induced by
   the electrodes of the three types of arrays on the cord, and to examine
   how various design parameters (thickness, base modulus, etc.,) impact
   the mechanical behavior of the electrode array. Rigid base arrays
   induced higher stresses on the cord than the flexible base arrays which
   in turn imposed higher stresses than the individual microwire implants.
   The developed flexible base array showed improvement over the rigid base
   array; however, its stiffness needs to be further reduced to emulate the
   mechanical behavior of individual microwire arrays without a base.}},

Title = {{Deposition modeling of hygroscopic saline aerosols in the human
   respiratory tract: Comparison between air and helium-oxygen as carrier
   gases}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{81-93}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{When hygroscopic aerosols are inspired, the size and temperature of the
   dispersed droplets, as well as the temperature and moisture content of
   the carrier gas may change due to heat and mass transfer between the
   dispersed phase and the gas, and also between the gas and the airway
   walls. This two-way coupled problem is numerically analyzed, with the
   focus on the effect of using helium-oxygen instead of air as the carrier
   gas on hygroscopic size changes and deposition of aqueous solution
   aerosols. Coefficients of heat and mass transfer in each generation of
   an idealized respiratory tract are specified based on realistic
   assumptions. Aerosols of initially isotonic droplets are considered.
   Differential equations of heat and mass transfer for both the continuous
   and dispersed phases are numerically solved to simulate the evaporation
   and condensation. Once the droplet sizes are determined in each
   respiratory tract generation, deposition is estimated based on existing
   correlations for stable particles. The results include regional
   deposition, in percentage of inhaled NaCl, for both helium-oxygen and
   air for a variety of size distributions: MMD between 2.5 and 8.5 pm and
   GSD of 1.7. Moreover, the size and temperature variations of the
   droplets as well as the temperature and humidity variations of the
   carrier gas are reported. To investigate the impact on deposition caused
   by hygroscopic size changes, the hygroscopic effectiveness is defined,
   which specifies the differences in He-O-2 and air deposition caused by
   hygroscopic size changes. The results, in general, suggest that the
   lowest deposition fraction in the extra-thoracic region and the highest
   deposition fraction in the alveolar region correspond to droplets with
   low mass fraction, inspired with helium-oxygen. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Real-time control of walking using recordings from dorsal root ganglia}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective. The goal of this study was to decode sensory information from
   the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in real time, and to use this information
   to adapt the control of unilateral stepping with a state-based control
   algorithm consisting of both feed-forward and feedback components.
   Approach. In five anesthetized cats, hind limb stepping on a walkway or
   treadmill was produced by patterned electrical stimulation of the spinal
   cord through implanted microwire arrays, while neuronal activity was
   recorded from the DRG. Different parameters, including distance and tilt
   of the vector between hip and limb endpoint, integrated gyroscope and
   ground reaction force were modelled from recorded neural firing rates.
   These models were then used for closed-loop feedback. Main results.
   Overall, firing-rate-based predictions of kinematic sensors (limb
   endpoint, integrated gyroscope) were the most accurate with variance
   accounted for >60\% on average. Force prediction had the lowest
   prediction accuracy (48 +/- 13\%) but produced the greatest percentage
   of successful rule activations (96.3\%) for stepping under closed-loop
   feedback control. The prediction of all sensor modalities degraded over
   time, with the exception of tilt. Significance. Sensory feedback from
   moving limbs would be a desirable component of any neuroprosthetic
   device designed to restore walking in people after a spinal cord injury.
   This study provides a proof-of-principle that real-time feedback from
   the DRG is possible and could form part of a fully implantable
   neuroprosthetic device with further development.}},

Abstract = {{A review of activities involving the development of large arrays of
   nanomechanical resonators is presented. This review includes
   demonstration of the use of these arrays for the detection of biological
   targets. Both top-down and bottom-up approaches to the realization of
   such arrays were developed. Using a top-down approach, a nanomachining
   method for the fabrication of large arrays of doubly-clamped silicon
   carbonitride (SiCN) resonators with width as narrow as 16 nm and a yield
   approaching 100\% was developed. The specific detection of protein-A
   using such resonator arrays functionalized with single domain antibody
   fragments (sdAb) was also demonstrated with femtogram-level mass
   sensitivity. A nano-imprinting based fabrication of these resonator
   arrays was also realized, opening up their potential for cost-effective
   manufacturing. On a bottom-up approach, resonant silicon nanowires were
   also produced using directed chemical vapor deposition methods. These
   bottom-up resonant nanowires were in turn successfully employed for the
   specific detection of streptavidin with attogram-level mass sensitivity.

   the difference between the subsystem state measurements and the
   estimates of them. The individual model predictive controllers in this
   DMPC are designed via Lyapunov techniques. Under the assumption that
   state measurements of the subsystems are available, sufficient
   conditions for the closed-loop stability are derived. The proposed DMPC
   is applied to a reactor-separator chemical process example and is
   compared with a cooperative DMPC in which distributed controllers are
   evaluated every sampling time extensively. The results demonstrate the

Abstract = {{In this present work, terminal amino-functionalized nanocrystalline
   cellulose derivatives were prepared using a simple two-step protecting
   group-free protocol under aqueous reaction conditions at room

   of nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) via a TEMPO-mediated oxidation. Then,
   reaction of surface-carboxylated NCC with bifunctional amines of small
   alkyl chain length by EDC/NHS-mediated coupling furnished the desired
   aminated NCC via an amide linkage. Surface covalent functionalization
   was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, elemental
   analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Size, surface charge,
   morphology, and thermal properties were obtained by various techniques.
   STEM images revealed no change in structure and morphology of the
   materials after TEMPO-mediated oxidation but a slight agglomeration was
   observed after surface covalent functionalization with diamines. While
   amide linkage confers stability, terminal primary amine groups on the
   surface of NCC represent a versatile reactive functional group for
   bioconjugation with other biomolecules for potential biomedical

Abstract = {{The performance of optimum combining (OC) used in a decode-and-forward
   relay network over Nakagami-m fading channels in the presence of
   co-channel interference at the relay nodes and at the destination is
   analyzed. A closed-form expression is derived for the exact outage
   probability. It is found that OC cannot be used to achieve end-to-end
   diversity gain when interference is present at single-antenna relays,
   but the outage probability floor at the destination receiver is lowered
   by the OC. If the interference is present only at the destination,
   diversity gains can be achieved using OC. The performance of OC is
   compared with maximal-ratio combining (MRC) and OC achieves diversity
   gain if interference is present only at the destination node, whereas

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{The vibration signals of faulty planetary gearboxes have complicated
   spectral structures due to the amplitude modulation and frequency
   modulation (AMFM) nature of gear damage induced vibration and the
   additional multiplicative amplitude modulation (AM) effect caused by the
   time-varying vibration transfer paths (for local gear damage case) and
   the passing planets (for distributed gear damage case). The spectral
   complexity leads to the difficulty in fault diagnosis of planetary
   gearboxes. Observing that both the amplitude envelope and the
   instantaneous frequency of planetary gearbox vibration signals are
   associated with the characteristic frequency of the faulty gear, a joint
   amplitude and frequency demodulation method is proposed for fault
   diagnosis of planetary gearboxes. In order to satisfy the mono-component
   requirement by instantaneous frequency estimation, a signal is firstly
   decomposed into product functions (PF) using the local mean
   decomposition (LMD) method. Then, the earliest extracted PF that has an
   instantaneous frequency fluctuating around the gear meshing frequency or
   its harmonics is chosen for further analysis, because it contains most
   of the information about the gear fault. The amplitude demodulation
   analysis can be accomplished through Fourier transforming the amplitude
   envelope of the chosen PF. For the frequency demodulation analysis,
   Fourier transform is applied to the estimated instantaneous frequency of
   the chosen PF to reveal its fluctuating frequency, thus obtaining the
   spectrum of the instantaneous frequency. By joint application of the
   amplitude and frequency demodulation methods, planetary gearbox faults
   can be diagnosed by matching the dominant peaks in the envelope spectrum
   and the spectrum of instantaneous frequency with the theoretical
   characteristic frequencies of faulty gears. The performance of the
   proposed method is illustrated by simulated signal analysis, and is
   validated by experimental signal analysis of a lab planetary gearbox
   with intentionally created pitting and naturally developed wear. (c)

Journal = {{THEORETICAL CHEMISTRY ACCOUNTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{132}},

Abstract = {{We recently demonstrated that dispersion-correcting potentials (DCPs),
   which are atom-centered Gaussian-type functions that were developed for
   use with B3LYP (Torres and DiLabio in J Phys Chem Lett 3: 1738-1744,
   2012), greatly improved the ability of the underlying functional to
   predict non-covalent interactions. However, the recent application of
   the B3LYP-DCP approach to study the beta-scission of the cumyloxyl
   radical led to a calculated barrier height that was over-estimated by
   ca. 8 kcal/mol. We demonstrate in the present work that the source of
   this error arises from the previously developed carbon atom DCPs, which
   erroneously alters the electron density in the C-C covalent-bonding
   region. In this work, we developed a new C-DCP with a form that was
   expected to less strongly influence the electron density in the covalent
   bonding region. Tests of the new C-DCP, in conjunction with previously
   published H-, N-, and O-DCPs, with B3LYP-DCP/6-31+ G(2d, 2p) on the S66,
   S22B, HSG-A, and HC12 databases of non-covalently interacting dimers
   showed that it is one of the most accurate methods available for
   treating intermolecular interactions, giving mean absolute errors (MAEs)
   of 0.19, 0.27, 0.16, and 0.18 kcal/mol, respectively. Additional testing
   on the S12L database of very large complexation systems gave an MAE of
   2.6 kcal/mol, demonstrating that the B3LYP-DCP/6-31+G(2d, 2p) approach
   to be one of the best-performing and most feasible methods for treating
   large systems containing significant non-covalent interactions. Finally,
   we showed that the modeling of C-C-making/C-C-breaking chemistry is well
   predicted using the newly developed DCPs. In addition to predicting a
   barrier height for the beta-scission of the cumyloxyl radical, that is,
   within 1.7 kcal/mol of the high-level value, application of
   B3LYP-DCP/6-31+G(2d, 2p) to 10 databases that include reaction barrier
   heights and energies, isomerization energies, and relative conformation
   energies gives performance that is among the best of all available
   dispersion-corrected density-functional theory approaches.}},

   affecting exhaust temperature and is based on thermodynamic relations
   and semi-empirical correlations. It incorporates intake and exhaust gas
   flow dynamics, residual gas mixing, and fuel burn rate and is validated
   with experimental data from a single cylinder engine at over 300 steady

Abstract = {{A calibration process for planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) is
   presented and employed to investigate the mixing field of a co-flowing
   jet in a water channel flow. The calibration technique uses individual
   calibration curves for each pixel in the image array that correct for
   the non-uniformities of the laser sheet, optics and digital sensor and
   account for parameters that affect fluorescence efficiency of the dye. A
   unique commercial optic is introduced into the optical train to generate
   a thin laser sheet with an approximately uniform laser intensity
   distribution. The performance of the calibration procedure is
   investigated by analysis of the calibration data and through the
   investigation of a coflowing jet. The results compare well with the
   results documented in the literature for this flow field. The work shows
   that the simple approach designed specifically for application in
   large-scale facilities is suitable for calibration of PLIF style

Abstract = {{Common blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) is a sessile organism that has
   unique ability to attach to a wide array of organic and inorganic marine
   surfaces using its holdfast structures. Strong adhesion to surfaces is
   essential for mussel survival, movement, and self-defense. Mussel
   proteins from byssal thread are structural components connecting soft
   mussel tissues to marine surfaces via an adhesive plaque in the distal
   end, while adhesive proteins from byssal plaque are responsible for
   mussel adhesion. Adhesive proteins are small molecules containing a high
   proportion of post-translationally modified amino acids such as
   3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). High DOPA content, small molecular
   size, protein flexibility, the presence of metal ions, and a high
   oxidation state enable strong mussel adhesion to surfaces. Mussel
   adhesion mechanisms depend on the composition and interactions of mussel
   proteins, as well as their interactions with the environment.
   Difficulties in the extraction of mussel adhesion proteins hamper
   mechanism studies and their practical applications. Development of
   recombinant mussel proteins and biomimetics will advance our
   understanding of adhesion mechanisms. In this paper, recent advances in
   the characterization of mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs), mussel adhesion
   mechanisms, application of MAPs, and the development of biomimetic
   biopolymers are reviewed.}},

Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{156-171}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a detailed experimental study on bubble
   characteristics of bubbly jets in crossflow by injecting air-water
   mixtures vertically via a circular nozzle. Bubbles were observed to
   separate from the water jets after some distance from the nozzle. Bubble
   properties were measured at different sections along the gas-phase
   centerline trajectory. The results show that the radial distributions of
   void fraction, bubble frequency and bubble specific interfacial area
   generally follow the Gaussian distribution. The distribution of bubble
   velocity was found to be larger in the downstream side of a
   cross-section, but Gaussian in the transverse direction. The
   distribution of bubble diameter was found to be affected primarily by
   air and water injection rates and the distance from the nozzle. At a
   cross-section, the gas-phase exhibits an ellipse-shape for pure air
   injection, while a kidney-shape for a mixture of air-water injection.
   Bubble properties along the gas-phase centerlines were also
   investigated, and their values decay along the centerlines until
   reaching some terminal values. Finally, relation of bubble slip velocity
   with bubble diameter in crossflow was found close to that of single
   isolated bubbles in stagnant water, rather than that of bubbly jets in
   stagnant water. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   were prepared by phase-inversion method from a quaternary system of
   polysulfone/N,N-dimethylformamide/polyvinilpyrrolidone (PVP)/nanosilver
   (nAg). The effect of casting mixture composition on the membrane
   morphology, performance, and anti-fouling (including anti-biofouling)
   properties was evaluated by microscopic, spectroscopic and surface
   characterization techniques. The results showed a substantial effect of
   casting mixture composition on the morphology and selectivity of
   membranes. The incorporation of nAg to a casting mixture containing 5
   wt\% PVP induced morphological changes in membrane structure including
   increase in pore sizes, suppression of macrovoids and thinning of the
   skin layer. These changes were further resembled in the separation and
   anti-fouling properties of membranes. The permeate flux of membranes
   increased regardless of PVP concentration, while the separation
   properties of membranes formed from a casting mixture containing 5 wt\%
   PVP were significantly compromised as compared to those formed with 1
   wt\% PVP. Under the same nAg loading, the membrane casted from a mixture
   contained 1 wt\% PVP had better anti-fouling properties with respect to
   bovine serum albumin. The bioassays with Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed
   that anti-biofouling properties of membranes (including antibacterial
   and anti-adhesive properties) were significantly induced upon addition
   of nAg. The findings of this study highlight the importance of casting
   mixture composition and interactions between its components for the
   optimization of membrane anti-fouling behavior while maintaining high
   separation properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Based on decision-theoretic rough sets (DTRS), we augment the existing
   model by introducing into the granular values. More specifically, we
   generalize a concept of the precise value of loss function to triangular
   fuzzy decision-theoretic rough sets (TFDTRS). Firstly, ranking the
   expected loss with triangular fuzzy number is analyzed. In light of
   Bayesian decision procedure, we calculate three thresholds and derive
   decision rules. The relationship between the values of the thresholds
   and the risk attitude index of decision maker presented in the ranking
   function is analyzed. With the aid of multiple attribute group decision
   making, we design an algorithm to determine the values of losses used in
   TFDTRS. It is achieved with the use of particle swarm optimization. Our
   study provides a solution in the aspect of determining the value of loss
   function of DTRS and extends its range of applications. Finally, an
   example is presented to elaborate on the performance of the TFDTRS
   model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The multi-granularity problem is one of the key open problems in
   Granular Computing. Multiple descriptions of the same phenomena may use
   very different information granulations, complicating any comparison or
   synthesis of those descriptions. One method for solving this problem is
   to transform all observations to a common granulation; however, this
   granulation must be adequate to capture all important facets of the
   phenomena. Determining this ``natural{''} granulation could be done by
   inductively learning and comparing multiple granular representations of
   the phenomenon, but this requires a dedicated learning architecture. We
   present the Granular Neural Network, a novel adaptive neural network
   architecture that employs granular values and operations at the level of
   individual neurons. The Granular Neural Network is based on the
   multiplayer perceptron architecture and the backpropagation learning
   algorithm with momentum. It uses the operations of linguistic arithmetic
   to manipulate granular connection weights, which are represented by
   linguistic terms. We test the performance of the Granular Neural Network
   on three well-known benchmark datasets, and then explore its use in
   determining the ``natural{''} granularity of a dataset (C) 2013 Elsevier

Pages = {{155-163}},

Abstract = {{Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is a widely used nanofabrication
   technique that allows precise abrasion of surfaces under controlled
   chemical conditions. This precision also makes CMP an ideal method to
   investigate the complex and interrelated phenomena that control
   simultaneous abrasion and passivation processes. In this paper, the
   controlled wear of copper by CMP is shown to be due to the synergistic
   interaction of passivation and mechanical abrasion. The overall rate at
   which copper is removed depends on the relative rates of the mutually
   dependent passivation and abrasion processes, and a synergistic
   interaction parameter Delta RC-A. A peak in the copper removal rate is
   observed when Delta RC-A is highest, and the abrasion and passivation
   rates balance each other; away from this peak, the removal rate is
   dominated by either the passivation or abrasion rate. While the
   interaction of abrasion and corrosion processes in CMP has been examined
   by a number of workers, this paper quantifies for the first time the
   magnitude of synergism for a model peroxide-glycine-citric acid-silica
   system. As well as affecting overall removal rate, the relative
   passivation and abrasion rates determine the final wafer surface
   quality. Where abrasion dominates, the surface roughness is high.
   Conversely, the protection offered to the underlying film by a strongly
   passivating chemistry results in very low surface roughness, a highly
   desirable outcome in copper CMP. Minimizing slurry cost and maximizing
   final surface quality are two key objectives of the CMP process; the
   approach presented in this paper allows these two objectives to be
   simultaneously met. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   materials to prepare composites. This work reviews the electrochemical
   modification of graphene. Commencing with a brief history, a summary of
   several different means of modifying graphene to effect diverse
   applications is provided. This is followed by a discussion on different
   composite materials that have been prepared with reduced graphene oxide
   prior to moving onto a detailed consideration of six different methods
   of electrochemically modifying graphene to prepare composite materials.
   These methods involve cathodic reduction of graphene oxide,
   electrophoretic deposition, electro-deposition techniques,
   electrospinning, electrochemical doping and electrochemical
   polymerization. Finally a consideration on the applications of
   electrochemically modified graphene composite materials in various
   fields is presented prior to discussing some prospects in enhancing the

Abstract = {{The current biodosimetry, a primary fluence validation method for
   ultraviolet (UV) reactors, is confronting some serious challenges (e.g.,
   the high cost and the lack of accurate monitoring of the lamp output),
   thus greatly limiting its practical application. In this study, a
   monitored tunable biodosimetry (MTB) was developed to validate the
   fluence of UV reactors with a lower cost but a higher accuracy. A novel
   micro-fluorescent silica detector (MFSD), used to monitor the real-time
   fluctuation of lamp output, was inserted into the gap between the lamp
   and the quartz sleeve. An adjustable ballast was utilized to tune the
   lamp output by adjusting the input voltage so as to export a desired
   reduction equivalent fluence. Fluence measurements were conducted on a
   commercial annular UV reactor with two challenge microorganisms
   (Bacillus subtilis spores and Escherichia coli). Results show that the
   MFSD could monitor well the lamp output during the validation process,
   and the viable number of B. subtilis spores could be greatly reduced by
   as much as 218 times. E. coli, a UV-sensitive microorganism usually
   inapplicable for fluence validation in the conventional biodosimetry,
   became applicable in the MTB process. Moreover, the dependence of
   fluence on water temperature could be readily determined. This MTB
   process cannot only increase the accuracy but also reduce the cost for
   UV fluence validation in comparison to the conventional biodosimetry.

Title = {{Electric double-layer interactions in a wedge geometry: Change in
   contact angle for drops and bubbles}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide a theory to pinpoint the role of electric
   double layer (EDL) interactions in governing the contact angle of an
   electrolyte drop on a charged solid in air or a bubble on a charged
   surface within an electrolyte solution. The EDL interactions are
   analytically solved by representing the three phase contact line as a
   wedge edge, with the wedge being formed by the solid-liquid and the
   air-liquid interfaces, and calculating the corresponding Maxwell
   stresses. We demonstrate that the EDL effects induce an
   ``electrowetting-like{''} behavior, resulting in a lowering of the
   contact angle. As a specific example, we use this model to analyze the
   effect of added salt on preformed surface nanobubbles, and find, in
   contrast to what has been reported earlier, that even for most moderate
   conditions, added salt may have remarkable effect in altering the
   contact angle in preformed surface nanobubbles.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{This study examined the cytotoxicity of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) by
   investigating physiological responses of Escherichia coli, from cell
   growth to protein expression. Surfaces of HNTs were modified by amine
   functionalization (NH2-HNTs) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) coating and
   their cytotoxicity levels were compared with that of non-modified HNTs
   (Bare-HNTs). Bare- and NH2-HNTs exhibited accelerated cell death rates
   at >= 0.5 mg/ml of HNTs. It was also found that concentration as low as
   0.01 mg/ml of HNTs exerted significant toxic effects on the bacterial
   cells. Cellular viability, metabolic activity, and DNA replication all
   decreased with increasing concentrations of Bare- and NH2-HNTs. In
   contrast, 0.01 mg/ml of BSA-coated HNTs (BSA-HNTs) coated showed no
   evidence of cytotoxicity. Even at concentrations <= 0.1 mg/ml, the
   cytocompatibility of BSA-HNTs was significantly better than those of
   Bare- and NH2-HNTs, which was confirmed by the observation of (i) the
   same or similar levels of cell proliferation and cell viability to the
   control, and (ii) higher levels of metabolic activity and plasmid DNA
   replication than those of Bare- and NH2-HNTs. In addition, higher
   ranaspumin-2 protein yield was observed from bacterial culture
   supplemented with BSA-HNTs (100, 83, and 80 \% of yield at 0.01, 0.05,
   and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively, relative to the control). This work showed
   that the increase of bacterial cytotoxicity of HNTs correlated well with
   elevating HNT concentration and that surface modification of HNTs with
   amine functional group and BSA coating was an effective strategy to
   reduce cytotoxicity up to 0.1 mg/ml of HNTs.}},

Abstract = {{Current oil sand mining operations in the Athabasca basin are
   predominantly aqueous-based. Extracts containing large amounts of fines
   lead to the formation of stable organoclay suspensions in froths giving
   lower yields and greater tailing wastes and making the development of
   more efficient extraction methods desirable from both economical and
   environmental perspectives. We examine an indole-kaolinite system as a
   model for these oil fines and their resistance to washing in nonaqueous
   solvents. The prepared organoclays show indole loading exclusively on
   the external surface of the clay. Micron-scaled vermicular structures,
   similar to natural kaolinite, are observed. Their formation is believed
   to be driven by strong adsorbate adsorbate interactions. Indole is the
   primary adsorbate, as solvent adsorption is shown to be minimal based on
   both experimental and computational results. Isotherms are constructed
   and parameters calculated from linear regression analysis fitted to the
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation. Monolayer quantities calculated match
   well to the theoretical amount calculated from surface areas
   measurements. Washing the organoclays with both toluene and isopropanol
   results in a 50\% decrease of loaded organic material, leaving a
   monolayer equivalent of organic matter. The statistical-mechanical
   3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation is employed to perform full
   sampling of solvent orientations around a kaolinite platelet and gain
   insights into the preferred orientation and adsorption thermodynamics of
   indole on kaolinite in toluene and heptane solvents. In its preferred
   orientation, indole is hydrogen-bonded to one or two 0 atoms at the
   aluminum hydroxide surface of kaolinite. The calculated solvation free
   energy and potential of mean force for adsorption of indole and solvents
   on kaolinite in solution yield the increasing adsorption strength order
   of heptane < toluene < indole on the aluminum hydroxide surface.
   Multilayer adsorption profiles are predicted based on the integrated
   three-dimensional distribution functions of indole, toluene, and
   heptane.}},

Title = {{Effectiveness of cough etiquette maneuvers in disrupting the chain of
   transmission of infectious respiratory diseases}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: The effectiveness of recommended measures, such as ``cover
   your mouth when coughing{''}, in disrupting the chain of transmission of
   infectious respiratory diseases (IRD) has been questioned. The objective
   of the current study was to determine the effectiveness of simple
   primary respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette maneuvers in blocking
   droplets expelled as aerosol during coughing.
   Method: In this study, 31 healthy non-smokers performed cough etiquette
   maneuvers in an effort to cover their voluntarily elicited best effort
   coughs in an open bench format. A laser diffraction system was used to
   obtain accurate, non-invasive, quantitative, real time measurements of
   the size and number of droplets emitted during the assessed cough
   etiquette maneuvers.
   Results: Recommended cough etiquette maneuvers did not block the release
   and dispersion of a variety of different diameter droplets to the
   surrounding environment. Droplets smaller than one-micron size dominate
   the total number of droplets leaked when practicing assessed maneuvers.
   Conclusions: All the assessed cough etiquette maneuvers, performed as
   recommended, do not block droplets expelled as aerosol when coughing.
   This aerosol can penetrate profound levels of the respiratory system.
   Practicing these assessed primary respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette
   maneuvers would still permit direct, indirect, and/or airborne
   transmission and spread of IRD, such as influenza and Tuberculosis. All
   the assessed cough etiquette maneuvers, as recommended, do not fully
   interrupt the chain of transmission of IRD. This knowledge urges us all
   to critically review recommended CE and to search for new evidence-based
   procedures that effectively disrupt the transmission of respiratory
   pathogens. Interrupting the chain of transmission of IRD will optimize
   the protection of first responders, paramedics, nurses, and doctors
   working in triage sites, emergency rooms, intensive care units, and the
   general public against cough-droplet-spread diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The adhesion force of drops deposited on smooth solid surfaces can be
   found by integration along the contact line of the liquid-vapor surface
   tension acting on an infinitesimal contact line element, projected on
   the substrate plane (gamma(parallel to)). Approximate relations
   available in the literature are applicable only for drops with specific
   contact line shapes (e.g. circular, elliptical, parallel-sided, or
   contact lines with at least one axis of symmetry). However, in most
   applications drops are exposed to a combination of forces and the
   contact line may have any arbitrary shape. In this study, a model is
   developed to calculate the adhesion force of drops with arbitrary shape.
   The contact line shape and contact angle values are found using side
   view images taken at different azimuthal angles (around the drop). The
   model is applicable to drops of any shape, as long as contact line is
   convex, and takes into account the perspective errors during imaging.

Abstract = {{A chitosan sample was modified by phosphorylation reactions on the
   hydroxyl site. The chemical structure of the resulting grafted chitosan
   was studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The adsorption behaviors of the
   phosphorylated chitosan on two oxide minerals, copper carbonate
   (malachite) and manganese carbonate (rhodochrosite) were studied by
   flotation, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and XPS. It was observed that the phosphorylated
   chitosan adsorbed more strongly on rhodochrosite possibly through
   covalent bonds of both the P=O group and the P-OH group with the
   rhodochrosite surface, but only the P-OH group was observed to bind with
   malachite surface possibly through hydrogen bonds. The different
   adsorption mechanisms led to the flotation of malachite and depression
   of rhodochrosite using sodium oleate as a collector. The oleate ions
   could replace the relatively weakly bound phosphorylated chitosan from
   malachite surfaces, making it floatable in the presence of the
   phosphorylated chitosan. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is an important industrial additive in the
   paper, textile, food, and cosmetic industries and has been shown to be
   an effective cryoprotectant for red blood cells, however, little is
   known about its thermodynamic solution properties. In many applications,
   in particular those in biology, HES is used in an aqueous solution with
   sodium chloride (NaCl). The osmotic virial solution thermodynamics
   approach accurately captures the dependence of osmolality on molality
   for many types of solutes in aqueous systems, including electrolytes,
   sugar, alcohols, proteins, and starches. Elliott et al. proposed mixing
   rules for the osmotic virial equation to be used for osmolality of
   multisolute aqueous solutions (Elliott, J. A. W., et al. J. Phys. Chem.
   B 2007, 111, 1775-1785] and recently applied this approach to the
   fitting of one set of aqueous HES-NaCl solution data reported by Jochem
   and Korber (Cryobiology 1987, 24, 513-536], indicating that the HES
   osmotic virial coefficients are dependent on HES-to-NaCl mass ratios.
   The current study reports new aqueous HES-NaCl vapor pressure osmometry
   data which are analyzed using the osmotic virial equation. HES
   modifications were measured after dialysis (membrane cut off: 10 000
   g/mol) and freeze-drying using vapor pressure osmometry at different
   mass ratios of HES to NaCl for HES up to 50\% and NaCl up to 25\% with
   three different HES modifications (weight average molecular weights
   {[}g/mol]/degree of substitution: 40 000/0.5; 200 000/0.5; 450 000/0.7)
   Equations were then fit to the data to provide a model for HES osmotic
   virial coefficient dependence on mass ratio of HES to NaCl. The osmolity
   data of the three HES modifications were accurately described over a
   broad range of HES-to-NaCl mass ratios using only four parameters,
   illustrating the power of the osmotic virial approach in analyzing
   complex data sets. As expected, the second osmotic virial coefficients
   increase with molecular weight of the HES and increase with HES-to-NaCl
   mass ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Evaporation of suspended micro-liter drops in room temperature,
   atmospheric conditions and in quiescent air is not controlled by liquid
   transport across the drop interface (phase change) but by vapor
   transport from the drop surface to the surrounding. The vapor transport
   can be decomposed into convection and diffusion. Literature assumes the
   convection is negligible, also the evaporation process is assumed as
   quasi-steady (Maxwell assumptions). Although, the Maxwellian models are
   relatively accurate, the validity of the assumptions was never
   investigated independently. In this paper, it was shown that relaxing
   the steady-state assumption alone results in 60\% error in predicting
   the evaporation rate. Also, using the Peclet number concept, it was
   found the evaporation is not purely diffusive. This means that
   evaporation is not a steady-state nor pure-diffusive process. Relaxing
   both Maxwell assumptions together, a transient and diffusive-convective
   (TDC) model was developed. It was found that only for liquids with small
   vapor concentration values (e.g. water), the TDC and Maxwell based
   models provide similar results (likely due to fortuitous cancelling of
   transient and convective effects for such liquids). For liquids with
   large vapor concentration values the TDC should be used. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The authors propose a distributed robust joint signal and interference

   interference signals and that of the desired signals, while maintaining
   interference to the primary user below a permissible level. Under the
   assumption of the ellipsoidal CSI uncertainties, the joint worst-case
   optimisation problem is decomposed and reformulated as semi-definite

Abstract = {{In this study an alternative approach to implementation of the
   generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test for, detection and isolation of
   the fault in linear systems is proposed. The proposed approach offers
   the following advantages: 1) It overcomes the Shortcomings of the
   previously suggested methods by accurately detecting the time of
   occurrence of the fault; 2) It uses statistical fault detection and
   confirmation tests to obtain a crude estimate of time of occurrence of
   the fault (TOF) and then refines the estimated TOF using an extended
   data window and the GLR test; and 3) It avoids performing the isolation
   in case the number of data points is not enough and hence the number of
   misclassifications is significantly reduced. The newly proposed method
   is evaluated by application to a benchmark CSTR problem using Monte
   Carlo simulations, and the results. reveal that this method can estimate
   the time of occurrence of the fault and the fault magnitude more
   accurately compared to a previous approach applied to the same benchmark
   problem. Simulation results on a benchmark problem also show
   significantly. lower misclassification rates.}},

Abstract = {{Using a 0.8-mm-diameter image guide fiber bundle consisting of 30,000
   single-mode fibers and an external linear array transducer, we
   demonstrate a dual-mode photoacoustic system capable of
   ultrasound-guided microendoscope insertion and photoacoustic imaging.
   The array optical resolution photoacoustic microendoscopy (AOR-PAME)
   system is designed to visualize the placement of the distal end of an
   endoscopy probe several centimeters into tissue, transmit scanning
   focused laser pulses into tissues via the fiber bundle, and acquire the
   generated photoacoustic signals. A ytterbium-doped fiber laser is
   tightly focused and is scanned across the proximal tip of the image
   guide fiber bundle using a two-dimensional galvanometer scanning mirror
   system. The end of the fiber bundle is used in contact mode with the
   object. The capabilities of AOR-PAME are demonstrated by imaging carbon
   fiber networks embedded in tissue-mimicking phantoms and the ears of a
   60-g rat. The lateral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio are measured
   as 9 mu m and 40 dB, respectively. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical

   distribution is presented. The main advantage of holography over
   conventional imaging techniques lies in its capability to measure the
   three-dimensional volume information, thereby overcoming limitations

   information (holography) is stored and tailored image analysis routines
   are used to extract the size and shape information from the stored
   holograms. The method is applied to experimental batch cooling
   crystallization of two systems, namely, oxalic acid and potash alum. The
   measured crystal size and shape distribution are found to be in good
   agreement with offline microscopy measurements.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of experimental techniques were applied to a single source
   asphaltene sample at the same experimental conditions in order to reveal
   the possible size distributions of asphaltene monomers and aggregates.
   The asphaltene sample was divided into solubility cuts by selective
   precipitation in solutions of heptane and toluene. Asphaltene
   self-association was assessed through a combination of density, vapor
   pressure osmometry (VPO), elemental analysis, Fourier transform-ion
   cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry, and time-resolved
   fluorescence emission spectra measurements performed on each cut. The
   physical dimensions of the asphaltenes were assessed using SAXS, DLS,
   membrane diffusion, Rayleigh scattering, and nanofiltration
   measurements:Molecular and nanoaggregate dimensions were also
   investigated through a combination of interfacial tension, interfacial
   adsorption, and surface force measurements.
   All of the measurements indicated that approximately 90 wt \% of the
   asphaltenes self-associated. Ultrahigh resolution spectrometry suggests
   that the nonassociated asphaltenes are smaller and more aromatic than
   bulk asphaltenes indicating that the associating species are larger and
   less aromatic. On the basis of VPO, the average monomer molecular weight
   was approximately 850 g/mol, while the molecular weight of the
   nanoaggregates spanned a range of at least 30000 g/mol with an average
   on the order of 10000 to 20000 g/mol. SAXS and DLS gave molecular
   weights 10 times larger. The physical dimensions of the nanoaggregates
   were less than 20 nm based on nanofiltration and with average diameters
   of 5 to 9 nm based on diffusion and Rayleigh scattering. SAXS and DLS
   gave average diameters of 14 nm and indicated that the nanoaggregates
   had loose structures. Film studies were consistent with the lower
   molecular weights and dimensions and also demonstrated that asphaltene
   monolayers swell by a factor of 4 in the presence of a solvent. The most
   consistent interpretation of the data is that asphaltenes form a highly
   polydisperse distribution of loosely structured (porous or low fractal
   dimension) nanoaggregates. However, the discrepancy between VPO and SAXS
   molecular weights remains unresolved.}},

Abstract = {{A passive seismic monitoring campaign was carried out in the frame of a

   analysis focuses on a two-week period during which prominent downhole

   CO2 and CH4 along the monitoring well equipped with an array of
   short-period borehole geophones. We applied state of the art
   seismological processing schemes to the continuous seismic waveform
   recordings. During the analyzed time period we did not find evidence of
   induced micro-seismicity associated with CO2 injection. Instead, we
   identified signals related to the leakage of CO2 and CH4, in that seven
   out of the eight geophones show a clearly elevated noise level framing
   the onset time of leakage along the monitoring well. Our results confirm
   that micro-seismic monitoring of reservoir treatment can contribute

Abstract = {{Asymmetric pulsed field electrophoresis within crystalline arrays is
   used to generate angular separation of DNA molecules. Four regimes of
   the frequency response are observed, a low frequency rise in angular
   separation, a plateau, a subsequent decline, and a second plateau at
   higher frequencies. It is shown that the frequency response for
   different sized DNA is governed by the relation between pulse time and
   the reorientation time of DNA molecules. The decline in angular
   separation at higher frequencies has not previously been analyzed.
   Real-time videos of single DNA molecules migrating under high
   frequency-pulsed electric field show the molecules no longer follow the
   head to tail switching, ratchet mechanism seen at lower frequencies.
   Once the pulse period is shorter than the reorientation time, the
   migration mechanism changes significantly. The molecule reptates along
   the average direction of the two electric fields, which reduces the
   angular separation. A freely jointed chain model of DNA is developed
   where the porous structure is represented with a hexagonal array of
   obstacles. The model qualitatively predicts the variation of DNA angular
   separation with respect to frequency.}},

   thermomechanical noise-limited magnetic moment sensitivity in the range
   of 5 x 10(6) mu(B) at room temperature and can be utilized to study both
   magnetostatics and dynamics in nanomagnets across a wide temperature

Abstract = {{New lipopolymers were synthesized by conjugating cholic acid (ChA) to
   polyethylenimines (PEI; 2 and 25 kDa) and a polyallylamine (PAA; 15 kDa)
   via N-acylation to develop effective gene delivery systems. The extent
   of ChA substitution linearly varied with the feed ratio during
   synthesis, indicating good control over grafting ratio. While ChA did
   not affect binding to plasmid DNA (pDNA) for higher molecular weight
   (MW) polymers, ChA substitution to 2 kDa PEI significantly affected the
   pDNA binding. Toxicity of the 2 kDa PEI was unaffected by ChA
   substitution, but it was improved for the higher MW polymers. Using
   immortal 293T cells and primary cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem
   cells, low MW (2 kDa) PEI was shown to display much better transfection
   efficiency as a result of ChA substitution, unlike the higher MW
   polymers. We conclude that ChA could be a suitable substituent for
   non-toxic (low MW) PEIs in order to improve their transfection
   efficiency. (c) 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Abstract = {{Here we report on fabricating photo-patternable polymer nanocomposite
   cantilevers for harvesting electrical energy from mechanical vibrations.
   The optimized piezoelectric polymer nanocomposite enables direct photo
   patterning and, therefore, easy fabrication of microcantilevers
   eliminating expensive etching steps. Integrating piezoelectric zinc
   oxide (ZnO) nanopartides (NPs) with optimum weight fraction into a
   photosensitive SU-8 polymer matrix not only retains the highly desired
   piezoelectric and semiconducting properties of the ZnO, but also
   combines the photo-patternability and the optical transparency of the
   SU-8. The maximum output power produced by nanocomposite cantilevers was
   0.025 mu W across a resistive load of 100 k Omega with peak to peak
   voltage of similar to 140 mV at a resonance frequency of 4 kHz. This
   inexpensive platform offers design flexibility and ease of fabrication
   for harvesting mechanical vibrations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objectives: To establish a rat model of a one-piece mandible using the
   principles of gingivoperiosteoplasty and guided bone regeneration to
   fuse the midline symphyseal area.
   Material and Methods: Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley female rats were
   divided into two groups: 12 experimental and 12 control. Both groups
   were imaged using in vivo micro-computed tomography at baseline and at
   end point (5 months). The experimental group received regenerative
   surgery at the symphysis area; the control group received no treatment.
   Outcomes were evaluated by radiographic examination of gross and
   volumetric bony changes in the symphyseal region of interest marked
   between the mental foramina bilaterally and the two central incisors
   near the most coronal margin of the alveolar crests. These landmarks
   were chosen as they can be reproduced on the computed tomography images
   at baseline and end point. Histologic examination was performed on all
   samples at a level 5 mm apical to the alveolar bone crest.
   Results: Radio logic and histologic examinations of the experimental
   group revealed complete bony fusion of the symphyseal area in three
   subjects, partial fusion in five subjects, and thickening of the
   alveolar bony socket in three subjects; one rat died of
   anesthesia-related complications. No evidence of fusion or alveolar bone
   thickening was found in any of the controls.
   Conclusions: This surgical animal model demonstrates that a rat mandible
   can be surgically manipulated to mimic the one-piece human mandible.
   This novel model may prove useful in studying mandibular bone remodeling
   and orthodontic mandibular tooth movement.}},

Abstract = {{The periodontal ligament is the tissue that provides early tooth motion
   as a result of applied forces during orthodontic treatment: a
   force-displacement behavior characterized by an instantaneous
   displacement followed by a creep phase and a stress relaxation phase.
   Stress relaxation behavior is that which provides the long-term loading
   to and causes remodelling of the alveolar bone, which is responsible for
   the long-term permanent displacement of the tooth. In this study, the
   objective was to assess six viscoelastic models to predict stress
   relaxation behavior of rabbit periodontal ligament (PDL). Using rabbit
   stress relaxation data found in the literature, it was found that the
   modified super-position theory (MST) model best predicts the rabbit PDL
   behavior as compared to nonstrain-dependent and strain-dependent
   versions of the Burgers four-parameter and the five-parameter
   viscoelastic models, as well as predictions by Schapery's viscoelastic
   model. Furthermore, it is established that using a quadratic form for
   MST strain dependency provides more stable solutions than the cubic form
   seen in previous studies.}},

Abstract = {{Background Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked disorder of lysosomal
   metabolism affecting multiple organs with cardiac disease being the
   leading cause of death. Current imaging evaluations of the heart are
   suboptimal. The goals of the current study are to evaluate the potential
   of quantitative T-1 mapping with cardiovascular MRI as a
   disease-specific imaging biomarker.
   Methods and Results A total of 31 patients with FD, 23 healthy controls,
   and 21 subjects with concentric remodeling or hypertrophy underwent
   cardiovascular MRI to measure left ventricular (LV) morphology,
   function, delayed enhancement, as well as myocardial T-1 values, and
   derived parameters (extracellular volume). All subjects had LV ejection
   fraction >50\% and similar volumes. FD and concentric remodeling or
   hypertrophy had similarly increased mass, wall thickness, and
   mass/volume as compared with controls. A total of 16 of 31 FD subjects
   and 10 of 21 concentric remodeling or hypertrophy subjects had LV
   hypertrophy. Noncontrast myocardial T-1 values were substantially lower
   in FD as compared with controls and concentric remodeling or hypertrophy
   (107050, 1177 +/- 27, and 1207 +/- 33 ms, respectively; P<0.001), but
   extracellular volume was similar in all groups (21.7 +/- 2.4\%, 22.2 +/-
   3.1\%, and 21.8 +/- 3.9\%, respectively). Single-voxel NMR spectroscopy
   in 4 FD and 4 healthy control subjects showed a significant negative
   linear relationship between lipid content and noncontrast T-1 values
   (r=-0.9; P=0.002). Female subjects had lower LV mass and wall thickness,
   longer myocardial T-1 values and larger extracellular volume suggesting
   a key sex difference in cardiac remodeling.
   Conclusions Reduced noncontrast myocardial T-1 values are the most
   sensitive and specific cardiovascular MRI parameter in patients with FD
   irrespective of sex and LV morphology and function.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the propagation characteristics of circular
   waveguides whose interior surface is coated with a thin metamaterial
   liner possessing dispersive, negative, and near-zero permittivity. A
   field analysis of this system produces the dispersion of complex modes,
   and reveals in detail intriguing phenomena such as backward-wave
   propagation below the unlined waveguide's fundamental-mode cutoff,
   resonant tunneling of power, field collimation, and miniaturization. It
   is shown how the waveguide geometry and metamaterial parameters may be
   selected to engineer the lined waveguide's spectral response.
   Theoretical dispersion and transmission results are closely validated by
   full-wave simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a technique to extract load signatures
   non-intrusively by using the smart meter data. Load signature extraction
   is different from load activity identification. It is a new and
   important problem to solve for the applications of non-intrusive load
   monitoring (NILM). For a target appliance whose signatures are to be
   extracted, the proposed technique first selects the candidate events
   that are likely to be associated with the appliance by using generic
   signatures and an event filtration step. It then applies a clustering
   algorithm to identify the authentic events of this appliance. In the
   third step, the operation cycles of appliances are estimated using an
   association algorithm. Finally, the electric signatures are extracted
   from these operation cycles. The results can have various applications.
   One is to create signature databases for the NILM applications. Another
   is for load condition monitoring. Validation results based on the data
   collected from three actual houses and a laboratory experiment have
   shown that the proposed method is a promising solution to the problem of
   load signature collection.}},

Abstract = {{Depending on the capacity, type and location, distributed generation
   (DG) can have an impact on protection coordination of directional
   over-current relays for looped distribution systems. In this paper, a
   new index is proposed, ``protection coordination index{''} (PCI), which
   can serve as an effective measure when planning the protection of meshed
   distribution systems with DG. A two-phase non-linear programming (NLP)
   optimization problem is proposed to determine the PCI by optimally
   calculating variations in the maximum DG penetration level with changes
   in the protection coordination time interval. Furthermore, the influence
   of connecting a DG at a certain location on the system PCIs is examined.
   The presented analysis is tested on the distribution section of the IEEE
   14-bus and IEEE 30-bus systems. The PCI can serve as an efficient index
   for distribution system planners: (i) to determine the best DG candidate
   locations for utility owned DG and (ii) to evaluate the impact of a
   customer owned DG, considering distribution system protection.}},

Abstract = {{Microgrids are known as clusters of distributed energy resources serving
   a group of distributed loads in grid-connected and isolated grid modes.
   Nowadays, the concept of microgrids has become a key subject in the
   smart grid area, demanding a systematic procedure for their optimal
   construction. According to the IEEE Std 1547.4, large distribution
   systems can be clustered into a number of microgrids to facilitate
   powerful control and operation infrastructure in future distribution
   systems. However, clustering large systems into a set of microgrids with
   high reliability and security is not reported in current literature. To
   fill-out this gap, this paper presents a systematic and optimized
   approach for designing microgrids taking into account system
   reliability- and supply-security-related aspects. The optimum design
   considers sustained and temporary faults, for system reliability via a
   combined probabilistic reliability index, and real and reactive power
   balance, for supply security. The loads are assumed to be variable and
   different distributed generation (DG) technologies are considered.
   Conceptual design, problem formulation and solution algorithms are
   presented in this paper. The well-known PG\&E 69-bus distribution system
   is selected as the test system. The effect of optimization coefficients
   on the design and the robustness of the algorithm are investigated using
   sensitivity studies.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid ac/dc multi-terminal micro-grids are gaining high momentum under
   the smart grid paradigm to integrate renewable and clean energy
   resources either in the transmission or distribution systems. This paper
   presents a robust multi-objective controller for the
   voltage-source-converter (VSC)-based dc-voltage power-port in hybrid
   ac/dc networks. The proposed controller ensures excellent tracking
   performance, robust disturbance rejection, and robust stability against
   operating point and parameter variation with a simple fixed-parameter
   low-order controller. A two-degree-of-freedom control structure is
   proposed, where feed-forward tracking and base-line robust disturbance
   rejection controllers are employed to decouple disturbance rejection and
   tracking objectives. A disturbance rejection controller is designed,
   based on the singular-values synthesis approach, to achieve robustness
   against variation in converter operation point. Further, the effect of
   parametric uncertainty in the effective dc-link capacitance is mitigated
   by modifying the robust disturbance rejection controller, via the
   polynomial method, to ensure that the closed-loop poles are allocated in
   the pre-defined region in the complex plane even under parameter
   variation. A theoretical analysis and comparative simulation and
   experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the
   proposed control structure.}},

Abstract = {{The sum rate of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)

   rate expressions and corresponding high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   approximations are derived for uncorrelated and min-semi-correlated
   (i.e., correlation exists only at the minimum antenna terminal) Rayleigh
   fading cases in closed-form. Moreover, the closed-form upper and lower
   bounds of the sum rate are derived for max-semi-correlated (i.e.,
   correlation exists only at the maximum antenna terminal) and
   doubly-correlated Rayleigh fading cases. Notably, these sum rate bounds
   and high SNR approximations provide valuable insights into practical
   MIMO AF TWRN system-design and the maximum achievable spatial

Abstract = {{Fundamental diagrams of vehicular traffic flow are generally

   fundamental diagrams can be constructed systematically from simple
   second order macroscopic traffic models, such as the classical
   Payne-Whitham model or the inhomogeneous Aw-Rascle-Zhang model. These
   second order models possess non-linear traveling wave solutions, called
   jamitons, and the multi-valued parts in the fundamental diagram
   correspond precisely to jamiton-dominated solutions. This study shows
   that transitions from function-valued to set-valued parts in a
   fundamental diagram arise naturally in well-known second order models.
   As a particular consequence, these models intrinsically reproduce

Abstract = {{Prediction of chemical reactivity has become one of the highest priority
   tasks of computational chemistry since the development of the methods of
   modeling electronic structure. Despite the general simplicity of the
   physical concept of reactivity and the rapid development of modern
   density functional theory (DFT) methods, this task remains
   state-of-the-art for systems with wavefunctions that have a
   multiconfigurational character. In such cases, for the accurate
   description of reactivity one needs to use multiconfigurational
   approaches that are much heavier computationally then ordinary
   single-determinant DFT methods. Moreover, the complexity of the
   calculation of reactivity is increased by the necessity to calculate
   ionic and transition states. These computational challenges can be
   addressed by employing the concepts of Koopmans' theorem and its
   extension to a multiconfigurational case. We present a simplified
   methodology for the calculation of Fukui functions, based on Koopmans'
   approximation for multiconfigurational Green's functions developed in
   our previous works. Also, an extension of this methodology based on
   perturbation theory has been developed to improve accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The vanadium and nickel components in heavy oils and bitumen are
   important impurities in catalytic processing and form aggregates with
   other asphaltene components. Metalloporphyrins are commonly analyzed
   using the characteristic Soret band in the UV-vis absorption spectrum.
   However, the Soret band of metalloporphyrins in petroleum is broadened
   and weaker than expected based on the concentration of Ni and V in heavy
   oils and the extinction coefficients of isolated porphyrins. We
   hypothesize that the low intensity and broadening of the Soret band
   could be due to axial coordination of the metal center or fusion
   (annelation) of aromatic rings on the porphyrin pi-system. This
   hypothesis is examined using the density functional theory for geometry
   optimization and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) for
   calculation of excited states of nickel(II) and vanadyl porphyrins with
   axially coordinated ligands and annelated polyaromatic hydrocarbons.
   Predictions of the excited electronic states performed using the tandem
   of TD-DFT and conductor-like polarizable continuum model of solvation
   support this hypothesis and provide insight into the extent of Soret
   band broadening and intensity decrease due to coordination and
   annelation. These computational results, validated with respect to
   visible absorption spectra, are important for understanding asphaltene
   aggregation and spectroscopic characterization and suggest methods for
   removal of transition metals from heavy oil.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the effect of surface energy on an anisotropic elastic

   solution is derived using the standard Stroh formalism. In particular,
   explicit expressions for the hoop stress, normal, in-plane tangential
   and out-of-plane displacement components along the edge of the hole are
   obtained. These expressions clearly demonstrate the effect of elastic
   anisotropy of the bulk material on the corresponding field variables.
   When the material becomes isotropic, the hoop stress agrees with the
   well-known result in the literature while both the in-plane tangential
   and out-of-plane displacements vanish and the normal displacement is
   constant along the entire boundary of the elliptical hole. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The oil sands in northern Alberta have been mined to produce bitumen
   over the past five decades. Since the 1980s, technical advances have
   been made in mining, material handling, and bitumen extraction. However,
   acquiring practical methods to control and reduce the fluid fine
   tailings build-up has been an ongoing challenge. Recent regulatory
   changes have driven the industry to review current tailings-management
   techniques and investigate numerous alternative technologies and
   processes to manage and reclaim fine tailings. Many of these fine
   tailings-management techniques involve some form of polymer or chemical
   addition to promote dewatering and strength gain to meet the regulatory
   requirements. Based on the reported data, the chemically amended fine
   tailings deposits have the characteristics of sensitive, metastable
   deposits, necessitating additional mitigative measures by oil sands
   operators beyond the regulatory requirements. This paper explores the
   geotechnical aspects of meeting regulatory strength performance criteria
   by employing flocculation-based dewatering of fluid fine tailings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an ontology-driven framework for developing

   approach addresses these challenges through ontological modeling and
   linking of construction simulation modeling components including (i)
   ontology of construction process, (ii) ontology of simulation world
   view, and (iii) ontology of distributed simulation modeling application
   tool. Within the paper, ontology driven approach and mapping of
   ontologies for information transference between simulation components
   has been described. Another discussed application of ontologies is
   structuring of simulation modeling development through use of reusable
   elements. A large-scale distributed simulation model of industrial

Abstract = {{Ball bearings, one of the most widely used components in rotating
   machinery, play a critical role in system performance. Localized defects
   such as pit and spall may develop in ball bearings during service. The
   vibration waveform of the impulse generated by a ball passing over a
   defect on the races is determined by the shape and size of the localized
   defect. Hence, it is important to study the relationship between the
   localized defect shape and its pulse waveform characteristics in order
   to diagnose the types of defect in bearings. This study examines the
   effects of the defect shape, radial load and shaft speed on the pulse
   waveform characteristics generated by localized defects using the method
   of explicit dynamic finite element analysis. To validate the proposed
   model, the results obtained from the experiments have also been
   provided, and the waveform and the duration of the pulse generated by
   the defect on the outer race are in good agreement with the simulation
   results, which shows validation of the proposed model. Both the
   experimental results and the simulation results have confirmed that the
   impulse shape generated by the defect on the raceway will be influenced
   by the contact deformations at the edges of the defect. The results
   obtained also demonstrate that the explicit dynamic finite element
   analysis approach can be used to analyze the pulse waveform
   characteristic generated by localized defects in ball bearings.}},

Abstract = {{Although the radiation force balance is the gold standard for measuring
   ultrasound intensity, it cannot be used for real-time monitoring in
   certain settings, for example, bioreactors or in the clinic to measure
   ultrasound intensities during treatment. Foreseeing these needs, we
   propose a close-proximity thermoacoustic sensor. In this article, we
   describe the design, characterization, testing and implementation of
   such a sensor. We designed a 20-mm-diameter plexiglass sensor with a
   2-mm-long absorber and tested it against low-intensity pulsed ultrasound
   generated at a 1.5-MHz frequency, 20\% duty cycle, 1-kHz pulse
   repetition frequency and intensities between 30 and 120 mW/cm(2). The
   sensor captures the beam, converts the ultrasound power into heat and
   indirectly measures the spatial-average time-average ultrasound
   intensity (I-sata) by dividing the calculated power by the beam cross
   section (or the nominal area of the transducers). A thin copper sheet
   was attached to the back face of the sensor with thermal paste to
   increase heat diffusivity 1000-fold, resulting in uniform temperature
   distribution across the back face. An embedded system design was
   implemented using an Atmel microcontroller programmed with a
   least-squares algorithm to fit measured temperature-versus-time data to
   a model describing the temperature rise averaged across the back side of
   the sensor in relation to the applied ultrasound intensity. After it was
   calibrated to the transducer being measured, the thermoacoustic sensor
   was able to measure ultrasound intensity with an average error of 5.46\%
   compared with readings taken using a radiation force balance. (E-mail:

Abstract = {{Ultrathin-layer chromatography (UTLC) potentially offers faster
   analysis, reduced solvent and sample volumes, and lower costs. One novel
   technique for producing UTLC plates has been glancing angle deposition
   (GLAD), a physical vapor deposition technique capable of aligning
   macropores to produce interesting separation properties. To date,
   however, GLAD-UTLC plates have been restricted to model dye systems,
   rather than realistic analytes. This study demonstrates the transfer of
   high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) sugar analysis
   methods to GLAD-UTLC plates using the office chromatography framework. A
   consumer inkjet printer was used to apply very sharp low volume (3-30
   nL) bands of water-soluble analytes (lactose, sucrose, and fructose).
   Analytic performance measurements extrapolated the limits of detection
   to be 3-5 ng/zone, which was experimentally proven down to 60-70
   ng/band, depending on the sugar. This qualitative analysis of sugars in
   a commercially available chocolate sample is the first reported
   application of GLAD-UTLC to food samples. The potential utility of
   GLAD-UTLC is further exemplified by successful coupling with
   electrospray ionization mass spectrometry for the first time to
   characterize underivatized sugars.}},

Abstract = {{The physicochemical processes that affect acid mine drainage (AMD) in
   unsaturated waste rock piles and the capabilities of small-scale
   laboratory experiments to predict AMD from waste rock are not well
   understood. An integrated laboratory and field study to measure and
   compare low sulfide waste rock and drainage characteristics at various
   scales has been initiated. This paper describes the design, construction
   and instrumentation of three field-scale experimental waste rock piles
   (test piles), and six active zone lysimeters at the Diavik diamond mine
   in the Northwest Territories, Canada. The test piles are comprised of
   granitic and sulfide-bearing metasedimentary waste rock excavated during
   open pit mining operations. One test pile contains waste rock with a
   target S content of <0.04 wt.\% S; the second test pile contains waste
   rock with a target S content of >0.08 wt.\% S; and the third test pile
   contains the higher sulfide waste rock (>0.08 wt.\% S) and was re-sloped
   and capped with a low permeability till layer and a low sulfide waste
   rock cover. The first two test piles are approximately 15 m high with
   bases of 50 m by 60 m, and the re-sloped test pile has a larger base of
   80 m by 125 m. Instrumentation was selected to measure matrix flow,
   geochemistry of pore water and drainage, gas-phase O-2 concentration,
   temperature evolution, microbiological populations, waste rock
   permeability to air, and thermal conductivity, as well as to resolve
   mass and flow balances. Instrument locations were selected to
   characterize coupled physicochemical processes at multiple scales and
   the evolution of those processes over time. Instruments were installed
   at a density such that the number of instruments that survived
   construction (40\% to >80\% by instrument type) was sufficient to allow
   adequate characterization of the physicochemical processes occurring at
   various scales in the test piles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Three large-scale instrumented waste rock piles were constructed at the
   Diavik Diamond Mine in the Northwest Territories, Canada. These
   experimental waste rock piles (test piles) are 15 m high and are part of
   an integrated field and laboratory research program to characterize and
   compare low-sulfide waste rock and drainage at various scales. During
   test pile construction, samples of the <50 mm fraction of waste rock
   were collected from two types of waste rock that are segregated during
   mining operations based on S content. The samples were analyzed for S
   content and particle size distribution. One test pile contained waste
   rock with an average of 0.035 wt.\% S in the <50 mm fraction, within the
   operational S target of <0.04 wt.\% S for the lower S waste rock type.
   The second test pile contained waste rock with an average of 0.053 wt.\%
   S in the <50 mm fraction, lower than the operational S target of >0.08
   wt.\% S for the higher S waste rock type. The third test pile has a low
   permeability till layer and a low sulfide waste rock thermal layer
   covering a core of waste rock with average 0.082 wt.\% S in the <50 mm
   fraction, which is within the operational S target of >0.08 wt.\% S for
   the higher S waste rock. Particle size distributions for the lower and
   higher S waste rock are similar, but the higher S waste rock has a
   higher proportion of fine-grained particles. Sulfur determinations for
   discrete particle sizes of the <50 mm fraction illustrate higher S
   concentrations in smaller particles for both the lower S waste rock and
   the higher S waste rock. Similarly, S concentrations calculated for the
   >10 m scale, from composite blast hole cuttings, are lower than those
   calculated for the <50 mm scale. Acid-base accounting using standard
   methods and site-specific mineralogical information was used to
   calculate the ratio of neutralization potential to acid generating
   potential. A comparison of calculation approaches to pH and alkalinity
   data from humidity cell and test pile effluent suggest that ratios are
   very sensitive to the calculation method. The preferred calculation
   method was selected by comparing calculation results to pH and
   alkalinity data from humidity cell effluent collected over 95 weeks and
   test pile effluent collected over five field seasons. The preferred
   acid-base accounting values were obtained by calculating the average
   neutralization potential divided by the average acid potential of a
   sample set. This approach indicates that waste rock with >0.05 wt.\% S
   is of uncertain acid-generating potential and effluent data indicate
   this waste rock generates acidic effluent; whereas lower S waste rock
   does not produce acidic effluent, consistent with the acid-base
   accounting predictions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three large-scale experimental waste rock piles (test piles) were
   constructed and instrumented at the Diavik Diamond Mine in the Northwest
   Territories, Canada, as part of an integrated field and laboratory study
   to measure and compare physical and geochemical characteristics of
   experimental, low sulfide waste rock piles at various scales. This paper
   describes the geochemical response during the first season from a test
   pile containing 0.053 wt.\% S. Bulk drainage chemistry was measured at
   two sampling points for pH, Eh, alkalinity, dissolved cations and
   anions, and nutrients. The geochemical equilibrium model MINTEQA2 was
   used to interpret potential mineral solubility controls on water
   chemistry. The geochemical response characterizes the initial flushing
   response of blasting residues and oxidation products derived from
   sulfides in waste rock exposed to the atmosphere for less than 1 year.
   Sulfate concentrations reached 2000 mg L (1) when ambient temperatures
   were >10 degrees C, and decreased as ambient temperatures declined to <0
   degrees C. The pH decreased to <5, concomitant with an alkalinity
   minimum of <1 mg L (1) (as total CaCO3), suggesting all available
   alkalinity is consumed by acid-neutralizing reactions. Concentrations of
   Al and Fe were <0.36 and <0.11 mg L (1), respectively. Trends of pH and
   alkalinity and the calculated saturation indices for Al and Fe (oxy)
   hydroxides suggest that dissolution of Al and Fe (oxy) hydroxide phases
   buffers the pH. The effluent water showed increased concentrations of
   dissolved Mn (<13 mg L (1)), Ni (<7.0 mg L (1)), Co (<1.5 mg L (1)), Zn
   (<0.5 mg L (1)), Cd (<0.008 mg L (1)) and Cu (<0.05 mg L (1)) as ambient
   temperatures increased. Manganese is released by aluminosilicate
   weathering, Ni and Co by pyrrhotite {[}Fe-1 S-x] oxidation, Zn and Cd by
   sphalerite oxidation, and Cu by chalcopyrite {[}CuFeS2] oxidation. No
   dissolved metals appear to have discrete secondary mineral controls.
   Changes in SO4, pH and metal concentrations indicate sulfide oxidation
   is occurring and effluent concentrations are influenced by ambient
   temperatures and, possibly, increasing flow path lengths that transport
   reaction products from previously unflushed waste rock. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{A field experiment is being carried out at the Diavik diamond mine in
   northern Canada to investigate the influence of unsaturated flow
   behavior on the quality of drainage from mine waste rock piles in a
   region of continuous permafrost. This paper is part of a series
   describing processes affecting the weathering of waste rock and
   transport of reaction products at this site; here the focus is on
   unsaturated water flow and its role in mass loading. Two 15 m-high
   instrumented test piles have been built on 60 m by 50 m collection
   systems, each consisting of lysimeters and a large impermeable
   high-density polyethylene (HDPE) liner. Collection lysimeters are
   installed nearby to investigate infiltration in the upper 2 m of the
   waste rock. Porosity, water retention curves, and hydraulic conductivity
   functions are estimated from field measurements and for samples ranging
   in size from 200 cm(3) to 16 m(3). Net infiltration in 2007 is estimated
   to have been 37\% of the rainfall for mean annual rainfall conditions.
   Early-season infiltration freezes and is remobilized as the waste rock
   thaws. Wetting fronts migrate at rates of 0.2-0.4 m d (1) in response to
   common rainfall events and up to 5 m d (1) in response to intense
   rainfall. Pore water and non-reactive solutes travel at rates of <10 (2)
   to 3 x 10 (2) m d (1) in response to common rainfall events and up to
   0.7 m d (1) in response to intense rainfall. Time-varying SO4 mass
   loading from the base of the test piles is dictated primarily by the
   flow behavior, rather than by changes in solute concentrations. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The interior thermal regime of a field-scale experimental waste rock
   pile in the Northwest Territories, Canada, was studied. Test pile
   construction was completed in the summer 2006, and temperature data was
   collected continuously since that time to February 2009. The temperature
   data indicates the test pile cooled over the study period, with an
   average heat energy release of -2.5 x 10(4) and -2.6 x 10(4) MJ in 2007
   and 2008, respectively. The mean annual air temperature (MAAT) at the
   site was -8.9 degrees C during the period between 2006 and 2009, with a
   permafrost table at a depth of 4 m in bedrock away from the pile.
   Because of this cold environment, the upward movement rate of the 0
   degrees C isotherm into the test pile at its base was approximately 1.5
   m a (1) during 2007 and 2008. Thermistor strings installed immediately
   below the base of the test pile showed the test-pile basal temperatures
   remained near and below 0 degrees C during the study period.
   Furthermore, due to low rates of sulfide mineral oxidation, elevated
   temperatures in the interior of the test pile were not observed. The
   average air velocity in the pore space in July 2007 and 2008 was about
   one third of that during January of each year based on temperature
   distributions. Therefore, due to higher air velocity during the winter,
   it is expected that heat transfer is greater during winter. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Wind-induced gas transport in a test-scale unsaturated waste rock pile
   was investigated at the Diavik diamond mine, Northwest Territories,
   Canada. Differential gas pressures were measured in 2008 at 49 locations
   within a field-scale experimental waste rock pile (test pile) and at 14
   locations on the surface of the test pile at 1-min intervals. Wind speed
   and direction were measured at 10-min intervals and decomposed into
   north, south, east, and west vectors. Correlations between wind vectors
   and pressure measurements indicate that the wind influences pressure
   fluctuations in the test pile. The strength of the correlation is
   roughly inversely proportional to the distance between the measurement
   ports and the atmospheric boundary. The relationship between the
   magnitude of the wind vector and pressure fluctuations on the surface of
   the test pile is non-linear. However, the relationship between internal
   and surface pressure measurements is linear, suggesting that gas flow
   within the test pile follows Darcy's Law. Spectral analysis demonstrates
   that the dominant periods of the wind range from 1 to 14 d. A 1-D
   analytical solution to the flow equation is used to demonstrate that
   long periods have the most pronounced effect on transient gas flow
   within the test pile and that the penetration depth of the wind-induced
   gas pressure wave is a function of wind period and permeability of the
   test pile. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The Diavik Waste Rock Project: Persistence of contaminants from blasting

Abstract = {{During mining operations, explosives are used to fragment rock into
   workable size fractions. Mine-water chemistry can be affected by
   blasting agent residuals, including NH3, NO2-, NO3-, Cl-, and ClO4-. At
   the Diavik diamond mine, Northwest Territories, Canada, waste rock
   generated from open-pit and underground mining is stockpiled on site.
   Three large-scale test piles measuring 60 by 50 m at the base and 15 m
   in height, along with four 2 x 2 m lysimeters each 2 m in height, were
   constructed at Diavik as part of a comprehensive research program to
   evaluate the quality of water emanating from waste rock stockpiles.
   Ongoing monitoring of the water chemistry since 2007 shows that blasting
   residuals comprise a large proportion of the dissolved constituents in
   the initial pore water and effluent. Leach tests conducted on freshly
   blasted rock from Diavik indicate the mass of N released corresponds to
   a 5.4\% N loss from the blasting explosives; this mass is in the range
   for N loss reported for blasting operations at Diavik during the period
   when the test piles were constructed. The total mass of N released from
   the lysimeters was also within this range. The three large-scale test
   piles have only released a small fraction of the N estimated to be
   contained within them. Blasting of waste rock contributes SO42- to
   effluent through the oxidation of sulfide minerals in the rock during
   the blast. During the initial flush of water, the test pile that
   contained waste rock with the higher S content was observed to release
   higher concentrations of SO42- than the test pile with lower S content
   waste rock. Mass-balance calculations based on the ratios of SO42- to
   total N can be used to estimate the relative contributions of sulfide
   oxidation within the test piles and SO42- released when S in the host
   rock is oxidized during blasting. These calculations provide an estimate
   of S mass released during the first flush of the test piles. (C) 2012

   analysis using finite element analysis is conducted to study the levels
   of the induced stress components at three rosette-sites and the levels

   applied tensile and compressive loads over three rosette-sites at

Abstract = {{Condition identification of mechanical equipment from vibration
   measurement data is significant to avoid economic loss caused by
   unscheduled breakdowns and catastrophic accidents. However, this task
   still faces challenges due to the complexity of equipment and the harsh
   environment. This paper provides a possibility for equipment condition
   identification by proposing a method called customized lifting
   multiwavelet packet information entropy. Benefiting from the properties
   of multi-resolution analysis and multiple wavelet basis functions, the
   multiwavelet method has advantages in characterizing non-stationary
   vibration signals. In order to realize the accurate detection and
   identification of the condition features, a customized lifting
   multiwavelet packet is constructed via a multiwavelet lifting scheme.
   Then the vibration signal from the mechanical equipment is processed by
   the customized lifting multiwavelet packet transform. The relative
   energy in each frequency band of the multiwavelet packet transform
   coefficients that equals a percentage of the whole signal energy is
   taken as the probability. The normalized information entropy is obtained
   based on the relative energy to describe the condition of a mechanical
   system. The proposed method is applied to the condition identification
   of a rolling mill and a demountable disk-drum aero-engine. The results
   support the feasibility of the proposed method in equipment condition
   identification.}},

Abstract = {{Background Eye movement tasks provide a simple method for inferring
   structural or functional brain deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders.
   Oculomotor control is impaired in children with fetal alcohol spectrum
   disorder FASD), yet the neuroanatomical substrates underlying this are
   not known. Regions of white matter have been shown by diffusion tensor
   imaging DTI) to be different in FASD and thus may play a role in the
   delayed saccadic eye movements. The objective of this study was to
   correlate oculomotor performance with regional measures of DTI-derived
   white matter anisotropy in children with FASD.
   Methods Fourteen children (8 to 13years) with FASD were recruited for
   oculomotor assessment and DTI. Eye movement control was evaluated using
   the pro- and antisaccade tasks, in which subjects look at (prosaccade)
   or away from (antisaccade) a peripheral target. Saccadic reaction time
   SRT; time for subjects to move their eyes after the target appears) and
   direction errors (saccades made in the incorrect direction relative to
   the instruction) were measured and correlated to fractional anisotropy
   FA) on a voxel-by-voxel basis across the whole brain white matter.
   Results A significant positive correlation was observed between
   antisaccade SRT and FA in a large cluster containing anterior and
   posterior sections of the corpus callosum just to the right of the
   midline; prosaccade SRT and FA correlated positively in the genu of the
   corpus callosum and the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF),
   and correlated negatively in the left cerebellum.
   Conclusions The negative correlation for prosaccade SRT and cerebellum
   demonstrated that individuals with slower reaction times had lower FA
   values relative to their faster responding counterparts, a finding that
   implicates cerebellar dysfunction as a significant contributor to
   deficits in oculomotor control. The higher FA in the corpus callosum and
   ILF corresponding to longer reaction times for both pro- and antisaccade
   was opposite to what was expected, but nonetheless implies that altered
   brain structure in these regions underlies deficits in oculomotor
   control.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel control scheme is proposed to guarantee global
   asymptotic stability of bilateral teleoperation systems that are
   subjected to time-varying time delays in their communication channel and
   sandwich linearity in their actuators. This extends prior art concerning
   control of nonlinear bilateral teleoperation systems under time-varying
   time delays to the case where the local and the remote robots' control
   signals pass through saturation or similar nonlinearities that belong to
   a class of systems we name sandwich linear systems. Our proposed
   controller is similar to the proportional plus damping (P + D)
   controller with the difference that it takes into account the actuator
   saturation at the outset of control design and alters the proportional
   term by passing it through a nonlinear function; thus, we call the
   proposed method as nonlinear proportional plus damping (nP + D). The
   asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is established using a
   Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional under conditions on the controller
   parameters, the actuator saturation characteristics, and the maximum
   values of the time-varying time delays. To show the effectiveness of the
   proposed method, it is simulated on a variable-delay teleoperation
   system comprising a pair of planar 2-DOF robots subjected to actuator
   saturation. Furthermore, the controller is experimentally validated on a
   pair of 3-DOF PHANToM Premium 1.5A robots, which have limited actuation
   capacity, that form a teleoperation system with a varying-delay
   communication channel. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Heart transplant recipients (HTRs) experience multiple
   cardiac complications, many of which might produce myocardial fibrosis.
   Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can image myocardial
   fibrosis using late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging. We
   hypothesized that the presence and volume of LGE in heart transplant
   recipients correlates with left ventricular (LV) functional parameters
   and clinical outcomes.
   Methods: Thirty-eight stable HTRs underwent a CMR study and clinical
   follow-up.
   Results: In 38 stable HTRs, LGE was seen in 19 patients (50\%), of which
   15 (79\%) had a nonischemic pattern and 4 (21\%) had an ischemic
   pattern. LGE volume was associated with reduced LV ejection fraction
   (EF) (R-2 = 0.57; P = 0.001) and increased LV end-diastolic volume (R-2
   = 0.59; P = 0.001). The presence of LGE was associated with
   cardiovascular death or hospitalization within the next year (P = 0.04),
   and patients who died or were hospitalized had more LGE than those that
   were not hospitalized (15 g vs 7 g; P = 0.03).
   Conclusions: LGE is common in HTR and is associated with adverse
   ventricular remodelling and adverse clinical outcomes. LGE might be a
   useful noninvasive approach to monitor graft disease in asymptomatic
   patients after heart transplant.}},

Abstract = {{This study estimated the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and net energy
   ratio (NER) for producing hydrogenation-derived renewable diesel (HDRD)
   from canola and camelina in Western Canada. Using 1 MJ of energy in the
   HDRD produced as the functional unit, a variety of scenarios were
   evaluated to account for variations in allocation methods, co-products,
   oilseed yield, N2O emission factor, and land use change (LUC). In
   producing HDRD, the farming stage and the oil conversion stage (i.e. the
   HDRD production stage) are the most energy and emission intensive. For
   canola based HDRD, the GHGs and NERs lie in the ranges of 33-94
   gCO(2e)/MJ and 1.2-2.2 MJ/MJ respectively. For camelina based HDRD, the
   GHGs and NERs range from 30 - 82 gCO(2e)/MJ and 1.0-2.3 MJ/MJ
   respectively. In the base scenario (mass allocation; oilseed meal and
   propane fuel gas co-products; average yield; 0.76\% N2O emission factor;
   LUC ignored), HDRD from camelina (38 gCO(2e)/MJ, 2.0 MJ/MJ) is
   environmentally superior to HDRD from canola (48 gCO(2e)/MJ, 1.7 MJ/MJ)
   due to lower agricultural inputs and higher yield for camelina.
   Considering all of the scenarios examined, HDRD from both crops appears
   to be more sustainable than fossil diesel. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper considers the optimal control problem for a class of

   time-varying evolution operator to guarantee existence and well
   posedness of the initial and boundary value problem are demonstrated
   which serves as the basis for the optimal control problem synthesis. An

Volume = {{62}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A periodic scheduling problem for sensor networks with communication
   constraints is considered for state estimation. The solvability of the
   problem is first discussed and a necessary and sufficient condition is
   presented based on the notion of periodic detectability. Since the
   calculation of the average prediction error variance requires the
   computation of the symmetric periodic positive-semidefinite stabilizing
   (SPPS) solutions to the periodic Riccati equations, a moving approximate
   cost function is proposed, which gradually converges to the exact cost
   function. Also, it is shown that the upper bound of the approximation
   error is independent of the SPPS solutions and converges to zero
   exponentially. Based on these results, a branch and bound based
   algorithm is proposed to compute the optimal periodic schedule, and the
   idea is to iteratively trim the set of schedules that are potentially
   robust optimal with respect to the approximation error. If the optimal
   schedule is unique, the algorithm solves the periodic scheduling problem
   by exploring a finite number of nodes. Moreover, given an arbitrary
   nonzero suboptimality specification, the algorithm results in a
   suboptimal schedule set containing all the optimal schedules at a
   manageable computation effort. A numerical example is presented to
   illustrate the proposed results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Resilience of death: intrinsic disorder in proteins involved in the

Journal = {{CELL DEATH AND DIFFERENTIATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{It is recognized now that intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs),
   which do not have unique 3D structures as a whole or in noticeable
   parts, constitute a significant fraction of any given proteome. IDPs are
   characterized by an astonishing structural and functional diversity that
   defines their ability to be universal regulators of various cellular
   pathways. Programmed cell death (PCD) is one of the most intricate
   cellular processes where the cell uses specialized cellular machinery
   and intracellular programs to kill itself. This cell-suicide mechanism
   enables metazoans to control cell numbers and to eliminate cells that
   threaten the animal's survival. PCD includes several specific modules,
   such as apoptosis, autophagy, and programmed necrosis (necroptosis).
   These modules are not only tightly regulated but also intimately
   interconnected and are jointly controlled via a complex set of
   protein-protein interactions. To understand the role of the intrinsic
   disorder in controlling and regulating the PCD, several large sets of
   PCD-related proteins across 28 species were analyzed using a wide array
   of modern bioinformatics tools. This study indicates that the intrinsic
   disorder phenomenon has to be taken into consideration to generate a
   complete picture of the interconnected processes, pathways, and modules
   that determine the essence of the PCD. We demonstrate that proteins
   involved in regulation and execution of PCD possess substantial amount
   of intrinsic disorder. We annotate functional roles of disorder across
   and within apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis processes. Disordered
   regions are shown to be implemented in a number of crucial functions,
   such as protein-protein interactions, interactions with other partners
   including nucleic acids and other ligands, are enriched in
   post-translational modification sites, and are characterized by specific
   evolutionary patterns. We mapped the disorder into an integrated network
   of PCD pathways and into the interactomes of selected proteins that are
   involved in the p53-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Cell permeability controls the transportation of extracellular materials
   through cell membranes, which plays a critical role in drug and gene
   delivery. This work reports an innovative method to enhance the cell
   permeability through cell-bubble interactions in a high gravity field.
   In the presence of microbubbles, the cell membrane permeability of
   mammalian cells was significantly increased in the high gravity field,
   and up to 80\% THP-1 and 70\% MCF-7 cells were permeabilized by using
   FITC-Dextran with average molecular weight of 40 and 70 kDa as
   fluorescent markers which were found to locate in both cytoplasm and
   cell nucleus by using a confocal microscope. Micro-scale pores were
   detected on the cell membrane by a scanning electron microscope after
   the cell-microbubble interactions in the high gravity field. The
   delivery efficiency of FITC-Dextran could be further enhanced in gravity
   field of higher strength and in solutions with higher volume fraction of
   microbubbles, though the cell viability would also fall under extreme
   conditions. A simplified model was proposed to compare the contributions
   of surface forces (i.e., Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO)
   interaction force and membrane undulation force) with hydrodynamic force
   associated with cell-bubble interactions in the high gravity field. The
   hydrodynamic force was found to dominate the cell-bubble interaction
   while the DLVO force and membrane undulation force only play an
   important role at small separation (< 10 nm) and low relative velocity
   of approach (i.e., low gravity field strength). The enhanced cell
   membrane permeability and formation of micro-scale pores are mainly due
   to the microbubble-cell interactions through collision and/or cavitation
   effects from the bursting of microbubbles. Our results have important
   implications in many bioengineering processes which are dependent on
   cell membrane permeability.}},

Abstract = {{Streamflow in small forested watersheds on the Boreal Plain of western
   Canada can be a challenge to monitor due to high variation in flow,
   shifting channel morphology, aufeis obstructions, shallow channel depth,
   and debris in the channel. Intensive monitoring in natural channels can
   overcome some of these problems, but frequent assessment and
   recalibration of streamflow-stage relationships are necessary.
   Experience over 8years indicates that in-channel structures designed to
   provide a stabilized stream-monitoring section (SSMS) proved beneficial
   to monitoring efforts during the ice-free season. The SSMS facilitated
   accurate gauging of the highest and lowest flows encountered during this
   period, provided a relatively stable foundation against streambank and
   channel erosion, and allowed passage of fish and the majority of debris
   and sediments. Functionality of the structures was markedly limited
   during ice-in conditions, but was improved with the addition of fitted
   canopies and propane heating systems.}},

   attenuation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{234}},
Pages = {{197-206}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Sodium signal strength in MRI is low when compared with H. Thus, image
   voxel volumes must be relatively large in order to produce a sufficient
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The measurement of sodium in cartilage is
   hindered by conflation with signal from the adjacent fluid spaces.
   Inversion recovery can be used to null signal from fluid, but reduces
   SNR. The purpose of this work was to optimize inversion recovery sodium
   MRI to enhance cartilage SNR while nulling fluid. Sodium relaxation was
   first measured for knee cartilage (T-1 = 21 +/- 1 ms, T-2fast{*} = 0.8
   +/- 0.2 ms, T-2slow{*} = 19.7 +/- 0.5 ms) and fluid (T-1 = 48 +/- 3 ms,
   T-2{*} = 47 +/- 4 ms) in nine healthy subjects at 4.7 T. The rapid
   relaxation of cartilage in relation to fluid permits the use of a
   lengthened inversion pulse to preferentially invert the fluid
   components. Simulations of inversion pulse length were performed to
   yield a cartilage SNR enhancing combination of parameters that nulled
   fluid. The simulations were validated in a phantom and then invivo. B-0
   inhomogeneity was measured and the effect of off-resonance during the
   soft inversion pulse was assessed with simulation. Soft inversion
   recovery yielded twice the SNR and much improved sodium images of
   cartilage in human knee with little confounding signal from fluid. (C)

Abstract = {{Tire-derived aggregate (TDA) has been successfully used for highway
   embankment applications in the past. Previous applications mainly used
   small and medium tire sizes as TDA sources. There are no published test
   results in the literature regarding the compression behavior of TDA made
   solely from off-the-road tires (OTR). In this study, large-scale,
   one-dimensional compression tests are carried out to study the
   compression behavior of TDA from OTR as well as from passenger and
   light-truck tires (PLTT). Samples for the tests are prepared by varying
   the initial unit weights. The results show that there is a general trend
   of decreasing compressibility with increasing initial unit weight for
   both TDA sources. The compression test results are also used to compare
   compression behavior between the two TDA sources. It is found that the
   compression behavior of TDA from OTR and PLTT is more or less similar.
   Moreover, one-dimensional stress-strain regression equations were
   developed for TDA from OTR.}},

Abstract = {{Clustering categorical data arising as an important problem of data
   mining has recently attracted much attention. In this paper, the problem
   of unsupervised dimensionality reduction for categorical data is first
   studied. Based on the theory of rough sets, the attributes of
   categorical data are decomposed into a number of rough subspaces. A
   novel clustering ensemble algorithm based on rough subspaces is then
   proposed to deal with categorical data. The algorithm employs some of
   rough subspaces with high quality to cluster the data and yields a
   robust and stable solution by exploiting the resulting partitions. We
   also introduce a cluster index to evaluate the solution of clustering
   algorithm for categorical data. Experimental results for selected UCI
   data sets show that the proposed method produces better results than
   those obtained by other methods when being evaluated in terms of cluster

Abstract = {{CoCrMo has been successfully employed as an orthopedic and orthodontic
   material because of its excellent corrosion resistant and suitable
   biocompatibility. The purpose of this research was to investigate the
   susceptibility of CoCrMo in Ringer's solution at three different
   temperatures: 22 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and 60 degrees C. The
   corrosion behavior of CoCrMo was carried out by using common
   electrochemical methods such as open circuit potential, potentiodynamic
   measurement, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and
   Mott-Schottky measurements. CoCrMo was passivated by the air, forming a
   passive film, which was not destroyed during the immersion in
   electrolytes under different temperatures. Results from potentiodynamic
   tests showed that at high anodic potentials, the passive film did not
   demonstrate significant localized corrosion and rather exhibited overall
   passive film degradation corresponding to the general corrosion of the
   alloy in Ringer's solution at the three temperatures. EIS measurements
   showed the presence of the stable passive film on the alloy surface when
   tested at open circuit potential. Mott-Schottky test indicated that the
   preformed passive film is an n-type semiconductor due to the presence of
   a donor species. This is implied by the existence of oxygen vacancies
   and interstitial metallic cations. As the potential increased, the Cr3+
   oxidized and produced soluble Cr4+ species. This resulted in the film
   changing to a p-type semiconductor owing to the dissolution and creation
   of cation vacancies (acceptor species). The passive film rupture was not
   due to p-type characteristics but rather was a result of the
   considerable oxidative dissolution of the film at high anodic potential.

Abstract = {{Scaling of CMOS technology into nanometric feature sizes has raised
   concerns for the reliable operation of logic circuits, such as in the
   presence of soft errors. This paper deals with the analysis of the
   operation of sequential circuits. As the feedback signals in a
   sequential circuit can be logically masked by specific combinations of
   primary inputs, the cumulative effects of soft errors can be eliminated.
   This phenomenon, referred to as error masking, is related to the
   presence of so-called restoring inputs and/or the consecutive presence
   of specific inputs in multiple clock cycles (equivalent to a
   synchronizing sequence in switching theory). In this paper, error
   masking is extensively analyzed using the operations of state transition
   matrices (STMs) and binary decision diagrams (BDDs) of a finite state
   machine (FSM) model. The characteristics of state transitions with
   respect to correlations between the restoring inputs and time sequence
   are mathematically established using STMs; although the applicability of
   the STM analysis is restricted due to its complexity, the BDD approach
   is more efficient and scalable for use in the analysis of large
   circuits. These results are supported by simulations of benchmark
   circuits and may provide a basis for further devising efficient and
   robust implementations when designing FSMs.}},

Abstract = {{Addition is a fundamental function in arithmetic operation; several
   adder designs have been proposed for implementations in inexact
   computing. These adders show different operational profiles; some of
   them are approximate in nature while others rely on probabilistic
   features of nanoscale circuits. However, there has been a lack of
   appropriate metrics to evaluate the efficacy of various inexact designs.
   In this paper, new metrics are proposed for evaluating the reliability
   as well as the power efficiency of approximate and probabilistic adders.
   Reliability is analyzed using the so-called sequential probability
   transition matrices (SPTMs). Error distance (ED) is initially defined as
   the arithmetic distance between an erroneous output and the correct
   output for a given input. The mean error distance (MED) and normalized
   error distance (NED) are then proposed as unified figures that consider
   the averaging effect of multiple inputs and the normalization of
   multiple-bit adders. It is shown that the MED is an effective metric for
   measuring the implementation accuracy of a multiple-bit adder and that
   the NED is a nearly invariant metric independent of the size of an
   adder. The MED is, therefore, useful in assessing the effectiveness of
   an approximate or probabilistic adder implementation, while the NED is
   useful in characterizing the reliability of a specific design. Since
   inexact adders are often used for saving power, the product of power and
   NED is further utilized for evaluating the tradeoffs between power
   consumption and precision. Although illustrated using adders, the
   proposed metrics are potentially useful in assessing other arithmetic
   circuit designs for applications of inexact computing.}},

Abstract = {{Generalized flow equations developed for two-phase flow through porous
   media contain a second term that enables proper account to be taken of
   capillary coupling between the two flowing phases. In this study, a
   partition concept, together with a novel capillary pressure equation for
   countercurrent flow, have been introduced into Kalaydjian's generalized
   flow equations to construct modified flow equations which enable a
   better understanding of the role of capillary coupling in horizontal,
   two-phase flow. With the help of these equations it is demonstrated that
   the reduced flux observed in countercurrent flow, as compared to
   cocurrent flow, can be explained by the reduction in the driving force
   per unit volume which comes about because of capillary coupling. Also,
   it is shown experimentally that, because fluids flow through a void
   space reduced in magnitude due to the presence of immobile irreducible
   and residual saturations, the capillary coupling parameter should be
   defined in terms of a reduced porosity, rather than in terms of
   porosity. Moreover, it is shown statistically that the countercurrent
   relative permeability curve is proportional to the cocurrent relative
   permeability curve, the constant of proportionality being the capillary
   coupling parameter. Finally it is suggested that one can eliminate the
   need to determine experimentally countercurrent relative permeability
   curves by making use of an equation constructed for predicting the
   magnitude of the capillary coupling parameter.}},

Abstract = {{High purity microporous vanadosilicate (EVS-10/AM-6) has been
   hydrothermally synthesised by a simple template-free, reducing
   agent-free method in the absence of titanosilicate ETS-10 seeds. Direct
   comparison between EVS-10 and ETS-10 showed successful isomorphous
   substitution of titanium with vanadium in the framework. The existence
   of vanadium is confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The scan electron
   microscopy and the X-ray diffractometry show similar crystal morphology
   and similar molecular structure between the as-synthesised material and
   the ETS-10. Preliminary results indicate a similar internal surface area
   to ETS-10. Similar to ETS-10, EVS-10 may be useful for semiconductor and
   other electronic applications. This new simplified synthesis method may
   allow the economical production of EVS-10/AM-6 for quantum wire and
   other applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Surprisingly, in the absence of any external loading, the hoop stress
   induced solely by the surface effects is identical to that in the
   corresponding case in a linearly elastic solid. In addition, we show
   that even in the presence of surface effects, we can nevertheless design
   a so-called `harmonic hole' where the Piola mean stress remains constant
   everywhere in the surrounding solid. In this case, however, the hoop
   stress is no longer constant along the edge of the elliptical hole due

Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},

Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{81-88}},

Abstract = {{A reliability allocation weight is used during the early design stage of
   a system to apportion the system reliability requirement to its
   individual subsystems. Since some failures have serious effects on
   public safety, cost and environmental issues especially in a mission
   critical system, the failure effect must be considered as one of the
   important factors in determining the allocation weight. Previously, the
   risk priority number or the criticality number was used to consider the
   failure effect in the allocation weight. In this paper, we identify the
   limitations of the previous approach and propose a new allocation weight
   based on the subsystem failure severity and its relative frequency. An
   example is given to illustrate that the proposed method is more
   effective than the previous method for reducing the occurrence of the
   unacceptable failure effects in a newly designed system. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We explored the application of Low-Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound (LIPUS)

   Saccharomyces cerevisiae. LIPUS conditions of 1.5 MHz, 20\% duty cycle,
   80 mW/cm(2) intensity, 5 min exposure and 12 exposures per day were
   found to improve the activity of the organisms the most. These LIPUS
   treatment conditions increased cellulase production by T reesei by 16
   +/- 6\%. The same LIPUS treatment conditions induced a 31 +/- 10\%
   increase in ethanol production by S. cerevisiae which implies a
   cumulative improvement of 52 +/- 16\% in lignocellulosic bio-ethanol
   production with LIPUS. This observation shows a new potential for LIPUS
   in the improvement of lignocellulosic bioethanol production to make it a
   sustainable energy source. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{306}},
Number = {{1-2}},

Abstract = {{Tungsten carbide (WC)-based metal matrix composite (MMC) coatings
   fabricated using a low-cost, low-pressure cold spray unit were subjected
   to ASTM standard G65 dry abrasion wear testing. A linear relationship
   was observed between the wear rate and hardness of the various MMC
   coatings. Rule of mixtures (ROM) and a modified wear theory was used to
   explain the wear rate and material removal from the various WC-based MMC
   coatings. In general, the MMC coatings had wear rates closer to the
   values predicted by the modified wear theory. Although the MMC coatings
   had low wear rates close to values predicted by the equal wear theory,
   the cross-sectional images of the worn coatings suggested that material
   removal may have occurred by mechanisms governed by the equal pressure
   theory, where portions of, or even, the entire reinforcing particle were
   removed with the nickel matrix. The mean free path between the WC-based
   reinforcing particles was used to explain the improvements in wear rate
   as a function of increasing WC content in the coating. The coatings with
   the highest WC content and lower mean free path between the reinforcing
   particles had the lowest wear rates that were comparable to
   high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF)-sprayed and high-pressure cold-sprayed
   WC-based coatings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   movement of removable nodes}},
Journal = {{WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1095-1110}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{For a wireless ad hoc network to achieve fault-tolerance, it is desired
   that the network is bi-connected. This means that each pair of nodes in
   the network have at least two node-disjoint paths between them, and
   thus, failure at any single node does not partition the network. In
   other words, in a bi-connected network, there is no cut-node (defined as
   a node such that the removal of it partitions the network). To make a
   connected but not bi-connected network become bi-connected, actions
   should be taken such that all cut-nodes become non-cut-nodes. In this
   research, we propose to deal with cut-nodes from a new perspective.
   Specifically, we first introduce a new concept of removable node,
   defined as a non-cut-node such that the removal of it does not generate
   any new cut-node in the network. Then, we propose to move a removable
   node to a new location around a cut-node. In this way, the cut-node
   becomes a non-cut-node, that is, the failure of it does not partition
   the network anymore. Algorithms are provided (i) to identify removable
   nodes; (ii) to match cut-nodes with a feasible set of removable nodes,
   in which all nodes can be simultaneously removed from the network
   without generating any new cut-node in the network; and (iii) to derive
   the final location of a removable node such that its movement distance
   is the shortest and the associated cut-node becomes a non-cut-node. The
   proposed algorithms do not guarantee the final bi-connectivity but have
   the merits of a large success rate (almost 100\% in the simulation), a
   small number of moved nodes, and a short total movement distance. In
   addition, the proposed algorithms are shown to be effective even when
   there are a large portion of fixed nodes in the network. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{A 3D CFD model of the UCG process is developed and evaluated on a
   small-scale coal block with the dimensions of 3 x 1.5 X 2 cm. The
   results are discussed in detail and compared with the experimental data
   available. It was observed that the process reaches a steady sate
   condition after 4000 s of the process and remains in this condition
   until 8300 s, when drying and pyrolysis of the whole block is finished.
   The rate of cavity growth and the temperature at the outlet increased
   right after this period. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis indicated
   that the coal thermal conductivity has a major effect on the UCG
   process. Initial permeability of the seam also had strong influence on
   the growth rate and shape of the cavity. The higher coal permeability
   led to faster growth of the cavity and resulted in a much wider cavity.
   Lower oxygen flow rates at the inlet led to a more bulbous cavity shape,
   whereas at higher flow rates, the cavity became elongated in the
   direction of the production well. Increasing the inlet flow beyond a
   certain value decreased the concentration of CO and H-2 in syngas due to
   excessive combustion of these gases.}},

Abstract = {{In this work a simple and effective method is proposed to solve the
   problem corresponding to plane strain deformations of an N-phase
   decagonal quasicrystalline circular inclusion-matrix system in which the
   circular inclusion is bonded to the surrounding matrix through (N-2)
   co-axial interphase layers. We consider three kinds of thermomechanical
   loadings: (i) the matrix is subjected to a remote uniform stress field;
   (ii) the composite undergoes a uniform temperature change; (iii) the
   matrix is subjected to a uniform heat flux at infinity. We find that it
   is sufficient to manipulate three 8 x 8 real matrices, a 5 x 5 real
   matrix, and another 4 x 4 real matrix to arrive at the complete
   temperature and thermoelastic fields within the circular inclusion and
   the surrounding matrix, irrespective of the number of interphase layers
   existing within the composite system. Our results clearly indicate that
   the existence of the intermediate interphase layer(s) mean that the
   internal stresses within the circular inclusion are: (i) sextic
   functions of the two coordinates x(1) and x(2) under the loading of a
   remote uniform stress field; (ii) quadratic functions of the two
   coordinates under the loading of a uniform temperature change; (iii)
   cubic functions of the two coordinates under the loading of a remote
   uniform heat flux. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Nonsolvent induced phase inversion has been widely used to prepare
   micro-porous to almost dense membranes. In this study, variations in the
   thermodynamic and kinetic properties of polyethersulfone (PES) casting
   solution caused by polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyvinylpyrrolidone
   (PVP) additives were investigated. The thermodynamic variation was
   realized to enhance demixing rate of solvent and nonsolvent in the
   casting solution, while the rheological variation induced the opposite
   trend, delayed demixing. The morphology of the final membranes was
   affected by trade-off between thermodynamic enhancement and kinetic
   hindrance. The effect of thermodynamic enhancement and kinetic hindrance
   on membrane properties was tracked through two simple non-dimensional
   parameters. By changing the concentration and molecular weight (MW) of
   polymeric additives, these two parameters were controlled, and a wide
   range of structures ranging from finger-like to sponge-like voids were
   prepared. Lowering the demixing rate resulted in denser membranes with
   sponge-like structure, whereas at higher demixing rates, membranes with
   large finger-like pores were produced. Synthesized membranes had
   molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) between 0.1 and 500 kDa, which
   demonstrates the principal effect of polymeric additives on morphology
   of polymeric membranes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Smooth basal plane and edge surfaces of two platy phyllosilicate
   minerals (muscovite and talc) were prepared successfully to allow
   accurate colloidal force measurement using an atomic force microscope
   (AFM), which allowed us to probe independently interactions of divalent
   cations with phyllosilicate basal planes and edge surfaces. The Stern
   potential of basal planes and edge surfaces was obtained by fitting the
   measured force profiles with the classical DLVO theory. The fitted Stern
   potential of the muscovite basal plane became less negative with
   increasing Ca2+ or Mg2+ concentration but did not reverse its sign even
   at Ca2+ or Mg2+ concentrations up to 5 mM. In contrast, the Stern
   potential of the muscovite edge surface reversed at Ca2+ or Mg2+
   concentrations as low as 0.1 mM. The Stern potential of the talc basal
   plane became less negative with 0.1 mM Ca2+ addition and nearly zero
   with 1 mM Ca2+ addition. The Stern potential of talc edge surface became
   reversed with 0.1 mM Ca2+ or 1 mM Mg2+ addition, showing not only a
   different binding mechanism of talc basal planes and edge surfaces with
   Ca2+ and Mg2+, but also different binding mechanism between Ca2+ and
   Mg2+ ions with basal planes and edge surfaces. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{In connection with the detection of various spatial- and temporal-scale
   ground settlements, an integrated persistent scatterer interferometry
   (PSI) approach is discussed using multi-source, multi-temporal, and
   multi-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Based on the
   comprehensive analysis of characteristics of available radar sensors,
   two remote-sensing SAR data sets were selected: 1m resolution X-band
   TerraSAR-X and 10m resolution L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite
   (ALOS) phased array L-band SAR. Tianjin Binhai New Area' has become one
   of the most important economic centres in China, and one of its
   fast-developing urban areas, Tanggu, was selected as the study area. PSI
   processing was conducted on both data sets. Substantial validation was
   performed for PSI results from both data sources using levelling
   measurement. The overall good agreement confirmed the ground deformation
   maps derived from both data sets. Integration of PSI results appears to
   be a potentially significant contribution to solving the problems
   related to common spatial and temporal gaps when using single-type data
   sets. Application of both data sets revealed the capability of
   integrated PSIs to measure ground deformation with strong temporal and
   spatial variation, thereby improving the interpretation of ground
   deformation characteristics which increases the confidence of hazard
   assessment and provides some insight into complex underlying mechanisms.}},

Title = {{On-chip porous media: Porosity and permeability measurements}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{274-283}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{In porous media, accurate determination of petrophysical properties such
   as effective porosity and permeability are important to understand the
   porosity-permeability relationships that help in improving the oil
   extraction mechanisms. Measuring porosity and permeability for on-chip
   porous media is difficult due to their small length scales. Hence in the
   present work, we conduct experiments to calculate the effective porosity
   and permeability of on-chip porous media containing different
   pore-networks. Four different types of on-chip porous media varying in
   number of pore bodies and pore throats are fabricated in this work.
   Porosity for each on-chip porous media is determined by using image
   analysis technique. Absolute permeability is estimated by measuring the
   pressure drop across the pore network and applying Darcy's law. The pore
   sizes of the networks range from 40 mu m to 70 mu m and the porosity of
   the on-chip porous media varies from 0.39 to 0.67. The flow resistance
   in the networks, measured by the quantity Delta P/Q, is found to
   decrease with the increase in Darcy number (root K/h(2)). The
   permeability values range between 2.66 +/- 0.06 and 15.93 +/- 0.55 Darcy
   (2.625 x 10(-12) +/- 0.059 x 10(-12) and 15.72 x 10(-12) +/- 0.542 x
   10(-12) M-2). It is found that as the number of pores and throats in
   on-chip porous media increases, the porosity increases as expected
   resulting in approximately one order of permeability increase. The
   results of this study would help in understanding the porosity and the
   permeability values in on-chip porous media that are miniaturized
   versions of oil reservoirs, which can be effective in understanding pore
   scale porosity-permeability relationships. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{304}},
Pages = {{142-155}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Using eight dry season satellite images of Landsat MSS (1973-1984),
   Landsat TM (1993-2003), and IRS LISS (2009), this study assessed
   morphological changes of the Ganges River within Bangladesh. As a
   typical alluvial river, morphological changes of the Ganges River had
   been a common phenomenon. In the 1973-2009 study period, with its
   morphologically dynamic nature, the Ganges River had undergone
   considerable changes in its river banks and its vegetated islands. The
   bankline movement rates (m/y)and erosion accretion rates (ha/y) of the
   river were analyzed under four time periods: 1973-1984, 1984-1993,
   1993-2003, and 2003-2009. The results indicate that both the left and
   the right banks of Ganges have changed significantly due to varying
   erosion and accretion rates that had occurred. On a whole, the left bank
   was more prone to accretion while the right bank to erosion. The
   magnitude of bank erosion along the Ganges River is closely related to
   the erodibility of riverbank materials which vary spatially. In
   1973-1984, the average river width and the overall islands area had
   decreased considerably due to a net river bank accretion which resulted
   in an increase of 6790 ha of land area. However, afterwards, both river
   width and islands area continue to increase to the end of this study
   period (2009) because of a net erosion (loss of 18,830 ha of land).
   Furthermore, from 1984 to 2009, the sinuosity of Ganges had generally
   increased and was related to increased river width caused by a net bank
   erosion. Compared to other major rivers, Ganges has a very high erosion
   rate probably because its river banks are primarily composed of highly
   erodible materials and its high discharge rate especially during the
   Monsoon season. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the interaction mechanism between polymeric flocculants
   and solid particles in solutions of high salinity and the associated
   flocculation mechanism is of great practical and fundamental importance
   in mineral processing and colloid and interface science. In this work,
   the effects of three polymers, polyacrylamide (PAM), Magnafloc 1011 (MF)
   and Al(OH)(3)-polyacrylamide (Al-PAM), on the settling of mineral
   tailings in freshwater and in saline solution were investigated. The
   settling of tailings significantly depends on solution salinity, type
   and dosage of polymer flocculants. MF showed the best settling
   performance among the three polymers in both freshwater and saline
   solutions. The tailings settling was found to be largely dependent on
   the various interactions among negatively charged clay particles and
   polymers including van der Waals attractions, electrostatic repulsion,
   and polymer bridging. The increased solution salinity significantly
   reduces the electrostatic repulsion among the negatively charged solid
   particles and negatively charged polymer flocculants (i.e. for MF, but
   not for PAM and Al-PAM), leading to more effective polymer bridging
   interactions, which enhances the settling of mineral tailings. Our
   results provide some new insight into the understanding of the effects
   of solution salinity on the settling of mineral tailings and the
   development of novel polymer flocculants. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{XPS measurements showed that octyl hydroxamic acid (OHA) adsorbed on
   pyrochlore by both chemisorption (N 1s binding energy peak at around 399
   eV) and physisorption (N 1s binding energy peak at above 400 eV). The
   ratio of the integrated areas of the physisorption peak and
   chemisorption peak increased from nearly zero to about 4, and remained
   at 4 with increasing OHA concentrations. However, adsorption isotherm
   showed a continuous increase in the adsorption density of OHA. The
   discrepancy was found to be the result of how the OHA-treated pyrochlore
   was separated from the suspensions. Maximum adsorption of OHA on
   pyrochlore in fact remained at the second plateau (about 50 mu
   mol/m(2)), i.e., N 1s peak ratio of 4, and the rest of the physisorbed
   OHA could be washed off. On calcite, only a small and symetrical N 1s
   binding energy peak could be detected, indicating only physisorbed OHA.

   designed, built and tested in 0.18 micron complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. It achieves a PSNDR better
   than state-of-the-art logarithmic sensors and comparable to the human
   eye. As the approach concerns an array of many ADCs, we use a small-area
   low-power delta-sigma design. For scalability, each pixel has its own

Abstract = {{This paper presents a successful application of soft sensor technologies
   in process industry. The hybrid modeling technique, online prediction
   update, and robust implementation procedure are presented in detail.
   Once-through steam generators (OTSGs) have wide applications in In Situ
   oil sands industry for producing high pressure steam. Real-time control
   of steam qualities is essential to ensure optimal performance of the
   OTSGs and ultimately to reduce the production cost and emissions.
   However, neither existing online measurement nor off-line lab analysis
   of steam quality can meet this control purpose due to their own
   limitations. To resolve this problem, soft sensors for steam quality
   measurements of OTSGs are designed in this work based on a hybrid
   modeling technique, where online bias update with optimized weighting
   factor is incorporated to compensate the model error. Furthermore,
   online outlier detection is considered to ensure the robustness and
   reliability of the developed soft sensors. The successful applications
   to an industrial OTSG demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of
   the developed soft sensors. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on the application of transition-metal catalysts for heavy-oil
   or bitumen in-situ upgrading were conducted in the absence of a porous
   medium, mainly measuring the characteristics of heavy oil in reaction
   with metal ions at static conditions with the help of a magnetic
   stirrer. Metal species in ionic form are not soluble in oil phase.
   Therefore, metal particles, as inhomogeneous catalysts, are considered
   in this paper. Furthermore, dynamic tests in porous media are needed to
   clarify the injection possibility of the metal particles and their
   effect on in-situ upgrading of heavy oil. Injection of metal particles
   may deteriorate the recovery process by damaging porous media because of
   attractive forces such as van der Waals and electrostatic forces between
   particles and porous rock. A better understanding of these forces and
   their importance in the retention of particles is required.
   In this paper, the catalysis effect of pure nanometer-sized nickel
   during steam-injection application was compared with that of an
   industrial catalyst such as micron-sized Raney nickel. The changes in
   the viscosity, refractive index, and asphaltene content were measured
   after each test to analyze the catalysis effects. Nickel nanoparticles
   showed a better catalysis compared with Raney nickel. The approximate
   optimum concentration of the catalysts was determined. Then, the
   catalysis effect of nickel nanoparticles was studied in the presence of
   sandpack as a porous medium. The results showed accelerated catalysis in
   presence of the sands. Also, nickel nanoparticles improved the oil
   recovery factor.
   The next phase of this paper studies the injectivity and transport of
   nickel particles. The injected suspension was stabilized by use of
   xanthan gum polymer and ultrasonication. The effect of solution pH,
   which controls the magnitude of the repulsive electrostatic forces, was
   clarified. Stabilization of the metal particles' suspension was studied
   at different pH values through zeta-potential measurements. Also, the
   zeta potential of the recovered suspensions was studied to confirm the
   stability of the suspension during travel through the porous medium.
   Depending on the size, particles carry different charges and have
   different settling velocities. Therefore, the stabilization pH and
   dispersant concentration were different from one sample to another. The
   results of the injectivity tests confirmed the lower retention and
   better injectivity of nanoparticles in comparison with micron-sized
   particles.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Existing literature has shown that high relative humidity
   (RH) affects in vitro aerosol drug delivery of nebulizer and pressurized
   metered dose inhaler (pMDI) formulations. The aim of this study is to
   investigate in vitro mouth-throat deposition and lung delivery of
   selected solution and suspension pMDI formulations, under a range of RH,
   temperature, and flow rate conditions.
   Methods: The Alberta Idealized Throat was connected to a collection
   filter and placed in an environmental control chamber. The formulations
   selected were beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) in 13\% w/w
   ethanol/1.3\% w/w glycerol and HFA-134a propellant solution ({''}BDP
   HFA134a{''}), BDP in 13\% w/w ethanol and HFA-227 propellant solution
   ({''}BDP HFA227{''}), and Flixotide Evohaler (fluticasone propionate 250
   mu g/dose in HFA-134a suspension). Each of these pMDI formulations was
   dispersed into the mouth-throat and filter assembly in triplicate,
   according to an experimental matrix consisting of the following
   conditions: air flow rates of 28.3, 60, and 90 L/min; 0\%, 35\%, and
   80\% RH; operating temperatures of 20 degrees C and 40 degrees C.
   Results: There was a general increase in mouth-throat deposition and
   corresponding decrease in filter deposition (representing lung dose
   fraction), with increasing RH for both BDP HFA134a and Flixotide pMDIs.
   Increasing temperature from 20 degrees C to 40 degrees C resulted in
   decreased mouth-throat deposition and increased lung dose fraction for
   the solution pMDIs, but generally no effect for the suspension pMDI.
   Conclusions: Not only is the dose delivery of pMDI formulations affected
   by environmental conditions (in some cases causing up to 50\% reduction
   in lung delivery), but solution and suspension formulations also behave
   differently in response to these conditions. These results have
   implications during dosage form design, testing, and for usage patient
   use.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive and general nonlinear control/power
   management strategy for both converter- and synchronous-machine-based
   units in microgrids. The proposed controller offers the following
   advantages as compared to previously reported controllers: 1) It can
   fulfill requirements of both islanded and grid connected microgrids
   without a need for reconfiguration; 2) the controller-manager adopts
   cascaded angle, frequency and power control loops, which give enhanced
   power sharing accuracy and nominal-frequency operation at steady-state
   conditions (i.e., permanent frequency drop is eliminated); 3) the
   controller provides an emulated performance of synchronous machines with
   controllable damping and synchronization power components, which provide
   additional degrees of freedom to improve the dynamic performance of the
   system and easy integration in systems with multiple converters
   synchronous machines; 4) the controller is equipped with a nonlinear
   supplementary controller to mitigate large power angle swings associated
   with large-signal disturbances; 5) the controller can be easily adapted
   to conventional synchronous machines; and 6) the controller provides
   seamless operation under out-of-phase reclosing. The proposed controller
   can realize the concept of plug-and-play of DG units and micrgrids in
   smart power environment. The effectiveness of the controller to damp
   power oscillations and ensure system seamless performance in a wide
   range of operating conditions is validated by simulation results under
   various microgrid operating scenarios.}},

Title = {{Biogeochemical processes controlling the mobility of major ions and

Abstract = {{Increased production and expansion of the oil sand industry in Alberta
   are of great benefit to the economy, but they carry major environmental
   challenges. The volume of fluid fine tailings requiring storage is 840 x
   10(6) m(3) and growing, making it imperative that we better understand
   the fate and transport of oil sand process-affected water (OSPW) seepage
   from these facilities. Accordingly, the current study seeks to
   characterize both a) the potential for major ion and trace element
   release, and b) the principal biogeochemical processes involved, as
   tailing pond OSPW infiltrates into, and interacts with, underlying
   glacial till sediments prior to reaching down gradient aquifers or
   surface waters. Objectives were addressed through a series of aqueous
   and solid phase experiments, including radial diffusion cells, an
   isotope analysis, X-ray diffraction, and sequential extractions. The
   diffusion cells were also simulated in a reactive transport framework to
   elucidate key reaction processes. The experiments indicate that the
   ingress and interaction of OSPW with the glacial till sediment-pore
   water system will result in: a mitigation of ingressing Na
   (retardation), displacement and then limited precipitation of
   exchangeable Ca and Mg (as carbonates), sulfate reduction and subsequent
   precipitation of the produced sulfides, as well as biodegradation of
   organic carbon. High concentrations of ingressing Cl (similar to 375 mg
   L-1) and Na (similar to 575 mg L-1) (even though the latter is delayed,
   or retarded) are expected to migrate through the till and into the
   underlying sand channel. Trace element mobility was influenced by ion
   exchange, oxidation-reduction, and mineral phase reactions including
   reductive dissolution of metal oxyhydroxides - in accordance with
   previous observations within sandy aquifer settings. Furthermore,
   although several trace elements showed the potential for release (Al, B,
   Ba, Cd, Mn, Pb, Si, Sr), large-scale mobilization is not supported.
   Thus, the present results suggest that in addition to the commonly cited
   naphthenic acids, remediation of OSPW-impacted groundwater will need to
   address high concentrations of major ions contributing to salinization.

Abstract = {{The South Tailings Pond (STP) is a similar to 2300-ha tailing pond
   operated by Suncor Energy Inc. that has received oil sand
   process-affected (PA) water and mature fine tailings since 2006. The STP
   is underlain by a clay till, which is in turn underlain by the Wood
   Creek Sand Channel (WCSC). The sandy deposits of the WCSC provide
   greater geotechnical stability but could act as a potential flow pathway
   for PA water to migrate off site and into the Athabasca River.
   Preliminary modeling of the STP suggests that PA water from the pond
   will infiltrate into the underlying sand channel, but the extent and
   development of this impact is still poorly understood. Suncor Energy
   Inc. built interception wells and a cut-off-wall to control any
   potential seepage. Here we present the results of an investigation of
   the fate and transport of PA water in clay till underlying a 10 m x 10 m
   infiltration pond that was constructed on the southeastern portion of
   the STP. The geochemistry of pore water in the till underlying the
   infiltration pond was determined prior to filling with process-affected
   water (2008) and two years after the infiltration pond was filled with
   PA waters (2010). Pore water was analyzed for metals, cations, anions,
   and isotopes (H-2 and O-18). The distribution of conservative tracers
   (O-18 and chloride) indicated migration of the PA waters to
   approximately 0.9 m, but the migrations of major ions and metals were
   significantly delayed relative to this depth. Uptake of Na and Mo and
   release of Ca, Mg, Mn, Ba, and Sr suggest that adsorption and ion
   exchange reactions are the foremost attenuation processes controlling
   inorganic solutes transport. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR). The contents of elements
   sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) and the ratios of carbon/sulfur (C/S) and

   evaluating the distribution of SARA fractions in the bituminous layer.
   Results indicated that saturates and aromatics tend to deposit at the
   outer bituminous layer, while asphaltenes and resins were inclined to
   distribute at the inner layer. Results also suggested that the
   distribution of SARA fractions was thermodynamically dependent and
   susceptible to thermal treatment. On the basis of the experimental

Abstract = {{Obtaining accurate geological boundaries and assessing the uncertainty
   in these limits are critical for effective ore resource and reserve
   estimation. The uncertainty in the extent of an ore body can be the
   largest source of uncertainty in ore resource estimation when drilling
   is sparse. These limits are traditionally interpreted deterministically
   and it can be difficult to quantify uncertainty in the boundary and its
   impact on ore tonnage. The proposed methodology is to consider
   stochastic modeling of the ore boundary with a distance function
   recoding of the available data. This technique is modified to
   incorporate non-stationarities in the form of a locally varying
   anisotropy field used in kriging and sequential Gaussian simulation.
   Implementing locally varying anisotropy kriging retains the geologically
   realistic features of a deterministic model while allowing for a
   stochastic assessment of uncertainty. A case study of a gold deposit in
   Northern Canada is used to demonstrate the methodology. The proposed
   technique generates realistic, curvilinear geological boundary models
   and allows for an assessment of the uncertainty in the model.}},

Abstract = {{Thermodynamic calculations were carried out to derive the Gibbs free
   energy diagram for the amorphous and crystalline phases in the To-Rh
   system. These calculations predicted that the compositional range for
   the amorphous To-Rh phase was within 37-66 at.\% Ta, which was validated
   by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, high-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy (HRTEM) observations and resistivity measurements of
   as-deposited films. The thermodynamic modeling provided a valuable guide
   for selecting an amorphous composition suitable for diffusion barrier
   applications. The stability and metallurgical failure mechanism for
   TaRhx diffusion barriers in contact with Cu and/or Si were investigated
   by resistivity measurements, XRD analysis and detailed electron
   microscopy on samples annealed in 5\% H-2/95\% N-2 gas for 30 min at
   various temperatures. Amorphous TaRhx in contact with the Si substrate
   was stable up to 700 degrees C, whereupon TaRhx decomposed and reacted
   to form TaSi2 and RhSi. Si/amorphousTaRh(x) (13 nm)/Cu stacks, on the
   other hand, were stable only up to 550 degrees C. Failure occurred by
   reaction of Rh with the Si substrate to form RhSi at the interface. The
   large density of defects formed in the barrier layer as a result of
   outward diffusion of Rh facilitated diffusion of Cu to the Si/TaRhx
   interface to form Cu3Si particles. The formation of Cu3Si was observed
   to trigger further silicidation of the barrier to form a discontinuous
   TaSi2 layer. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   whole set of switching laws under consideration. Based on the properties
   of the worst-case switching law set, a low-complexity complete solution
   to the l(2)-induced norm evaluation problem is provided for general
   switched linear systems. It is shown that under the assumption of
   exponential stability, the finite-horizon l(2)-induced norm
   monotonically converges to the infinite-horizon norm, and the volume of
   the worst-case switching law set gradually becomes constant as the time
   horizon approaches infinity. Some numerical properties of the worst-case
   switching law set are also exploited. A numerical example is presented
   to illustrate the proposed results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An area-efficient CMOS impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) transmitter

   The core of the pulse generator is constructed using the cascade

   voltage-controlled current-source allows for generation of varying
   orders of Gaussian pulses, which in turn allows for controlling the
   power and spectral mask of transmitted signals. Fabricated in a TSMC 90
   nm digital CMOS process, the measurement shows that the fully integrated
   transmitter can generate fifth-to sixth-order Gaussian pulses. The core
   transmitter consumes 10.0-12.0 mW at 200 MHz pulse repeating frequency
   and occupies a chip area of 0.008 mm(2) only.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the relay selection (RS) problem in networks
   with multiple users and multiple common amplify-and-forward (AF) relays.
   We first give an optimality measure for RS in multiple-user relay
   networks. An optimal RS (ORS) algorithm is then provided, which is an
   extension of an RS scheme in the literature that maximizes the minimum
   end-to-end receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of all users. The
   complexity of the ORS is quadratic in both the number of users and the
   number of relays. A suboptimal RS (SRS) scheme is also proposed, which
   has linear complexity in the number of relays and quadratic complexity
   in the number of users. Furthermore, diversity orders of both the ORS
   and the proposed SRS are derived and compared with those of a naive RS
   scheme and the single-user case. The ORS is shown to achieve full
   diversity, while the diversity order of the SRS decreases with the
   number of users. For two-user networks, the closed-form outage
   probabilities and array gains corresponding to the minimum SNR of the
   users in the RS schemes are derived. It is proved that the advantage of
   the SRS over the naive RS scheme increases as the number of relays in
   the network increases. Simulation results are provided to corroborate
   the analytical results.}},

Abstract = {{Paclitaxel is a microtubule inhibitor causing mitotic arrest and is
   widely used in cancer chemotherapy. However, its poor water solubility
   restricts its direct clinical applications. In this article, we report
   paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles that are water soluble and that can
   improve the drug's bio-distribution and therapeutic efficacy.
   Paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles were synthesized by using Pluronic
   copolymers (F-68 and P-123) and surfactant (Span 40) as nanocarrier. The
   toxicity and cellular uptake of paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles were
   evaluated. The paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles can completely disperse
   into phosphate buffer saline to produce a clear aqueous suspension.
   Based on HPLC analysis, the drug-loading rate is 9.0 +/- 0.1\% while
   drug encapsulation efficiency is 99.0 +/- 1.0\%. The cytotoxicity assay
   was performed using breast cancer MCF-7 and cervical cancer Hela cells.
   For MCF-7 cells, the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of
   paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles and paclitaxel are 8.5 +/- 0.3 and 14.0
   +/- 0.7ng/mL at 48 hours and 3.5 +/- 0.4 and 5.2 +/- 0.5ng/mL at 72
   hours across several runs. IC50 of paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles and
   paclitaxel for Hela cells are 5.0 +/- 0.3 and 8.0 +/- 0.3ng/mL at 48
   hours and 2.0 +/- 0.1 and 6.5 +/- 0.3ng/mL at 72 hours. In-vitro studies
   show that the drug's nanoformulation gives obvious enhancements in the
   drug's efficiency at killing cancer cells over paclitaxel alone.
   Materials of the nanocarrier used for nanoformulation are approved with
   low toxicity according to the result of cell studies. Conclusion:
   paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles greatly improved the physicochemical
   properties of paclitaxel without modifying its chemical structure,
   allowing for deep-site cancer drug delivery and enhancing the drug
   therapeutic efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Vertically aligned few layered graphene (FLGs) nanoflakes were
   synthesized by microwave plasma deposition for various time durations
   ranging from 30 to 600 s to yield graphene films of varying morphology,
   microstructure and areal/edge density. Their intrinsic electrochemical
   properties were explored using Fe(CN)(6) (3-/4-) and Ru(NH3)(6) (3+/2+)
   redox species. All the FLG electrodes demonstrate fast electron transfer
   kinetics with near ideal Delta Ep values of 60-65 mV. Using a
   relationship between electron transfer rate and edge plane density, an
   estimation of the edge plane density was carried out which revealed a
   moderation of edge plane density with increase in growth time. The
   pristine FLGs also possess excellent electrocatalytic activity towards
   oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline solutions. This ORR activity
   can be further enhanced by exposing the pristine FLGs to nitrogen
   electron cyclotron resonance plasma. The metal free N-doped FLGs exhibit
   much higher electrocatalytic activity towards ORR than pristine FLGs
   with higher durability and selectivity than Pt-based catalysts. The
   excellent electrochemical performance of N-doped FLGs is explained in
   terms of enhanced edge plane exposure, high content of pyridinic
   nitrogen and an increase in the electronic density of states.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an overview of some of the challenges encountered in the
   fabrication and testing of MEMS-based piezoelectric devices is
   presented. All major steps involved in developing piezoelectric MEMS,
   with particular focus on energy harvesters, are examined in three main
   sections: Microfabrication, Packaging and Testing. Although the main
   focus of this paper are the challenges involved with vibration based
   piezoelectric energy harvesters, most of these challenges apply to other
   piezoelectric MEMS devices. Various techniques reported for each
   individual fabrication step are categorized to provide a summary of
   required information. This allows new researchers to estimate the
   overall fabrication process, available resources and equipment to
   prepare accordingly. In addition, challenges of each technique are
   pointed out explicitly with solutions from literature and our own
   research. These challenges are typically overlooked in results-based
   technical papers. Some of the technical solutions discussed were
   achieved in our experimental work. For other solutions found in
   literature, references are provided to address issues more in detail.
   Packaging piezoelectric energy harvesters can be especially challenging.
   Although a variety of packaging solutions exist for MEMS, these
   solutions are generic and must be adapted to fit the specific needs of
   the energy harvesters. This paper illustrates some packaging schemes
   that have been developed in our research to overcome these challenges.
   In addition, testing challenges and equipment requirements are discussed
   with sample results demonstrated. This article explores all fabrication
   steps, reviews literature, points out challenges and provides solutions
   with regard to developing piezoelectric MEMS.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafast studies(1,2) of excitations on the nanometre scale are
   essential for guiding applications in nanotechnology. Efforts to
   integrate femtosecond lasers with scanning tunnelling microscopes
   (STMs)(3) have yielded a number of ultrafast STM techniques(4-14), but
   the basic ability to directly modulate the STM junction bias while
   maintaining nanometre spatial resolution has been limited to similar to
   10 ps (refs 7,8) and has required specialized probe or sample
   structures. Here, without any modification to the STM design, we
   modulate the STM junction bias by coupling terahertz pulses to the
   scanning probe tip of an STM and demonstrate terahertz-pulse- induced
   tunnelling in an STM. The terahertz STM (THz-STM) provides simultaneous
   subpicosecond (<500 fs) time resolution and nanometre (2 nm) imaging
   resolution under ambient laboratory conditions, and can directly image
   ultrafast carrier capture into a single InAs nanodot. The THz-STM
   accesses an ultrafast tunnelling regime that opens the door to
   subpicosecond scanning probe microscopy of materials with atomic
   resolution.}},

   depth scanning. Discrete focal zones at several depth locations were
   created by refocusing light from a polarization-maintaining single-mode
   fiber pumped by a nanosecond fiber laser. The fiber and laser parameters
   were chosen to take advantage of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in
   the fiber to create a multiwavelength output that could then be bandpass
   filtered. The collimator lens and objective lens are chosen to take
   advantage of chromatic aberration in which each generated SRS wavelength
   peak focuses at a slightly different depth. The maximum amplitude of
   photoacoustic signals is mapped to form C-scan images. Additionally, all
   wavelength peaks fired simultaneously offers improved depth-of-field
   structural imaging at the cost of slight degradation of
   mainlobe-to-sidelobe ratios. Wavelength-tuned depth scanning over more
   than 440 mu m is demonstrated, significantly greater than the similar to
   100 mu m depth of field predicted from our focused Gaussian beams. The
   improved depth of focus could be valuable for structural imaging of
   microvascular morphology without the need for mechanical scanning in the
   depth direction. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We consider plane deformations of a composite material containing two
   interacting elastic inclusions of irregular shape which do not disturb
   the first invariant of an applied non-uniform stress field at infinity
   (so-called `harmonic inclusions'). Our analysis is based on a conformal
   map which maps the matrix region outside the two inclusions onto an
   annulus in the mapped plane. The unknown coefficients in the mapping
   function are uniquely determined via the continuity conditions of
   traction and displacement across the two inclusion-matrix interfaces. In
   our design, the two inclusions may have different and arbitrary elastic
   constants and the hoop stress remains constant along each of the two
   inclusion-matrix interfaces from the matrix side. The results are
   illustrated graphically. The set of permissible parameters leading to a
   one-to-one mapping is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Gypsum supersaturated process water has been shown to have an adverse
   effect on the flotation of sphalerite minerals. This study probes the
   mechanism of such effect by determining the uptake of copper and
   Xanthate on sphalerite in gypsum supersaturated water using zeta
   potential distribution measurement, atomic absorption spectroscopy,
   UV-visible spectroscopy and quartz crystal microbalance with
   dissipation. Our results indicate that the supersaturation of water by
   gypsum retards the adsorption of copper and hence the sequence xanthate
   adsorption on sphalerite. The retardation of copper and xanthate
   adsorption on sphalerite is also observed by the addition of 800 ppm
   calcium. The adsorption of calcium is identified to compete with copper
   species for the reactive surface sites of the sphalerite, resulting in
   the reduction in copper and xanthate uptake and hence flotation recovery
   of sphalerite. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Airspace Flow Programs (AFPs) assign ground delays to flights in order
   to limit flow through capacity constrained airspace regions. AFPs have
   been successful in controlling traffic with reasonable delays, but a new
   program called the Combined Trajectory Options Program, or CTOP, is
   being explored to further accommodate projected increases in traffic
   demand. In CTOP, centrally managed rerouting and user preference inputs
   are also incorporated into initial en route resource allocations. We
   investigate four alternative versions of resource allocation within CTOP
   in this research, under differing assumptions about the degree of random
   variability in airline flight assignment costs when measured against a
   simple model based upon the flight specific, but otherwise fixed, ratio
   of airborne flight time and ground delay unit cost. Two en route
   resource allocation schemes are based on ordered assignments that are
   similar to those used currently, and the other two are system-optimal
   assignment schemes. One of these system-optimal schemes is based on
   complete preference information, which is ideal but not realistic, and
   the other is based on partial information that may be feasible to
   implement but yields less efficient assignments. The main contribution
   of this research is a methodological framework to evaluate and compare
   these alternative en route resource allocation schemes, under varying
   assumptions about the information traffic managers have been provided
   about the flight operators' route preferences. The framework allows us
   to evaluate these various schemes under differing assumptions about how
   well the traffic managers' flight cost model captures flight costs. A
   numerical example demonstrates that a sequential resource allocation
   scheme where flights are assigned resources in the order in which
   preference information is submitted - can be more efficient than a
   scheme that offers a cost minimizing allocation based on less complete
   preference information, and may at the same time be perceived as
   equitable. We also find that assigning resources in the order flights
   are scheduled results in less efficient allocations, but more equitable
   ones. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research in the protein intrinsic disorder was stimulated by the
   availability of accurate computational predictors. However, most of
   these methods are relatively slow, especially considering proteome-scale
   applications, and were shown to produce relatively large errors when
   estimating disorder at the protein- (in contrast to residue-) level,
   which is defined by the fraction/content of disordered residues. To this
   end, we propose a novel support vector Regression-based Accurate
   Predictor of Intrinsic Disorder (RAPID). Key advantages of RAPID are
   speed (prediction of an average-size eukaryotic proteome takes <1 h on a
   modem desktop computer); sophisticated design (multiple, complementary
   information sources that are aggregated over an input chain are combined
   using feature selection); and high-quality and robust predictive
   performance. Empirical tests on two diverse benchmark datasets reveal
   that RAPID's predictive performance compares favorably to a
   comprehensive set of state-of-the-art disorder and disorder content
   predictors. Drawing on high speed and good predictive quality, RAPID was
   used to perform large-scale characterization of disorder in 200 + fully
   sequenced eukaryotic proteomes. Our analysis reveals interesting
   relations of disorder with structural coverage and chain length, and
   unusual distribution of fully disordered chains. We also performed a
   comprehensive (using 56000+ annotated chains, which doubles the scope of
   previous studies) investigation of cellular functions and localizations
   that are enriched in the disorder in the human proteome. RAPID, which
   allows for batch (proteome-wide) predictions, is available as a web
   server at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/RAPID/. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Three-phase (G/L/S) horizontal pipe flow data collected from the
   literature are used to evaluate the performance of a number of
   correlations designed to predict the pipeline pressure gradient. In the
   present study, a number of popular two-phase gas-liquid pressure loss
   correlations were modified for three-phase flow predictions. The primary
   modification is to assume that the slurry (L/S) mixture behaves as a
   singlephase. The modified Dukler and the Beggs and Brill correlations
   did not provide accurate estimates of the three-phase pressure
   gradients. When the classical Lockhart-Martinelli (L-M) correlation was
   used, along with a kinematic friction loss model to calculate the slurry
   (L/S) superficial flow pressure gradient, accurate predictions of the
   three-phase (G/L/S) pressure gradient were obtained provided the slurry
   did not exhibit non-Newtonian behaviour and that Coulombic (sliding bed)
   friction was negligible. Additional experiments should be conducted
   before the improved version of the L-M correlation is applied to
   commercial installations with pipe diameters greater than 100mm.}},

Abstract = {{In oil sands froth treatment, an undesirable intermediate layer, often
   accumulates during the separation of water-oil emulsions. The layer
   referred to as rag layer is a complex mixture of water, oil, solids and

   detrimental impact on the separation of water and fine solids from
   diluted bitumen. The current study focuses on characterisation of solids
   from a rag layer forming stream of a naphthenic froth treatment plant in
   an attempt to understand the mechanism of rag layer formation. Through
   detailed characterisation of rag-forming and non-rag-forming solids, the
   mineralogy of solids and their contamination were shown to be critical
   to rag layer formation. The iron-based minerals such as siderite and
   pyrite were found to be enriched within the rag layer. Analysis of
   surface organic complexes confirms a high level of organic matter
   associated with these solids through the binding of carboxylic acid
   group with iron on solids, resulting in a surface hydrophobicity
   susceptible for rag layer formation.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to perform mineral and chemical
   characterisation of the four petrologic end members of Alberta oil sands
   in order to better understand the mineralogical and geochemical factors
   affecting bitumen extraction. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results revealed
   that the petrologic end members contain a variable amount of quartz,
   clay minerals, carbonates, K-feldspar, TiO2 minerals and pyrite and the
   Fe-containing phases were also observed in Mossbauer spectra. Scanning
   electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) analysis also
   showed the presence of Fe-Ti oxide minerals. Mossbauer results also
   indicated the presence of lepidocrocite in the fine fractions in amounts
   below the detection limit of XRD. Interstratified illite-smectite was
   found only in clay-rich petrologic end members. Calcite and dolomite
   were primarily concentrated in the fine fractions of marine petrologic
   end members. Conversely, siderite was found mainly in the coarse
   fraction of estuarine petrologic end members. The relative amount of
   toluene insoluble organics was higher in the fine fractions of marine
   petrologic end members.}},

Abstract = {{Oil sands development is both a costly and technically complex business
   with potential concerns in land use, water consumption and greenhouse
   gas emissions. Therefore, it is of practical interest to further
   investigate novel techniques to improve profitability while diligently
   maintaining environmental compliance. Our approach for finding solutions
   to achieve this objective is to develop innovative strategies for
   advanced monitoring, optimisation and control of plant operations.
   Development of reliable process models is a key requirement for
   investigating the behaviour of complex systems. Such descriptive models
   can help to improve analysis, simulation, optimisation, design, control
   and operation of process systems at both micro and macro levels. This
   paper presents a summary of some of the successful applications focussed
   on development and implementation of inferential process models, also

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1427-1432}},

Abstract = {{In bitumen recovery from oil sands, a percentage of the bitumen is lost
   to tailings. The effect of fugitive bitumen on fines settling and
   consolidation in tailings ponds remains controversial. In the current
   study, the settling performance of mature fine tailings (MFT) in
   response to flocculant addition was considered by studying MFT of
   varying bitumen content. Bitumen content in the MFT was adjusted by
   controlled removal of bitumen using a Denver flotation cell. The initial
   settling rate of flocculated MFT was observed to increase with
   decreasing bitumen content from 0.45 to 0.18wt\%. A further reduction in
   bitumen content was found to dramatically decrease the settling rate of
   flocculated MFT. Such behaviour seems counterintuitive since the polymer
   flocculant was found to have a greater affinity for clean' surfaces
   (Al2O3) than for bitumen contaminated surfaces, as measured by quartz
   crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), which would predict a
   further increase in settling rate of flocculated MFT with decreasing
   bitumen content. The reduction in settling rate below a critical bitumen
   content is thought to result from selective removal of hydrophobic
   solids, since washing of untreated MFT with toluene is shown to
   significantly improve settling of flocculated solids. The current study
   confirms the use of flotation as a viable option to control MFT bitumen
   content and improve the settling rate of flocculated MFT.}},

Abstract = {{Stability of a bilateral teleoperation system may be jeopardized by
   controller discretization, which has been shown to involve energy leaks.
   This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing the absolute stability
   of sampled-data bilateral teleoperation systems consisting of
   discrete-time controllers and continuous-time master, slave, operator,
   and environment. The proposed stability analysis permits scaling and
   delay in the master and the slave positions and forces. The absolute
   stability conditions reported here impose bounds on the gains of the
   discrete-time controller, the damping terms of the master and the slave,
   and the sampling time. A design-related application of these results is
   in proper selection of various control parameters and the sampling rate
   for stable teleoperation under discrete-time control. To explore the
   trade-off between the control gains and the sampling time, it is studied
   that how large sampling times, which require low control gains for
   maintaining stability, can lead to unacceptable teleoperation
   transparency and human task performance in a teleoperated switching
   task. This shows that the effect of sampling time must be taken into
   account because neglecting it (as in the absolute stability literature)
   undermines both stability and transparency of teleoperation. The
   resulting absolute stability condition has been verified via experiments
   with two Phantom Omni robots. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Recently, studies on suboptimal precoding techniques for multiple-input
   multiple-output broadcast channels (MIMO-BC), which achieve performance
   near to that of the dirty paper coding (DPC), have drawn attention to
   vector perturbation (VP) precoding. In practice, each antenna or more
   generally each antenna group has its own limit on the transmitted power,
   which makes per-antenna-group power constraints more meaningful than the
   sum power constraint. In this paper, we introduce an optimization
   technique for VP precoding employing the minimum mean-square error
   (MMSE) criterion with per-antenna-group power constraints. This
   technique is inspired by the p-sphere encoding in a sense that it
   involves finding the node with the lowest mean-square error (MSE) over a
   lattice. We demonstrate that the MSE metric, as well as the p-norm one,
   can be enclosed in a proper Frobenius-norm ball. This Frobenius-norm
   ball shrinks until it captures the perturbing vector minimizing the MSE.
   Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms
   conventional VP precoding and the p-sphere encoding, but at higher
   complexity. Consequently, we investigate a couple of simplified
   techniques employing the MMSE criterion, which perform almost as well as
   the proposed precoding technique, but are less complex.}},

Abstract = {{We applied the split-step Fourier imaging method to back-propagate the
   ultrasound zero-offset wave-fields acquired on the bone surface to the
   sources of scatterers, which are the reflecting interfaces. The method
   required, as an input, an estimated slowness (reciprocal of half the
   velocity) model to map the time-dependent sonogram to the depth image,
   which provides the geometric properties of the interfaces. The slowness
   was approximated by a depth-dependent term and a first-order spatially
   varying perturbation. Simulated data sets were used to validate the
   method. The reconstructed images show proper mapping of the interfaces
   and the fracture, and a reasonable cortical thickness measurement with
   8.3\% error. The images also illustrate clearly the bone fracture
   healing process of a 1-mm-wide 45 degrees inclined crack with different
   in-filled tissue velocities for various healing stages. Reconstruction
   of a fractured bone plate using data from an in vitro experiment is also
   presented. This study suggests that the proposed imaging method has good
   potential in quantification of bone fractures and monitoring of the
   fracture healing process. (E-mail: lawrence.le@ualberta.ca) (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Local sources of knowledge structured in the form of logic
   descriptors-constructs of fuzzy logic, are arranged together
   (structured) in the form of a global model coming as a high-level
   granular logic descriptor. The inherent granularity of the global
   descriptor of this nature arises as a manifestation of the diversity of
   the locally available descriptors. The granular descriptor can be
   expressed with the aid of any of the formal models of information
   granules including sets, fuzzy sets, rough sets, probabilistic granules
   and others. The architectural essence of the granular descriptor, which
   supports a quantification of the variability among the sources of
   knowledge, is realized through an optimal allocation of information
   granularity. Information granularity is treated as an important design
   asset and its allocation throughout the parameters of the logic
   descriptors helps quantify the diversity of individual sources of
   knowledge. Various protocols of allocation of information granularity
   along with an overall quantification of their effectiveness are
   discussed along with their numeric characterization.}},

Abstract = {{The Web is a constantly growing repository of information. Amount of
   data that becomes available exceeds our abilities to search and examine
   this data in a reasonable time and with a practical effort. The data is
   stored in forms of documents, texts and web pages, which are not
   suitable for comprehensive analysis and search. In order to make the
   data stored on the Internet more accessible, a new model of data
   representation has been introduced-linked data. Linked data provides an
   open platform for representing and storing structured data as well as
   metadata. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for calculating the
   degree of similarity between two entities in the web of linked data. The
   idea is based on the fact that entities are submerged in the linked data
   and their semantics is defined via their connections to other entities.
   Therefore, similarity between two entities is determined by comparing
   connections of two entities to other entities. Firstly, the approach is
   introduced to determine semantic similarity in a context-free manner.
   This method does not select specific types of connections but takes into
   consideration all of them. Secondly, a context-aware approach is
   presented as a modification of the original method. In this case, a
   context is defined by a set of connection types-only connections of
   specific types are considered for similarity determination. The proposed
   approach uses concepts of possibility theory to determine lower and
   upper bounds of similarity intervals. We evaluate the proposed
   similarity assessment process by applying it to real-world datasets, and
   we compare it to other related methods.}},

Abstract = {{Adhesion of a particle with a substrate in presence of electrostatic
   interaction is an appealing area of research because of its significance
   in many biological and industrial applications. In this work, we study
   an interesting problem in which a charged flexible particle located in
   an electrolytic environment adheres to an oppositely charged rigid
   substrate due to the electrostatic attraction between them. The particle
   is a membrane filled with incompressible fluid and can undergo large
   deformation. Continuum theories are used to model the mechanics of the
   membrane and the electric potential in the electrolytic solution. The
   developed model allows us to examine the nature of the coupling between
   the electrostatic interaction and the deformation of the membrane. In
   particular, the deformation of the membrane causes non-uniform
   distribution of charges on its surface and significant electrostatic
   repulsion between these charges. This repulsion is most pronounced
   within and near the contact zone and provides a source of resistance to
   its further deformation and contact formation. As a result, the coupling
   between electrostatics and deformation is most significant for moderate
   deformation and becomes weaker for very large deformation. The relation
   between the total electrostatic adhesive force and the contact area
   shows similar scaling (F similar to a(n), where n = 3) to the classical
   Hertz theory of contact at small deformation, but the value of n
   increases as deformation increases. The dependence of this relation on
   the Debye length of the solution and the initial fluid pressure in the
   membrane is also investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Electrochemically anodized TiO2 nanotubular arrays can provide large

   with pre-synthesized hydroxyapatite within 5 days while only a thin film
   composed of calcium phosphorous chemicals formed on as-formed TiO2

Abstract = {{Porous carbide composites were synthesized by reactive sintering of
   chromium oxide mixed with various amounts of cobalt ranging from 5 wt\%
   to 50 wt\% in carbonaceous environments. It was found that the porous
   structure of the obtained samples changed with the cobalt content.
   Higher cobalt content increased the porosity but reduced the pore size.
   It was determined that the porous samples were mainly composed of M(Cr,
   Co)(7)C-3 phase when the cobalt content was below 30 wt\%. When more
   cobalt was added, cobalt enriched phases were formed. The solubility of
   cobalt in M(Cr, Co)(7)C-3 phase was also examined and compared with the
   data published previously. The hardness of the porous composites was
   evaluated and rationalized based on the combined effect of pore
   structures, solubility of cobalt and the composite phases present in the
   porous structure. The M(Cr, Co)(7)C-3 phase can be strengthened by
   increasing cobalt dissolution. A solubility of cobalt in M(Cr, Co)(7)C-3
   phase near its theoretic limit can be achieved by the current reactive
   sintering at the temperature and time much less than that reported by
   any other methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new aerosol particle classifier, the aerodynamic aerosol classifier
   (AAC), is presented and its classifying characteristics are determined
   theoretically. The AAC consists of two rotating coaxial cylinders
   rotating at the same angular velocity. The aerosol to be classified
   enters through a gap in the inner cylinder and is carried axially by
   particle-free sheath flow. The centrifugal force causes the particles
   between the rotating cylinders to move in the radial direction and
   particles of a narrow range of particle relaxation times exit the
   classifier through a gap in the outer cylinder with the sample flow.
   Particles with larger relaxation times impact and adhere to the outer
   cylinder and particles with smaller relaxation times exit the classifier
   with the exhaust flow. Thus, the aerosol is classified by particle
   relaxation time from which the aerodynamic equivalent diameter can
   easily be found. Four theoretical models of the instrument transfer
   function are developed. Analytical particle streamline models (with and
   without the effects of particle diffusion), like those often used for
   mobility classifiers, are developed for the case when the centrifugal
   acceleration field is assumed to be uniform in the radial direction.
   More accurate models are developed when this assumption is not made.
   These models are the analytical limiting trajectory model which neglects
   the effects of diffusion and a numerical convective diffusion model that
   does not. It is shown that these models agree quite well when the gap
   between the cylinders is small compared to the radii of the cylinders.
   The models show that, theoretically, the AAC has a relatively wide
   classification range and high resolution. Copyright 2013 American

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel, simple, yet powerful and robust method for
   rotation invariant texture classification. Like the Local Binary
   Patterns (LBP), the proposed method considers at each pixel a
   neighboring function defined on a circle of radius R. We define local
   frequency components as the magnitude of the coefficients of the 1D
   Fourier transform of the neighboring function. By applying different
   bandpass filters on the 2D Fourier transform of the local frequency
   components, we define our Local Frequency Descriptors (LFD). The LFD
   features are added dynamically from low frequencies to high. The
   features defined in this paper are invariant to rotation. As well, they
   are robust to noise. The experimental results on the Outex, CUReT, and
   KTH-TIPS datasets show that the proposed method outperforms
   state-of-the-art texture analysis methods. The results also show that
   the proposed method is very robust to noise. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{Organic spin valve array, with vertically oriented methanofullerene
   {[}6, 6]-phenyl C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) nanotubes as
   spacer, has been prepared by combining an electrochemical self-assembly
   with a recently developed fixed angle centrifuge-assisted organic
   nanowire growth technique. The PCBM nanotubes are similar to 325 nm
   long, have outer shell diameter of similar to 70 nm, and inner shell
   diameter of similar to 45 nm. In spite of the relatively long channel
   length, these devices exhibit an inverse spin valve effect, which
   persists even at room temperature. Spin relaxation length in PCBM
   nanotubes is relatively temperature-independent and its lower limit is
   estimated to be similar to 50 nm at room temperature. This is the
   largest room-temperature spin relaxation length in organic nanowire
   systems, including carbon nanotubes reported to date, and identifies
   PCBM as a promising material for room temperature organic
   nanospintronics. Observation of spin valve signals in these devices is
   due to efficient spin selective transmission at the interfacial Schottky
   barriers. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Changes to the North American snowpacks for 1979-2007 were detected from
   snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieved empirically from horizontally
   polarized brightness temperature (T-B) of a scanning multichannel
   microwave radiometer (18 and 37 GHz) and special sensor microwave imager
   (19 and 37 GHz) passive microwave data using the nonparametric Kendall's
   test. The predominant SWE trends detected agree with negative anomalies
   in snow cover observed in Northern Hemisphere since the 1980s, and both
   the SWE and snow cover results should be related to the significant
   increase in the surface temperature of North America (NA) observed since
   the 1970s. About 30\% of detected decreasing trends of SWE for 1979-2007
   are statistically significant, which is three times more than the
   significant increasing trends of SWE detected in NA. Significant
   decreasing SWE trends are more extensive in Canada than in the United
   States. The mean trend magnitudes detected for December-April are -0.4
   to -0.5 mm/yr, which means an overall reduction of snow depth of about
   5-8 cm in 29 years (assuming a snowpack density between 200 and 250
   kg/m(3)), which can impact regions relying on spring snowmelt for water
   supply. From detected increasing (decreasing) trends of gridded
   temperature (precipitation) based on the North American Regional
   Reanalysis data set and the University of Delaware data set for NA,
   their respective correlations with SWE data and other findings, such as
   global scale decline of snow cover, longer rainfall seasons, etc., it
   seems the extensive decreasing trends in SWE detected mainly in Canada
   are more caused by increasing temperatures than by decreasing
   precipitation. However, climate anomalies could also contribute to the
   detected trends, such as PC1 of NA's SWE, which is found to be
   correlated to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index and marginally
   correlated to the Pacific North American pattern.}},

Title = {{Effect of interleukin-1 beta treatment on co-cultures of human meniscus
   cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is a major mediator of local
   inflammation present in injured joints. In this study, we aimed at
   comparing the effect of IL-1 beta on engineered tissues from MCs, BMSCs
   and co-cultured MCs and BMSCs.
   Methods: We compared the effect of IL-1 beta in 3 groups: (1) MCs, (2)
   BMSCs and, (3) co-cultures of MCs and BMSCs. We selected 1 to 3 ratio of
   MCs to BMSCs for the co-cultures. Passage two (P2) human BMSCs were
   obtained from two donors. Human MCs were isolated from menisci of 4
   donors. Mono-cultures of MCs and BMSCs, and co-cultures of MCs and BMSCs
   were cultured in chondrogenic medium with TGF beta 3, as cell pellets
   for 14 days. Thereafter, pellets were cultured for 3 more days in same
   medium as before with or without IL-1 beta (500 pg/ml). Pellets were
   assessed histologically, biochemically and by RT-PCR for gene expression
   of aggrecan, sox9, MMP-1, collagens I and II. Statistics was performed
   using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-tests.
   Results: Co-cultured pellets were the most intensely stained with
   safranin O and collagen II. Co-cultured pellets had the highest
   expression of sox9, collagen I and II. IL-1 beta treatment slightly
   reduced the GAG/DNA of co-cultured pellets but still exceeded the sum of
   the GAG/DNA from the proportion of MCs and BMSCs in the co-cultured
   pellets. After IL-1 beta treatment, the expression of sox9, collagen I
   and II in co-cultured pellets was higher compared to their expression in
   pure pellets. IL-1 beta induced MMP-1 expression in mono-cultures of MCs
   but not significantly in mono-cultures of BMSCs or in co-cultured
   pellets. IL-1 beta induced MMP-13 expression in mono-cultured pellets of
   BMSCs and in co-cultured pellets.
   Conclusions: Co-cultures of MCs and BMSCs resulted in a synergistic
   production of cartilaginous matrix compared to mono-cultures of MCs and
   BMSCs. IL-1 beta did not abrogate the accumulated GAG matrix in
   co-cultures but mediated a decreased mRNA expression of aggrecan,
   collagen II and Sox9. These results strengthen the combinatorial use of
   primary MCs and BMSCs as a cell source for meniscus tissue engineering
   by demonstrating retention of fibrochondrogenic phenotype after exposure
   to IL-1 beta.}},

Abstract = {{We used molecular dynamics simulation together with the OPLS-AA force
   field along with a high temperature equilibration protocol proposed by
   Belmares et al. to calculate selected thermodynamic properties of
   poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with different tacticities. The results showed
   that the OPLS-AA force field was able to reproduce specific volumes,
   thermal expansion coefficients, glass transition temperatures and
   solubility parameters of the PVAs over a wide range of temperatures
   (200-550 K). PVA with different tacticities in the amorphous phase
   showed different solubility parameters but possessed similar specific
   volumes, thermal expansion coefficients and glass transition
   temperatures. For heat capacities, 300\% overestimations were obtained.
   Such overestimations were reduced significantly to about 30\% by
   applying the quantum correction method of Berens et al. We have also
   applied the newly developed two-phase thermodynamic (2 PT) approach in
   an attempt to further improve the results but failed. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The limits of fully developed turbulence are defined in the wall jet and
   in the recirculation flow for three different impeller geometries: A310,
   HE3 and PBTD. At two different tank scales, mean velocity profiles in
   both the wall jet and the recirculation flow were measured to determine
   whether the condition of fully turbulent self-similarity is satisfied.
   Higher impeller Reynolds numbers are able to keep the flow fully
   turbulent higher in the tank. In addition to the expected effect of
   impeller Reynolds number, the fluid also affected the flow regime.
   Measurements in a pilot scale stirred tank gave similar results.
   Although the power number is often constant for Re > 20 000, an impeller
   Re >= 300 000 is required to keep the flow in the fully turbulent regime
   in the top third of the tank and in the recirculation zone. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Stationary phase morphology and surface chemistry dictate the properties
   of ultrathin-layer chromatography (UTLC) media and interactions with
   analytes in sample mixtures. In this paper, we combined two powerful
   thin film deposition techniques to create composite chromatography
   nanomaterials. Glancing angle deposition (GLAD) produces high surface
   area columnar microstructures with aligned macropores well-suited for
   UTLC. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) enables precise fabrication of
   conformal, nanometer-scale coatings that can tune surfaces of these UTLC
   films. We coated similar to 5 mu m thick GLAD SiO2 UTLC media with <10
   nm thick ALD metal oxides (Al2O3, ZrO2, and ZnO) to decouple surface
   chemistry from the underlying GLAD scaffold microstructure. The effects
   of ALD coatings on GLAD UTLC media were investigated using transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), gas adsorption porosimetry, and lipophilic
   dye separations. The results collectively show that the most significant
   changes occur over the first few nanometers of ALD coating. They further
   demonstrate independent control of film microstructure and surface
   characteristics. ALD coatings can enhance complex GLAD microstructures
   to engineer new composite nanomaterials potentially useful in analytical
   chromatography. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Bacteriophage Receptor Binding Protein Based Assays for the Simultaneous
   Detection of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JUL 18}},
Abstract = {{Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the most common
   bacterial causes of foodborne gastroenteritis which is occasionally
   followed by a debilitating neuropathy known as Guillain-Barre syndrome.
   Rapid and specific detection of these pathogens is very important for
   effective control and quick treatment of infection. Most of the
   diagnostics available for these organisms are time consuming and require
   technical expertise with expensive instruments and reagents to perform.
   Bacteriophages bind to their host specifically through their receptor
   binding proteins (RBPs), which can be exploited for pathogen detection.
   We recently sequenced the genome of C. jejuni phage NCTC12673 and
   identified its putative host receptor binding protein, Gp047. In the
   current study, we localized the receptor binding domain to the
   C-terminal quarter of Gp047. CC-Gp047 could be produced recombinantly
   and was capable of agglutinating both C. jejuni and C. coli cells unlike
   the host range of the parent phage which is limited to a subset of C.
   jejuni isolates. The agglutination procedure could be performed within
   minutes on a glass slide at room temperature and was not hindered by the
   presence of buffers or nutrient media. This agglutination assay showed
   100\% specificity and the sensitivity was 95\% for C. jejuni (n = 40)
   and 90\% for C. coli (n = 19). CC-Gp047 was also expressed as a fusion
   with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Chimeric EGFP\_CC-Gp047
   was able to specifically label C. jejuni and C. coli cells in mixed
   cultures allowing for the detection of these pathogens by fluorescent
   microscopy. This study describes a simple and rapid method for the
   detection of C. jejuni and C. coli using engineered phage RBPs and
   offers a promising new diagnostics platform for healthcare and
   surveillance laboratories.}},

Abstract = {{Circumpolar rivers, including the Mackenzie River in Canada, are sources
   of the contaminant mercury (Hg) to the Arctic Ocean, but few Hg export
   studies exist for these rivers. During the 2007-2010 freshet and open
   water seasons, we collected river water upstream and downstream of the
   Mackenzie River delta to quantify total mercury (THg) and methylmercury
   (MeHg) concentrations and export. Upstream of the delta, flow-weighted
   mean concentrations of bulk THg and MeHg were 14.6 +/- 6.2 ng L-1 and
   0.081 +/- 0.045 ng L-1, respectively. Only 11-13\% and 44-51\% of bulk
   THg and MeHg export was in the dissolved form. Using
   concentration-discharge relationships, we calculated bulk THg and MeHg
   export into the delta of 2300-4200 kg yr(-1) and 15-23 kg yr(-1) over
   the course of the study. Discharge is not presently known in channels
   exiting the delta, so we assessed differences in river Hg concentrations
   upstream and downstream of the delta to estimate its influence on Hg
   export to the ocean. Bulk THg and MeHg concentrations decreased 19\% and
   11\% through the delta, likely because of particle settling and other
   processes in the floodplain. These results suggest that northern deltas
   may be important accumulators of river Hg in their floodplains before
   export to the Arctic Ocean.}},

   adhesion to inert surfaces in aquatic environments}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{90-98}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Bacterial initial adhesion to inert surfaces in aquatic environments is
   highly dependent on the surface properties of the substratum, which can
   be altered significantly by the formation of conditioning films. In this
   study, the impact of conditioning films formed with extracellular
   polymeric substances (EPS) on bacterial adhesion was investigated.
   Adhesion of wild type Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to slides coated with
   model EPS components (alginate, humic substances, and bovine serum
   albumin (BSA)) was examined. Surface roughness of conditioning film
   coated slides was evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and its
   effect on the bacterial initial adhesion was not significant. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were performed to determine the
   elemental surface compositions of bacterial cells and substrates.
   Results showed that bacterial adhesion to bare slides and slides coated
   with alginate and humic substances increased as ionic strength
   increased. Conversely, BSA coating enhanced bacterial adhesion at low
   ionic strength but hindered adhesion at higher ionic strength. It was
   concluded that forces other than hydrophobic and electrostatic
   interactions were involved in controlling bacterial adhesion to BSA
   coated surfaces. A steric model for polymer brushes that considers the
   combined influence of steric effects and DLVO interaction forces was
   shown to adequately describe the observed bacterial adhesion behaviors.

   respectively. This test digester COD loading represented 240\% of the
   control digester COD loading. At this loading, test digester biogas
   production was 67\% greater than that of the control. During the test
   digester quasi steady state loading period when VS from GTW represented
   19\% of its total VS loading, the test digester COD and VS removal rates
   were 2.5 and 1.5 fold those of the control digester, respectively. The
   test digester biogas production declined markedly when the percentage of
   VS from GTW in its feed was increased to 30\% of its total VS loading.
   Causes of the reduced biogas production were investigated and attributed
   to inhibition due to long chain fatty acid accumulation. (C) 2013

Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{140-150}},
Month = {{JUL 11}},
Abstract = {{Chattering alarms, which repeatedly and rapidly make transitions between
   alarm and normal states in a short time period, are the most common form
   of nuisance alarms that severely degrade the performance of alarm
   systems for industrial plants. One reason for chattering alarms is the
   presence of oscillation in process signals. The paper proposes an online
   method to promptly detect the chattering alarms due to oscillation and
   to effectively reduce the number of chattering alarms. In particular, a
   revised chattering index is proposed to quantify the level of chattering
   alarms; the discrete cosine transform-based method is used to detect the
   presence of oscillation; two mechanisms by adjusting the alarm trippoint
   and using a delay timer are exploited to reduce the number of chattering
   alarms. An industrial case study is provided to illustrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERAL PROCESSING}},

Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{29-35}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Chitosan was exploited as a selective depressant in the differential
   Pb-Zn sulfide flotation at pH 4 on artificial galena and sphalerite
   mixtures. The mixtures were prepared in two different approaches. In the
   first approach, the high purity galena and sphalerite were blended
   directly whereas in the second approach, the sphalerite was coated with
   copper before blending with galena. Using the first approach, it was
   found that lead ions contaminated the sphalerite surface making the
   separation non-selective. After adding EDTA, sphalerite was depressed by
   chitosan while galena was floated at pH 4. Using the second approach,
   i.e., that the sphalerite was pre-coated with copper before mixing with
   galena, it was found that the sphalerite was selectively depressed by
   chitosan without the need to add EDTA. ToF-SIMS and XPS were used to
   study the interactions of chitosan with uncoated sphalerite and
   copper-coated sphalerite. The results indicated that the amine groups
   and the hydroxyl groups in chitosan were involved in the strong
   interaction between chitosan and sphalerite whether the latter was
   coated by copper or not. Chitosan did not interact strongly with galena
   as reported previously. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce the photonic analog of electronic van Hove singularities

   Unlike photonic and electronic crystals, the VHS in metamaterials are

   manifested in the near-field local density of optical states in spite of
   the losses, dispersion, and finite unit-cell size of the hyperbolic

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{Microtubules supported by surrounding cross linkers in eukaryotic cells
   can bear a much higher compressive force than free-standing
   microtubules. Different from some previous studies, which treated the
   surroundings as a continuum elastic foundation or elastic medium, the
   present paper develops amicromechanics numerical model to examine the
   role of randomly distributed discrete cross linkers in the buckling of
   compressed microtubules. First, the proposed numerical approach is
   validated by reproducing the uniform multiwave buckling mode predicted
   by the existing elastic-foundation model. For more realistic buckling of
   microtubules surrounded by randomly distributed cross linkers, the
   present numerical model predicts that the buckling mode is localized at
   one end in agreement with some known experimental observations. In
   particular, the critical force for localized buckling, predicted by the
   present model, is insensitive to microtubule length and can be about 1
   order of magnitude lower than those given by the elastic-foundation
   model, which suggests that the elastic-foundation model may have
   overestimated the critical force for buckling of microtubules in vivo.
   In addition, unlike the elastic-foundation model, the present model can
   capture the effect of end conditions on the critical force and
   wavelength of localized buckling. Based on the known data of spacing and
   elastic constants of cross linkers available in literature, the critical
   force and wavelength of the localized buckling mode, predicted by the
   present model, are compared to some experimental data with reasonable
   agreement. Finally, two empirical formulas are proposed for the critical
   force and wavelength of the localized buckling of microtubules
   surrounded by cross linkers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the stability analysis and active-impedance-based
   stabilization of pulsewidth modulated voltage-source rectifier (VSR)
   loads in grid-connected and isolated voltage-source inverter (VSI)-based
   microgrid systems. Using small-signal analysis, detailed and coupled
   admittance-based models of the VSR-interfaced load and the source side
   are obtained in the rotating reference frame by considering all control
   loops and phase-locked loop dynamics. Therefore, a
   multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) impedance-admittance network is yielded.
   Using the generalized Nyquist stability criterion, it is shown that a
   VSR-interfaced load can negatively interact with the source-side
   dynamics resulting in unstable voltage response at the point of
   interconnection. To suppress these instabilities, proposed
   active-impedance-based compensators are implemented in the control

Abstract = {{Current source converters (CSCs) can be a viable option to interface
   large photovoltaic (PV) systems to the utility grid. However,
   interaction dynamics in both the ac- and dc-sides might be yielded and
   affect the converter stability. 1) On the ac side, interactions of the
   grid impedance with the LC ac-side filter might cause uncertain resonant
   frequency modes that should be damped without affecting the converter
   efficiency. 2) On the dc-side, under uncertain characteristics of the PV
   source impedance (e.g., number of PV modules connected and/or
   uncertainty in source circuit parameters), the Nyquist stability
   criterion might be violated due to equivalent source/load impedance
   mismatch. Moreover, the real part of the dc impedance of the CSC can be
   negative which contributes to instabilities of the PV system. In this
   paper, the ac-side LC filter dynamics are robustly damped by an improved
   active compensator in the control structure of the CSC. More
   importantly, the dc-side interactions dynamics are effectively
   stabilized by proposing active reshaping techniques for the dc impedance
   of the CSC so that the Nyquist stability criterion is maintained and
   positive damping is added. Time-domain model is implemented under
   Matlab/Simulink environment to validate the analytical results.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The proximal tibiofibular joint can be used as a source of
   osteochondral autograft with little to no morbidity at the harvest site.
   Methods: CT scans of fourteen left and seven right fibular heads, seven
   right and six left ulnas obtained from healthy subjects were
   volume-scaled and analyzed. Ipsilateral ulnar articular surfaces were
   compared between subjects and contralateral ulnas were compared within
   the same subject. The average deviations between the surfaces were
   measured. Manual registration and best-fit alignment were used to locate
   the area on the fibular heads that would best-fit the 50\% coronoid
   process surface.
   Findings: The average deviations in the articular surface between
   subjects were (mean (SD) 0.79 mm (0.17) and 0.76 mm (0.14) for the left
   and right ulnas respectively and 0.35 mm (0.07) in the same subject. The
   average coronoid process height of the scaled ulnas was 15.92 mm (1.15).
   When comparing the 50\% coronoid process with the ispsilateral fibular
   head geometries, the maximum deviations for all subjects were smaller
   than 2.0 mm. Two locations were identified as the best-fit locations.
   Interpretation: When volume-scaled, the articular congruency of the
   proximal ulna articular surfaces between subjects is within the
   allowable limit for a typical intra-articular fracture step. Results
   suggest it is possible to use the CT scan of a patient's contralateral

Abstract = {{A teleoperation system consists of a teleoperator, a human operator, and
   a remote environment. Conditions involving system and controller
   parameters that ensure the teleoperator passivity can serve as control
   design guidelines to attain maximum teleoperation transparency while
   maintaining system stability. In this paper, sufficient conditions for
   teleoperator passivity are derived for when position error-based
   controllers are implemented in discrete-time. This new analysis is
   necessary because discretization causes energy leaks and does not
   necessarily preserve the passivity of the system. The proposed criterion
   for sampled-data teleoperator passivity imposes lower bounds on the
   teleoperator's robots dampings, an upper bound on the sampling time, and
   bounds on the control gains. The criterion is verified through
   simulations and experiments.}},

Title = {{Experimental Investigation of Bitumen Recovery From Fractured Carbonates
   Using Hot Solvents}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{289-295}},

Abstract = {{With the decrease in conventional oil and gas reserves throughout the
   world and an ever-increasing demand for fossil-fuel-based energy and
   resulting high oil prices, focus has been shifting to unconventional and
   heavy oil and bitumen. Grosmont carbonates in northern Alberta have been
   estimated to contain at least 300 billion bbl of heavy oil or bitumen.
   However, recovering this oil is extremely difficult because of the
   complexity associated with carbonate reservoirs in general (e.g., the
   Grosmont unit is known to possess a triple-porosity system of matrix,
   fractures, and vugs, on the basis of core studies). The second problem
   is the fluid itself, which is highly viscous bitumen that is immobile at
   reservoir conditions. To extract this bitumen from heterogeneous
   carbonate rock, both heat and dilution using solvents may be needed.
   This paper reports the results and analysis of hot-solvent experiments
   conducted on original Grosmont carbonate cores.
   Three experiments were conducted using propane and one using butane as
   solvent. After heating the entire system containing the core sample,
   solvent gas was injected. The rock was allowed to soak in the hot
   solvent for a long time. The experimental temperature and pressure were
   decided on the basis of the results of our earlier work that suggested
   they be slightly above the saturation line of the particular solvent. An
   attempt was made to keep the conditions close to the saturation
   conditions of the solvent being used to maximize the dilution and,
   hence, the recovery. The oil produced was analyzed for viscosity and
   asphaltene content. The results in terms of recovery, the degree of
   dilution, and upgrading achieved suggested that butane was a better
   solvent for this bitumen. Finally, the optimum conditions for operation
   of the hot-solvent process were verified for Grosmont carbonates.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) modeling of site elements is beneficial to many
   construction management applications such as quantity takeoff and
   quality control. However, current practice lacks a solution that is
   computationally simple, cost effective, and easy to use in the field.
   This research proposes a 3D modeling method based on the mechanism of
   photogrammetry. It analytically processes the image data contained in
   site photos at a minimum in terms of image quantities and reference
   points. A minimum of five pairs of image points of the object from two
   photos taken at two different camera stations provide sufficient input
   data to analytically derive the positions and orientations of the camera
   stations. With more than five paired image points available, the least
   squares adjustment is utilized to refine the modeling result. The
   mathematical formulas are established for the proposed method, with the
   computational procedure and validity illustrated with examples of a
   simple box, a precast facade, and a residential building. These cases
   validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in
   modeling construction site elements, particularly for dimensional
   measurement related applications, and help researchers and practitioners
   to better understand the impact of the baseline, the overlap percentage,
   and the quantity of overlapping photos on the outcome of the 3D
   modeling. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The study is concerned with addressing hydrodynamic dispersion of an
   electroneutral non-adsorbed solute being transported by electroosmotic
   flow through a slit channel formed by walls with different zeta
   potentials. The analysis is conducted in terms of the plate height
   which, using the Van Deemter equation, can be expressed through the
   cross-sectional mean flow velocity, the solute molecular diffusion
   coefficient and a length scale parameter having meaning of the minimum
   achievable plate height and depending on the velocity distribution
   within the channel cross-section. The minimum plate height is determined
   by substituting distribution of electroosmotic velocity into the
   preliminary derived integral expression that is valid for any given
   velocity distribution within a slit channel cross-section. The
   electroosmotic velocity distribution within the slit channel
   cross-section is obtained by solving one-dimensional version of the
   Stokes equation accounting for electric force exerted on the local
   equilibrium electric space charge. The major obtained result is an
   analytical expression which represents the minimum plate height
   normalized by half of channel width as a function of two dimensionless
   parameters, namely, half of channel width normalized by the Debye
   length, and the ratio of the wall zeta potentials. The obtained result
   reveals a substantial increase in the minimum plate height compared with
   the case of equal wall zeta potentials. Different limiting cases of the
   obtained relationships are analyzed and possible applications are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The McMurray Formation of northern Alberta in Canada contains multiscale
   complex geologic features that were partially formed in a
   fluvial-estuarine depositional environment. The inclined heterolithic
   strata deposited as part of fluvial point bars contain continuous
   centimeter-scale features that are important for flow characterization
   of steam-assisted gravity drainage processes. These channels are common,
   extensive, and imbricated over many square kilometers. Modeling the
   detailed facies in such depositional systems requires a methodology that
   reflects heterogeneity over many scales. This article presents an
   object-based facies modeling technique that (1) reproduces the geometry
   of multiscale geologic architectural elements seen in the McMurray
   Formation outcrops and (2) provides a grid-free framework that models
   these geologic objects without relating them to a grid system. The
   grid-free object-based modeling can be applied to any depositional
   environment and allows for the complete preservation of architectural
   information for consistent application to any gridding scheme, local
   grid refinements, downscaling, upscaling, drape surface, locally
   variable azimuths, property trend modeling, and flexible model
   interaction and manipulation. Features millimeters thick or kilometers
   in extent are represented very efficiently in the same model.}},

Abstract = {{The thermally treated wood is a new value-added product and is very
   important for the diversification of forestry products. It drew the
   attention of consumers due to its attractive dark brown color. However,
   it loses its color when exposed to outside environment. Therefore,
   development of a protective coating for this value added product is
   necessary. In the present study, the efficiency of CeO2 nano particles
   alone or in combination with lignin stabilizer and/or bark extracts in
   acrylic polyurethane polymer was investigated by performing an
   accelerated weathering test. The color measurement results after
   accelerated weathering demonstrated that the coating containing CeO2
   nano particles was the most effective whereas visual assessment
   suggested the coating containing CeO2 nano particles and lignin
   stabilizer as the most effective coating. The surface polarity changed
   for all the coatings during weathering and increase in contact angle
   after weathering suggested cross linking and reorientation of the
   polymer chain during weathering. The surface chemistry altered during
   weathering was evaluated by ATR-FTIR analysis. It suggested formation of
   different carbonyl byproducts during weathering. The chain scission
   reactions of the urethane linkages were not found to be significant
   during weathering. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To implement model predictive traffic control to reduce congestion,
   traffic state variables such as flow, speed, and density need to be
   accurately predicted with real-time measurements. To evaluate the
   accuracy of online prediction of a macroscopic traffic model, this paper
   compares the predicted flow, density, and speed from a macroscopic
   simulation model with those from a microscopic simulation model, using
   METANET and VISSIM respectively, on a section of urban freeway. Three
   levels of traffic demands and seven different time step lengths in
   macroscopic simulation were applied to evaluate the compatibility of the
   two models. It was concluded that in the macroscopic simulation model
   there exists an optimum time step length, under moderate to heavy
   traffic demands the predicted traffic states from the macroscopic
   simulation are consistent with the outputs from the microscopic
   simulation, and under stop-and-go traffic states significant difference
   exists between the two models.}},

Abstract = {{Steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) boiler blow-down (BBD) water
   contains high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and total
   dissolved solids (TDS). A detailed understanding of the BBD chemistry,
   particularly the DOM composition, is important for better management and
   recycle of this water. In this study, we fractionated the dissolved
   organic matter in the BBD using DAX-8, Dowex, and Duo lite resins into
   hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions of acid, base, and neutral
   compounds. Additionally, the DOM was fractionated on the basis of size
   by filtering the BBD through a series of membranes with progressively
   tighter molecular weight cutoffs of 10, 3, and 0.5 kDa. Fluorescence
   excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs), specific UV absorbance
   (SUVA), and FTIR were used to characterize the water samples and the
   different fractions. The ion exchange fractionation revealed that the
   DOM contained a high percentage of hydrophobic acids (39\%) and
   hydrophilic neutrals (28.5\%). The different ion exchange fractions had
   distinct fluorescence excitation-emission signatures. The permeate
   samples from the membrane fractionation, on the other hand, did not
   reveal any significant difference in the fluorescence EEM spectra,
   indicating that the hydrophilic and hydrophobic constituents of the DOM
   could not be separated on the basis of pore size by these membranes. The
   SAGD boiler blow-down water was found to be significantly concentrated
   in DOM compared to oil sands mining process affected water.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a hybrid dimension reduction method that combines
   kernel feature selection and kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (KFDA).
   In the first stage, a kernel feature selection method is proposed to
   remove redundant and irrelevant features for two purposes: (1) reducing
   computation burden of the entire fault diagnosis system and (2)
   alleviating the impact of irrelevant features on KFDA. In the second
   stage, KFDA is used to establish a more compact feature subset by
   extracting a smaller number of features. We use Gaussian radial basis
   function as the kernel function for the two kernel stages in the
   proposed method. A parameter selection method for this kernel is
   proposed to select the optimal values for the proposed method.
   Experimental results on fault level diagnosis demonstrate that the
   proposed hybrid dimension reduction method has advantages over other
   approaches that use feature selection or KFDA separately.}},

Abstract = {{Amphiphilic polymers are effective in complexing and delivering
   therapeutic nucleic acids, such as plasmid DNA (pDNA) and short
   interfering RNA (siRNA). However, long-term stability of the complexes
   is not desirable, as it may have an impact on the transfection
   efficiency in vivo. To develop a method to preserve complex stability we
   first showed that pDNA complexes formed with the amphiphilic polymer
   linoleic acid-substituted polyethylenimine (PEI-LA) and incubated at 37
   degrees C lost similar to 90\% of their transfection efficiency after
   only 24 h of complex formation. Polyethyleneglycol modification of
   complexes to control the increase in complex size and incubation in
   scaffolds used for implantation did not preserve the transfection
   ability of the complexes. Among a variety of approaches explored,
   gelatin coating of complexes was found to be the best at maintaining the
   original transfection efficiency. Mechanistic studies suggested that
   improved complex uptake, not size stability, was responsible for
   retention of the transfection efficiency. Similarly to the results with
   pDNA, gelatin coating also prevented the decreases in uptake and
   silencing efficiency of siRNA complexes observed following incubation at
   37 degrees C. Gelatin-stabilized complexes were, furthermore, effective
   in vivo and led to subcutaneous transgene expression with a low pDNA
   dose that was otherwise ineffective. We conclude that a simple gelatin
   coating approach offers an efficient means to preserve the transfection
   efficiency of polyplexes. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to minimize errors that occur when using a
   four vs six landmark superimpositioning method in the cranial base to
   define the co-ordinate system. Cone beam CT volumetric data from ten
   patients were used for this study. Co-ordinate system transformations
   were performed. A co-ordinate system was constructed using two planes
   defined by four anatomical landmarks located by an orthodontist. A
   second co-ordinate system was constructed using four anatomical
   landmarks that are corrected using a numerical optimization algorithm
   for any landmark location operator error using information from six
   landmarks. The optimization algorithm minimizes the relative distance
   and angle between the known fixed points in the two images to find the
   correction. Measurement errors and co-ordinates in all axes were
   obtained for each co-ordinate system. Significant improvement is
   observed after using the landmark correction algorithm to position the
   final co-ordinate system. The errors found in a previous study are
   significantly reduced. Errors found were between 1 mm and 2 mm. When
   analysing real patient data, it was found that the 6-point correction
   algorithm reduced errors between images and increased intrapoint
   reliability. A novel method of optimizing the overlay of
   three-dimensional images using a 6-point correction algorithm was
   introduced and examined. This method demonstrated greater reliability

Abstract = {{The problem of power allocation is studied for a multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) decode-and-forward (DF) two-way relaying (TWR)
   system consisting of two source nodes and one relay. It is shown that
   achieving maximum sum-rate in such a system does not necessarily demand
   the consumption of all available power at the relay. Instead, the
   maximum sum-rate can be achieved through efficient power allocation with
   minimum power consumption. Deriving such power allocation, however, is
   nontrivial due to the fact that it generally leads to a nonconvex
   problem. In Part I of this two-part paper, a sum-rate maximizing power
   allocation with minimum power consumption is found for MIMO DF TWR in
   which the relay optimizes its own power allocation strategy given the
   power allocation strategies of the source nodes. An algorithm is
   proposed for efficiently finding the optimal power allocation of the
   relay based on the proposed idea of relative water-levels. The
   considered scenario features low complexity due to the fact that the
   relay optimizes its power allocation without coordinating the source
   nodes. As a tradeoff for the low complexity, it is shown that there can
   be waste of power at the source nodes due to the lack of coordination
   between the relay and the source nodes. Simulation results demonstrate
   the performance of the proposed algorithm and the effect of asymmetry on
   the considered system.}},

Abstract = {{In Part II of this two-part paper, a sum-rate-maximizing power
   allocation with minimum power consumption is derived for multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) decode-and-forward (DF) two-way relaying (TWR) in
   a network optimization scenario. In this scenario, the relay and the
   source nodes jointly optimize their power allocation strategies to
   achieve network optimality. Unlike the relay optimization scenario
   considered in Part I, which features low complexity but does not achieve
   network optimality, the network-level optimal power allocation can be
   achieved in the network optimization scenario at the cost of higher
   complexity. The network optimization problem is considered in two cases
   each with several subcases. It is shown that the considered problem,
   which is originally nonconvex, can be transferred into different convex
   problems for all but two subcases. For the remaining two subcases, one
   for each case, it is proved that the optimal strategies for the source
   nodes and the relay must satisfy certain properties. Based on these
   properties, an algorithm is proposed for finding the optimal solution.
   The effect of asymmetry in the power limits, number of antennas, and

Abstract = {{Magnetic gold nanoparticles (mGNPs) with uniform size and morphology
   synthesized by our sonication treatment method were covalently bound
   with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecules. Driven by an external
   magnetic field, FITC-labelled nanoparticles were delivered into plant
   cells with and without cell walls, evident from sectional transmission
   electron microscopy images. Confocal images further indicate that the
   green fluorescence in canola protoplasts and walled cells indeed came
   from the FITC molecules, instead of the chloroplasts' autofluorescence.
   FITC-labelled nanoparticles had a delivery efficiency of 95\% based on
   confocal images. In further study, plasmids were covalently bound with
   mGNPs, and delivered into canola cells with and without cell walls.
   After culturing for 48 h followed by staining with
   5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-glucuronic acid (X-Gluc), blue colour
   appeared in the protoplasts, while the walled canola cells showed a
   green colour that can be interpreted as the combination of blue and
   yellow from the suspension cells themselves. The presence of the blue
   colour indicates the expression of the GUS gene; therefore, the plasmids
   were successfully delivered into the canola cells. Furthermore, on
   examination, mGNPs were considered to be noncytotoxic by fluorescein
   diacetate staining.}},

Abstract = {{The potential effectiveness for long-term closure of a desulphurized
   tailings cover placed on reactive tailings at the Detour Lake Mine was
   assessed. The single-layer cover was aimed at reducing oxygen ingress
   using high water saturation to limit oxygen diffusion and consumption of
   oxygen in the cover by residual sulphide minerals. The cover was 1.0 to
   1.5 m thick and met desulphurization targets, but was coarser grained
   than the design. One-dimensional unsaturated flow and oxygen diffusion
   modelling was used to predict water content profiles, depth of oxygen
   penetration, and diffusive oxygen fluxes. Effective diffusion and
   reaction rate coefficients estimated from field data matched laboratory
   measurements. Depth to water table was identified as the most important
   factor for reducing tailings oxidation. The deeper (4 m) water tables
   measured at the cover edges led to a lower degree of saturation and
   higher oxygen flux. Finer grain size and higher air-entry values in the
   cover materials helped maintain saturation, and a capillary break (fine
   over coarse) cover reduced oxygen fluxes to <5\% of fluxes to uncovered
   tailings. The as-built cover (coarse over fine) reduced oxygen influx by
   at most 50\% and as low as <1\% of uncovered tailings.}},

Abstract = {{With the aid of self-consistent quantum-mechanical simulations and
   simple expressions for the radio-frequency (RF) metrics, we examine the
   impact of a lack of a bandgap on limiting the RF potential of graphene
   transistors. We consider the transconductance, gate-input capacitance,
   output conductance, unity-current-gain frequency, and unity-power-gain
   frequency. We show that the lack of a bandgap leads to all RF metrics
   being optimal when the bias point is chosen such that the drain Fermi
   level aligns with the Dirac point at the midpoint of the channel. We are
   also able to quantify the precise extent to which the lack of a bandgap
   limits the transistor's cutoff frequencies, an issue that has been
   flagged as requiring crucial attention to make graphene transistors
   competitive. For an 18-nm channel length, we show that the extrinsic
   unity-current-gain frequency could be improved by 300 GHz and the
   unity-power-gain frequency could be doubled if a bandgap could be
   introduced to reduce the output conductance to zero.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an improved self-adaptive particle swarm optimization
   (ISAPSO) algorithm is developed for estimating the best set of surge
   arrester model parameters. The purpose is to minimize the relative error
   between the calculated and manufacturer's measured residual voltage peak
   values for lightning, switching, and steep-front impulses. An objective
   function, which generalizes the model parameters for all impulse current
   types with different peak levels, is proposed. This objective function
   is the summation of three subfunctions that in each of them one type of
   impulse current with different current peak levels is considered. An
   efficient multiobjective approach is also applied along with the
   presented ISAPSO method. The proposed algorithm finds different sets of
   Pareto-optimal nondominated solutions for the objective functions. A
   fuzzy clustering technique is used to restrain the size of the
   repository within the desired limit. The proposed method is applied for
   a 150-kV TRIDELTA metal-oxide surge arrester in order to demonstrate its
   accuracy and effectiveness.}},

   appliance through a measurement-based comparative approach.
   Magnitude-related indices are introduced to compare the harmonic effects
   of the various appliances and to quantify their relative severity. Phase
   angle-related indices are introduced to study the diversity of the
   current harmonics phase angle among the devices and to understand its
   effect on harmonic cancellation. The proposed approach can be used to
   establish a database of harmonic characteristics for home appliances and
   other small, distributed harmonic-producing loads. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper compares three existing Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)
   formulations for simulating summer moisture variability in western
   Canada and a preliminary analysis of climate change impacts on summer
   moisture anomalies. The three models considered are Palmer's original
   algorithm (orPDSI), the self-calibrating PDSI (scPDSI), and a version
   modified for Canadian Prairie conditions (cpPDSI). In all formulations,
   potential evapotranspiration was parameterized by the Penman-Monteith
   method instead of the traditional Thornthwaite method. The scPDSI was
   used as a benchmark for evaluation as it is more appropriate for
   comparing drought severity of diverse climates. The results confirm that
   orPDSI produces inflated drought statistics as compared to scPDSI,
   whereas cpPDSI produced more conservative drought statistics than
   scPDSI. On the basis of results from scPDSI, historical moisture
   availability in the Canadian Prairies has shown a significant downward
   trend since 1950 at the 5\% level, whereas southern British Columbia has
   shown a significant increasing trend. No discernible trend was found in
   the northern parts of the study area. These results were corroborated by
   trends in annual precipitation and summer temperature over the
   respective regions. When scPDSI parameters were calibrated using
   historical climate data, simulations for the 2050s using climate change
   scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth
   Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) showed increases in summer moisture deficit
   relative to the 1961-90 baseline. However, projecting the extent to
   which the frequency of extreme drought and/or wet spell categories will
   change is not trivial since the computation of scPDSI is tied to the
   definition of the frequency of extreme events.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Genetic modification of human bone marrow stem cells
   (hBMSCs) before administration to a patient is emerging as a viable
   approach to creating tailored cells that perform effectively in a
   clinical setting. To this end, safe delivery systems are needed that can
   package therapeutic genes into nanoparticles for cellular delivery.
   Methods: We evaluated different plasmids on gene expression and compared
   the effective plasmids directly in hBMSCs. Then, we evaluated the
   transfection efficiencies of the polymeric carriers linoleic
   acid-substituted polyethylenimine (PEI-LA), polyethylenimine (PEI)-25,
   and PEI-2 using flow cytometry. We used
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to compare
   the toxicity of PEI-LA and PEI-25 on hBMSCs. We further assessed bone
   morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) secretion and the osteogenic activity of
   hBMSCs transfected with the polymeric (PEI-LA and PEI-25) gWIZ-BMP-2
   complex.
   Results: Unlike the transformed cells that gave robust (>50\%)
   transfection, only a few percent (<10\%) of hBMSCs was transfected by
   the developed nanoparticles in culture. The plasmid DNA design was
   critical for expression of the transgene product, with the choice of the
   right promoter clearly enhancing the efficiency of transgene expression.
   Using the in-house designed PEI-LA, hBMSCs secreted BMP-2 in culture
   (similar to 4 ng BMP-2/10(6) cells/d), which indicates the feasibility
   of using PEI-LA as a delivery system. Furthermore, we demonstrated an
   increased osteogenic activity in vitro for hBMSCs transfected with the
   PEI-LA containing the BMP-2 expression system.
   Conclusions: These results provide encouraging evidence for the
   potential use of a low toxic PEI-LA to genetically modify hBMSC. (C)

Abstract = {{In past research on the control of pneumatic actuators, typically
   proportional servovalves have been used for achieving high-performance
   control of the mass flow rate. In this brief, we instead use
   fast-switching ON/OFF valves due to their distinct advantages in terms
   of low cost and small size. Accurate control of pneumatic actuators with
   ON/OFF solenoid valves is a challenge since the system dynamics is both
   discrete input and highly nonlinear. In this brief, we apply a hybrid
   control algorithm to a pneumatic actuator with ON/OFF valves. Such a
   control approach is developed for choosing the best control vector at
   each sample time to track the reference state (i.e., desired force) in
   the inner force control loop within a bilateral teleoperation system.
   Experimental results show that good teleoperation transparency is
   achieved despite all the obstacles such as discrete input and nonlinear
   behavior of the pneumatic-actuated teleoperation system.}},

Abstract = {{The simplicity of synthesis of deterministically positioned inorganic
   semiconductor nanorods (NRs) and nanotubes (NTs) coupled with their
   chemical stability, high surface area, controllable optical properties
   and tunable surface functionality, have sparked worldwide research
   efforts towards biodiagnostic applications. Biosensors based on oriented
   and aligned one-dimensional (1-D) inorganic semiconductor nanostructures
   have demonstrated remarkable detection sensitivity, high throughput and
   label-free operability. In comparison to suspensions of nanoparticles
   and discrete randomly oriented nanowires, nanowire (NW) and nanotube
   arrays offer continuous charge transport pathways, a major advantage for
   all-electrical detection and in exploiting electrokinetic effects. We
   review highly sensitive biosensors based on oriented and aligned
   NTs/NRs/NWs employing conventional detection methods, inclusive of
   fluorescence, electrochemistry and electromechanical sensing as well as
   detection methods unique to nanowires such as field-effect transistors.
   Entirely new types of sensing applications such as the impaling of
   living cells to monitor cellular events in situ, and substrates with
   electrically controlled wetting for surface-assisted laser desorption
   and ionization are emerging to take advantage of the unique properties
   of nanowire arrays. Concurrently, we explain the semiconductor materials
   and architectures employed, and the functionalization procedures used to
   construct the biosensors. Aligned semiconductor array-based approaches
   are critically examined in relation to prevailing technologies to get a
   sense of the exclusive niches that nanotube/nanorod array biosensors
   inhabit. The versatility of the detection principles that
   nanowire/nanotube arrays are compatible with are enabling hybrid
   approaches where combinations of detection methods are used. Such
   advantages offset the complexity associated with changing the status quo
   with respect to the current state-of-the-art in biodiagnostic platforms
   and devices.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we introduce a new topology of radial basis
   function-based polynomial neural networks (RPNNs) that is based on a
   genetically optimized multi-layer perceptron with radial polynomial
   neurons (RPNs). This paper offers a comprehensive design methodology
   involving various mechanisms of optimization, especially fuzzy C-means
   (FCM) clustering and particle swarm optimization (PSO). In contrast to
   the typical architectures encountered in polynomial neural networks
   (PNNs), our main objective is to develop a topology and establish a
   comprehensive design strategy of RPNNs: (a) The architecture of the
   proposed network consists of radial polynomial neurons (RPN). These
   neurons are fully reflective of the structure encountered in numeric
   data, which are granulated with the aid of FCM clustering. RPN dwells on
   the concepts of a collection of radial basis function and the
   function-based nonlinear polynomial processing. (b) The PSO-based design
   procedure being applied to each layer of the RPNN leads to the selection
   of preferred nodes of the network whose local parameters (such as the
   number of input variables, a collection of the specific subset of input
   variables, the order of the polynomial, the number of clusters of FCM
   clustering, and a fuzzification coefficient of the FCM method) are
   properly adjusted. The performance of the RPNN is quantified through a
   series of experiments where we use several modeling benchmarks, namely a
   synthetic three-dimensional data and learning machine data (computer
   hardware data, abalone data, MPG data, and Boston housing data) already
   used in neuro-fuzzy modeling. A comparative analysis shows that the
   proposed RPNN exhibits higher accuracy in comparison with some previous
   models available in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown lower hippocampal
   volume in major depressive disorder (MDD). Preclinical and postmortem
   studies show that chronic stress and MDD may affect hippocampal
   subfields differently, but MRI spatial resolution has previously been
   insufficient to measure subfield volumes.
   Methods: Twenty MDD participants (9 unmedicated and 11 medicated, both
   >6 months) and 27 healthy control subjects were studied. We used
   T2-weighted two-dimensional fast spin echo and T1-weighted
   three-dimensional magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo
   sequences at 4.7 T to compare hippocampal subfield volumes at .09 mu L
   voxel volume.
   Results: Unmedicated MDD participants had a lower dentate gyrus volume
   than control subjects or medicated MDD participants and a lower cornu
   ammonis (CA1-3) volume in the hippocampal body subregion than control
   subjects.
   Conclusions: Hippocampal volumes in unmedicated MDD showed evidence of
   localization to specific subfields and subregions, findings that appear,
   on the surface, consistent with preclinical evidence for localized
   mechanisms of hippocampal neuroplasticity. Strengths include in vivo
   measurement of entire hippocampal subfields and separation between
   unmedicated and medicated MDD. Limitations include power to control for
   multiple comparisons and that MRI landmarks approximate the subfields
   defined by cellular microstructure.}},

Abstract = {{Chemotherapy is still the treatment of choice for many types of cancer;
   but its effectiveness is hampered by dose limiting toxicity. Properly
   designed delivery systems can overcome this shortcoming by reducing the
   non-specific distribution and toxicity of chemotherapeutics in healthy
   organs and at the same time increasing drug concentrations at tumor
   tissue. In this study, we developed stealth liposomal formulations of
   doxorubicin (DOX) having a novel stable engineered peptide ligand,
   namely p18-4, that binds specifically to breast cancer cell line
   MDA-MB-435 on its surface. The coupling of p18-4 to liposomes was
   carried out through conventional, post insertion and post conjugation
   techniques and prepared liposomes were characterized for their size and
   level of peptide modification. The p18-4 decorated liposomal DOX
   formulations were then evaluated for their cellular uptake as well as
   cytotoxicity against the human breast cancer MDA-MB-435 cells. In this
   context, the effect of coupling technique on the uptake and cytotoxicity
   of p18-4 liposomal DOX in MDA-MB-435 cells was evaluated. The
   conventional and post conjugation methods of peptide incorporation were
   found to be more reliable for the preparation of p18-4 decorated
   liposomes for active DOX targeting to MDA-MB-435 cells. p18-4 decoration
   of liposomes by these methods did not have a notable effect on the size
   of prepared liposomes and DOX release, but increased the uptake and
   cytotoxicity of encapsulated DOX in MDA-MB-435 cells. The results show a
   potential for p18-4 decorated liposomes prepared by conventional and
   post conjugation method for tumor targeted delivery of DOX in breast
   tumor models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background aims. The interaction between stromal cell-derived factor
   (SDF)-1 and its receptor CXCR4 is one of the mechanisms by which
   mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are recruited to sites of injury. SDF-1
   is upregulated in damaged tissues, but because the surface expression of
   CXCR4 on cultured MSCs is low, we investigated whether the delivery of
   CXCR4 into MSCs with the use of the cationic liposomal reagent IBAfect
   would increase their migration toward SDF-1. Methods. We examined (i)
   the effect of MSC confluency, passage number, duration of transfection
   and amount of IBAfect and plasmid on transfection efficiency as
   determined by flow cytometric analysis of CXCR4 and (ii) whether
   IBAfect-mediated CXCR4 transfection affected the viability,
   proliferation and differentiation of MSCs as well as their response
   toward an SDF-1 gradient in a trans-Matrigel migration assay. Results.
   We found that transfection efficiency of up to 40\% was achieved after
   24-h transfection of 50\% confluent MSCs (at passage 4) with an
   IBAfect:plasmid ratio of 3.6 mu L:0.6 mu g, and CXCR4 transcript
   expression in transfected MSCs was 10(5)-fold higher than in
   non-transfected cells. Transfected MSCs retained their ability to
   differentiate to osteocytes and chondrocytes but had lower
   proliferation. Importantly, overexpression of surface CXCR4 with the use
   of IBAfect significantly increased (>3-fold) the number of cells
   migrating toward an SDF-1 gradient relative to cells migrating to media
   alone, compared with non-transfected cells (1.3-fold). Conclusions. Our
   results suggest that IBAfect-mediated delivery of CXCR4 into MS Cs is a
   highly efficient technique that may be useful for enhancing the
   recruitment of systemically infused MSCs for tissue repair.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of drip emitter clogging with labyrinth channel was
   investigated experimentally to study the fine particle size and
   concentration effects in the irrigation water. Short-term clogging tests
   were performed using muddy water containing particles with 8 different
   sizes (all less than 0.1 mm). The particles used in this study were
   composed of fine sands, slit and clay. Afterwards, verification tests
   were conducted to prove the results obtained from short-term clogging
   tests. The impacts of particle size and particle concentration in muddy
   water on emitter clogging were analyzed by means of calculating the mean
   discharge and the Christiansen uniformity coefficient. The results
   showed that for particles that were smaller than 0.1 mm in diameter,
   sediment concentration significantly affected clogging. The clogging
   level of emitters increased with raising the concentration. Especially
   when the sediment concentration was higher than 1.25 g/L, the impacts
   became remarkable. On the other hand, the sensitive sediment particle
   range that could get emitters clogged easily was found. In this study,
   the sensitive particle range were D6 (0.038-0.034 mm) and D7
   (0.034-0.031 mm) The results aim to help in improving drip irrigation
   methods using water with high sediment concentration and providing
   experimental data for optimization design of emitter channel.}},

Abstract = {{Miscible gas injection (MGI) processes such as miscible CO2 flooding
   have been in use as attractive EOR options, especially in conventional
   oil reserves. Optimal design of MGI is strongly dependent on parameters
   such as gas-oil minimum miscibility pressure (MMP), which is normally
   determined through expensive and time-consuming laboratory tests. Thus,
   developing a fast and reliable technique to predict gas-oil MMP is
   inevitable. To address this issue, a smart model is developed in this
   paper to forecast gas-oil MMP on the basis of a feed-forward artificial
   neural network (FF-ANN) combined with particle swarm optimisation (PSO).
   The MMP of a reservoir fluid was considered as a function of reservoir
   temperature and the compositions of oil and injected gas in the proposed
   model. Results of this study indicate that reservoir temperature among
   the input parameters selected for the PSO-ANN has the greatest impact on
   MMP value. The developed PSO-ANN model was examined using experimental
   data, and a reasonable match was attained showing a good potential for
   the proposed predictive tools in estimation of gas-oil MMP. Compared
   with other available methods, the proposed model is capable of
   forecasting oil-gas MMP more accurately in wide ranges of thermodynamic
   and process conditions. All predictive models used other than the
   PSO-ANN model failed in providing a good estimate of the oil-gas MMP of
   the hydrocarbon mixtures in Azadegan oilfield, Iran. (c) 2013 Canadian

Abstract = {{Fluorescent silica nanoparticles are reported to be highly stable and
   biocompatible materials with high water solubility, which make them
   ideal candidates for biological applications. These nanoparticles can
   also be modified with biocompatible and targeting moieties and can be
   used for a variety of in vitro and in vivo applications, such as
   targeting, particle tracking, cargo carrier, and as contrast agents. In
   this study, fluorescent dye-doped silica nanoparticles were prepared by
   a modified Stober method. The nanoparticles produced were surface
   functionalized with amine moieties for their conjugation with
   glucose-derived and galactose-based residues. The amine,
   glucose-derived, and galactose-based functionalized fluorescent silica
   nanoparticles were analyzed for their physiochemical properties such as
   sizes, polydispersities, organic layer content, and surface chemistries.
   The nanoparticles produced were then studied for their interactions with
   carbohydrate-specific lectins. These lectin bioconjugates have helped in
   understanding their interactions with cell-surface receptors. As
   expected, galactose-functionalized nanoparticles were found to
   specifically interact with RCA120, as compared to other nanoparticles.
   These specific interactions of galactose-lectin conjugates were further
   studied on the hepatocytes cell surface in vitro. The aggregation of
   galactose-lectins conjugates on the plasma membrane was possibly due to
   the specific interactions of carbohydrates with cell-surface
   glycoproteins, hence preventing the uptake of these nanoparticles. The
   study has provided an interesting approach to mark the cell-surface
   glycoproteins with fluorescent probes using a combination of
   lectin-carbohydrate conjugates. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Abstract = {{ZnO branches with hydrophobic surfaces have been successfully produced
   in the presence of oleic acid (OA) through a phase transfer-based
   solution method. Results from field emission scanning electron
   microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis and Raman tests revealed that the
   obtained ZnO particles exhibited well-defined branch-like morphology and
   hexagonal wurtzite structure. Furthermore, surface characteristics of
   ZnO could be regulated according to the results of floating and active
   ratio tests. Fourier transform infrared spectra showed that OA
   interacted with ZnO particles through strong chemical adsorption.
   Room-temperature photoluminescence spectra were also used to
   characterize branch-like ZnO particles. Possible mechanism for the
   formation and surface modification of branch-shaped ZnO particles was
   applied. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights

Title = {{The acute phase of Wallerian degeneration: Longitudinal diffusion tensor
   imaging of the fornix following temporal lobe surgery}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{128-139}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Numerous animal studies have shown the applicability of diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI) to track Wallerian degeneration that occurs after injury
   to the neural fiber. Non-invasive biomarkers that may differentiate the
   early axonal breakdown and later myelin degradation have been attributed
   to either reduced parallel and elevated perpendicular diffusivity,
   respectively. While several human DTI studies have shown this potential
   at subacute and chronic time points, the diffusion changes that occur
   within the first week are unknown. Anterior temporal lobectomy (i.e.
   resection of hippocampus) is the standard surgical treatment of
   medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. The concomitant transection
   of the fimbria-fornix serves as a unique opportunity to examine the
   process of Wallerian degeneration since the timing is known. Six
   temporal lobe epilepsy patients underwent brain DTI before the surgery,
   three to four times within the first week post-operatively, and at one
   to four months following surgery. Both parallel and perpendicular
   diffusivities decreased markedly by a similar amount in the ipsilateral
   fornix within the first two days post-surgery. Approaching the end of
   the first week, perpendicular (but not parallel) diffusivity
   pseudo-recovered towards its pre-surgical value, but then increased
   dramatically months later. Fractional anisotropy, as a result of the
   combined action of the parallel and perpendicular diffusivities, stayed
   relatively stable within the first week and only reduced drastically at
   the chronic stage. DTI demonstrated acute water diffusion changes within
   days of transection that are not just limited to parallel diffusivity.
   While the chronic diffusion changes in the fornix are compatible with
   myelin degradation, the acute changes may reflect beading and swelling
   of axolemma, granular disintegration of the axonal neurofilaments,
   ischemia induced cytotoxic edema, and/or changes in the extra-axonal
   space including inflammatory changes and gliosis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{A detailed mathematical model that accounts for mass, momentum, heat,
   and electric charge transfer is developed for a tubular micro-solid
   oxide fuel cell. Electrochemical reactions as well as reversible and
   irreversible heat generation are modelled locally within the volume of
   each cermet electrode. The gas velocity profile and convective and
   conductive heat and mass transfer are modelled within each porous
   electrode and the gas channel. The heat transfer model includes the
   thermal radiation exchanged between surfaces.
   The simulation results are validated against electrochemical performance
   and temperature distribution experimental data. Simulation results are
   presented to give a detailed insight about several aspects of the cell's
   thermal behaviour. It is found that local heating within the electrodes
   is negligible when the temperature is controlled on the surface of the
   electrode. Temperature gradients along the cell's active length are
   found not to be negligible. Modelling heat transfer has a negligible
   effect on overall cell performance predictions for the specific setup of
   this study. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Maxillary expansion treatment is a commonly used procedure by
   orthodontists to widen a patient's upper jaw. As this is typically
   performed in adolescent patients, the midpalatal suture, connective
   tissue adjoining the two maxilla halves, remains unfused. Studies that
   have investigated patient response to expansion treatment, generally
   through finite element analysis, have considered this suture to behave
   in a linear elastic manner or it was left vacant. The purpose of the
   study presented here was to develop a model that could represent the
   midpalatal suture's viscoelastic behavior. Quasilinear viscoelastic,
   modified superposition, Schapery's, and Burgers modeling approaches were
   all considered. Raw data from a previously published study using New
   Zealand White Rabbits was utilized for model parameter estimation and
   validation. In this study, Sentalloy (R) coil springs at load levels of
   0.49 N (50 g), 0.98 N (100 g), and 1.96 N (200 g) were used to widen the
   midsagittal suture of live rabbits over a period of 6 weeks. Evaluation
   was based on a models ability to represent experimental data well over
   all three load sets. Ideally, a single set of model constants could be
   used to represent data over all loads tested. Upon completion of the
   analysis it was found that the modified superposition method was able to
   replicate experimental data within one standard deviation of the means
   using a single set of constants for all loads. Future work should focus
   on model improvement as well as prediction of treatment outcomes. (C)

Abstract = {{Oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) is the water contained in
   tailings impoundment structures in oil sands operations. There are
   concerns about the environmental impacts of the release of OSPW because
   of its toxicity. In this study, zonation followed by biodegradation was
   used to remediate OSPW. The impacts of the ozone process evolution on
   the naphthenic acids (NAs) speciation and acute toxicity were evaluated.
   Ion-mobility spectrometry (IMS) was used to preliminarily separate
   isomeric and homologous species. The results showed limited effects of
   the ozone reactor size on the treatment performance in terms of
   contaminant removal. In terms of NAs speciation, high reactivity of NAs
   with higher number of carbons and rings was only observed in a region of
   high reactivity (i.e., utilized ozone dose lower than 50 mg/L). It was
   also found that nearly 0.5 mg/L total NAs was oxidized per mg/L of
   utilized ozone dose, at utilized ozone doses lower than 50 mg/L. IMS
   showed that ozonation was able to degrade NAs, oxidized NAs, and
   sulfur/nitrogenated NAs. Complete removal of toxicity toward Vibrio
   fischeri was achieved after ozonation followed by 28-day biodegradation
   period. In vitro and in vivo assays indicated that ozonation reduced the
   OSPW toxicity to mice.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the near-field radiative thermal energy transfer properties
   of hyperbolic metamaterials. The presence of unique electromagnetic
   states in a broad bandwidth leads to super-planckian thermal energy
   transfer between metamaterials separated by a nano-gap. We consider
   practical phonon-polaritonic metamaterials for thermal engineering in
   the mid-infrared range and show that the effect exists in spite of the
   losses, absorption and finite unit cell size. For thermophotovoltaic
   energy conversion applications requiring energy transfer in the
   near-infrared range we introduce high temperature hyperbolic
   metamaterials based on plasmonic materials with a high melting point.
   Our work paves the way for practical high temperature radiative thermal
   energy transfer applications of hyperbolic metamaterials. (C) 2013

   droplet diameter and their angles, discharging velocity at the tip of
   the cone, the frequency of Taylor cones appearance, and their merging to
   each other are studied in this paper. Additionally, the circumstances of

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{400}},
Pages = {{130-134}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide an analytical derivation to show that the
   interfacial electrostrictive effects may modify the liquid-vapor surface
   tension. We propose that at the liquid vapor interface, there is
   possibility of an electrostatic field, which in conjunction with the
   inherent density and permittivity variations across the interface, will
   lead to an electrostrictive force. This force will act in tandem with
   the intermolecular van der Waals (vdWs) interactions and will modify the
   expression of the interfacial density profile as well as the surface
   tension. The final result is found to have very similar mathematical
   forms as that corresponding to the classical square gradient theory
   (with only vdW intermolecular interactions), allowing an easy estimation
   of the role of the electrostrictive effects on the overall surface
   tension. Depending on the parameters, the contribution of
   electrostriction in surface tension can be of the same order as the
   classical non-electrostrictive surface tension. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a method to predict the presence or absence of

   original problem of forming a ranking of the most likely classes can be
   solved by running several classification methods, the analysis presented
   here is moved one step further. The main objective is to analyse
   (classify) the provided rankings (an ordered list of rankings of a fixed
   length) and decide whether the ``true{''} class is present on this list.
   With this regard, a two-class classification problem is formulated where
   the underlying feature space is built through a characterization of the
   ranking lists. Experimental results obtained for synthetic data as well

Abstract = {{Wavelength selection is widely accepted as an important step in
   near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic model development. In quantitative
   online applications, the robustness of the established NIR model is
   often jeopardized by instrument response changes, process condition
   variations or new sources of chemical variation. However, to the best of
   our knowledge, online updating of wavelength selection has not been
   considered in NIR modeling and property prediction. In this article, a
   new model-updating approach is proposed that can adjust to process
   changes by recursively selecting the NIR model structure in terms of
   wavelength. The advantage of the presented approach is that it can
   recursively adjust both wavelength selection and model coefficients
   according to real process variations. The performance of the Method was
   tested on a spectroscopic data set from a refinery process. Compared
   with traditional PLS, locally weighted PLS, and several other updating
   strategies, the proposed method was found to achieve good accuracy in
   the prediction of diesel properties.}},

Abstract = {{Active layer nanomorphology is a major factor that determines the
   efficiency of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs).
   Synthesizing diblock copolymers in which acceptor and donor materials
   are the constituent blocks is the most recent method to control the
   structure of the active layer. In the current work, a computational
   method is proposed to predict the nanomorphology of the active layer
   consisting of a diblock copolymer. Diblock copolymers have a tendency to
   self organize and form well-defined nanostructures. The shape of the
   structure depends on the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter (i.e.,
   chi), the total degree of polymerization (N) and volume fractions of the
   constituent blocks (phi(i)). In this work, molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations were used to calculate chi parameters for two different
   block copolymers used in PSCs: P3HT-b-poly(S(8)A(2))-C-60 and
   P3HT-b-poly(n-butyl acrylate-stat-acrylate perylene) also known as
   P3HT-b-PPerAcr. Such calculations indicated strong segregation of blocks
   into cylindrical structure for P3HT-b-poly(S(8)A(2))-C-60 and
   intermediate segregation into cylindrical structure for P3HT-b-PPerAcr.
   Experimental results of P3HT-b-poly(S(8)A(2))-C-60 and P3HT-b-PTP4AP, a
   diblock copolymer having very similar structure to P3HT-b-PPerAcr,
   validate our predictions.}},

   novel contrast agent uses bisphosphonates to impart bone-seeking
   properties, but replaces the former radioisotope with nonionizing SPIONs
   which enables their subsequent detection using MRI. Our reported method
   is relatively simple, quick and cost-effective and results in BP-SPIONs
   with a final nanoparticle size of 17 nm under electron microscopy
   technique (i.e., TEM). In vitro binding studies of our novel bone tracer
   have shown selective binding affinity (around 65\%) for hydroxyapatite,

Abstract = {{Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of brain development in fetal alcohol
   spectrum disorders (FASD) has revealed structural abnormalities, but
   studies have been limited by the use of cross-sectional designs.
   Longitudinal scans can provide key insights into trajectories of
   neurodevelopment within individuals with this common developmental
   disorder. Here we evaluate serial DTI and T1-weighted volumetric MRI in
   a human sample of 17 participants with FASD and 27 controls aged 5-15
   years who underwent 2-3 scans each, similar to 2-4 years apart (92 scans
   total). Increases of fractional anisotropy and decreases of mean
   diffusivity (MD) were observed between scans for both groups, in keeping
   with changes expected of typical development, but mixed-models analysis
   revealed significant age-by-group interactions for three major white
   matter tracts: superior longitudinal fasciculus and superior and
   inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. These findings indicate altered
   developmental progression in these frontal-association tracts, with the
   FASD group notably showing greater reduction of MD between scans. Delta
   MD is shown to correlate with reading and receptive vocabulary in the
   FASD group, with steeper decreases of MD in the superior
   fronto-occipital fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus between
   scans correlating with greater improvement in language scores.
   Volumetric analysis revealed reduced total brain, white, cortical gray,
   and deep gray matter volumes and fewer significant age-related volume
   increases in the FASD group, although age-by-group interactions were not
   significant. Longitudinal DTI indicates delayed white matter development
   during childhood and adolescence in FASD, which may underlie persistent
   or worsening behavioral and cognitive deficits during this critical
   period.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},

Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we identify that the different regimes encountered in a
   vertical capillary filling or a capillary-rise problem are determined
   entirely by two dimensionless parameters: Ohnesorge number (Oh) and Bond
   number (Bo). The initial universal inertial regime, which has been
   analyzed in our recent paper {[}Das et al., Phys. Rev. E 86, 067301
   (2012)], is followed by any one of three possible regimes, dictated by
   the ratio Oh/Bo. For Oh/Bo >> 1, the viscous effects dominate the
   gravitational effects, and one encounters the classical Washburn regime.
   For the other limit, i.e., Oh/Bo << 1, the viscous effects are
   insignificant and there is no Washburn regime. On the contrary, the
   inertial regime transits to the oscillatory regime with the filling
   length similar to oscillating about the Jurin height (similar to 1/Bo),
   which is the maximum height attained by a liquid column in vertical
   capillary filling, with the viscous effects (similar to Oh) dictating
   the nature of the oscillations. For Oh/Bo similar to 1, we get a
   behavior intermediate of these two extreme regimes. Finally, we identify
   the correct force picture that drives the oscillatory regime and in the
   process achieve quantitative match with the experimental results, that
   was precluded in the previous studies.}},

   Influenza Virus Vaccine in Gastric Environment}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 11}},
Abstract = {{Oral immunization using whole inactivated influenza virus vaccine
   promises an efficient vaccination strategy. While oral vaccination was
   hampered by harsh gastric environment, a systematic understanding about
   vaccine destabilization mechanisms was not performed. Here, we
   investigated the separate and combined effects of temperature, retention
   time, pH, and osmotic stress on the stability of influenza vaccine by
   monitoring the time-dependent morphological change using stopped-flow
   light scattering. When exposed to osmotic stress, clustering of vaccine
   particles was enhanced in an acidic medium (pH 2.0) at >= 25 degrees C.
   Fluorescence spectroscopic studies showed that hyper-osmotic stress at
   pH 2.0 and 37 degrees C caused a considerable increase in conformational
   change of antigenic proteins compared to that in acidic iso-osmotic
   medium. A structural integrity of membrane was destroyed upon exposure
   to hyper-osmotic stress, leading to irreversible morphological change,
   as observed by undulation in stopped-flow light scattering intensity and
   transmission electron microscopy. Consistent with these analyses,
   hemagglutination activity decreased more significantly with an
   increasing magnitude of hyper-osmotic stress than in the presence of the
   hypo- and iso-osmotic stresses. This study shows that the magnitude and
   direction of the osmotic gradient has a substantial impact on the
   stability of orally administrated influenza vaccine.}},

Title = {{Bayesian method for state estimation of batch process with missing data}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{14-24}},
Month = {{JUN 11}},
Abstract = {{Formulated under the state space framework, most previous methods for
   the state estimation typically treated batch processes in the same way
   as continuous ones, and only considered the state transition within a
   single batch. Considering that the initial state of the current batch is
   often related to that of the previous one, this paper incorporates the
   information of the previous batches into the estimation of the current
   state, where the filtering and smoothing for the previous batch is
   implemented and then the initial state of the current batch is estimated
   by treating the smoothed initial state of the previous batch as a
   ``measurement{''}. To deal with the nonlinear and non-Gaussian property
   of batch processes, the particle filter method is employed as the key
   algorithm for filtering and smoothing. In addition, in order to make
   full use of various measurements, the case of missing data is considered
   during the implementation of the particle filter algorithm. The proposed
   method is illustrated and evaluated through the simulation on a
   penicillin fed-batch fermentation process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background: The late cardiotoxic effects of anthracycline chemotherapy
   influence morbidity and mortality in the growing population of childhood
   cancer survivors. Even with lower anthracycline doses, evidence of
   adverse cardiac remodeling and reduced exercise capacity exist. We aim
   to examine the relationship between cardiac structure, function and
   cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) tissue characteristics with
   chemotherapy dose and exercise capacity in childhood cancer survivors.
   Methods: Thirty patients (15 +/- 3 years), at least 2 years following
   anthracycline treatment, underwent CMR, echocardiography, and
   cardiopulmonary exercise testing (peak VO2). CMR measured ventricular
   function, mass, T-1 and T-2 values, and myocardial extracellular volume
   fraction, ECV, a measure of diffuse fibrosis based on changes in
   myocardial T-1 values pre- and post-gadolinium. Cardiac function was
   also assessed with conventional and speckle tracking echocardiography.
   Results: Patients had normal LVEF (59 +/- 7\%) but peak VO2 was 17\%
   lower than age-predicted normal values and were correlated with
   anthracycline dose (r = -0.49). Increased ECV correlated with decreased
   mass/volume ratio (r = -0.64), decreased LV wall thickness/height ratio
   (r = -0.72), lower peak VO2(r = -0.52), and higher cumulative dose (r =
   0.40). Echocardiographic measures of systolic and diastolic function
   were reduced compared to normal values (p < 0.01), but had no relation
   to ECV, peak VO2 or cumulative dose.
   Conclusions: Myocardial T-1 and ECV were found to be early tissue
   markers of ventricular remodeling that may represent diffuse fibrosis in
   children with normal ejection fraction post anthracycline therapy, and
   are related to cumulative dose, exercise capacity and myocardial wall
   thinning.}},

Abstract = {{New ultra-wideband (UWB) band-pass filters (BPFs) with multiple (triple
   and quadruple) notches are proposed. A systematic approach is
   demonstrated to establish one to four or more notch-bands within the
   passband of a UWB BPF on a single-layer substrate using mu-strip
   technology, while avoiding the use of any via-holes. The proposed
   filters are based on parallel integration of gap-coupled microstrip
   resonators (GCMR) and two tri-section stepped-impedance resonators
   (TSSIR) to generate multiple notches. Two notches are produced by the
   use of TSSIR fundamental and first spurious resonance frequencies and
   the third and fourth notches are introduced by developing transmission
   zeros using additional integrated GCMR. Two samples of triple and
   quadruple notch-band UWB filters are fabricated and tested. In
   comparison to the previous triple single-layer notch-band BPFs with
   via-holes, the proposed single-layer triple notch BPF offers a size
   reduction of around 52\%. The authors have also expanded the concept and
   designed a new quadruple notch-band UWB BPF. The proposed filter uses
   only a single layer and can be easily mass-produced with low cost.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a novel dual-band resonant cavity antenna (RCA) with
   orthogonal linear polarisations. The proposed RCA utilises one
   single-sided slotted-patch partially reflective surface (PRS) excited by
   a microstrip patch antenna. The two operating frequencies can be
   arbitrarily and independently controlled and the polarisation of each
   band is orthogonal to the other. A prototype is designed, fabricated and
   tested. The measured results show a dual broad-side beam with lower-band
   gain of 18.06 dBi at 10.25 GHz with vertical polarisation (V-pol) and
   the upper-band gain of 19.41 dBi at 11.05 GHz with horizontal
   polarisation (H-pol). Besides, the proposed RCA has the capability of
   independent beam-forming. By applying progressive phase gradient using
   variable slot length over PRS, the V-pol lower-band beam is tilted off
   broadside up to 29 degrees, whereas the H-pol upper-band beam is fixed
   at broadside.}},

Abstract = {{The axis inhibition (Axin) scaffold protein colocalizes beta-catenin,
   casein kinase I alpha, and glycogen synthetase kinase 3 beta by their
   binding to Axin's long intrinsically disordered region, thereby yielding
   structured domains with flexible linkers. This complex leads to the
   phosphorylation of beta-catenin, marking it for destruction. Fusing
   proteins with flexible linkers vastly accelerates chemical interactions
   between them by their colocalization. Here we propose that the complex
   works by random movements of a ``stochastic machine,{''} not by
   coordinated conformational changes. This non-covalent, modular assembly
   process allows the various molecular machine components to be used in
   multiple processes. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of the

Abstract = {{The increased non-linear loads in today's typical home are a growing
   concern for utility companies. This situation might be worsened by the
   harmonic resonance introduced by the installation of capacitor banks in
   the distribution network. To mitigate the harmonic distortions, passive
   or active filters are typically used. However, with the increasing
   implementation of distributed generation (DG) in residential areas,
   using DG systems to improve the power quality is becoming a promising
   idea, particularly because many DG systems, such as photovoltaic (PV),
   wind and fuel cells, have DG-grid interfacing converters. In this paper,
   the potential for using photovoltaic (PV) interfacing inverters to
   compensate the residential system harmonics is explored. A system model
   including the residential load and DG is first developed. An in-depth
   analysis and comparison of different compensation schemes based on the
   virtual harmonic damping impedance concept are then carried out. The
   effects of the capacitor banks in the system are also studied. The
   effectiveness of the harmonic compensation strategies under different
   conditions is verified through analysis and simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Channel Components Transform (CCT) is a recently developed technique to

   perspective. The proposed methods are verified by case studies conducted
   on multiple test systems. This paper also demonstrates the capability of
   the CCT to work properly when a limited number of phasor measurement
   units are available. For this purpose, a strategy is proposed to
   determine the number and location of PMU installations that are
   sufficient to track the modes of voltage collapse and associated

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust single-loop direct voltage control strategy
   featuring effective suppression of uncertain resonant modes generated
   due power-factor correction (PFC) capacitors and residential capacitive
   loads in distributed generation (DG) microgrids. The proposed controller
   adopts an improved uncertainty modeling approach, which facilities the
   realization of a robust controller based on structured singular values
   (mu) analysis. The resultant controller is used as a direct voltage
   controller where no additional damping technique, either passive or
   active, is required. This feature reduces the sensor requirements in the
   DG interface controller and enhances the bandwidth characteristics of
   the closed-loop voltage-controlled converter. Mathematical and
   comparative analyses are provided to show the advantages of proposed
   mu-synthesis controller over the conventional H-infinity controller in
   maintaining robust stability as well as robust performance of the
   microgrid in presence of parameter uncertainties and uncertain resonant
   peaks caused by connection of PFC capacitors. Systematic design approach
   for the proposed controller is presented. Time-domain simulation studies
   and comparative experimental results are presented to show the
   effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller in microgrid

Abstract = {{Axially symmetric fiber-reinforced polymer composite structures, such as

   structure in order to achieve best performance in terms of mechanical
   behavior and strength for structures subjected to combined loadings. To
   this end, an approach combining netting analysis and Tsai-Wu failure
   theory was employed as a design tool to assess critical fiber angles at
   which applied loadings would cause a structure to fail. Together, the
   proposed netting analysis and failure theory-based approach constitute a
   simple, expedient, and convenient design process for complex-shaped

Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Periodic impulses in vibration signals and its repeating frequency are
   the key indicators for diagnosing the local damage of rolling element
   bearings. A new method based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition
   (EEMD) and the Teager energy operator is proposed to extract the
   characteristic frequency of bearing fault. The signal is firstly
   decomposed into monocomponents by means of EEMD to satisfy the
   monocomponent requirement by the Teager energy operator. Then, the
   intrinsic mode function (IMF) of interest is selected according to its
   correlation with the original signal and its kurtosis. Next, the Teager
   energy operator is applied to the selected IMF to detect fault-induced
   impulses. Finally, Fourier transform is applied to the obtained Teager
   energy series to identify the repeating frequency of fault-induced
   periodic impulses and thereby to diagnose bearing faults. The principle
   of the method is illustrated by the analyses of simulated bearing
   vibration signals. Its effectiveness in extracting the characteristic
   frequency of bearing faults, and especially its performance in
   identifying the symptoms of weak and compound faults, are validated by
   the experimental signal analyses of both seeded fault experiments and a
   run-to-failure test. Comparison studies show its better performance
   than, or complements to, the traditional spectral analysis and the
   squared envelope spectral analysis methods.}},

   corresponding changes of the grain size, mechanical properties and
   corrosion resistance of surface nanocrystalline induced by punching
   process were characterized by atomic force microscopy, nanoindentation,
   microhardness, electrochemical behavior and electron work function. It
   was observed that the grain size was about 40 nm in the topmost surface.
   The increasing mechanical properties were also demonstrated.
   Additionally, the dynamic polarization test showed that the surface
   nanocrystallization improved the resistance to electrochemical attacks.
   Such increasing corrosion resistance was identified with the higher EWF
   value.. This study demonstrates that surface nanocrystallization can be

   best estimate of the CST critical period for the legs is when the child
   is younger than 2 years of age. Previous interventions for walking in
   children with CST damage were mainly applied after this age. Our
   preliminary results with training children younger than 2 years showed
   improvements in walking that exceeded all previous reports. Further, we
   refined techniques for measuring motor and sensory pathways to and from
   the legs, so that changes can be measured at this young age. Previous
   activity-based therapies may have been applied too late in development.
   A randomized controlled trial is now underway to determine if intensive

Abstract = {{Frequency-dependent modeling of devices and systems is a common practice
   in several fields, such as power systems, microwave systems, and
   electronics systems. The modeling process usually involves converting
   the tabulated frequency-response data into a compact equivalent circuit
   model. The main drawback of the currently existing methods such as
   vector fitting is that the obtained model is often nonpassive, leading

   proposes a genetic programming (GP) approach to generate equivalent
   circuits with guaranteed passivity. The proposed method starts with a
   nonoptimal initial equivalent circuit. Both the elements and the
   topology of this circuit are then evolved by the proposed GP-based
   method, and an accurate equivalent circuit is obtained. Key ideas and

Abstract = {{The optimization of pilot symbol parameters can improve the spectral
   efficiency of adaptive modulation for orthogonal frequency division
   multiplexing (OFDM) systems, since pilot symbols impose an overhead on
   the system consuming power and bandwidth. An optimal pilot symbol
   assisted adaptive modulation (PSAAM) scheme for OFDM systems is proposed
   that maximizes spectral efficiency by adapting the power and
   constellation size of each subcarrier based on employing imperfect
   channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. The pilot symbol
   power and spacing is also optimized in this scheme. A suboptimum scheme
   that decreases computational complexity without perceivable loss in
   performance is also presented. The optimality of minimum mean square
   error (MMSE) channel prediction for OFDM systems expressed in terms of a
   lower bound on spectral efficiency is approached. It is proved that the
   rectangular pilot pattern with equi-spaced and equal power pilot tones
   achieves the minimum MSE of the channel prediction in addition to having
   the advantage of simplifying PSAAM design. Numerical results show the
   importance of optimal pilot parameter adjustment for rapidly fading
   channels.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a multi-user single-relay wireless network,
   where the relay facilitates transmissions of the users' signals to the
   destination. We study the relay power allocation among the users, and
   use bargaining theory to model the negotiation among the users on relay
   power allocation. By assigning a bargaining power to each user to
   indicate its transmission priority, we propose an asymmetric Nash
   bargaining solution (NBS)-based relay power allocation scheme. We also
   propose a distributed implementation for this solution, where each user
   only requires its local channel state information (CSI). We analytically
   investigate the impact of the bargaining powers on the relay power
   allocation and show that via proper selection of the bargaining powers,
   the proposed power allocation can achieve a balance between the network
   sum-rate and the user fairness. Then we generalize the NBS-based power
   allocation and its distributed implementation to multi-user multi-relay
   networks. Simulation results are shown to compare the proposed power
   allocation with sum-rate-optimal power allocation and even power
   allocation. The impact of the bargaining powers on the power allocation
   is also demonstrated via simulations.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Oblique incidence reflectometry (OIR) is an established technique for
   the estimation of tissue optical properties. However, a sensing
   footprint of a few transport mean-free paths is often needed when
   diffusion-regime-based algorithms are used. Smaller-footprint probes
   require improved light-propagation models and inversion schemes for
   diffuse reflectance close to the point of entry but might enable
   micro-endoscopic form factors for clinical assessments of cancers and
   precancers. The phase-function corrected diffusion theory presented by
   Vitkin et al. {[}Nat. Commun. 2, 587 (2011)] to the case of pencil beams
   obliquely incident on a semi-infinite turbid medium is extended. The
   model requires minimal computational resources and offers improved
   accuracy over more traditional diffusion-theory approximations models
   when validated against Monte Carlo simulations. The computationally
   efficient nature of the models lends itself to rapid fitting procedures
   for inverse problems. The analytical model is used in a nonlinear
   fitting algorithm to demonstrate the recovery of optical properties
   using a measurement footprint that is significantly smaller than needed
   in previous diffusion-regime OIR methods. (C) The Authors. Published by

Title = {{Molecular Mechanisms in the Activation of Abscisic Acid Receptor PYR1}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The pyrabactin resistance 1 (PYR1)/PYR1-like (PYL)/regulatory component
   of abscisic acid (ABA) response (RCAR) proteins comprise a well
   characterized family of ABA receptors. Recent investigations have
   revealed two subsets of these receptors that, in the absence of ABA,
   either form inactive homodimers (PYR1 and PYLs 1-3) or mediate basal
   inhibition of downstream target type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs;
   PYLs 4-10) respectively in vitro. Addition of ABA has been shown to
   release the apo-homodimers yielding ABA-bound monomeric holo-receptors
   that can interact with PP2Cs; highlighting a competitive-interaction
   process. Interaction selectivity has been shown to be mediated by subtle
   structural variations of primary sequence and ligand binding effects.
   Now, the dynamical contributions of ligand binding on interaction
   selectivity are investigated through extensive molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations of apo and holo-PYR1 in monomeric and dimeric form as well
   as in complex with a PP2C, homology to ABA insensitive 1 (HAB1). Robust
   comparative interpretations were enabled by a novel essential collective
   dynamics approach. In agreement with recent experimental findings, our
   analysis indicates that ABA-bound PYR1 should efficiently bind to HAB1.
   However, both ABA-bound and ABA-extracted PYR1-HAB1 constructs have
   demonstrated notable similarities in their dynamics, suggesting that
   apo-PYR1 should also be able to make a substantial interaction with
   PP2Cs, albeit likely with slower complex formation kinetics. Further
   analysis indicates that both ABA-bound and ABA-free PYR1 in complex with
   HAB1 exhibit a higher intra-molecular structural stability and stronger
   intermolecular dynamic correlations, in comparison with either holo-or
   apo-PYR1 dimers, supporting a model that includes apo-PYR1 in complex
   with HAB1. This possibility of a conditional functional apo-PYR1-PP2C
   complex was validated in vitro. These findings are generally consistent
   with the competitive-interaction model for PYR1 but highlight dynamical
   contributions of the PYR1 structure in mediating interaction selectivity
   suggesting added degrees of complexity in the regulation of the
   competitive-inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{Research into organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is rapidly growing worldwide
   because it offers a route to low temperature, inexpensive processing of
   lightweight, flexible solar cells that can be mass manufactured cheaply.
   Unlike silicon or other inorganic semiconductors (e.g., CdTe, CIGs),
   OPVs are complicated by the requirement of having multiple materials and
   layers that must be integrated to enable the cell to function. The
   enormous number of research hours required to optimize all aspects of
   OPVs and to integrate them successfully is typically boiled down to one
   number the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device. The PCE is
   the value by which comparisons are routinely made when modifications are
   made to devices; new bulk heterojunction materials, electron- and
   hole-transport layers, electrodes, plasmonic additives, and many other
   new advances are incorporated into OPV devices and compared with one, or
   a series of, control device(s). The concern relates to the statistical
   significance of this all-Important efficiency/PCE value: Is the observed
   change or improvement in performance truly greater than experimental
   error? If it is not, then the field can and will be misled by Improper
   reporting of efficiencies, and future research in OPVs could be
   frustrated and, ultimately, irreversibly damaged. In this Perspective,
   the dangers of, for instance, cherry-picking of data and poor
   descriptions of experimental procedures, are outlined, followed by a
   discussion of a real data set of OPV devices, and how a simple and easy
   statistical treatment can help to distinguish between results that are
   Indistinguishable experimentally, and those that do appear to be
   different.}},

Abstract = {{Block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly is an effective and versatile
   approach for the production of complex nanopatterned interfaces. Mono
   layers of BCP films can be harnessed to produce a variety of different
   patterns, including lines, with specific spacings and order. In this
   work, bilayers of cylinder-forming
   polystyrene-block-polydimethylsiloxane block copolymer (PS-b-PDMS) were
   transformed into arrays of silica lines with half the pitch normally
   attained for conventional monolayers, with the PDMS acting as the source
   for the SiOx. The primary hurdle was ensuring the bilayer silica lines
   were distinctly separate; to attain the control necessary to prevent
   overlap, a number of variables related to the materials and
   self-assembly process were investigated In detail. Developing a detailed
   understanding of BCP film swelling during solvent annealing, blending of
   the PS-b-PDMS with PS homopolymer, utilization of a surface brush layer,
   and adjustment of the plasma exposure conditions, distinct and separate
   silica lines were prepared. On the microscale, the sample coverage of
   PS-b-PDMS bilayers was investigated and maximized to attain >95\%
   bilayers under defined conditions. The bilayer BCP structures were also
   amenable to graphoepitaxy, and thus, dense and highly ordered arrays of
   silica line patterns with tightly controlled width and pitch were
   fabricated and distributed uniformly across a Si surface.}},

Abstract = {{The antitumor activity of organo-gold compounds is a focus of research
   from the past two decades. A variety of gold stabilizing ligands such as
   vitamins and xanthanes have been prepared and explored for their
   `chelating effect' as well as for their antitumor activity.
   Dithiocarbamates (DTC) compounds and their metallic conjugates have been
   well explored for their antiproliferative activities. In this study,
   glycopolymer based DTC-conjugates are prepared by reversible addition
   fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) and subsequently
   modified with gold(I) phosphine. These polymer-DTC derivatives and their
   gold compounds are tested for their in vitro toxicity in both normal and
   cancer cell lines. The Au(I) phosphine conjugated cationic glycopolymers
   of 10 kDa and 30 kDa are evaluated for their cytotoxicity profiles using
   MTT assay. Au(I) compounds are well-known for their mitochondrial
   toxicity, hence hypoxic cell lines bearing unusually enlarged
   mitochondria are subjected to these anticancer compounds. It is
   concluded that these polymeric DTC derivatives and their gold conjugates
   indeed show higher accumulation as well as cytotoxicity to cancer cells
   under hypoxic conditions in comparison to the normoxic ones. Hypoxic
   MCF-7 cells showed significant sensitivity toward the low molecular
   weight (10 kDa) glycopolymer-Au(I) complexes.}},

Abstract = {{Venezuela Orinoco heavy crude oil was sequentially separated into
   several subfractions to determine the contents and types of vanadyl
   porphyrins contained in the products. Vanadium contents in each

   visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and positive-ion electrospray ionization
   (ESI) Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry
   (FT-ICR MS). Six types of petroleum vanadyl porphyrins, which have been
   identified previously, were well-characterized with the detailed
   fractionation. Three new series of vanadyl porphyrins corresponding to
   molecules of CnHmN4VO2, CnHmN4VO3, and CnHmN4VO4, respectively, were
   identified in addition to the six known types of vanadyl porphyrins.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of vapor-phase cracking of bitumen-derived heavy gas oil
   and the quality of the resulting liquid products were investigated at
   temperatures of 600-700 degrees C. Light ends components were analyzed
   by gas chromatography. The quality of the liquid product was
   characterized using simulated distillation, elemental analysis, and C-13
   nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Consistent with vapor-phase
   cracking, the coke yield was negligible at less than 2\%. The yields of
   C-2-C-3 olefins were 2-16 wt \%, while the yields of C-2-C-3 alkanes
   ranged from 0.2 to 1.0 wt \%. The hydrogen content of the liquid product
   decreased significantly with conversion, corresponding to an increase of
   the aromatic carbon content. A kinetic model that considered cracking of
   alkyl groups from aromatic rings fitted the conversion yields and the
   chemical compositions. The apparent activation energy of the cracking of
   reactive alkyl groups was 215 +/- 20 kJ/mol.}},

   plotted versus scaling dimensionless time, contrary to capillary-driven
   imbibition models. The observed difference is more pronounced in samples
   with higher day content. The results suggest that the excess water

   adsorption by clay minerals, and (2) the enhancement of sample
   permeability through adsorption-induced microfractures.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3061-3070}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Mild pyrolysis (400 degrees C) of bitumen was investigated to establish
   ways in which coke formation can be suppressed. Bitumen was diluted to
   various degrees with solvents that had different hydrogen transfer
   properties, namely, hydrogen donation, hydrogen shuttling, and poor
   hydrogen transfer properties. Additionally, the concentration of light
   products generated during bitumen pyrolysis was manipulated by pressure
   and batch/semibatch operation. Coke formation was suppressed by light
   material, whether added as a solvent or generated in situ during
   pyrolysis. As anticipated, hydrogen transfer was important, but coke
   formation was reduced by 35\% at 10\% concentration of even a poor
   hydrogen transfer solvent. Hydrogen availability and the H:C ratio of
   the reaction mixture were found to be particularly influential in
   determining whether coke formed. The results showed that light gases
   produced during pyrolysis were not irreversible reaction products, but
   continued to participate in the reaction network to moderate the
   pyrolysis process and suppress coke formation. Applied to industrial
   operation, evidence was provided to indicate that liquid yield can be
   increased and coke formation can be suppressed during visbreaking by
   cofeeding light gases, typically C-4 and lighter hydrocarbons.}},

Abstract = {{In a typical industrial Fischer-Tropsch process the hot reaction product
   from Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is stepwise cooled, condensed, and
   recovered, before being separated by distillation into different cuts. A
   different design was proposed whereby the hot reaction products are
   directly introduced into a pressure distillation unit, which combines
   syncrude recovery and distillation. Process simulation was employed to
   evaluate the proposal. It was found that integration of syncrude
   recovery and distillation was technically viable and that it had a
   number of benefits compared to stepwise cooling and recovery of syncrude
   prior to distillation. These positive outcomes were independent of the
   type of Fischer-Tropsch technology used. Some notable benefits included
   a decrease in heating/cooling duty, improved liquid recovery, and
   reduced loading of tail gas separation. The proposed design also enabled
   other improvements, such as a strategy to improve catalyst-wax
   separation from slurry bubble column reactors and a strategy to
   reactively improve distillation performance and increase liquid yield.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile cloud computing, with its promise to meet the urgent need for
   richer applications and services of resource-constrained mobile devices,
   is emerging as a new computing paradigm and has recently attracted
   significant attention. However, there is no clear definition and no well
   defined scope for mobile cloud computing due to commercial hype, and
   diverse ways of combining cloud computing and mobile applications. This
   article makes the first attempt to present a survey of mobile cloud
   computing from the perspective of its intended usages. Specifically, we
   introduce three common mobile cloud architectures and classify
   comprehensive existing work into two fundamental categories: computation
   offloading and capability extending. Considering the energy bottleneck
   and user context of mobile devices, we discuss the research challenges
   and opportunities of introducing cloud computing to assist mobile
   devices, including energy-efficient interactions, virtual machine
   migration overhead, privacy, and security. Moreover, we demonstrate
   three real-world applications enabled by mobile cloud computing, in

Title = {{Impact of gypsum supersaturated solution on surface properties of silica
   and sphalerite minerals}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46-47}},
Pages = {{6-15}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In some sulphide mineral flotation operations, the process water
   contains high concentrations of calcium and sulphate ions that exceed
   the solubility limit of gypsum. It has been speculated that the gypsum
   supersaturated process water would lead to precipitation of gypsum which
   could coat on mineral surfaces by either nucleation or coagulation,
   resulting in reduced flotation recovery and selectivity. In this study,
   a laboratory prepared gypsum supersaturated solution is used to
   represent the gypsum supersaturated process water, the effect of gypsum
   supersaturated solution on the surface properties of silica and
   sphalerite minerals was investigated using zeta potential distribution
   measurements, scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photon
   spectroscopy (XPS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and quartz
   crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D). Our results show that
   silica and sphalerite minerals carry identical surface charge (-10 mV of
   zeta potential) in the gypsum supersaturated solution at pH 10 although
   they are charged differently in simple electrolyte solution at the same
   pH. Needle shape gypsum precipitates are found in both silica and
   sphalerite minerals systems conditioned with gypsum supersaturated
   solution. The gypsum precipitates do not grow on the minerals surfaces
   but form in the bulk gypsum supersaturated solution. The
   heterocoagulation between the examined minerals and gypsum particles is
   insignificant in the gypsum supersaturated solution. It is the high
   calcium concentration in the gypsum supersaturated solution that has
   significant effect on the surface properties of silica and sphalerite
   minerals. The zeta potentials of silica and sphalerite in a 800 ppm
   calcium solution (similar to the calcium concentration in the gypsum
   supersaturated solution) are similar to those measured in the gypsum
   supersaturated solutions. Both silica and sphalerite minerals surfaces
   are indiscriminately coated with calcium. The surface coating of calcium
   results in the identical surfaces between silica and sphalerite
   minerals, and ultimately causes problems for the flotation separation of
   silica and sphalerite. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46-47}},
Pages = {{45-51}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Chitosan was used in the flotation of pyrite-galena mixtures. The
   results indicated that chitosan preferentially adsorbed on pyrite and
   galena was floated from the pyrite-galena mixtures. Time-of-flight
   secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed to study the interaction
   mechanism of chitosan on the pyrite and galena minerals at pH 4 and 6.
   ToF-SIMS showed that chitosan adsorbed heavily on pyrite but barely on
   galena when a mixture of pyrite and galena was treated by chitosan. The
   high resolution XPS spectra indicated that both the amine and the
   hydroxyl groups from chitosan reacted with pyrite surface, whereas no
   significant binding energy shifts were observed on galena. Combined with
   the authors' previous studies of chitosan in other sulfide flotation
   systems, it was observed that chitosan could depress pyrite, galena,
   sphalerite and chalcopyrite to different extent when the minerals were
   floated alone. However, in the flotation of mineral mixtures, chitosan
   selectively adsorbed on one mineral which depressed its flotation,
   allowing the other mineral to be floated from the mixture. The
   competitive adsorption was attributed to the differences in the electron
   affinity value of the lattice metal ions. Chitosan strongly binds with
   metal ions with a high electron affinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Introduction: Speeding in residential areas is one aspect of a larger
   set of problems related to speeding and traffic safety. The problem
   affects the safety of vulnerable road users (pedestrians and cyclists),
   specifically young children, and creates a sense of insecurity due to
   the risk of being involved in a vehicle crash and the seriousness of
   ensuing injuries. Method: This paper describes the implementation and
   evaluation of an integrated speed management plan to reduce vehicle
   speeds on residential roads. A before-after experimental design with
   comparison group was employed for the evaluation. To address the fact
   that the effectiveness of treatment might diminish with time, two sets
   of speed data were collected with one immediately after the treatment
   and another after four months. Results: Statistical analysis reveals
   that the proposed plan can effectively reduce vehicle speeds and speed
   variances for both the short and long term. The effectiveness was found
   to vary with time of day and day of week. Overall, reductions of mean
   speed were estimated at 2.94 km/h (5.8\%) and 2.26 km/h (4.5\%) for the
   short term and long term, respectively. Impact on Industry: The study
   shows that an integrated speed management strategy, which combines
   education and enforcement activities with a low cost engineering
   treatment, can effectively reduce vehicle speeds on residential roads
   with a potential to improving road safety. (C) 2013 National Safety

Title = {{Performance analysis of on-farm irrigation tanks on agricultural
   drainage water reuse and treatment}},
Journal = {{RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Water reuse and pollutant removal efficiency analysis of the on-farm
   irrigation tanks (OFTs) was carried out in rice paddy field region of
   Zhanghe Irrigation District, Southern China through field experiments
   during the rice growing season of 2009-2011. Water flow measurements
   indicate that 20.6-68.9\% of drainage water captured by OFTs was reused
   for supplemental irrigation. Rainfall was the most important factor that
   determines the water reuse efficiency (WRR) of OFTs, since higher
   rainfall resulted in higher surplus irrigation water draining out of
   OFTs without reuse, and thus decreased WRR. Fully using the storage
   capacity for storing return flow, and releasing totally for supplemental
   irrigation also enhanced WRR of OFTs. Water quality analysis shows that
   OFTs removed 47.2\% of total phosphorous (TP) and 60.8\% of total
   nitrogen (TN) of inflow and have a great effect on increasing
   sedimentation for return flow as the mean of removal efficiency of
   pollutant load (REL) for suspended solids (SS) amounted to 68.4\%. For
   water treatment effectiveness of OM, high hydraulic retention time (HRT)
   is most beneficial to increase REL of TN whereas REL of TP is not
   sensitive to HRT. These results confirm that OFTs can effectively
   increase agricultural return flow reuse and remove pollutants. As the
   cascade OFTs irrigation system recycle return flow for several times,
   the irrigation water demand from outside of region was reduced
   significantly for rice production. Coupling with the effect of cyclic
   irrigation on the nutrients recycling by paddy fields, OFTs irrigation
   system also considerably mitigate the N and P off-site emission.
   Therefore, it is advisable to integrate the role of OFTs on water reuse
   and treatment for water saving irrigation and ecological management of
   paddy fields landscape. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In wireless multicast systems, cooperative multicast, in which
   successful users help to relay received packets to unsuccessful users,
   has been shown to be effective in combating channel fading and improving
   system performance. However, this mechanism requires the users'
   voluntary contributions, which cannot be guaranteed since users are
   selfish and only care about their own performance. Furthermore, users
   may have heterogeneous costs (which are their private information) to
   forward packets, and they may lie about their costs if cheating can
   improve their utilities. To address these problems, in this paper, we
   model the interaction among users in the wireless multicast system as a
   multiseller multibuyer payment-based game, where users pay to receive
   relay service and get paid if they forward packets to others. A
   simplified case with homogeneous users that have the same cost to
   forward packets is investigated first. Then, for the case with
   heterogeneous users, to encourage users to tell their true costs, we use
   the second-price sealed-bid auction, which is a truth-telling auction,
   since bidding the true cost is a weakly dominant strategy. To analyze
   the multiseller multibuyer payment-based game, we observe that under
   different selected prices, the game can converge to different
   equilibria, resulting in different user free-riding probabilities and
   system throughput. We also study the price selection problem and derive
   the optimal price that maximizes the system throughput. Simulation
   results show the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The research objectives are to estimate differences between the
   potential impact of climatic change to the Athabasca River basin (ARB)
   and Fraser River basin (FRB) of Canada with and without considering
   shifts in vegetation patterns induced by climate change and how much the
   difference will depend on vegetation types and climate. The hydrologic
   effects of vegetation shifts on ARB and FRB were estimated by applying
   the Mapped Atmosphere-Plant-Soil System (MAPSS) simulated results based
   on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's First and Second
   Assessment Report general circulation model (GCM) scenarios to the
   modified Interaction Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere (MISBA) scheme. According
   to MAPSS, vegetation shifts in mountainous regions of FRB are expected
   to be dominated by conifer/broadleaf competition, while in ARB, climate
   projections of MAPSS predicted a southern expansion of the boreal
   forest. Because of differences in sublimation, there is a tendency for
   more snow to accumulate in open grassland than forests. Furthermore,
   changes to simulated mean annual maximum snowpack, runoff, and basin
   area covered by grassland are positively correlated to each other.
   Generally, a 4\% increase in snow water equivalent (SWE) results in a
   1\% increase in mean annual runoff. These relationships hold true in
   both basins over a wide range of GCM-projected climate conditions and
   vegetation responses, suggesting that most changes in mean annual flow
   can be attributed to changes in SWE. Because of the different modeling
   approaches between MAPSS and MISBA, it seems that the treatment of these
   processes in vegetation and hydrologic models should be similar before
   conclusions can be drawn from various stand-alone simulations. Ideally,
   a land surface scheme should be coupled with a vegetation model in

Abstract = {{This study empirically examines the impact of quality tools on business
   performance in a sample of 119 Serbian industrial firms. Quality tools
   are classified into three primary groups according to their usage
   pattern by means of factor analysis and reliability testing: quality
   tools for reviewing current conditions, for analysing current conditions
   and for production planning and control. The relationships between these
   groups of quality tools and business performance measures were tested
   using stepwise regression analysis. Quality tools for reviewing current
   conditions have a significantly positive impact on most business
   performance dimensions, which is to be expected due to the fact that
   Serbia is in the phase between quality assurance and total quality
   management. Quality tools for analysing current conditions significantly
   influence productivity, while those for improvement have a positive
   effect on capacity expansion as a development performance measure.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental results on the nature-like fishway induced flow field and
   its relation to fish behaviour are presented. A rocky-ramp with 5\%
   slope was built along a 8.9m x 0.9m x 0.6m laboratory flume, and
   acoustic Doppler velocity measurements were taken in a grid with 186
   points for low, middle, and high discharges. The flow is characterized
   applying spatial and point analysis techniques. Point analysis
   consistently shows that the boulder to boulder distance is small enough
   to disrupt turbulent coherent structures. At boulder wakes no
   predominance of sweep and ejection events occur, evidencing a good
   resting place for fish migration. The nature-like rocky-ramp offers a
   diversity of flow conditions controlled by the boulders geometry that
   might allow a variety of fishes to develop their preferred paths
   characterized by flow properties with different magnitudes depending on
   the particular species. Obtained results compare well with similar ones
   reported for other standard fishways.}},

   antennas, and the energy of the excitation and received pulses. We find
   excellent agreement between the estimated and measured scattered pulses
   for metal planar objects of sizes 100 x 100 mm(2), 160 x 160 mm(2), and
   200 x 200 mm(2). For the same objects, the estimated frequency averaged
   RCS are close to narrowband conventional RCS. The agreement validates
   the proposed method, allowing us to compute the scattered pulse shape

Abstract = {{We report the development of a surrogate spinal cord for evaluating the
   mechanical suitability of electrode arrays for intraspinal implants. The
   mechanical and interfacial properties of candidate materials (including
   silicone elastomers and gelatin hydrogels) for the surrogate cord were
   tested. The elastic modulus was characterized using dynamic mechanical
   analysis, and compared with values of actual human spinal cords from the
   literature. Forces required to indent the surrogate cords to specified
   depths were measured to obtain values under static conditions.
   Importantly, to quantify surface properties in addition to mechanical
   properties normally considered, interfacial frictional forces were
   measured by pulling a needle out of each cord at a controlled rate. The
   measured forces were then compared to those obtained from rat spinal
   cords. Formaldehyde-crosslinked gelatin, 12 wt\% in water, was
   identified as the most suitable material for the construction of
   surrogate spinal cords. To demonstrate the utility of surrogate spinal
   cords in evaluating the behavior of various electrode arrays, cords were
   implanted with two types of intraspinal electrode arrays (one made of
   individual microwires and another of microwires anchored with a solid
   base), and cord deformation under elongation was evaluated. The results
   demonstrate that the surrogate model simulates the mechanical and
   interfacial properties of the spinal cord, and enables in vitro
   screening of intraspinal implants.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal balance of ammonium and nitrite is essential for successful
   operation of the subsequent anammox process. We conducted a partial
   nitritation experiment using an upflow air-lift reactor to provide
   operational parameters for achieving the optimal ratio of ammonium to
   nitrite, by feeding supernatant of anaerobic digester effluent,
   highnitrogen containing rejection water. Semi-continuous operation
   results show that HRT should be set between 15 and 17 hours to achieve
   the optimum ration of 1.3 of NO2-N/NH4-N. In the UAR, nitritation was
   the dominant reaction due to high concentration of ammonia and low
   biodegradable organics. The influent contained low concentrations of
   hydroxylamine and hydrazine. However, hydrazine increased during partial
   nitritation by similar to 60-130\% although there was no potential
   anammox activity in the reactor. The partial nitritation process
   successfully provided the ratio of nitrogen species for the anammox
   reaction, and relived the nitrite restraint on the anammox activity by
   increasing hydrazine concentration.}},

Title = {{AC frequency-based electrical stimulation of hydrogel microactuators
   employing Parylene-N coated electrodes}},
Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{182}},
Pages = {{761-773}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This article demonstrates the first AC-frequency based electrical
   actuation of hydrogels employing coplanar microelectrodes coated with
   Parylene-N. For the first time hydrogel microactuators were operated at
   applied voltages up to 40 Vpk-pk without any electrolyte electrolysis or
   external pumping equipment. An RC circuit model was developed to
   determine the characteristic frequency required to overcome
   electrostatic shielding, as the hydrogels were actuated in the
   polarizable potassium hydroxide (KOH). The characteristic actuation
   frequency was found to be between 10 kHz and 1 GHz, with the minimum
   frequency at an electrolyte concentration of 1 mM and Parylene-N
   thickness of 100 nm. This circuit model was also extended to calculate
   the total capacitance of the hydrogel-based system. To validate the
   circuit model, the total capacitance of the system was experimentally
   measured using capacitance and admittance spectroscopy, for Parylene-N
   thicknesses from 2145 +/- 55 nm to 565 +/- 7 nm and from 1 mM to 10 mM
   KOH. Good agreement was found at higher frequencies, while at lower
   frequencies the system demonstrated frequency and concentration
   dependent behavior. The spectroscopy results were used to calculate the
   apparent power of the system based off the maximum electric potential of
   40 Vpk-pk applied during actuation, with an absolute minimum and maximum
   of similar to 2 x 10(-4) V A and similar to 2 x 10(-2) V A,
   respectively. To determine actuation dynamics systems were fabricated
   with Parylene-N thicknesses from 907 +/- 28 nm to 348 +/- 13 nm and
   equilibrated with 1 mM or 5 mM KOH, providing a system above and a
   system below the predicted characteristic frequency, respectively. The 1
   mM KOH system displayed true strains from 18\% to 30\% with response
   times from 14.7 s to 4.7 s, with optimum response at applied electric
   fields of 16 kV/m or 40 Vpk-pk with an 80\% duty cycle. The 5 mM KOH
   system had a maximum true strain of similar to 7\% and response time of
   14.9 s. The trend observed while increasing frequency was also observed
   when a 1 mM KOH sample was subjected to increasing applied electric
   potential, which showed a 674\% increase in true strain and a 703\%
   decrease in response time, from 15 Vpk-pk to 40 Vpk-pk. All systems
   actuated displayed deformation at all frequencies tested; thus even a
   minimal frequency can disturb electrostatic shielding, but above the
   characteristic frequency deformation and response times were optimum.
   This work overcomes the previous operational challenges associated with
   electrical hydrogel actuation, and investigates the electrical and
   actuation characteristics of the hydrogel-based system. Moreover, as
   hydrogels operated at lower frequencies still displayed actuation,
   hydrogel actuation could occur at low power zones enabling its
   integration within ultra-low power portable systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   complex in vitro. We collected sixty-three premolars from patients who
   needed the extraction. The premolars were sectioned transversely into
   600-mu m-thick slices, and then divided into five groups according to
   LIPUS application time (control, 5, 10, 15 and 20 min). LIPUS transducer
   produced an incident intensity of 30 mW/cm(2). After 24 h, tissue was
   harvested for histomorphometrical analysis and RT-PCR (Genes of
   interest: Collagen I, DMP1, DSPP, TGF beta 1, RANKL and OPG).
   Histomorphometric analysis showed no significant difference among the
   five groups in the odontoblast count and predentin thickness. RT-PCR
   demonstrated no expression of TGF beta 1, low amounts of DSPP, a twofold
   increase in collagen I expression in the 5- and 10-minute LIPUS groups
   and a threefold increase in DMP1 expression in the 10-minute LIPUS
   group. LIPUS application was stimulatory to the dentin-pulp complex in

Abstract = {{Blood-borne biomarkers have great potential in diagnostic medicine, but
   low concentrations, inability to determine their source and lack of a
   patient baseline have limited their success in both research and
   clinical medicine. D'Souza et al. previously demonstrated that
   ultrasound-induced sonoporation can be used to liberate protein
   biomarkers from a colorectal cancer into the surrounding serum,
   overcoming many of the limitations of blood-borne biomarkers. In this
   study we build on D'Souza's work, extending this technique to nucleic
   acids, specifically mammaglobin mRNA-a potential diagnostic biomarker
   for breast cancer metastases. Furthermore, we propose to use ultrasound
   contrast agents, lipid-stabilized microbubbles, to enhance the effects
   of sonoporation and further amplify the biomarker levels. We demonstrate
   that microbubbles can enhance mammaglobin mRNA levels by two to three
   orders of magnitude greater than background levels and one to two orders
   of magnitude greater than ultrasound alone. (E-mail: rzemp@ualberta.ca)

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Cryopreservation has numerous practical applications in medicine,
   biotechnology, agriculture, forestry, aquaculture and biodiversity
   conservation, with huge potentials for biological cell and tissue
   banking. A specific tissue of interest for cryopreservation is the
   articular cartilage of the human knee joint for two major reasons: (1)
   clinically, there exists an untapped potential for cryopreserved
   cartilage to be used in surgical repair/reconstruction/replacement of
   injured joints because of the limited availability of fresh donor tissue
   and, (2) scientifically, successful cryopreservation of cartilage, an
   avascular tissue with only one cell type, is considered a stepping stone
   for transition from biobanking cell suspensions and small tissue slices
   to larger and more complicated tissues. For more than 50 years, a great
   deal of effort has been directed toward understanding and overcoming the
   challenges of cartilage preservation. In this article, we focus mainly
   on studies that led to the finding that vitrification is an appropriate
   approach toward successful preservation of cartilage. This is followed
   by a review of the studies on the main challenges of vitrification, i.e.
   toxicity and diffusion, and the novel approaches to overcome these
   challenges such as liquidus tracking, diffusion modeling, and
   cryoprotective agent cocktails, which have resulted in the recent
   advancements in the field. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many problems of academic and industrial interests such as operating

   this study, a noncontinuum state estimator, which is based on a moving
   horizon method for a class of switching system that follows a hidden
   Markov model, is developed. A new approach to arrival cost development
   and constraints handling in moving horizon estimation of noncontinuum

Abstract = {{This study explores the behavior of textile fabrics under thermal
   exposures. The performance of thermal protective textile fabric systems
   with different structural features was evaluated under laboratory
   simulated thermal exposures. The study demonstrated that the protective
   performance of textile fabric systems varies with different types of
   thermal exposure. To provide effective protection in flame and
   radiant-heat exposures, the most important fabric properties to address
   are emissivity, absorptivity and thermal resistance. In hot surface
   exposures, the compression property of the fabric systems is the primary
   feature to consider for protection. Hot water and steam exposures
   produce mass transfer through fabrics. In the presence of water or steam
   jet pressure, fabric compression is a primary factor in protecting the
   human body. The findings obtained in this study can be used to engineer
   fabric systems that provide better protection from various thermal
   exposures.}},

Abstract = {{An approach is developed to simultaneously model the geometry of
   multiple coal seams in 3-D without directly modeling surface elevations
   or isochore thicknesses. The approach truncates a locally refined 3-D
   model of estimated signed distance function values. The signed distance
   function measures the sign dependent distance to a coal/non-coal
   contact; negative in coal and positive outside. Global kriging is used
   to estimate the distance function at unsampled locations so that the
   resulting model has the correct anisotropy and is free of search
   artifacts. This approach is aimed at relatively large modeling volumes
   where the number of coal seams varies and the seams show complexities
   such as pinch outs and bifurcation. The technique aims to locate all of
   the coal boundaries with high precision through local grid refinement.
   The results can be used for resource/reserve evaluation. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{Non-aqueous extraction of bitumen from oil sands has the potential to
   reduce fresh water demand of the extraction process and eliminate
   tailings ponds. In this study, different light hydrocarbon solvents,
   including aromatics, cycloalkanes, biologically derived solvents and
   mixtures of solvents were compared for extraction of bitumen from
   Alberta oil sands at room temperature and ambient pressure. The solvents
   are compared based on bitumen recovery, the amount of residual solvent
   in the extracted oil sands tailings and the content of fine solids in
   the extracted bitumen. The extraction experiments were carried out in a
   multistage process with agitation in rotary mixers and vibration
   sieving. The oil sands tailings were dried under ambient conditions, and
   their residual solvent contents were measured by a purge and trap system
   followed by gas chromatography. The elemental compositions of the
   extraction tailings were measured to calculate bitumen recovery.
   Supernatants from the extraction tests were centrifuged to separate and
   measure the contents of fine solid particles. Except for limonene and
   isoprene, the tested solvents showed good bitumen recoveries of around
   95\%. The solvent drying rates and residual solvent contents in the
   extracted oil sands tailings correlated to solvent vapour pressure. The
   contents of fine solids in the extracted bitumen (supernatant) were
   below 2.9\% for all solvents except n-heptane-rich ones. Based on these
   findings, cyclohexane is the best candidate solvent for bitumen
   extraction, with 94.4\% bitumen recovery, 5mg of residual solvent per
   kilogram of extraction tailings and 1.4wt\% fine solids in the recovered
   bitumen. (c) 2012 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a fuzzy expert system (FES) is significantly affected
   by the accuracy of its knowledge base parameters (membership functions
   and rule bases). The main contribution of this paper is in presenting a
   methodology to integrate an FES with adaptation/optimization techniques
   and applying the data-based adaptive learning concept to increase the
   accuracy of an FES developed for contractor default prediction for
   surety bonding. In addition, this paper investigates two optimization
   approaches (genetic algorithms and neural network back-propagation) for
   adaptation of fuzzy membership function (MBF) and rules' degree of
   support (DoS) to determine the most suitable technique to adapt the FES.
   The optimized FES, called SuretyQualification, was validated using 30
   hypothetical contractor default prediction cases, and the highest
   accuracy of the system (adapted using neural networks) was found to be
   91.83\%. Another contribution of this paper is the development of a
   software tool called SuretyQualification that provides a comprehensive
   and systematic evaluation process to evaluate a contractor and their
   risk of default on a project. The presented optimization approaches
   address FES context adaptation using any changing information conveyed
   by the input-output data and provide a methodology for continuous
   adaptation of the FES parameters, using practical cases to adjust the
   FES according to any contexts changes. (C) 2013 American Society of

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel rotation invariant method for texture
   classification based on local frequency components. The local frequency
   components are computed by applying 1-D Fourier transform on a
   neighboring function defined on a circle of radius R at each pixel. We
   observed that the low frequency components are the major constituents of
   the circular functions and can effectively represent textures. Three
   sets of features are extracted from the low frequency components, two
   based on the phase and one based on the magnitude. The proposed features
   are invariant to rotation and linear changes of illumination. Moreover,
   by using low frequency components, the proposed features are very robust
   to noise. While the proposed method uses a relatively small number of
   features, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in three well-known
   datasets: Brodatz, Outex, and CUReT. In addition, the proposed method is
   very robust to noise and can remarkably improve the classification
   accuracy especially in the presence of high levels of noise.}},

Abstract = {{Security and privacy concerns remain a major factor that hinders the
   whole scale adoption of web-based technology in sensitive situations,
   such as financial transactions (Gao and Owolabi, 2008; Lichtenstein and
   Williamson, 2006). These concerns impact both end users and content
   generators. To tackle this problem requires a complimentary technology
   to the already developed and deployed infrastructure for web security.
   Hence, we have developed a multi-layer framework for web client security
   based on mobile code instrumentation. This architecture seeks to isolate
   exploitable security vulnerabilities and enforce runtime policies
   against malicious code constructs. Our instrumentation process uniquely
   integrates both static and dynamic engines and is driven by flexible
   (XML based) rewrite rules for a scalable operation and transparent
   deployment.
   Based on secure equivalents for vulnerable JavaScript objects and
   methods, our mechanism offers superior runtime performance compared to
   other approaches. Extensive investigation using four case studies shows
   that the instrumentation technique provides a potential solution to curb
   the rising number of security exploits that exist on the web today. In
   addition, performance data gathered from evaluations on active websites
   demonstrate that the mechanism has very little impact in terms of user
   experience; thus making it plausible for adoption by end-users. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the approach taken to the geosphere risk assessment
   conducted for the IEAGHG Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage
   Project. The role of the geosphere risk assessment is to facilitate
   clear identification, analysis and communication of the often complex
   technical issues that could potentially reduce the ability of a CO2
   storage project to store CO2 or to contain the bulk of the CO2 within
   the subsurface. It should provide sufficient information to enable the
   risks to the biosphere from potential CO2 releases from the storage
   project to be assessed so that stakeholders can come to a view about
   project acceptability.
   One of the main objectives of the Weyburn-Midale Project research was to
   test and demonstrate that around 30 Mt of CO2 is likely to remain safely
   stored underground for a very long period of time. The risk assessment
   concluded that, based on currently available data, this objective would
   be met. It also identified that although all identified risks met
   containment risk targets, well pathways pose by far the greatest risk to
   containment (approximately three and one half orders of magnitude higher
   than the risk posed by natural events and by EOR activities). Given the
   relative contribution of this risk to the overall containment risk for
   the project, it was identified that a review of well abandonment
   practices may be warranted to treat this risk.
   The risk assessment commenced early in the life of the Weyburn-Midale
   Project, thereby allowing knowledge gaps and areas of uncertainty to be
   identified. As a result, additional research was commissioned to address
   some of these gaps and uncertainties. The results of the research were
   incorporated into subsequent assessments of risk, thereby improving
   confidence in risk assessment outputs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to describe the methodology developed to link
   the quantitative outputs of the geosphere risk assessment to the
   semi-quantitative assessment of risk to the biosphere. It also shows how
   good practice stakeholder engagement principles can be incorporated into
   the risk assessment process to achieve transparency in project decision
   making. The objective of the biosphere risk assessment portion of the
   Weyburn-Midale Project was to develop a risk assessment methodology that
   can be applied to a range of CO2 storage projects. Preliminary modelling
   of potential biosphere impacts associated with the Weyburn-Midale
   Project was undertaken to enable the risk assessment methodology to be
   tested and to demonstrate the nature of the biosphere risk assessment
   outputs, and how the process and outputs can be used to facilitate
   stakeholder acceptance.
   The method to assess the biosphere risk at the Weyburn-Midale Project
   uses the outputs (pathways, likelihoods and CO2 mass) from geosphere
   risk assessment to identify the general physical and chemical effects on
   the fundamental biosphere components (groundwater, surface water, soil,
   air) and the consequential impacts on organisms, habitat, amenity and
   public safety. The approach applies an existing environmental impact
   assessment methodology to derive outputs that stakeholders can use to
   assess the risk and impacts to environmental assets.
   The outcomes of biosphere risk assessment are used to: develop risk
   mitigation strategies and future monitoring options; understand whether
   the project will likely have unacceptable impacts on safety or valued
   community assets; decide whether the project should proceed; and to
   assist engagement with regulators and the community. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{As granular soils may be compressible or have inadequate strength,
   compaction is particularly useful when soils are subjected to dynamic
   loading or cyclic loading. A new laboratory apparatus for investigating
   dynamic compaction has been designed and fabricated. The basic principle
   of this new technique is to introduce vibrations during the expansion
   process in static compaction grouting. In these tests,the injection
   pressure, the excess pore water pressure, and the change in void ratio
   of the specimens are measured. The main focus is to investigate the
   development of the injection pressure, the void ratio, and the excess
   pore water pressure due to dynamic compaction and the subsequent
   consolidation of the soils. In addition, the relative density of the
   soils is used to evaluate the dynamic compaction efficiency. Scaled
   laboratory experiments are conducted to study the effect of this dynamic
   compaction frequency on compaction efficiency. The experimental results
   show that the change in void ratio in the dynamic compaction tests is
   about four times greater than that in the static compaction tests.
   Dynamic compaction frequency plays an important role in soil
   densification due to dynamic compaction. (C) 2013 The Japanese

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{353-362}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The concepts of percolation theory and fractal geometry are combined to
   define the connectivity characteristics of 2-D fracture networks and a
   new approach to estimate the equivalent fracture network permeability
   (EFNP) is introduced. In this exercise, the fractal dimensions of
   different fracture network features (intersection points, fracture
   lines, connectivity index, and also fractal dimensions of scanning lines
   in X- and Y-directions), and the dimensionless percolation density of
   fracture networks are required. The method is based on the proposed
   correlations between the EFNP and a percolation term, (rho'-rho'(c)).
   The first parameter in this term is the dimensionless density, and the
   second one is the percolation threshold (a constant number). This term
   is obtained using the relationships with the properties of fracture
   networks mentioned above. It was found that the highest correlation
   coefficient between the actual and the predicted EFNP could be obtained
   using the percolation term, (rho'-rho'(c)), calculated from the fractal
   dimension of fracture lines by the box-counting technique. The method
   introduced is validated using different fracture patterns representing a
   wide range of fracture and length values. In addition, a correlation
   between the number of fractures in the domain and the minimum size of
   the fracture length is presented to estimate the shortest or minimum
   fracture length required for percolation for a given number of fractures
   in the domain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Chemical-mechanical bromination of biomass ash for mercury removal from

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{54-59}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Current approaches for mercury removal have been focusing on injection
   of powdered activated carbon sorbents into the flue gas stream. In
   particular, brominated activated carbon has been proven at pilot scale
   and plant trials to be effective at removing mercury from flue gases of
   coal-fired power plants. However, activated carbon is a costly source
   material. Using an industrial solid waste from biomass combustion as an
   alternative source material to produce sorbents for mercury emission
   control is an attractive option. This paper describes a novel
   chemical-mechanical bromination process for production of mercury
   sorbent from a biomass combustion ash, which is normally considered a
   solid waste. The chemical-mechanical brominated ash was characterized
   and tested for mercury capture and release at high temperatures. The
   brominated biomass ash was found to effectively capture mercury up to
   390 degrees C in lab scale tests. The tests of the new brominated
   sorbent in a 375 MW coal fired power plant showed promising performance.

Title = {{Analytical model for zeta potential of asphaltene}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{543-549}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide for the first time an analytical framework for
   calculating the zeta (f) potential of asphaltene in aqueous solution in
   presence and in absence of an electrolyte salt. The analytical model is
   based on the assumption that the ionizable (in aqueous solution)
   carboxylic and hydroxyl groups present on the asphaltene molecule lead
   to its charging. The model predicts the zeta potential as a function of
   parameters such as buffer pH and electrolyte salt concentration. For the
   case with the added salt, f potential decreases with pH monotonically,
   and we obtain quantitative match with the experimental results. For the
   case without the added salt, the variation with pH is non-monotonic,
   represented by presence of two distinct extrema, and can be attributed
   to the role of the corresponding Electric Double Layer (EDL) thickness,
   which (in absence of any added salt) is a sole function of the pH. (C)

Abstract = {{Branched Poly(ethylenimine) (bPEI) is a commercially available cationic
   polymer, which is well-studied due to its superior gene transfection
   efficacies. However, its toxicity is a major concern for its use in
   clinical applications. Therefore, bPEI is modified with various
   non-ionic, non-toxic moieties in an effort to reduce its toxicity.
   Ternary complexes of PEI with anionic polymers have also been used to
   decrease its toxicity. In this report, we have prepared pH-sensitive
   glycopolymers of linear and hyperbranched architecture via reversible
   addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT). These
   anionic glycopolymers were complexed with bPEI at varying weight by
   weight (w/w) ratios to reduce the toxicity of PEI in vitro. In addition,
   these PEI-anionic glycopolymer complexes showed improved buffering
   capacity, as compared to PEI alone. The interactions of anionic
   glycopolymers with Hep G2 and HEK 293T cells were then studied as a
   function of time. The cellular uptake and gene expression of PEI
   polyplexes in the presence of anionic glycopolymers was directly related
   to the interactions of anionic glycopolymers with Hep G2 and HEK 293T

Abstract = {{Principal curves arising as an essential construct in dimensionality
   reduction and pattern recognition have recently attracted much attention
   from theoretical as well as practical perspective. Existing methods
   usually employ the first principal component of the data as an initial
   estimate of principal curves. However, they may be ineffective when
   dealing with complex data with self-intersecting characteristics, high
   curvature, and significant dispersion. In this paper, a new method based
   on global structure is proposed to detect the principal graph-a set of
   principal curves from complex data. First, the global structure of the
   data, called an initial principal graph, is extracted based on a
   thinning technique, which captures the approximate topological features
   of the complex data. In terms of the characteristics of the data,
   vertex-merge step and the improved fitting-and-smoothing phase are then
   proposed to control the deviation of the principal graph and improve the
   process of optimizing the principal graph. Finally, the restructuring
   step introduced by Kegl is used to rectify imperfections of the
   principal graph. By using synthetic and real-world data sets, the
   proposed method is compared with other existing algorithms. Experimental
   results show the effectiveness of the global structure based method. (c)

Abstract = {{In this paper, the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability of the
   doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind energy conversion
   system in the asymmetrical grid fault situation is analyzed, and the
   control scheme for the system is proposed to follow the requirements
   defined by the grid codes. As analyzed in the paper, the control efforts
   of the negative-sequence current are much higher than that of the
   positive-sequence current for the DFIG. As a result, the control
   capability of the DFIG restrained by the dc-link voltage will degenerate
   for the fault type with higher negative-sequence voltage component and 2
   phi fault turns out to be the most serious scenario for the LVRT
   problem. When the fault location is close to the grid connection point,
   the DFIG may be out of control resulting in non-ride-through zones. In
   the worst circumstance when LVRT can succeed, the maximal
   positive-sequence reactive current supplied by the DFIG is around 0.4
   pu, which coordinates with the present grid code. Increasing the power
   rating of the rotor-side converter can improve the LVRT capability of
   the DFIG but induce additional costs. Based on the analysis, an LVRT
   scheme for the DFIG is also proposed by taking account of the code
   requirements and the control capability of the converters. As verified
   by the simulation and experimental results, the scheme can promise the
   DFIG to supply the defined positive-sequence reactive current to support
   the power grid and mitigate the oscillations in the generator torque and
   dc-link voltage, which improves the reliability of the wind farm and the
   power system.}},

Month = {{MAY 30}},
Abstract = {{Unlike physical patterning of materials at nanometer scale, manipulating
   soft matter such as biomolecules into patterns is still in its infancy.
   Self-assembled monolayer (SAM) with surface density gradient has the
   capability to drive biomolecules in specific directions to create
   hierarchical and discrete structures. Here, we report on a two-step
   process of self-assembly of the human serum albumin (HSA) protein into
   discrete ring structures based on density gradient of SAM. The
   methodology involves first creating a 2-dimensional (2D) polyethylene
   glycol (PEG) islands with responsive carboxyl functionalities.
   Incubation of proteins on such pre-patterned surfaces results in direct
   self-assembly of protein molecules around PEG islands. Immobilization
   and adsorption of protein on such structures over time evolve into the
   self-assembled patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Simulating droplet coalescence is challenging because small-scale (tens
   of nanometers) phenomena determine the behavior of much larger
   (micrometer- to millimeter-scale) droplets. In general, Liquid droplets
   colliding in a liquid medium coalesce when the capillary number is less
   than a critical value. We present simulations of droplet collisions and
   coalescence in simple shear flow using the free-energy binary-liquid
   lattice Boltzmann method. In previous simulations of low-speed
   collisions, droplets coalesced at unrealistically high capillary
   numbers. Simulations of noncoalescing droplets have not been reported,
   and therefore, the critical capillary number for simulated collisions
   was unknown. By simulating droplets with radii up to 100 lattice nodes,
   we determine the critical capillary number for coalescence and quantify
   the effects of several numerical and geometric parameters. The
   simulations were performed with a well-resolved interface, a Reynolds
   number of one, and capillary numbers from 0.01 to 0.2. The ratio of the
   droplet radius and interface thickness has the greatest effect on the
   critical capillary number. As in experiments, the critical capillary
   number decreases with increasing droplet size. A second numerical
   parameter, the interface diffusivity (Peclet number) also influences the
   conditions for coalescence: coalescence occurs at higher capillary
   numbers with lower Peclet numbers (higher diffusivity). The effects of
   the vertical offset between the droplets and the confinement of the
   droplets were also studied. Physically reasonable results were obtained
   and provide insight into the conditions for coalescence. Simulations
   that match the conditions of experiments reported in the literature
   remain computationally impractical. However, the scale of the
   simulations is now sufficiently large that a comparison with experiments
   involving smaller droplets (approximate to 10 mu m) and lower
   viscosities (approximate to 10(-6) m(2)/s, the viscosity of water) may
   be possible. Experiments at these conditions are therefore needed to
   determine the interface thickness and Pedet number that should be used
   for predictive slmulations of coalescence phenomena.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{27-32}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Indirect and direct microwave regeneration were assessed as potential
   techniques for desorbing a CO2/CH4 mixture from Na-ETS-10. Indirect
   microwave regeneration consists of desorption with water followed by
   microwave drying, while direct microwave regeneration consists of
   constant power microwave heating. Five adsorption-desorption cycles were
   completed to determine and compare the swing capacity, net energy
   consumption, and gas recovery obtained with these two regeneration
   techniques. During indirect microwave regeneration the swing capacity of
   Na-ETS-10 was stable at 0.3 mmol/g, with the exception of the first
   cycle where it reached 1.6 mmol/g. The first cycle swing capacity
   decreased however, by fivefold during the subsequent desorption cycles.
   During direct microwave regeneration, the swing capacity remained stable
   at 0.7 mmol/g over all five consecutive cycles. On average, 2.46 KJ and
   0.32 KJ were consumed during regeneration of 1 g of Na-ETS-10 using
   indirect and direct microwave regeneration, respectively. With the
   exception of the first cycle, gas recovery for indirect microwave
   regeneration was only 20\%. In contrast, an average of 50\% gas recovery
   was achieved by direct microwave regeneration. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Recovery of bitumen from oil sands in northern Alberta, Canada, occurs
   by surface mining or in situ thermal. recovery, and both methods produce
   toxic oil sands process-affected Water (OSPW). A new. characterization
   strategy for surface mining OSPW (sm-OSPW) and in situ OSPW (is-OSPW)
   was achieved by combining liquid chromatography With orbitrap mass
   spectrometry (MS). In electrospray positive and negative ionization
   mode's.(ESI+/ESI-), mass spectral data:were acquired with high resolving
   power (RP > 100 000-190 000) and mass accuracy (<2 ppm). The additional
   chromatographic resolution allowed for separation of various isomers and
   interference-free MSn experiments. Overall, similar to 3000 elemental
   compositions were revealed in. each OSPW sample, corresponding to a
   range of heteroatom-containing homologue classes: O-x (where x = 1-6),
   NOx (where x = 1-4), SOx (where x = 1-4), NO2S, N, and S. Despite
   similarities between the OSPW samples at the level of heteroatom class,
   the two samples were very different when considering isomer patterns and
   double-bond equivalent profiles. The chromatographic separations also
   allowed for confirmation that, in both OSPW samples, the O-2 species
   detected in ESI- (i.e., naphthenic acids) were chemically distinct from
   the corresponding O-2 species detected in ESI+. In comparison to model
   compounds, tandem MS spectra of these new O-2 species suggested a group
   of non-acidic compounds with dihydroxy, diketo, or ketohydroxy
   functionality. In light of the known endocrine-disrupting potential of
   sm-OSPW, the toxicity : of these O-2 species deserves attention and the
   method should be further applied to environmental forensic analysis of
   water in the region.}},

   surfactant-rich solvent}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY 21}},
Abstract = {{Preparing low energy liquid-repellant surfaces (superhydrophobic or
   superoleophobic) have attracted tremendous attention of late. In all
   these studies, the necessary liquid repellency is achieved by
   irreversible micro-nano texturing of the surfaces. Here we show for the
   first time that a glass surface, placed under water, can be made
   superoleophobic (with unprecedented contact angles close to 180 degrees
   and roll off angles only a few fractions of 1 degree) by merely changing
   the surfactant content of the water medium in which the oil (immiscible
   in water) has been dispersed. Therefore, we propose a paradigm shift in
   efforts to achieve liquid-repellant systems, namely, altering the
   solvent characteristics instead of engineering the surfaces. The effect
   occurs for a surfactant concentration much larger than the critical
   micelle concentration, and is associated to strong adsorption of
   surfactant molecules at the solid surface, triggering an extremely
   stable Cassie-Baxter like conformation of the oil droplets.}},

   high refractive index (n similar to 1.43) PDMS by soft lithography.
   Outer layers of lower-index (n similar to 1.41) PDMS were subsequently
   added to provide optical and fluidic confinement. Here, we focus on the
   design and characterization of the microspectrometer part, which employs
   a novel self-focusing strategy based on cylindrical facets, and exhibits
   resolution <10 nm in the visible wavelength range. The dispersive
   behavior of the grating was analyzed both experimentally and using

Abstract = {{Single-particle interactions hold the promise of nanometer-scale devices

   plasmon-assisted heat generation and flux. The temperature dependence of
   the dielectric function and the thermal transport properties of the
   particles play the central role in the feasibility of the
   thermally-actuated system, however the behavior of these thermoplasmonic
   processes is unclear. We experimentally and computationally analyzed
   modulation via thermoplasmonic processes on a test system of gold (Au)
   nano-islands. Modulation and energy transport in discontinuous domains
   exhibited quantitatively different characteristics compared to thin

Abstract = {{In this work, an experimental and theoretical investigation was
   conducted on the adsorptive removal of CO2 onto tetraethylenepentamine
   (TEPA) functionalized mesoporous SBA-15. The functionalization of SBA-15
   silica with TEPA was achieved using a conventional wet impregnation
   technique. The structural properties of the mesoporous silica sorbents
   were characterized by nitrogen adsorption/desorption, SAXS, SEM, TEM,
   and FTIR techniques. The adsorption of CO2 on the amine-impregnated
   sorbent was measured by thermogravimetric method over a CO2 partial
   pressure range of 10-100 kPa and a temperature range of 30-100 degrees C
   under atmospheric pressure. The effects on CO2 adsorption capacity of
   temperature, partial pressure of COD amine loading, and moisture were
   evaluated. All the impregnated SBA-15 sorbents showed reversible CO2
   adsorption behaviors with fast adsorption kinetics. The CO2 adsorption
   capacity measured at different temperatures suggests that the optimal
   adsorption temperature is 75 degrees C. The CO2 uptake of the
   amine-impregnated sorbent increased significantly in the presence of
   moisture. SBA-15 containing 60 wt \% TEPA showed the highest CO2
   adsorption capacity of 5.22 mmol/g in pure and humid CO, at 75 degrees
   C. Temperature swing adsorption/desorption cycles were also explored
   using simulated flue gas in both dry and humid conditions, and it was
   found that CO2 uptake after ten cycles was within 90\% of CO2 uptake of
   the first cycle. Different adsorption kinetic models have also been
   investigated to analyze the experimental data of CO, uptake. The model
   was validated with the experimental results of isothermal adsorption
   measurements of CO2 on SBA-15/TEPA. It has been found that Fractional
   Order kinetic model (Chem. Eng. J. 2011, 173, 72) is very good over the
   entire adsorption region of the study with a maximum average absolute
   deviation between experimental CO2 uptake and that calculated from the
   model of about 2.42\%.}},

Abstract = {{A medium-pressure (MP) ultraviolet (UV) process has been applied to
   investigate the direct UV photolysis and UV/H2O2 oxidation of selected
   model micropollutants (naproxen, carbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil,
   ibuprofen, caffeine, 2,4-D, 2,4-DCP, and mecoprop). The quantum yields
   were found to be between0.0010and 0.13 at pH = 7. In the MP UV/H2O2
   oxidation, the pseudo first-order rate constants for the selected
   compounds were found to be dependent on their initial concentrations (at
   mg/L levels) and on the H2O2 concentration. The UV doses required for
   50\% and 90\% removal at various H2O2 levels varied widely among the
   compounds tested. Second-order rate constants (ranging from 4.1 x 10(9)
   to 1.4 x 10(10) M-1 s(-1)) for the reaction between the selected
   compounds and hydroxyl radicals were determined using a
   competition-kinetics approach, where para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) was
   chosen as the reference compound. Further, as an evaluation of
   electrical energy efficiency, the Figure-of-Merit, Electrical Energy per
   Order (E-EO) was determined for the selected compounds using a batch
   reactor at 25 and 50 mg/L H2O2 concentrations. The electrical energy (in
   kWh) required to reduce a pollutant concentration by 90\% ranged from
   1.3 to 7.1 kWh m(-3). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 14}},
Abstract = {{Laser ablation of chromium with nanojoule energy UV femtosecond pulses
   under background pressure conditions between 0.3 Torr and 700 Torr is
   studied and the corresponding plasma plume images at different times
   after irradiation are measured. The ablation focal spot is less than or
   the order of a micron when 170 nJ of laser pulse energy is used. This
   low pulse energy leads to short lifetimes of the plasma of the order of
   tens of nanoseconds. The plume shape changes with ambient pressure due
   to the collision with background gas. An axially stretched plume changes
   to a more circular plume as the pressure increases. In addition, a
   separation of the ionic and atomic components is observed at lower
   pressure. These two components move at significantly different
   velocities as well. The plasma plume expands at almost constant velocity
   at very low pressure but exhibits significant deceleration at higher
   pressure reaching an asymptotic stopping distance. Plume images are also
   obtained near the ablation threshold pulse energy. The plume
   characteristics are compared to different models of plume expansion. (C)

Abstract = {{In vitro drug release mechanism of core/shell nanofibers of poly(methyl

   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), Korsmeyer-Peppas equation and Fickian diffusion model were
   utilized to characterize the system. Antibacterial activity of the
   designed drug delivery system was investigated against Gram-positive
   Listeria innocua through optical density (OD) measurement. The system
   showed sustained drug release through three stages; although the release
   in stage I followed non-Fickian diffusion, Fickian diffusion was proven
   to be the release mechanism of stages II and III. A significant decrease
   in the diffusion coefficient from stage II to stage III was observed,
   which is believed to be the consequence of crystallization of fibers as
   a result of long-term incubation in an aqueous solution. Finally, the
   antibacterial activity of the system was verified by means of optical
   density (OD) measurements against Gram-positive L innocua. (C) 2013

   that threshold, ablation yielded a minimum resonance shift of -1.7nm.
   There was some increase in waveguide loss for both trimming mechanisms.

Abstract = {{Understanding and minimizing the film drainage resistance (forces) from
   a moving fluid are of great importance both scientifically and
   technologically. The direct and accurate measurement of film drainage
   resistance was made possible by integrating a speaker diaphragm of large
   displacement range and rapid responses with a sensitive bimorph force
   sensor and high resolution digital camera: Our study demonstrates that
   the liquid :film drainage resistance can be greatly diminished or
   accurately controlled by increasing or controlling the hydrophobicity of
   solid surfaces. The results show that for a given solid surface
   hydrophobicity, the film drainage resistance at the point where film
   ruptures increases linearly with increasing bubble approach velocity.
   The dependence of the film drainage. resistance on bubble :approach
   velocity decreases linearly with increasing hydrophobicity of the solid
   surface. This finding has important implications for biological
   processes, microfluidic devices, and design of new materials.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral decision making is an area of multidisciplinary research
   attracting growing interest of scientists and practitioners, economists,
   and business people. A wide spectrum of successful theories is present
   now, including Prospect theory, multiple priors models, studies on
   altruism, trust and fairness. However, these theories are developed for
   precise and complete information, whereas real information concerning a
   decision maker's (DM) behavior and environment is imperfect,
   qualitative, and, as a result, often described in natural language (NL).
   We suggest an approach based on modeling a DM's behavior by a set of
   states. Each state represents a certain principal behavior. In our
   approach, states of nature and DM's states constitute a single space of
   combined states. For formalizing relevant information described in NL,
   we use fuzzy set theory. The utility model is based on Choquet-like
   integration over combined states. The investigations show that Expected
   Utility, Choquet Expected Utility and Cumulative Prospect Theory are
   special cases of the suggested approach. We apply the suggested approach
   to solving a benchmark and a real-life decision problem. The obtained
   results show validity of the suggested approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, an adaptive vector controller is designed for a

   asymptotic tracking of the q-axis current using an inner loop, which
   contain two proportional-integral ( PI) controllers that have adaptive
   decoupling terms. The output of an outer loop PI controller for dc
   voltage defines the reference for the d-axis current control. The
   asymptotic stability of the closed-loop is proven using Lyapunov's
   method. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in the
   simulation and experiment, and results show improved performance and
   ease of controller tuning.}},

   provided in terms of a 3-FPGA and 10-FPGA real-time hardware emulation
   of a three-phase 42-bus and 420-bus power systems using detailed
   modelling of various system components and iterative non-linear solution

Abstract = {{The interaction between asphaltenes and clay is crucial in understanding
   wettability changes in petroleum reservoirs and in oilsands production.
   In this study, we report the changes in surface properties and
   composition of kaolin clay as a result of exposure to solutions of
   asphaltenes. Adsorption experiments were conducted at 25 degrees C with
   solutions of asphaltenes in toluene at concentrations ranging from 0.05
   to 5 mg/mL. The wettability of the modified kaolinite surface was
   characterized by contact angle measurement. Chemical composition changes
   of the surface because of asphaltene adsorption were assessed using
   time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and elemental analysis. The contact
   angle data indicated that, upon asphaltene adsorption, the clay
   particles changed from water-wet to bi-wet. Both ToF-SIMS and XPS
   measurements indicated that the kaolinite surface was never completely
   covered by asphaltenes based on the concentration of Al and Si on
   asphaltene-treated kaolinite surfaces. ToF-SIMS analysis indicated that,
   with more asphaltenes covered on the kaolinite surface, the relative
   intensities of C3H5+/Al+ and C3H5+/Si+ increased and an inverse linear
   correlation between the contact angle and surface Si+ concentration was
   observed. The maximum thickness of adsorbed asphaltenes, assuming
   complete surface coverage, was estimated to be 11 nm based on XPS depth
   profile results on a model silica surface, with a mean value of 3 nm.
   The XPS depth profile also indicated no preferential adsorption of
   nitrogen- or sulfur-rich species at the interface between asphaltenes
   and kaolinite.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-wide bandwidth communication systems are known to suffer from
   non-Gaussian interference. In general, wireless ad-hoc networks, due to
   the lack of perfect power control and the random placement of nodes, are
   very likely to experience non-Gaussian multiple access interference. In
   systems with additive non-Gaussian noise, non-Gaussian signal detection
   and nonlinear signal processing can play important roles, especially in
   suppressing the multiple access interference. Practical ultra-wide
   bandwidth receiver designs based on the astable non-Gaussian additive
   impairment model are proposed and evaluated. It is demonstrated that the
   a-stable model together with a fractile based parameter estimation
   technique constitute a robust technique for adaptive receiver designs.
   The proposed receivers based on the a-stable model suppress multiple
   access interference, adapt to the noise and the interference in the
   environment, and are robust to estimation errors in the receiver
   parameters. The proposed receivers provide much better bit error rates
   than linear detectors and previously known nonlinear detectors.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to characterize proteinacious material
   recovered from cattle tissues known as specified risk materials (SRM)
   hydrolyzed according to two protocols approved by the Canadian Food
   Inspection Agency and Food and Drug Administration and to evaluate its
   potential for non-food/feed value-added applications. Sodium dodecyl
   sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), size exclusion
   high performance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC), and free amino acid
   determination methods were adopted to measure the extent of protein
   cleavage and the average molecular weight of hydrolyzates, and to
   identify the reactive functionalities available. Molecular weight
   analysis revealed that the alkaline hydrolysis protocol cleaved the
   proteins more severely than thermal hydrolysis. Both protocols narrowed
   the molecular weight distribution of the proteins and increased their
   solubility in water. Several active functional groups amenable to
   further chemical processing were identified in the protein hydrolyzates.
   In conclusion, this work demonstrated that both hydrolytic protocols can
   be adopted as pre-processing steps to produce safe and renewable
   proteinacious feedstock for industrial applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We present a unique experimental configuration that allows us to
   determine the interfacial forces on nearly parallel plates made from the
   thinnest possible mechanical structures, single and few layer graphene
   membranes. Our approach consists of using a pressure difference across a
   graphene membrane to bring the membrane to within similar to 10-20 nm
   above a circular post covered with SiOx or Au until a critical point is
   reached whereby the membrane snaps into adhesive contact with the post.
   Continuous measurements of the deforming membrane with an AFM coupled
   with a theoretical model allow us to deduce the magnitude of the
   interfacial forces between graphene and SiOx and graphene and Au. The
   nature of the interfacial forces at similar to 10-20 nm separation is
   consistent with an inverse fourth power distance dependence, implying
   that the interfacial forces are dominated by van der Waals interactions.
   Furthermore, the strength of the interactions is found to increase
   linearly with the number of graphene layers. The experimental approach
   can be used to measure the strength of the interfacial forces for other
   atomically thin two-dimensional materials and help guide the development
   of nanomechanical devices such as switches, resonators, and sensors.}},

Title = {{Application of Analytical Proxy Models in Reservoir Estimation for SAGD

Abstract = {{Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) has been used successfully for
   the last 25 years in Canada. SAGD is a thermal recovery process that was
   invented to extract highly viscous bitumen from deep Canadian oil-sands
   reservoirs. To date, the original idea of SAGD has not changed greatly
   since the first pilot test in 1987. However, field operation and
   reservoir management have been influenced by recent developments in
   technology. Advanced drilling techniques, automated production control,
   and real-time data monitoring are gradually transforming the SAGD
   process into smart fields. As such, improving current history-matching
   techniques would support fast decision-making requirements significantly
   in closed-loop reservoir management.
   This paper recommends analytical solutions for simulations with
   medium-to-high levels of uncertainty. This shows how an analytical
   simulator can be improved effectively to mimic the essential features of
   a SAGD field for fast history matching. Combined with the analytical
   model recently proposed by the authors, this paper investigates the
   methodology to apply uncomplicated analytical/mathematical solutions to
   practical cases. The two underground-test-facility (UTF) pilot-test case
   studies covered in this paper provide a better understanding of the
   proposed methodology. History-matching results show that the current
   analytical models are suitable to act as proxy models for optimization
   purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Placement of steam-assisted-gravity-drainage (SAGD) surface production
   pads and subsurface drainage areas in the McMurray formation to maximize
   the economic potential of an area is a challenging problem. The location
   of surface pads (SPs) and drainage areas has a large impact on their
   production performance because of several factors, including variation
   of bitumen in place, variation of the reservoir base surface, vertical
   conformance, areal conformance, interaction between different drainage
   areas and pads, and surface hazards. An optimization algorithm is
   presented to determine the positions and orientations of SPs and
   drainage areas over a reservoir area; therefore, the potential for
   economically recoverable bitumen is maximized. The optimization
   considers either a deterministic model of the relevant properties or
   multiple realizations to account for uncertainty. Optimization considers
   all drainage areas simultaneously to ensure joint optimality of an
   entire set. The algorithm is demonstrated using two realistic examples
   that show a significant improvement in potential recovery. The algorithm
   executes in a reasonable amount of computation time, considering the
   complexity of the problem.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, the feasibility of label-free in vivo GRIN-lens optical
   resolution photoacoustic micro-endoscopy is demonstrated. An image guide
   with 100 000 single-mode fibers in a 1.4 mm diameter bundle in
   conjunction with a 0.29 pitch GRIN lens is used in order to transfer a
   focused scanning spot through the image guide and refocus it into
   tissue. A high-repetition-rate (up to 600 kHz) ytterbium fiber laser is
   used in order to enable near real-time imaging capability. Phantom
   studies indicate 6 mu m resolution. The system, with similar to 2 mm
   working distance, overcomes the penetration depth limitation and hence
   improves the surface laser fluence of previously reported fiber based
   optical resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM). The proposed
   system with a sub-mm probe footprint is very flexible and now has a
   significant penetration depth which is another step towards clinical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing the throughput of the powerful single-step glancing angle
   deposition (GLAD) method using a prototype simplified roll-to-roll (R2R)
   system has been explored. While the conventional GLAD technique is
   popular for fabricating nanostructured devices in a single deposition
   step, it is not a high-output process. To evaluate the feasibility of
   large area GLAD deposition, the authors examined the geometrical
   considerations required to eventually achieve GLAD in a roll-to-roll
   manufacturing system. Nominal deposition and rotation angles were
   mathematically translated to their effective R2R counterparts, allowing
   for deposition recipes of the archetype GLAD nanostructures (slanted
   posts, vertical posts, and square spirals) and the mechanics of the
   phi-sweep technique to be converted to this space. Representative
   structures were then deposited, and the phi-sweep technique successfully
   applied, in a prototype single barrel roller R2R experimental system.
   This prototype system provides a foundation for moving GLAD from the
   laboratory to mass production. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{An oil spill on solid ice poses unique challenges to that of a spill on
   water or land. One challenge, which this study has elected to
   investigate, is the tendency of ice to crack and form channels. These
   channels are able to transport the oil away from the main mass of the
   spill making efficient cleanup difficult. Within the context of in situ
   burning, the oil channels may expedite the critical thickness of the oil
   spill being reached. A series of bench scale tests using a 100 cm long
   ice channel were conducted to study the effects of varying ice channel
   widths on the spread of an oil mixture, to mimic solid sea ice
   conditions that may be found in higher latitudes. Results suggest that
   spread rates of oil in ice channels approximately follows a viscous
   two-dimensional box model. The implication of these results on in situ
   burning of oil in icy conditions is discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents the deformation and pore-water pressure response
   within peat foundations below three different railway embankments in
   response to cyclic heavy axle loading. The study sites include two at
   Canadian National (CN) Railway's Edson and Lac-La-Biche subdivisions in
   northern Alberta, and one at CN's Levis subdivision in southeastern
   Quebec. The three sites were instrumented to monitor the spatial
   distribution of strain, pore pressure generation, and stress, and the
   distribution of horizontal cyclic displacement with depth during the
   passage of trains. The horizontal cyclic displacement with depth was
   measured using a ShapeAccelArray (SAA). An analysis was conducted to
   determine how close the peat is to yielding under heavy axle loads. This
   analysis was based on the elastic response determined from undrained
   triaxial testing, a constitutive model developed for peat, and finite
   element modelling. The field response and the numerical modelling
   suggest that the embankments at the northern Alberta sites are stable
   under current loading conditions. The highest potential for yielding at
   these sites occurs just beneath the embankment and at the interface
   between the peat and underlying stiffer soil. At the Levis site the
   analysis suggests that a recently constructed ditch concentrates shear
   stress at a location where the principal stress orientation corresponds
   to a reduced strength of peat and may have increased the potential for
   yielding.}},

Abstract = {{Water was added as a diluent into the hydrophobic room temperature ionic
   liquid (RTIL) 1-butly-1-methyl-pyrrolidinium
   bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (BMP-TFSI) with the purpose of
   improving the conductivity of the RTIL, which is being considered as a
   potential electrolyte for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. The behavior of
   water additions in BMP-TFSI and its effect on Zn/Zn(II) redox behavior
   in BMP-TES! were studied. Two types of water, free or unbound water and
   bound water, were identified in BMP-TFSI through DSC and FUR analysis
   and density functional theory (DFT) modeling. When the water content was
   less than similar to 2.0 wt\%, water molecules interacted with
   {[}TESI](-) anions through hydrogen bonding. When the water amount was
   greater than 2.0 wt\%, clusters of water molecules (free water) were
   observed. Bound water in BMP-TFSI improved Zn/Zn(II) redox reversibility
   by reducing the activation overpotential for electrochemical reactions.
   The optimal amount of water, in terms of the kinetic properties for
   Zn/Zn(II) redox in BMP-TFSI, was 2.0 wt\%. Compared with water-free
   BMP-TFSI, both the diffusion coefficient for the Zn species and the
   exchange current density for Zn/Zn(II) redox reactions increased by
   approximately 70\% in BMP-TFSI with 2.0 wt\% water addition. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Carbon-nanotube, field-effect transistors (CNFETs) are among the
   candidates for emerging radio-frequency applications, and improved
   linearity has recently been identified as one of the performance
   advantages they might offer. In this paper, the potential for improved
   linearity has been investigated by considering an array-based device
   structure under the best-case scenario of ballistic transport. A
   nonlinear equivalent circuit for ballistic field-effect transistors is
   used to compare the linearity of CNFETs to conventional MOSFETs. We show
   that nanotube devices working at high frequencies are not inherently
   linear, as recently suggested in the literature, and that CNFETs exhibit
   overall linearity that is comparable to their MOSFET counterparts. The
   nonlinear quantum capacitance is identified to be a major source of
   high-frequency nonlinearity in CNFETs. The impacts of device parameters

   the desirable diversity order of uniform pruning and the threshold level

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effect of plastic deformation on the anodic
   dissolution behavior of pipeline steel in deaerated groundwater with
   near-neutral pH. The plastic deformation is introduced via two different
   ways: cold-rolling and in situ tension. It is observed that the
   cold-rolling prior to the exposure to corroding environment reduces the
   corrosion rate but the in situ tension increases corrosion rate
   slightly. In accord with thermodynamic analysis, the impacts of residual
   stresses and plastic deformation on active dissolution are very small
   except a highly non-uniform dislocation structure is formed. A
   preliminary analysis suggests that the reduced corrosion rate of
   cold-rolled steel is related to competitive adsorption of CO2 and H+ on
   the active sites over the surface.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{142-152}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Mixtures of hydrocarbons + water exhibit complex phase behaviors, and
   transitions in phase behavior classification also arise as hydrocarbon
   composition is varied. In this work, the phase behavior of Athabasca
   bitumen + water mixtures is reported, in the temperature range
   (522.1-644.0 K) and the pressure range (4.2-35.7 MPa).
   Pressure-temperature (at fixed composition) and pressure-composition (at
   fixed temperature) phase diagrams were prepared based on observations
   obtained using a view cell apparatus equipped with X-ray transmission
   tomography. Phase boundary and phase composition accuracy and precision
   were validated by reproducing phase diagrams for 1-methylnaphthalene +
   water and toluene + water mixtures available in the literature. The
   Athabasca bitumen + water pseudo-binary exhibits type Bib phase
   behavior, based on the van Konynenburg and Scott classification scheme,
   as the composition difference between the water rich and Athabasca
   bitumen rich liquid phases remain large and liquid-liquid-vapor phase
   behavior persists up to the critical temperature of water. The reported
   phase diagrams are expected to provide benchmark data needed to define

Abstract = {{The invariant observer is a recently introduced constructive nonlinear
   design method for symmetry-possessing systems such as the
   magnetometer-plus-global positioning system (GPS)-aided inertial
   navigation system (INS) example considered in this paper. The resulting
   observer guarantees a simplified form of the nonlinear estimation error
   dynamics, which can be stabilized by a proper choice of observer gains
   using a nonlinear analysis. A systematic approach to this step is the
   invariant Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is modified from its
   originally proposed form and applied to the aided INS example to obtain
   the observer gains. The resulting invariant observer is implemented
   onboard an outdoor helicopter unmanned aerial vehicle platform and
   successfully validated in experiment and demonstrates an improvement in
   performance over a conventional (non-invariant) EKF design.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous bioactive glasses such as 45S5 have been successfully used in
   bone-filling therapy in non-load bearing biomedical applications for
   decades. In this study, we challenge the predilection to amorphous over
   crystalline ceramics by investigating the effect of synthesis route on
   surface texture, in vitro dissolution, and mineral formation on powders
   produced by solgel and glass melt-casting methods. Many reports have
   indicated bulk crystalline bioactive glass-ceramics to be less bioactive
   than their amorphous counterparts as measured by the onset time for
   mineral formation. Bioactive glass 45S5 was synthesized using the solgel
   method followed by heat treatment to produce a semi-crystalline
   structure and was compared against commercially available amorphous
   melt-cast 45S5 powder. Gel-derived samples were stabilized at 700
   degrees C making more than 80\% of the structure crystalline.
   Dissolution of 45S5 glass-ceramic in powder form(particle diameter 12m)
   was studied by in vitro immersion in simulated body fluid solution for
   various periods of time. The immersed powders were then analyzed through
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy
   dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS), Differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (DSC/TGA), and Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to determine the onset time for surface
   mineralization, and were compared with the melt-cast powder as a
   control. The rates of dissolution and onset time for mineral formation
   were similar for the gel-derived powder as compared with the melt-cast
   control; it is proposed that the higher surface area of the solgel
   powder overcame the penalty usually associated with lower dissolution
   rates of crystalline materials, implicating surface texture as a much
   more important determinant of dissolution and mineralization behavior
   than mere crystallinity.}},

Abstract = {{Embryonic stem cells are actively explored as a cell source in tissue
   engineering and regenerative medicine involving bone repair. Basic
   fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been a valuable growth factor to
   support the culture of human stem cells as well as their osteogenic
   differentiation, but the influence of bFGF on mouse embryonic stem (mES)
   cells is not known. Towards this goal, D3 cells were treated with bFGF
   during maintenance conditions and during spontaneous and osteogenic
   differentiation. In feeder-free monolayers, up to 40ng/ml of exogenous
   bFGF did not support self-renewal of mES without LIF during cell
   expansion. During spontaneous differentiation in high-density cultures,
   bFGF stimulated cell proliferation under certain conditions but did not
   influence differentiation, as judged by stage-specific embryonic
   antigen-1 expression. The addition of bFGF reduced the alkaline
   phosphatase (ALP) activity associated with osteoblast activity during
   differentiation induced by osteogenic supplements, although the extent
   of mineralization was unaffected by bFGF. The bFGF increased the
   mesenchymal stem cell marker Sca-1 in an mES cell population and led to
   an enhanced increase in osteocalcin and runx2 expression in combination
   with BMP-2. These results suggest that bFGF could be utilized to expand
   the cell population in high-density cultures in addition to enriching
   the BMP-2 responsiveness of mES cells. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{In water distribution systems, water leakage from cracked water pipes is
   a major concern for water providers. Generally, the relationship between
   the leakage rate and the water pressure can be modeled by a power
   function developed from the orifice equation. This paper presents an

   rate through a longitudinal line crack of a water distribution pipe
   considering the surrounding soil properties. The derived solution agrees
   well with results of numerical simulations. Compared with the
   traditional models, the new solution allows assessment of all the
   parameters that related with leakage including the pressure head inside
   the pipe, hydraulic conductivity, crack size and its position, and pipe
   size and its depth.}},

Abstract = {{Protein adsorption at the biomaterial-tissue interface is of utmost
   importance to the widespread application of engineered materials. The
   present study asked what role the secondary structures of peptides play
   in their adsorption, as well as how these structures affect the
   physicochemical properties of the final adsorbed layer. To this end,
   alpha-helices and beta-sheets were induced in poly-L-lysine, and their
   adsorption to Au surfaces was monitored using quartz crystal
   microbalance with dissipation. It was observed that secondary structures
   played an important role in governing both the adsorption process and
   the final film properties. Higher initial adsorption rates were obtained
   for alpha-helices compared with beta-sheets, regardless of solution salt
   concentration. Adsorption half-time for beta-sheets was greater than
   that for alpha-helices, and the final amount adsorbed on beta-sheet was
   significantly higher than that on alpha-helix. The adsorbed amount and
   adsorption half-time decreased with increasing salt concentration,
   suggesting that electrostatic interactions played a role. It was found
   that the differences in Zeta potential coupled with the apparent effect
   of surface contact area differences between alpha-helix and beta-sheet
   conformations are ultimately responsible for these different peptide
   adsorption behaviours at the Au interface. The initial adsorption rate
   of alpha-helix increased with salt concentrations up to 50 mM, whereas
   beta-sheet initial adsorption rates increased with salt concentrations
   up to 500 mM. Viscosities for films formed from alpha-helices were about
   twice those of beta-sheets films, regardless of solution ionic strength.
   It was evident that the peptide secondary structures influence all
   aspects of their adsorption, as well as affecting the adsorbed film
   properties. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Introduction: Archwire rotation is used in orthodontic treatment to
   alter the labiolingual orientation of a tooth. Measurement of the
   3-dimensional (3D) motion of the orthodontic brackets requires a new
   configuration of the orthodontic torque simulator. Methods: The
   orthodontic torque simulator was coupled with a stereo microscope and 2
   cameras to allow for the 3D bracket motion to be determined during wire
   twisting. The stereo camera images were processed with a 3D digital
   image correlation technique to determine the 3D deformation of the
   orthodontic brackets. Three self-ligating brackets (Damon Q, Ormco,
   Orange, Calif; In-Ovation R, GAC, Bohemia, NY; and Speed, Strite
   Industries, Cambridge, Ontario, Canada) were compared by using the 3D
   digital image correlation method to demonstrate the difference in 3D
   motion of self-ligating brackets components. Results: Contour plots of
   the 3 brackets demonstrate the 3D motion of the bracket tie-wings and
   the archwire retentive component. The 3D motion of the bracket tie-wings
   and archwire retentive component were quantified. The displacement
   values of the archwire retentive component measured with the 3D
   orthodontic torque simulator were found to be 2.0 and 3.5 times less for
   the In-Ovation and Damon Q brackets than the values in previous studies
   that examined the compliance of the archwire retentive component.
   Conclusions: The 3D digital image correlation method used to quantify
   bracket deformation showed the 3D motion of the bracket tie-wings and
   the motion of the archwire retentive component. The use of a 3D optical
   measurement system is useful to understand the motion of the archwire
   retentive component but is not necessary to quantify bracket tie-wing
   motion. This measurement technique can be used to evaluate brackets of
   varying designs. (Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop 2013;143:645-57)}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{768}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{We have developed a general model for determining density-dependent
   effective dielectronic recombination (DR) rate coefficients in order to
   explore finite-density effects on the ionization balance of plasmas. Our
   model consists of multiplying by a suppression factor those
   highly-accurate total zero-density DR rate coefficients which have been
   produced from state-of-the-art theoretical calculations and which have
   been benchmarked by experiment. The suppression factor is based upon
   earlier detailed collision-radiative calculations which were made for a
   wide range of ions at various densities and temperatures, but used a
   simplified treatment of DR. A general suppression formula is then
   developed as a function of isoelectronic sequence, charge, density, and
   temperature. These density-dependent effective DR rate coefficients are
   then used in the plasma simulation code Cloudy to compute ionization
   balance curves for both collisionally ionized and photoionized plasmas
   at very low (n(e) = 1 cm(-3)) and finite (n(e) = 10(10) cm(-3))
   densities. We find that the denser case is significantly more ionized
   due to suppression of DR, warranting further studies of density effects
   on DR by detailed collisional-radiative calculations which utilize
   state-of-the-art partial DR rate coefficients. This is expected to
   impact the predictions of the ionization balance in denser cosmic gases
   such as those found in nova and supernova shells, accretion disks, and
   the broad emission line regions in active galactic nuclei.}},

Abstract = {{Many children and adults have specific reading disabilities; insight
   into the brain structure underlying these difficulties is evolving from
   imaging. Previous research highlights the left temporal-parietal white
   matter as important in reading, yet the degree of involvement of other
   areas remains unclear. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and voxel-based
   analysis were used to examine correlations between reading ability and
   tissue structure in healthy adolescents and young adults (n = 136) with
   a range of reading ability. Three complementary reading scores (word
   reading, decoding, and reading fluency) yielded positive correlations
   with fractional anisotropy (FA) that spanned bilateral brain regions,
   particularly in the frontal lobes, but also included the thalamus and
   parietal and temporal areas. An analysis of the unique effects of each
   reading assessment revealed that most of the variance in FA values could
   be attributed to sight word reading ability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Off-resonance can result in signal loss on triple-quantum-filtered (TQF)
   sodium images. Three correction methods have been proposed to mitigate
   this problem, but their effectiveness and necessity has not yet been
   evaluated for human brain. This evaluation is warranted given the
   doubling or quadrupling of scan length without the expected
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) benefit. First, simulations and agar gel
   experiments showed that the off-resonance effects on signal loss were
   asymmetric about on-resonance. Second, the two scan length doubling
   correction methods were tested for two sets of TQF acquisition
   parameters in 10 healthy volunteers at 4.7 Tesla. Using only manual
   shimming on the sodium signal and a 3-pulse TQF sequence with an optimal
   preparation time value of 6 ms, the majority of brain tissue voxels
   (87-94\% depending on sequence parameters) experienced B-0 inhomogeneity
   amounting to less than 10\% signal losses. Relative signal intensities
   of 0.96 +/- 0.04 and 0.98 +/- 0.02 were measured in these voxels
   relative to on-resonant voxels for SNR-optimized and standard TQF
   parameters. The remaining brain voxels in regions with known
   susceptibility problems suffered more substantial signal losses, which
   were partially recovered with the correction methods. At field strengths
   below 4.7 T, at similar ranges of offset frequencies at higher fields
   and in typical volunteers, B-0 correction appears unnecessary for TQF
   analysis in most of the brain. In many cases where regions with known
   susceptibility issues are not of concern, a doubling of scan time may be
   better spent to either improve SNR or spatial resolution in the TQF
   sodium images. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, stepped beam resonators have found broad application in
   MEMS/NEMS devices. A beam resonator with an undercut at the support,
   produced due to isotropic etching of the supporting substrate during
   fabrication, has also been characterized as stepped beam in the
   literature. The present study deals with thermoelastic dissipations of
   clamped-clamped stepped beam resonators under adiabatic surface thermal
   conditions having j (j = 1, 2, aEuro broken vertical bar., n) number of
   sections defined by (j - 1) number of steps along the length. Numerical
   results are obtained for three different types of stepped beams of
   rectangular cross-section having single step such as beams with
   cross-sectional change at the step only in lateral direction (type-1),
   in bending direction (type-2), and in both lateral and bending
   directions (type-3) where the section on the right of the step possesses
   smaller cross-sectional size compared to the other. The obtained results
   show that Q-factors vary significantly with step positions in all the
   three types of stepped beams. For constant length, the Q-factor
   increases in the type-1 while it decreases in other two types of stepped
   beams as the step position moves from the left support to the right
   along the length. Moreover, Q-factors in a type-1 stepped beam depend on
   the widths of different sections and can be higher than a uniform beam
   of same thickness for some particular step positions. For most common
   lengths of stepped beams in real applications with the step close to the
   left support, type-1 stepped beams provide higher quality factors than
   the other stepped beams provided that they have the same cross-sectional
   area.}},

Abstract = {{Proton-decoupled, 13C nuclear MRS experiments require a RF coil that
   operates at the Larmor frequencies of both 13C and 1H. In this work, we
   designed, built and tested a single-unit, dual-tuned coil based on a
   half-birdcage open coil design. It was constructed as a low-pass network
   with a resonant trap in series with each leg. Traps are tuned in
   alternate legs such that the two resonant modes arise from currents on
   alternate legs. The coil performance was compared with that of a
   dual-tuned coil consisting of two proton surface coils operating in
   quadrature and a single surface coil for 13C transmission and reception.
   The half-birdcage coil was shown to produce a more homogeneous RF field
   at each frequency and was more sensitive to a 13C signal arising from
   regions further from the coil surface. The applicability of the coil in
   vivo was demonstrated by acquiring a proton decoupled, natural abundance
   13C glycogen signal from the calf of a normal volunteer. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{The review provides a comprehensive account on the development of gene
   delivery vectors via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer
   polymerization (RAFT) approach. Since the development and use of the
   first non-viral vector for gene delivery applications, a wide range of
   polymers were synthesized and studied for their gene delivery
   efficacies. With the advent of living radical polymerization (LRP),
   well-defined polymers with varying molecular weights, compositions and
   architectures were synthesized to evaluate their potency as gene
   delivery vectors. Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and RAFT
   are two widely used LRP approaches for gene delivery applications. This
   review focuses primarily on the synthesis and use of cationic polymers
   via RAFT for DNA and siRNA delivery in vitro and in vivo. RAFT
   polymerization has allowed the facile synthesis of tailor-made cationic
   polymers with pendent biocompatible moieties which are promising
   non-viral gene delivery vectors. Advanced structure-activity
   relationship studies between the polymers and gene expression have been
   possible due to the remarkable control in the design of these polymers
   via the RAFT process. As a result, biocompatible and non-toxic polymers
   are produced under aqueous conditions and are identified as potent gene
   delivery vectors in vitro and in vivo. Polymeric functionalized
   nanomaterials were produced and studied for gene delivery applications.
   The consistency of results obtained from different research groups and
   identification of improved gene expression efficacies of RAFT based gene
   delivery vectors indicate the scope of this polymerization approach for
   future studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the relationship between iron staining and
   magnetic resonance (MR) imaging measurements in postmortem subjects with
   multiple sclerosis (MS).
   Materials and Methods: Institutional ethical approval was obtained, and
   informed consent was obtained from the subjects and/or their families.
   Four MR imaging methods based on transverse relaxation (T2 weighting, R2
   mapping, and R2{*} mapping) and phase imaging were performed by using a
   4.7-T system in three in situ postmortem patients with MS less than 28
   hours after death and in one in vivo patient 1 year before death. Iron
   staining with the Perls iron reaction was performed after brain
   extraction. Region-of-interest measurements from six subcortical gray
   matter structures were obtained from MR imaging and then correlated with
   corresponding locations on photographs of iron-stained pathologic slices
   by using a separate linear least-squares regression in each subject.
   Iron status of white matter lesions, as determined by staining, was
   compared with appearance on MR images.
   Results: R2{*} mapping had the highest intrasubject correlations with
   iron in subcortical gray matter (R-2 = 0.857, 0.628, and 0.685; all P <
   .001), while R2 mapping (R-2 = 0.807, 0.615, 0.628, and 0.489; P < .001
   and P = .001, .034, and .001, respectively), phase imaging (R-2 = 0.672,
   0.441, 0.596, 0.548; all P < .001), and T2-weighted imaging (R-2 =
   0.463, 0.582, 0.650, and 0.551; all P < .001) had lower but still strong
   correlations. Within lesions, hypointense areas on phase images did not
   always represent iron. A hyperintense rim surrounding lesions on R2{*}
   maps was only present with iron staining, yet not all iron-staining
   lesions had R2{*} rim hyperintensity.
   Conclusion: All four MR imaging methods had significant linear
   correlations with iron and could potentially be used to determine iron
   status of subcortical gray matter structures in MS, with R2{*} mapping
   being preferred. A reliable method of determining iron status within MS
   lesions was not established. (C) RSNA, 2013}},
