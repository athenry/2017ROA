Title = {{Mercury Isotopes as Proxies to Identify Sources and Environmental
   Impacts of Mercury in Sphalerites}},

Abstract = {{During the past few years, evidence of mass independent fractionation
   (MIF) for mercury (Hg) isotopes have been reported in the Earth's
   surface reservoirs, mainly assumed to be formed during photochemical
   processes. However, the magnitude of Hg-MIF in interior pools of the
   crust is largely unknown. Here, we reported significant variation in
   Hg-MIF signature (Delta Hg-199: -0.24 similar to + 0.18 parts per
   thousand) in sphalerites collected from 102 zinc (Zn) deposits in China,
   indicating that Hg-MIF can be recorded into the Earth's crust during
   geological recycling of crustal material. Changing magnitudes of Hg-MIF
   signals were observed in Zn deposits with different formations, evidence
   that Hg isotopes (especially Hg-MIF) can be a useful tracer to identify
   sources (syngenetic and epigenetic) of Hg in mineral deposits. The
   average isotopic composition in studied sphalerites (delta
   Hg-202(average): -0.58 parts per thousand;Delta Hg-199(average): +0.03
   parts per thousand) may be used to fingerprint Zn smelting activities,
   one of the largest global Hg emission sources.}},

Abstract = {{The residual wall thicknesses (RWT) of the skin and the inner layers are
   important quality indicators of water-assisted co-injection molding
   (WACIM) parts. The influences of the shape of the cavity cross section
   and the processing parameters, including the water pressure, water delay
   time, inner melt temperature, and inner melt flow rate, on the
   penetration of the inner melt and water were explored via experiments.
   The results showed that the shape of the penetration section of the
   inner melt was closer to the cavity section with round corners, while
   that of the water ended up being round. Both the penetration ratios of
   the inner melt and the water increased proportionally with increasing
   circle ratio. Both the minimum values of the total RWT and the inner
   melt RWT increased with increasing circle ratio. Both the maximum values
   of the total RWT and the inner melt RWT increased with increasing
   Max\_D, which is the maximum distance between the inscribed circle
   center and the wall. Both the penetration ratios of the inner melt and
   the water increased with increasing water pressure, decreased with
   increasing water delay time, and increased with increasing inner melt
   flow rate and increasing inner melt temperature. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{An analysis of dijet events in PbPb and pp collisions is performed to
   explore the properties of energy loss by partons traveling in a
   quark-gluon plasma. Data are collected at a nucleon-nucleon
   center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV at the LHC. The distribution of
   transverse momentum (p(T)) surrounding dijet systems is measured by
   selecting charged particles in different ranges of p(T) and at different
   angular cones of pseudorapidity and azimuth. The measurement is
   performed as a function of centrality of the PbPb collisions, the p(T)
   asymmetry of the jets in the dijet pair, and the distance parameter R
   used in the anti-k(T) jet clustering algorithm. In events with
   unbalanced dijets, PbPb collisions show an enhanced multiplicity in the
   hemisphere of the subleading jet, with the p(T) imbalance compensated by
   an excess of low-p(T) particles at large angles from the jet axes.}},

   cavity. Single mode lasing was achieved for a large area laser, with a
   side-mode suppression ratio of 28 dB, for lasing operation temperature
   -200 K. Two types of lasers were demonstrated operating at different
   temperatures. Detailed modal analysis reveals the lasing mode matches
   with the estimated lasing gain threshold conditions. Our demonstration
   promises a hybrid laser sources on Si towards three-dimensional (3D)

   production scheduling models}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{516-535}},
Month = {{JAN 4}},
Abstract = {{We propose a series of preprocessing algorithms for the generation of
   strong valid inequalities for time-indexed, discrete and continuous,
   mixed-integer programming scheduling models for problems in network
   production environments. Specifically, starting from time- and
   inventory-related instance data, the proposed algorithms use constraint
   propagation techniques to calculate parameters that are used to bound
   the number of times subsets of tasks can be executed in a feasible
   solution. We also extend some of the propagation ideas to generate three
   classes of new tightening constraints. The proposed methods result in
   tightening constraints expressed in terms of assignment binary variables
   (X-ijt = 1 if task i is assigned to start on unit j at time point t)
   which are present in all time-indexed MIP models, therefore they are
   applicable to all time-indexed models accounting for a wide range of
   processing features. Finally, the methods are shown to lead to up to two
   orders of magnitude reduction in computational time when optimal
   solutions are found and significantly improve optimality gap when a time
   limit is enforced. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A vehicle type-dependent visual imaging model for analysing the

Journal = {{TRANSPORTMETRICA B-TRANSPORT DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{68-85}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{Heterogeneity is an essential characteristic in car-following
   behaviours, which can be defined as the differences between the
   car-following behaviours of driver/vehicle combination under comparable
   conditions. This paper proposes a visual imaging model (VIM) with
   relaxed assumption on (1) a driver's perfect perception for the states
   of the neighbouring vehicles (e.g. spacing, velocity, etc.) and (2)
   uniform reaction to vehicles with different sizes in most existing
   car-following models. VIM utilises the visual imaging information
   subtended by the preceding vehicle as the stimuli drivers react to, and
   can generate greater stimuli from the preceding vehicle with larger
   apparent size (i.e. vehicle width x vehicle height) under short gap
   distance with the follower, but less change in stimuli from the distant
   leading vehicle under various apparent sizes. The NGSIM data containing
   vehicle type/size information is used to evaluate VIM at different
   levels. At the level of single trajectory pair, the calibrated VIM
   occupies the well capability of reproducing the trajectory of the
   follower, and can also reproduce statistical results from the field
   data, that is, the gap distance for car-following truck (C-T) is greater
   than that for car-following car (C-C). At the level of vehicle type, the
   calibration results also show the promising performance of VIM in
   describing heterogeneous car-following behaviours with the simple model
   formulation and limited model parameters compared with other six
   reference models.}},

Abstract = {{Background Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is modulated by sex
   steroid hormones and affects vascular function and mood. In the Kronos
   Early Estrogen Prevention Cognitive and Affective Ancillary Study
   (KEEPS-Cog), women randomized to oral conjugated equine estrogens (oCEE)
   showed greater benefit on affective mood states than women randomized to
   transdermal 17-estradiol (tE2) or placebo (PL). This study examined the
   effect of these treatments on the platelet content of 5-HT as a
   surrogate measure of 5-HT synthesis and uptake in the brain.Methods The
   following were measured in a subset (n=79) of women enrolled in
   KEEPS-Cog: 5-HT by ELISA, carotid intima-medial thickness (CIMT) by
   ultrasound, endothelial function by reactive hyperemic index (RHI), and
   self-reported symptoms of affective mood states by the Profile of Mood
   States (POMS) questionnaire.Results Mean platelet content of 5-HT
   increased by 107.0\%, 84.5\% and 39.8\%, in tE2, oCEE and PL groups,
   respectively. Platelet 5-HT positively correlated with estrone in the
   oCEE group and with 17- estradiol in the tE2 group. Platelet 5-HT showed
   a positive association with RHI, but not CIMT, in the PL and oCEE
   groups. Reduction in mood scores for depression-dejection and
   anger-hostility was associated with elevations in platelet 5-HT only in
   the oCEE group (r=-0.5, p=0.02).Conclusions Effects of oCEE compared to
   tE2 on RHI and mood may be related to mechanisms involving platelet, and
   perhaps neuronal, uptake and release of 5-HT and reflect conversion of
   estrone to bioavailable 17-estradiol in platelets and the brain.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes an experimental facility designed and constructed
   to measure heat transfer coefficients and frictional pressure drop in a
   small-diameter horizontal test section with two-phase multi-component
   zeotropic mixtures at cryogenic temperatures. The aim of this facility
   is to enable the collection of high-accuracy data to overcome the
   scarcity of heat transfer and pressure drop data for zeoptropic mixtures
   undergoing a phase change (boiling). These data can then be used to
   support model development efforts to characterize the pressure drop and
   heat transfer process in horizontal tubes. The test facility is intended
   to provide measurements for a range of test conditions, including
   varying mixture components, mixture compositions, heat fluxes, mass
   fluxes, evaporating pressures, and tube diameters. The temperature range
   associated with the mixture measurements varies from near 150K to room
   temperature. The heat transfer coefficient measurements have been shown
   to be repeatable and accurate with an uncertainty of less than 10\%. The
   pressure drop measurements have been calibrated, and the facility is
   capable of measuring the frictional pressure drop under both adiabatic
   and diabatic conditions with an uncertainty of less than 20\%.}},

Journal = {{MRS ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructures offer the opportunity to control the vibrational
   properties of via the scattering of phonons due to boundaries and mass
   disorder as well as through changes in the phonon dispersion due to
   spatial confinement. Advances in understanding these effects have the
   potential to lead to thermoelectrics with an improved figure of merit by
   lowering the thermal conductivity and to provide insight into
   electron-phonon scattering rates in nanoelectronics. Characterizing the
   phonon population in nanomaterials has been challenging because of their
   small volume and because optical techniques probe only a small fraction
   of reciprocal space. Recent developments in x-ray scattering now allow
   the phonon population to be evaluated across all of reciprocal space in
   samples with volumes as small as several cubic micrometers. We apply
   this approach, synchrotron x-ray thermal diffuse scattering (TDS), to
   probe the population of phonons within a Si/SiGe/Si trilayer
   nanomembrane. The distributions of scattered intensity from Si/SiGe/Si
   trilayer nanomembranes and Si nanomembranes with uniform composition are
   qualitatively similar, with features arising from the elastic anisotropy
   of the diamond structure. The TDS signal for the Si/SiGe/Si
   nanomembrane, however, has higher intensity than the Si membrane of the
   same total thickness by approximately 3.75\%. Possible origins of the
   enhancement in scattering from SiGe in comparison with Si include the
   larger atomic scattering factor of Ge atoms within the SiGe layer or
   reduced phonon frequencies due to alloying.}},

   parallelizing the Monte Carlo Synthetic Acceleration method. Monte Carlo
   Synthetic Acceleration methods use the Neumann-Ulam class of Monte Carlo
   solvers for linear systems to accelerate a fixed-point iteration
   sequence. Effective parallel algorithms for these methods require the
   parallelization of the underlying Neumann-Ulam solvers. To do this in a
   domain decomposed environment, we borrow strategies traditionally
   implemented in Monte Carlo particle transport to parallelize the
   problem. The parallel Neumann-Ulam and multiple-set overlapping-domain
   decomposition algorithms are presented along with parallel scaling data
   for the resulting implementation using the Titan Cray XK7 machine at Oak

Abstract = {{In his letter of June 3, 1883, Vincent Van Gogh wrote ``drawing is at
   the root of everything.{''} Though much less well known than his
   paintings, Vincent used a large number of different kinds of strokes,
   hatchings, and dots to convey his unique vision in pen and ink. This
   paper presents a first attempt to automatically catalog the various
   kinds of pen strokes used throughout Vincent's career. The output of the
   process may be pictured in two ways: one which segments the sketch into
   regions dominated by a single style of stroke, and one which identifies
   and separates every occurrence of every stroke throughout the drawing.
   The ability to carry out such classifications will be of use to scholars
   of Van Gogh, to students learning the art of drawing, and may be useful
   in the automated translation from photograph to computer-drawing.
   Successful classification of pen and ink strokes may point towards ways
   of approaching the more difficult problem of identifying brush strokes
   in paintings. High resolution images used for this analysis are
   available at the website of the Van Gogh museum.}},

   printing in the twentieth century. To aid in the study and
   classification of fine art prints on wove paper, the present work
   compares the results of five different image processing approaches for
   characterizing surface texture. Using a collection of popular wove
   papers, a reference dataset of raking light close-up images was
   assembled. Five research teams undertook their own processing strategies
   to detect affinities among the paper samples. Their success in
   identifying similarity groupings are reported.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of clustering uncertain objects whose
   locations are uncertain and described by probability density functions
   (pdf). Though K-means has been extended to UK-means for handling
   uncertain data, most existing works only focus on improving the
   efficiency of UK-means. However, the clustering quality of UK-means is
   rarely considered in existing works. The weights of objects are assumed
   same in existing works. However, the weights of objects which are far
   from their cluster representatives should not be the same as the weights
   of objects which are close to their cluster representatives. Thus, we
   propose an AdaUK-means to group the uncertain objects by considering the
   weights of objects in this article. In AdaUK-means, the weights of
   objects will be adjusted based on the correlation between objects by
   using Adaboost. If the object pairs are must-link but grouped into
   different clusters, the weights of the objects will be increased. In our
   ensemble model, AdaUK-means is run several times, then the objects are
   assigned by a voting process. Finally, we demonstrate that AdaUK-means
   performs better than UK-means on both synthetic and real data sets by
   extensive experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison)
   and Madison Area Technical College (Madison College) partnered to create
   an internship pathway for graduate students pursuing careers as future
   science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) faculty members. Since
   2003, 10 doctoral students from the university completed teaching
   internship appointments with the technical college chemistry department.
   Interns benefited from a variety of teaching and educational experiences
   that helped lay the foundations for their future teaching careers.
   Following completion of their internships, many students secured
   employment in higher education as new instructors and enthusiastic
   members of the teaching profession. Intern projects also benefited
   veteran faculty mentors at Madison College, and the experience provided
   a rich forum for collaboration that generated curricular and
   instructional innovations in the classroom. Centered on the three
   pillars of teaching-as-research, learning community, and learning
   through diversity, the internship program created at UW-Madison and
   implemented at Madison College provides a model pathway for preparing
   future STEM faculty. This approach provides clear benefits not only for
   the future faculty who are trained, but also for veteran faculty
   mentors, for the host institution, and for the undergraduate students
   impacted by the educational innovations. This paper examines the key
   attributes of this program, with the hope that our experience may be
   disseminated and replicated to benefit others.}},

Abstract = {{Many residential homeowners are investing in distributed energy
   generation, energy storage, and load management technologies. Due to the
   highly variable nature of residential energy consumption, homeowners
   tend to oversize their generation and storage capabilities in order to
   meet their demand. We find the energy needs of many households are more
   efficiently met when neighboring homeowners pool their energy resources
   into an aggregate microgrid instead of relying solely on individually
   owned resources. We quantify the energy needs of individual residences
   and the aggregate microgrid by measuring net load variability. Using
   modified coincident factors, a conventional measure of variability in
   the electric utility industry, we calculate that the overall load
   variability for four southern Wisconsin households is reduced due to net
   load aggregation.}},

Abstract = {{Rapidly falling costs of photovoltaic generation and electrical energy
   storage devices are prompting the proliferation of self-contained
   electricity systems in homes and buildings, that can be called homegrid,
   and several of these homegrids form a microgrid. The homegrid consists
   of local generation, storage and utilization devices, which may or may
   not interconnect to a central utility system. A critical challenge in
   operating a homegrid is the energy management of the electrical power
   system to ensure electricity availability and system stability while
   meeting customer needs. This paper proposes a wireless communication
   framework for energy management in homegrids using a Homegrid Sensor
   Network (HSN) which consists of the HEM (Homegrid Energy Manager) and
   Homegrid Nodes (HN) which are connected to the required loads/sources.
   HSN has been realized using an IEEE 802.15.4 based Wireless Sensor
   Network (WSN) with mesh capabilities for control and management of the
   electrical power system. The paper presents a design framework along
   with evaluation results using an IEEE 802.15.4 based commercial off the
   shelf radio chipset and a vendor-supplied cross-layer mesh networking
   protocol. The paper presents results from link quality estimation using
   hardware and software-based approaches.}},

   of homegrids form the community-level microgrid, and are managed by MEM,
   which is based in the cloud. MEM adopts a plug-and-play model, working
   with existing storage systems, inverters, energy sources, and loads. A
   multi-layer approach provides real-time control and intelligent
   management of energy sources and loads, using embedded sensing and

Abstract = {{In this study new metrics were developed for assessing the performance
   of surgical knots. By adding sensors to a knot tying simulator we were
   able to measure the forces used while performing this basic and
   essential skill. Data were collected for both superficial tying and deep
   tying of square knots using the one hand and two hands techniques.
   Participants used significantly more force when tying a deep knot
   compared to a superficial knot (3.79N and 1.6N respectively). Different
   patterns for upward and downward forces were identified and showed that
   although most of the time upward forces are used (72\% of the time), the
   downward forces are just as large. These data can be crucial for
   improving the safeness of knot tying. Combing these metrics with known
   metrics based on knot tensiometry and motion data may help provide
   feedback and objective assessment of knot tying skills.}},

Abstract = {{Insuring correct needle location is crucial in many medical procedures.
   This can be even more challenging for physicians injecting in a new
   location for the first time. Since they do not necessarily know how the
   tissue is supposed to feel, finding the correct location and correct
   depth can be difficult. In this study we designed a simulator for
   training needle injection. The simulator was fabricated to give a
   realistic feeling of injecting Botox (R) in the temporalis and the
   semispinalis muscles as part of migraine treatment. In addition the
   simulator provided real-time feedback of correct needle location. Nine
   residents and medical students evaluated the simulator. They made
   several errors that were corrected real time using the real time
   feedback provided. They found the simulator to be very useful and that
   the training significantly improved their confidence. The methods
   described in this study can easily be implemented for developing needle
   injection simulators for other anatomical locations.}},

Abstract = {{Millimeter-wave (mmW) wireless is as a promising technology for meeting
   the Gigabit rate and low latency requirements of emerging fixed and
   mobile 5G applications. This is enabled by the large (GHz) bandwidths
   and high-gain beamforming due to high-dimensional antenna arrays
   possible at mmW frequencies. Initial propagation measurements underscore
   the highly directional nature of mmW communication, dominated by
   line-of-sight and single-bounce multipath, making beamforming a critical
   operational functionality. However, existing channel measurements are
   limited to mechanically pointed horn antennas and single-beam phased
   arrays of moderate sizes. On the other hand, multi-beam operation is
   necessary for spatial multiplexing. In this paper, we introduce a new
   measurement methodology and initial results based on beamspace MIMO
   channel modeling and communication. The measurement results are based on
   a novel beamspace MIMO prototype system that uses a lens array for
   analog beamforming and enables, for the first time, simultaneous
   multi-beam channel measurements with a beamwidth of about 4 degrees
   equivalent to that of a two-dimensional array with 636 critically spaced
   elements. Initial indoor channel measurements follow Friis formula for
   pathloss, and illustrate the new beamspace channel measurement and
   modeling methodology.}},

   produced by the circular permanent magnets on the rotor disk. The finite
   element analysis is performed to quantify the change in flux linkage,
   back-EMF, and output power as a function of field current. This research
   contributes to the field weakening or intensifying feature of the axial

   ideal for high speeds since they have a simple and robust rotor
   structure. They also utilize permanent magnet (PM) in the stator
   enabling them to achieve high power density. It is desirable to keep the
   operating frequency minimized to reduce core losses and cost of power
   electronics. A 6-stator slot, 4-rotor pole (6/4) FSPM machine has the
   lowest operating frequency for a three phase FSPM configuration but
   suffers from heavy harmonic distortion in flux linkage. This paper aims
   to identify structural modifications that can minimize the dominant 2nd
   order harmonic component to make the 6/4 configuration amiable for
   high-speed applications. The analysis and methods proposed in this paper
   will be useful in tackling harmonic content of FSPM machines in general.}},

Abstract = {{Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converters are emerging to become the preferred
   high power DC-DC conversion topology to satisfy the requirements of
   modularity, high voltage transfer ratio, high efficiency and
   bidirectional power transfer capability. However transformer design for
   DAB converters remains a challenging problem, especially for high
   voltage conversion ratio and higher switching frequencies.
   Capacitor-coupled transformer-less DC-DC converters capable of arbitrary
   high voltage transfer ratio with reasonable efficiency have been
   recently introduced. The voltage gain in this case is achieved by series
   combination of capacitor coupled active bridge modules. This paper
   introduces the capacitor-coupled dual active bridge converter and
   compares it with the traditional transformer-coupled dual active bridge
   converter. A brief overview of the analytical models of both
   transformer-coupled and capacitor-coupled DAB converters is presented
   and the important design factors of both topologies are identified,
   followed by a comparative evaluation of a published benchmark design
   with details of all the power circuit components.}},

Abstract = {{Wound field synchronous generators (WFSG) are the standard for back-up
   and utility scale power generation. Rotor field current and prime mover
   speed are the only control parameters required to regulate power
   conversion in a generator application. Maintenance costs may be
   minimized by adopting non-contact or `` brushless{''} technologies to
   replace sliding slip ring connections. This paper presents a brushless
   excitation approach using ceramic insulated sleeve (journal) bearings
   with oil lubrication to form capacitively coupled slip rings, in
   contrast to more traditional inductive brushless exciters and rotary
   transformers. This capacitive power transfer (CPT) approach exhibits
   advantages including low weight, low volume and has a relatively simple
   construction using off-the-self components. Analysis, design and
   prototype construction of the CPT system are presented. Experimental
   results demonstrate that similar to 1.7nF of capacitive coupling
   transfers 340W to the rotor field winding of a 10kW 208V WFSG. Voltage
   regulation of a WFSG is demonstrated during steady state and 1 per unit
   load step changes yielding a NEMA-MG1 class G2 rating.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an alternative spoke type interior permanent magnet
   machine (STIPMM) design to minimize the pulsating torque and decrease
   the use of permanent magnet materials. The proposed rotor design
   consists of a number of rotor lamination stacks with notches made on the
   surface and packed in the axial direction. Within each stack, the width
   of the permanent magnets (PMs) and the span of the notches are different
   from those in the other lamination stacks. By varying the magnet width
   and the span of the notches in each lamination stack, the pulsating
   torque of the machine can be minimized while reducing the amount of PM
   materials used. A differential evolution (DE) algorithm was used to
   solve this minimization problem by evaluating a large number of design
   candidates. Finite element analysis was employed when calculating the
   cost function of the optimization. The rated performance of the optimum
   design is benchmarked against a base-line STIPMM in which the rotor was
   modified based on the 2007 Camry motor model. The results show
   improvement in the pulsating torque and the PM material utilization of
   the proposed model.}},

   carried out to identify how the optimal design rules and proportions of
   IPM motors with sintered NdFeB magnets vary with respect to the changes
   in the commodity prices of permanent magnet material, copper, and steel.
   The sensitivities of the correlations between the design parameters and
   the AMC with respect to the commodity price ranges are investigated
   based on response surface methodology (RSM) and large-scale design
   optimization practice using differential evolution (DE) optimizer. An
   innovative application of artificial neural network (ANN)-based design
   optimization is introduced. Multi-objective minimization of cost and
   losses is pursued for an overall of 200,000 design candidates in 30
   different optimization instances subjected to different cost scenarios
   according to a systematic design of experiments (DOE) procedure. An
   interesting finding is that, despite common expectations, the average

Abstract = {{Recently, fluid filled electrostatic machines have demonstrated specific
   and volumetric torque density that hold promise to be competitive with
   electromagnetic machines in niche applications. These demonstrations of
   variable elastance (dual of reluctance) machines were non-optimized from
   an electrostatics perspective as their geometry was heavily constrained
   due to manufacturability. Higher performance electromechanical power
   conversion for electrostatics requires optimal geometric design. This
   paper proposes a semi-analytical method incorporating conformal mapping
   techniques with finite element (FE) analysis to optimize a variable
   elastance electrostatic machine in a low speed direct drive
   applications. As a proof of concept, an optimized geometry was built
   using additive manufacturing, specifically stereolithographic 3D
   printing, to circumvent geometry constraints. By building the machine
   from plastic plated with conductor, it is lightweight with improved
   torque density. This manufacturing approach suggests that a machine can
   be injected molded or cast in a single step. Experimental results
   support both the design and manufacturing approaches and the resulting
   machine is benchmarked against previous work.}},

Abstract = {{Three phase ac drives using a dc link typically feature a significant
   amount of dc energy storage to maintain a stiff dc bus. This paper
   examines the concept of reducing the size of the dc link capacitor
   dramatically, to store just enough energy to provide one high frequency
   switching cycle of output power. The dc bus is no longer stiff and hence
   the classical sinusoidal pulse width modulation cannot be used. But, the
   stored energy modulation (SEM) concept that is used here synthesizes
   high quality sinusoidal waveforms even with such tiny dc link
   capacitors. In SEM, the switching intervals of the interconnecting
   switches are carefully determined non-linear functions of various
   operating parameters such as reactive component sizing, switching
   frequency, load levels, etc. The detailed operation of the SEM modulated
   converter for a field-oriented controlled (FOC) four-quadrant permanent
   magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) electric drive application using space
   vector modulation (SVM) has been presented in the paper. The paper also
   includes circuit simulation results and preliminary design
   considerations of a SEM modulated drive.}},

Abstract = {{A droop-controlled, hybrid ac/dc microgrid represents a robust
   architecture that can coordinate the operation of multiple distributed
   sources while minimizing the power conversion stages. While the
   reduced-order nonlinear dynamics of grid-forming, droop-controlled
   inverter-based microgrids have been rigorously shown to be stable for a
   wide range of operating parameters, the problem of analyzing the
   transient stability characteristics of droop-controlled hybrid ac/dc
   architectures has not been adequately addressed. This work reviews the
   link between the Virtual Synchronous Machine control concept and
   grid-forming droop control, and introduces a new droop control strategy
   for ac/dc hybrid microgrids, termed `symmetric droop control' (SDC). SDC
   better addresses the dynamic interactions between the ac and dc
   sub-grids of the hybrid microgrid, by ensuring that the interfacing
   inverter appropriately represents the dc sub-grid dynamics when
   interacting with other inverters. SDC can help to ensure that the
   reduced-order, nonlinear dynamics in both the ac and dc networks remain
   predictable and well-behaved during large disturbances in the ac
   network.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new perspective on cell balancing (equalization)
   in a lithium-ion battery pack by proposing the thermal balancing concept
   of battery cells. Thermal balancing can be achieved by relative
   temperature control based on either conventional active cell balancing
   circuits or module-integrated systems. Compared to
   voltage/state-of-charge (SoC) balancing, relative temperature can be
   used as the balancing target with several advantages. First, absolute
   temperature directly affects the lifetime and usable capacity of battery
   cell. Second, the relative temperature between cells degrades the
   uniformity of the cells and increase the imbalance in various
   parameters. Third, temperature usually has a slow dynamic which makes it
   an ideal control target for low balancing power compared to the high
   charging/discharging power. Last, thermal balancing control can take
   over the job of the thermal management system to a certain degree.
   Therefore the balancing function could be potentially built into the
   thermal management system. In this paper, two algorithms are developed
   to achieve thermal balancing: direct relative temperature control and
   virtual heat sink temperature control. A simple battery system thermal
   model is developed and the proposed control algorithms are validated.}},

   regulation of the electromagnetic torque and the stator flux linkage by
   using a control law based on an inverse discrete time physical model.
   During fault conditions, the PMSM drive requires very limited hardware
   and software reconfigurations. The drive model equations result very
   similarly to those adopted for the healthy electric drive just by using
   a different matrix transformation set when the drive operates under a
   faulty condition. The proposed fault tolerant DB-DTFC ensures
   satisfactory faulty operations and drive stability, without increasing

   gusts exceed the nominal maximum value of thrust. This paper suggests
   that improved operation is possible if the generator is confined to
   always operate in the super-synchronous state resulting in improved

   compatibility with existing RF and SC topologies and improves the
   performance of RF converters through partitioning of energy conversion
   stage and output regulation stage. Emerging new wide bandgap devices
   like GaN FETs enable a higher power density DC/DC converter design. A
   wider input range, larger voltage conversion ratio, smaller size, and
   excellent transient performance are expected. The prototype of the
   proposed GaN reconfigurable SC-based partial power RF converter
   comprises of a 20 MHz resonant single-ended-primary-inductor-converter
   (SEPIC) as a regulated stage and a high-efficiency 2 MHz reconfigurable
   SC as an unregulated stage. The GaN RF resonant SEPIC regulates the
   output using a robust ON/OFF control scheme, which enables fast
   transient responses. The high-efficiency GaN reconfigurable SC provides
   1: 1, 2: 1 and 3: 1 voltage conversion ratio which widens the input
   voltage range. The power stage of the prototype achieves a peak
   efficiency of 93 \% and a power density of 963 W/in(3) at 91.5 W.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates how the aging of lithiumion batteries is
   influenced by several less well-known properties of different vehicle
   drive profiles. It is demonstrated that the RMS current value is a
   statistically significant aging factor for the case of dynamic drive
   profiles, extending the results of previous work that focused on
   steady-state discharge current waveforms. In addition, a quantitative
   analysis procedure is developed to facilitate the separation of aging
   factors and to analyze their individual and mutual effects. Strong
   statistical evidence is presented to support the importance of the
   interaction between the RMS current value and the battery discharge
   temperature on aging characteristics. The impact of these outcomes on
   designing battery systems that include provisions for reducing the AC
   content of the battery current as a function of the battery operating
   temperature are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{As the technology on wide bandgap materials such as gallium-nitride
   (GaN) has advanced rapidly, commercial GaN power devices with satisfying
   performance are available now. It is widely-known that GaN-based
   switching devices have several advantages over traditional Si-based
   switching devices, such as lower ON-resistance, faster switching speed,
   better thermal conductivity, and smaller size. However, researchers have
   not yet fully explored and applied GaN devices in some of the important
   power conversion applications. In this paper, a popular three-phase
   three-level three-switch Vienna rectifier is designed with GaN FETs. The
   advantages and challenges of utilizing GaN FETs in Vienna rectifiers are
   discussed. The topology, control and simulation are carried out as well.
   To provide a comparative analysis of the GaN FET and Si MOSFET based
   Vienna rectifiers, two prototypes are built with each type of the power
   devices on a similar scale. Detailed comparative analysis discussions
   based on the experimental results, including size, power circuit
   efficiency and THD, are provided. It is concluded in this paper that GaN
   FETs and their drivers have smaller size and higher power density
   compared with Si MOSFETs and their drivers. The overall performance of
   the GaN FET and Si MOSFET based Vienna rectifiers are at the same level,
   although driving techniques of the GaN FET devices are not mature.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid proliferation of data hungry devices is creating a bandwidth
   crisis, with aggregate data rates expected to increase 1000 fold between
   2010 and 2020. Millimeter-wave (mmW) systems operating in the 30-300 GHz
   band are poised to meet this exploding demand through large bandwidths
   and high-dimensional MIMO operation. However conventional MIMO
   techniques result in prohibitively high complexity, and existing phased
   array based mmW prototypes are only capable of supporting a single beam.
   In this paper, we report new results on a Continuous Aperture Phased
   (CAP) MIMO prototype system that uses a lens array for analog
   multi-beamforming to achieve near-optimal performance with a
   dramatically lower transceiver complexity. We discuss the main

Abstract = {{Millimeter-wave (mmW) wireless is as a promising technology for meeting
   the Gigabit rate and millisecond latency requirements of emerging 5G
   applications. This promise fundamentally rests on the large (GHz)
   bandwidths and high-gain/ high-dimensional beamforming possible at mmW
   frequencies. While multi-beam operation is necessary for achieving
   spatial multiplexing, existing channel measurements are limited to
   mechanically pointed horn antennas and single-beam phased arrays of
   moderate sizes. In this paper, we report a new measurement methodology
   and initial results based on the concept of beamspace MIMO channel
   modeling and communication. The measurement results use a novel
   multi-beam MIMO prototype system at 28GHz that uses a lens array for
   analog beamforming with a beamwidth of about four degrees. Furthermore,
   it is the first mmW MIMO prototype that enables simultaneous multi-beam
   channel measurements (and communication). The unique measurement
   capabilities of the multi-beam MIMO prototype are discussed and the new

Abstract = {{This paper suggests a sparse feedback dynamic control scheme with
   unified power flow controller (UPFC) to prevent transmission system
   overload. An transient energy function (TEF) is developed to measure the
   security of the grid in dynamic. Firstly, a TEF are constructed based on
   AC dynamic model with transmission over-current tripping model. Then a
   power flows feedback control law is proposed to exploits the
   non-positive time derivative of the TEF with the accommodated
   admittance, to mitigate dynamic current violation. The accommodated
   admittance are obtained by TEF stability margin sensitivity analysis.
   With the proposed control method, the system can be driven to a stable
   state without current violation even if part of the UPFCs fails.
   Finally, the simulation results of 14 bus test case demonstrate the
   effectiveness, as well as the resilience of our proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the design and simulation of a long-wave
   infrared (LWIR) angle sensing detector operating at 10.6 mm. The
   proposed detector is composed of a two-element antenna array where the
   antennas are strongly coupled to each other. Each antenna is loaded with
   a resistive microbolometer detector to detect incoming IR radiation and
   absorb power from the antenna. The system is designed in a manner to
   ensure that the power absorbed in each microbolometer is a strong
   function of the angle of incidence of the wave. This way, the ratio of
   the power absorbed in each bolometer can be used as a means to detect
   the angle of incidence of the IR wave without needing to perform any
   coherent measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless links with implantable devices can help in real-time monitoring
   of symptoms, irregularities, implanted device efficacy and their
   reconfiguration. We present the design of a low-power wideband voltage
   controlled oscillator (VCO) to facilitate implantable wireless
   telemetry. A coupled SAW-LC resonator design combines high Q and
   spectral purity of a SAW element and tunability of an LC-tank. The
   designed 2.7 MHz bandwidth VCO is suitable for full duplex communication
   protocols in the MedRadio band with frequency agility and higher duty
   cycles, in conformance with FCC regulations. Output power at the
   fundamental frequency is above -7.5 dBm for a wide range of load
   impedances. Output power load insensitivity provides a wide margin for
   selection of communication system parameters, variability in device
   placement, temporal variation in tissue properties and flexibility for
   implants at different locations (e. g. heart, gastrointestinal tract,
   brain). The maximum output power variation in the entire 2.7 MHz band is
   limited to 1.3 dBm. Sensitivity of oscillation frequency to loading can
   be addressed by individual device calibration. The small size, component
   count and low DC power consumption (1.9 V, similar to 1.95 mW) is
   favorable for including in a miniaturized and integrated design assembly
   with a battery-powered implanted device.}},

Abstract = {{Quasi-Quadratic Residue Codes (QQR Codes) are a family of double
   circulant codes. They are important in at least two respects:
   Firstly, they have very good minimum distances when p  3 (mod 8),
   providing a critical test case for Goppa's Conjecture.
   Secondly, they serve as a powerful tool for studying point distributions
   on hyperelliptic curves. We will use the result of their weight
   distributions to prove a variant on a result of Larsen {[}1] on
   asymptotic normal distribution of numbers of points on hyperelliptic
   curves.
   In this paper, we will show new results on QQR Codes from several
   perspectives. We will observe (and prove when p  7 (mod 8)) that the
   weight polynomial of a QQR Code is at least divisible by (x(2) +
   y(2))(d-1), where d is its minimum distance.
   We also provide new results about their structures. When p  7 (mod 8),
   it is the even weight subcode of the direct sum of the quadratic residue
   code with itself. Its automorphism group contains the invertible affine
   transformations on F-p.
   We also answer a question of Joyner {[}2] asking whether they satisfy
   the Riemann hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is part of a new line of research involving the use of a
   model-free controller to trade stock. The main result is a discrete-time
   version of the so-called Robust Positive Expectation Theorem which
   includes delay in the controller. To date, no results in the literature
   are available for this delay case. Motivated by robustness
   considerations and consistent with existing work, neither modelling nor
   identification of the stock price dynamics is involved. The time-varying
   investment level is generated using a ``hard-wired{''} feedback
   controller which processes cumulative gains and losses. While this paper
   addresses discrete time, it is noted that the results also apply to
   high-frequency trading since the discretization interval At is allowed
   to be arbitrarily small.}},

Abstract = {{Kelly betting is a prescription for optimal resource allocation among a
   set of gambles which are typically repeated in an independent and
   identically distributed manner. In this setting, there is a large body
   of literature which includes arguments that the theory often leads to
   bets which are ``too aggressive{''} with respect to various risk
   metrics. To remedy this problem, many papers include prescriptions for
   scaling down the bet size. Such schemes are referred to as Fractional
   Kelly Betting. In this paper, we take the opposite tack. That is, we
   show that in many cases, the theoretical Kelly-based results may lead to
   bets which are ``too conservative{''} rather than too aggressive. To
   make this argument, we consider a random vector X with its assumed
   probability distribution and draw m samples to obtain an
   empirically-derived counterpart X. Subsequently, we derive and compare
   the resulting Kelly bets for both X and X with consideration of sample
   size m as part of the analysis. This leads to identification of many
   cases which have the following salient feature: The resulting bet size
   using the true theoretical distribution for X is much smaller than that
   for X. If instead the bet is based on empirical data, ``golden{''}
   opportunities are identified which are essentially rejected when the
   purely theoretical model is used. To formalize these ideas, we provide a
   result which we call the Restricted Betting Theorem. An extreme case of
   the theorem is obtained when X has unbounded support. In this situation,
   using X, the Kelly theory can lead to no betting at all.}},

   which invariably result in oscillations. The results of this paper
   utilize the implicit numerical integration schemes of non-smooth systems
   to the systems with resets via employing the method of Zhuravlev-Ivanov
   transformation. The contribution lies in attaining existence of
   discretization solutions in the presence of the Zeno mode of impacts. We
   illustrate the effectiveness of the method on regulation and tracking
   problems. The good results presented here will motivate the theoretical
   study of those control strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Two-player single-controller zero-sum stochastic games are a class of
   zero-sum dynamic games with Markovian state dynamics, where only one
   player controls the state transitions. Design of optimal strategies for
   such games with large state and action spaces relies on computationally
   demanding dynamic programming. Linear programming can also be used, but
   the number of constraints equals the number of states. This paper
   presents a class of simple suboptimal strategies that can be constructed
   by playing a certain repeated static game where neither player observes
   the specific mixed strategies used by the other player at each round. We
   quantify the suboptimality of the resulting strategies and show that,
   when the two players honestly follow the prescribed protocol, each
   player can exploit the regularity or predictability of the moves of the
   other player, and thus speed up convergence to the minimax value.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we proposed a decentralized cooperative lane-changing
   decision-making framework for connected autonomous vehicles, which is
   composed of three modules, i.e., state prediction, candidate decision
   generation, and coordination. In other words, each connected autonomous
   vehicle makes cooperative lane-changing decision independently. In the
   state prediction module, we employed existing cooperative car-following
   models to predict the vehicles' future state. In the candidate decision
   generation module, we proposed incentive based model to generate a
   candidate decision. In the candidate decision coordination module, we
   proposed an algorithm to avoid candidate lane-changing decision that may
   lead to a vehicle collision or traffic deterioration to be final
   decision. Moreover, the effects of decentralized cooperative
   lane-changing decision-making framework on traffic stability,
   efficiency, homogeneity, and safety are investigated in a numerical
   simulation experiment. Some stability, efficiency, homogeneity, and
   safety indicators are evaluated and show the high potential of our
   proposed framework in traffic dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{In the Internet of Things (IoT) architecture, middleware is the
   component that creates a bridge between the heterogeneous sensor nodes
   and the software applications. One aspect among many others that
   determine the efficiency, performance, and functionality of middleware
   is parallelizability. Parallelizability refers to how ready the software
   is to utilize multicore architecture. The problem in general has been
   studied recently. This paper presents a study that examines the
   middleware software systems that have been widely used in IoT and
   wireless sensor network (WSN) applications. The examination gives us an
   idea of how well the software takes advantage of the hardware's
   multicore technology. The study is conducted on the source code of three
   open source middleware systems containing 1.07 million lines of code and
   almost 5k files. Each system is analyzed and the inhibitors to
   parallelization are detected and presented. The most prevalent
   inhibitors are pointed out to show the developers of IoT middleware
   systems what they should focus on when refactoring and improving their
   products. A historical trend over the last five years concerning the
   presence of inhibitors in the source code is also presented. The study
   suggests some techniques for refactoring the source code to improve the
   parallelizability of the systems as well.}},

   statements in software systems developed in C/C++ and used for IoT is
   presented. The study is conducted on 3 open source systems comprising
   more than one million lines of code and containing almost 5K files.
   Static analysis methods are applied to each system to determine the
   number of unsafe commands known among research communities to cause
   potential risks and security concerns, thereby decreasing a system's
   robustness and quality (i.e., strcpy, strcmp, and strlen). Some of those
   statements are banned by some companies (e.g., Microsoft). These
   commands are not supposed to be used in new code and should be removed
   from legacy code over time as recommended by new C/C++ language
   standards. Additionally, each system is analyzed and the distribution of
   the known unsafe commands is presented. Historical trends in the usage
   of the unsafe commands are presented to show how the studied systems
   evolved over time with respect to the vulnerable code. The results show
   that the most prevalent unsafe command used across all systems is
   memcpy, followed by strlen.}},

   saturated porous materials consists of a closed-loop of liquid that
   passes through the specimen, tubing, a mercury-water reservoir, and a
   capillary tube. Use of a closed-loop forces inflow to equal outflow
   throughout the test, resulting in faster equilibration. The closed loop
   contains two liquids: water and mercury. A constant head drop is applied
   by displacing a column of mercury and flow rates are measured by
   monitoring the rate of displacement of a water-mercury interface in a
   horizontal capillary tube. Tests were conducted on a variety of media
   having very different stiffness and hydraulic conductivity using the
   CHCV device and a conventional open system. Nearly identical hydraulic
   conductivities were measured using both methods, but much less testing
   time was required with the CHCV device.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a flexible, three-axis, rapidly prototyped
   capacitive touch sensor that utilizes a patterned elastomeric dielectric
   layer. The sensor was fabricated from a copper clad kapton laminate and
   is capable of resolving normal pressure and tracking directional motion.
   In a mock clinical breast examination (CBE) setup, we used a breast
   model to demonstrate that the sensor, when placed under the model, could
   track a normal force of about 18N applied to the test area, as well as
   the trajectory of the force as it was moved around the breast model.
   This data, along with the accompanying variation in signal patterns, can
   be utilized to quantify the CBE conducted by an expert physician, which
   in turn can be a training tool for residents and other physicians.}},

Abstract = {{Mesh adaptation plays a critical role in balancing computational
   efficiency and numerical accuracy. Three types of mesh adaptation
   techniques exist today, namely, mesh improvement, mesh refinement and
   mesh simplification, and for each of these, several strategies have been
   proposed. Most of these strategies yield acceptable geometric mesh
   quality but provide limited control over topological quality.
   In this paper, we introduce a unified algorithm for all three types of
   mesh adaptation for quadrilateral meshes. The algorithm builds upon the
   Minimum Singularity Templates (MST) idea proposed by the authors for
   improving the topological quality of a quadrilateral mesh. The MST is
   extended here to define the concept of an alpha MST where a single
   parameter a controls mesh adaptation: alpha = 1 for mesh improvement,
   alpha > 1 for mesh refinement, and alpha < 1 for mesh simplification.
   The proposed algorithm generates mesh with high geometric and
   topological qualities. Further, it is non-hierarchical and stateless,
   and yet it provides an arbitrary level of mesh adaptation. Finally,
   since cyclic chords can play an important role in quadrilateral mesh
   adaptation, we provide a simple constructive algorithm to insert such
   chords using the aMST. Several examples are presented that demonstrate
   the robustness, efficiency, and versatility of the proposed concept and
   algorithm. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Positron emission tomography (PET) phantoms are used to calibrate PET
   scanners so that inter-scanner and inter-isotope comparison can be made
   between PET datasets. Hot rod style phantoms have a hole pattern, which
   is filled with a positron-emitting isotope and typically involves using
   two radioisotope reservoirs with the pattern created with channels in
   between. However, this configuration is difficult to fill and requires
   an excess of activity and volume. Here we present an alternative design,
   a phantom that is linearly filled-one channel at a time. The process of
   fabrication of prototypes of the design is described and PET images of
   the prototyped phantom are also shown for a variety of commonly used
   radioisotopes (Mn-52, Cu-64, Br-76, I-124). This design allows for a
   large reduction in isotope volume and required filling time making a
   quality assurance (QA) protocol safer, more efficient and less costly.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an economic model predictive control (econ MPC)
   strategy for a two-stage (primary and secondary refining) Mechanical
   Pulping (MP) process. The MP process is a complex multi-input
   multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear process with strong interactions among the
   variables. In order to guarantee both stability and convergence of the
   closed-loop nonlinear MP process, two different econ MPC schemes are
   proposed: one with penalty on the increment of the input and one with
   penalty on the offset of the input from its steady-state target. We
   demonstrate that both econ MPC schemes achieve significant amount of
   energy reduction in terms of the specific energy consumed by the process
   while ensuring closed-loop stability and convergence to a nearby
   steady-state. In addition, we show that more energy reduction can be
   achieved by using the econ MPC with penalty on the input increment
   compared with the other scheme. Simulation results also demonstrate the
   potential benefits of using econ MPC over the standard MPC technique.}},

Abstract = {{A novel air sampling monitor was developed for near-continuous (i.e.,
   2-h time resolution) measurement of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and
   chromium (Cr) concentrations in ambient coarse particulate matter (PM)
   (i. e., PM10-2.5). The developed monitor consists of two modules: (1)
   the coarse PM collection module, utilizing two virtual impactors (VIs)
   connected to a modified BioSampler to collect ambient coarse PM into
   aqueous slurry samples; (2) the metal concentration measurement module,
   which quantifies the light absorption of colored complexes formed
   through the reactions between the soluble and solubilized target metals
   and pertinent analytical reagents in the collected slurries using a
   micro volume flow cell (MVFC) coupled with UV/VIS spectrophotometry. The
   developed monitor was deployed in the field for continuous ambient PM
   collection and measurements from January to April 2016 to evaluate its
   performance and reliability. Overall, the developed monitor could
   achieve accurate and reliable measurements of the trace metals Fe, Mn,
   and Cr over long sampling periods, based on the agreement between the
   metal concentrations measured via this online monitor and off-line
   parallel measurements obtained using filter samplers. Based on our
   results, it can be concluded that the developed monitor is a promising
   technology for near-continuous measurements of metal concentrations in

Abstract = {{Systems composed of rigid bodies interacting through frictional contact
   are manifest in several science and engineering problems. The number of
   contacts can be small, such as in robotics and geared machinery, or
   large, such as in terramechanics applications, additive manufacturing,
   farming, food industry, and pharmaceutical industry. Currently, there
   are two popular approaches for handling the frictional contact problem
   in dynamic systems. The penalty method calculates the frictional contact
   force based on the kinematics of the interaction, some representative
   parameters, and an empirical force law. Alternatively, the
   complementarily method, based on a differential variational inequality
   (DVI), enforces non penetration of rigid bodies via a complementarity
   condition. This contribution concentrates on the latter approach and
   investigates the impact of an anti-relaxation step that improves the
   accuracy of the frictional contact solution. We show that the proposed
   anti-relaxation step incurs a relatively modest cost to improve the
   quality of a numerical solution strategy which poses the calculation of
   the frictional contact forces as a cone-complementarity problem..}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents an isogeometric shape optimization method that is
   based on Bezier triangles. Bezier triangles are used to represent both
   the geometry and physical fields. For a given physical domain defined by
   B-spline boundary, triangular Bezier parameterization can be
   automatically generated. This shape optimization method is thus
   applicable to structures of complex topology. Due to the use of B-spline
   parameterization of the boundary, the optimized shape can be compactly
   represented with a relatively small number of optimization variables. In
   order to ensure mesh validity during shape optimization, we adopt a
   bi-level mesh representation, where the coarse mesh is used to maintain
   mesh quality through positivity of Jacobian ordinates of the Bezier
   triangles. The fine mesh is used in isogeometric analysis for numerical
   accuracy. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficacy
   of the proposed method.}},

   Perceptual Cues}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2602}},
Pages = {{97-103}},
Abstract = {{Driver models have been developed to capture collision-avoidance
   behaviors, yet there is a lack of understanding of what perceptual
   processes influence drivers' choices to brake or steer. A statistical
   model of these decisions was developed with cluster analysis and
   multinomial logistic regression with data from a simulator study of
   drivers' responses to rear-end collisions. Drivers' choices of responses
   were clustered on the basis of the maximum values of the magnitude of
   braking and steering forces, starting from the time at which the driver
   looked back to the road, just before initiating the avoidance maneuver,
   to the end of the maneuver. The clusters identified three types of
   responses: medium to high braking with medium to high steering, medium
   to high braking with mild steering, and mild braking with medium to high
   steering. The perceptual variables such as the optical angle, the
   expansion rate of the optical angle, and their ratio were used to
   predict the drivers' choice of response. The results show that, of the
   perceptual variables, the combination of optical angle and tau performs
   as well as or better than others in predicting the choice of response.
   The mode and timing of an alert from a collision-warning system did not
   influence the drivers' choices. These results can inform driver behavior
   models to guide design and assess benefits of advanced driver assistance
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicle-to-grid is a promising concept, which has a potential to provide

   spinning and non-spinning reserve, and voltage and frequency regulation.
   This paper investigates the control method of a grid-connected inverter
   in vehicle to grid application for voltage regulation through reactive
   power control. The control technique is to maintain the point of common
   coupling voltage at a nominal value when there is sag or swell on grid
   voltage. The required power is mathematically derived as a function of
   the balanced sag or swell factor and phase angle of compensated voltage.
   The proposed control technique is simulated using MATLAB Simulink and

Abstract = {{Forced induction technology (turbocharging and supercharging) can
   enhance the performance of an internal combustion engine by compressing
   inlet air charge, allowing full engine power to be produced efficiently.
   As the fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission standards are projected
   to be much more stringent globally, the use of a forced induction engine
   in passenger cars and light duty trucks has become a new inevitable
   trend in the automotive industry. However, the conventional forced
   induction system suffers from the slow transient response, especially
   when the engine speed is low, a phenomenon typically known as turbo lag.
   The electrification of forced induction system, called electric forced
   induction system (EFIS), has emerged as a feasible solution and it also
   possesses numerous benefits depending on its topologies. This paper
   provides a comprehensive study on EFIS by investigating system level
   topologies, performance, various types of high-speed machines, power
   electronics, and control techniques. The advantages and disadvantages of
   existing electric forced induction system are summarized and the new
   challenges and opportunities are also introduced.}},

Abstract = {{Significant insight can be gained into the dynamics of a structure with
   bolted interfaces by observing the change in the effective modal natural
   frequency and damping of each mode of the structure as excitation
   amplitude increases. Unfortunately, current methods for estimating these
   parameters require that the model be integrated through several dynamic
   transient simulations at considerable computational expense. Festjens,
   Chevallier and Dion {[}Int. J. Mech. Sci. 75:170-177, 2013] recently
   proposed an alternative based on quasi-static analysis. This work builds
   on theirs, presenting an alternate derivation and alternative means of
   extracting the frequency and damping. The utility of the approach is
   then explored by using it to estimate the modal frequency and damping of
   two structures where bolted interfaces are modeled using discrete Iwan
   joints. The cases studied show that the methodology is highly effective
   in the micro-slip regime and provides several orders of magnitude
   reduction in the computational cost.}},

Abstract = {{The quantification of uncertainty is an important aspect in modern
   design. One relatively new technique to quantify this uncertainty is the
   maximum entropy approach. This approach characterizes the physical
   system in terms of random matrices. The random matrices are generated to
   have a mean value of the nominal system and the variance is controlled
   by a single dispersion parameter. The determination of the dispersion
   parameter is done by creating the maximum likelihood estimate. This
   estimate requires a numerical probability measure for any real world
   system since an analytical distribution cannot be determined. This paper
   investigates the effect of multiple sampling techniques and multiple
   probability measurements. The investigation is performed on a planar
   frame truss with uncertainty introduced due to a reduced model using
   different reduction techniques. This technique is a systematic method
   that produces repeatable results that can be used in model simulations
   to produce a stochastic output range that is verified to the desired
   truth data.}},

Title = {{RESHAPING AND RECOMPRESSING ROUND BIOMASS BALES}},
Journal = {{Transactions of the ASABE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},

Pages = {{795-802}},
Abstract = {{Recompressing bales to achieve greater density can reduce biomass
   storage and transportation costs, but research on recompressing round
   biomass bales is limited. Bi-axial compression in the radial direction
   of wheat straw, corn stover, switchgrass, and reed canarygrass was used
   to reshape round bales into a rectangular cross-section. The process was
   conducted as a three-stage progression: vertical reshaping to cuboid
   shape, followed by vertical and then horizontal densification. Density
   increased by 13\% to 23\% during vertical densification, and the
   pressure-density relationship was modeled as a linear function. Linear,
   power, and exponential models were fit to the pressure-density data
   collected during horizontal compression, during which density increased
   by an additional 68\% to 83\%. The linear and power functions best
   modeled the horizontal compression data. Although the power model
   underpredicted the initial density, it closely predicted the final bale
   density, so this model would have greater utility for future design
   applications. The target density of 240 kg DM m-3 was achieved at the
   end of compression with all four crops. Corn stover had significantly
   greater final density than the other three crops and achieved the target
   density with less applied pressure. Bales were restrained with polyester
   strapping prior to removal from the chamber. Bale density decreased 19\%
   to 30\% due to re-expansion after pressure was released. Although the
   forces applied were great, the specific energy requirements were low
   because compression took place over a relatively long time (similar to
   30 s). Differences in specific energy between crops were not
   statistically significant. Reshaping and recompressing large round bales
   could be an alternative to high-density large square baling to achieve
   weight-limited transport of baled biomass.}},

Title = {{AN EVALUATION OF SIMPLIFYING ASSUMPTIONS IN DAIRY COW COMPUTATIONAL
   FLUID DYNAMICS MODELS}},
Journal = {{Transactions of the ASABE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},

Pages = {{1575-1584}},
Abstract = {{Concurrent with the development of technologies and strategies for
   abating the heat buildup inside dairy barns, there is greater demand for
   an efficient and accurate way to test their performance. Computational
   modeling has improved to the point that it is now feasible to create
   realistic representations of animals to facilitate fluid dynamic
   modeling. Therefore, this study sought to use computational fluid
   dynamics to create and evaluate six different cow geometries: a sphere,
   a cylinder, a rectangular prism, a six-cylinder configuration, and two
   polygonal geometries labeled ``low-polygon cow{''} and ``high-polygon
   cow.{''} These six geometries were compared on the basis of their
   relative ability to replicate the effects of various different cooling
   and ventilation systems in operation inside a dairy barn. The
   low-polygon cow, having achieved results similar to the high-polygon cow
   with a coarser mesh, was then used to test the now common assumption
   that the area occupied by an animal (commonly called the animal-occupied
   zone) can be treated as porous media. While all three realistic
   geometries predicted heat transfer with nearly the same degree of
   accuracy (all were within 10\% of each other), the test showed that key
   localized differences must be taken into account when selecting a
   particular geometry. The testing also found evidence in support of the
   assumption that an animal-occupied zone should be treated as porous
   media when evaluating the effects that the zone will have on the rest of
   the computational domain; however, the animal-occupied zone assumption
   should not guide any evaluation of the transport phenomena occurring
   within the zone itself.}},

Title = {{A COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS MODEL OF A PERFORATED POLYETHYLENE TUBE
   VENTILATION SYSTEM FOR DAIRY OPERATIONS}},
Journal = {{Transactions of the ASABE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1585-1594}},
Abstract = {{The primary objective of this study was to create and validate a
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model capable of replicating the flow
   distribution created by a positive-pressure polyethylene tube (polytube)
   ventilation system. A polytube system was designed and installed at the
   University of Wisconsin-Madison. To properly compare the model and
   experimental data, precise magnitude and direction measurements, as well
   as their spatial locations, were recorded. In addition, a simple
   cost-effective rubber deflector, mounted on one of the discharge holes,
   was tested to ascertain the effects it would have on the jet's discharge
   angle and how this would affect the jets downstream from the deflected
   jet. Results showed that the CFD model created a flow field similar to
   that found in the field experiments. Testing also revealed that the
   first few jets in both the model and the actual setup tended to
   discharge air at an angle that aligned with the axis of the tube and in
   consequence failed to strike their intended targets. Additionally, the
   swirl effect created by the inlet fan proved to be a major influence
   affecting the distribution patterns of the air jets. To improve the
   model in this regard, a special boundary condition was added, after
   which the CFD model was able to replicate the damping effect created by
   backpressure generated at the end of the tube and a nearly identical air
   velocity at cow level. In addition, when the rubber deflector redirected
   the first jet to a more perpendicular angle, the jet no longer affected
   the downstream jets. The study thus was able to confirm that a polytube
   ventilation system could effectively cool dairy cows and that CFD can
   help optimize the design and predict the system's operational
   efficiency.}},

Volume = {{59}},

Pages = {{1645-1650}},
Abstract = {{Vegetative filter strips have the potential to treat agricultural runoff
   and reduce the pollutant load that reaches surface waters. Filter strips
   are used to infiltrate and remove nutrients from high-volume,
   low-concentration silage runoff produced from precipitation events.
   Following infiltration events, nitrates can form from organic nitrogen
   and ammonia, enter the subsurface drainage, and potentially contaminate
   groundwater. This study quantifies the surface and subsurface
   concentrations and nutrient load reductions provided by filter strips
   with different design storms. Two 3.7 m x 1.2 m filter strips were
   constructed, and silage runoff was applied at rates simulating a 25-year
   24-hour design storm and a 2-year 24-hour design storm for a bunker pad
   to filter strip area ratio of 1:1. The filter strips had a >80\%
   reduction of SRP and TP in the subsurface drainage when compared to the
   silage runoff influent. Subsurface drainage reduced total ammoniacal
   nitrogen, BOD5, and COD by 29\% to 77\%, 37\% to 76\%, and 40\% to 76\%,
   respectively. The pH of the subsurface drainage was increased from 4 to

Abstract = {{Modeling of decision-making behavior for discretionary lane-changing
   execution (DLCE) is fundamental to both movement simulation and
   controlling design of automatic vehicles. The existing gap acceptance
   models ingored the nonlinearity of drivers' DLCE decision-making
   behavior. Therefore, this study tries to analyze and simulate the DLCE
   decision-making behavior using the real trajectory data. First, a
   threshold of the lane-changer's lateral velocity is introduced to
   identify the starting point of DLCE process based on vehicle
   trajectories from the NGSIM data set. In the following, the empirical
   analysis based on traffic state variables at the instant of accepting
   DLCE event are presented, which prove the necessity of modeling DLCE
   decision-making behavior with machine learning method. Then, we propose
   a DLCE decision-making model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM). For
   verifying the prediction performance, the proposed model is compared
   with the Nagel's model based on the NGSIM data set. The comparison
   results indicate that the proposed model using SVM outperforms the
   Nagel's model in predicting the DLCE decision.}},

Abstract = {{Scripting languages like Javascript and PHP are widely used to implement
   application logic for dynamically-generated web pages. Their popularity
   is due in large part to their flexible syntax and dynamic type system,
   which enable rapid turnaround time for prototyping, releasing, and
   updating web site features and capabilities. The most common complex
   data structure in these languages is the hash map, which is used to
   store key-value pairs. In many cases, hash maps with a fixed set of keys
   are used in lieu of explicitly defined classes or structures, as would
   be common in compiled languages like Java or C++. Unfortunately, the
   runtime overhead of key lookup and value retrieval is quite high,
   especially relative to the direct offsets that compiled languages can
   use to access class members. Furthermore, key lookup and value retrieval
   incur high microarchitectural costs as well, since the paths they
   execute contain unpredictable branches and many cache accesses, leading
   to substantially higher numbers of branch mispredicts and cache misses
   per access to the hashmap. This paper quantifies these overheads,
   describes a compiler algorithm that discovers common use cases for hash
   maps and inlines them so that keys are accessed with direct offsets, and
   reports measured performance benefits on real hardware. A prototype
   implementation in the HipHop VM infrastructure shows promising
   performance benefits for a broad array of hash map-intensive server-side
   PHP applications, up to 37.6\% and averaging 18.81\%, improves SPECWeb
   throughput by 7.71\% (banking) and 11.71\% (e-corrunerce).}},

Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{89-97}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents empirical findings on car-following and
   lane-changing behavior involving heavy vehicles; trajectory data from
   the next generation simulation program were used in the study. It was
   found that when following passenger cars, heavy vehicles tended to
   reduce speed variations caused by traffic disturbances and thereby
   dampened traffic oscillations. In contrast, passenger cars following
   heavy vehicles tended to amplify traffic disturbances, although with
   lower probability and magnitude compared with the dampening effect.
   Moreover, heavy vehicles tended to discourage lane changes, especially
   behind them. This finding has convoluted implications: although reduced
   lane changes can improve traffic stability by preventing or reducing
   disturbances, large gaps can persist behind heavy vehicles and
   contribute to underutilization of road capacity.}},

Title = {{Effects of Parking Provision on Automobile Use in Cities Inferring
   Causality}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2543}},
Pages = {{159-165}},
Abstract = {{Many cities include minimum parking requirements in their zoning codes
   and provide ample parking for public use. However, parking is costly to
   provide and encourages automobile use, according to many site-specific
   studies. At the city scale, higher automobile use is linked to traffic
   congestion, environmental degradation, and negative health and safety
   impacts, but there is a lack of compelling, consolidated evidence that
   large-scale parking increases cause automobile use to rise. In this
   study, the Bradford Hill criteria, adopted from the field of
   epidemiology, were applied to determine whether increases in parking
   should be considered a likely cause of citywide increases in automobile
   use. Prior research and original data from nine U.S. cities dating to
   1960 were relied on. It was found that an increase in parking provision
   from 0.1 to 0.5 parking space per person was associated with an increase
   in automobile mode share of roughly 30 percentage points. It was also
   demonstrated that a majority of the Bradford Hill criteria could be
   satisfied by using the available data; this finding offers compelling
   evidence that parking provision is a cause of citywide automobile use.
   Given the costs associated with parking and its apparent effects on
   automobile use, these findings warrant policies to restrict and reduce
   parking capacity in cities.}},

   we introduce BADGR, a novel GHR design for TAGE predictors that lowers
   power consumption and chip area over naive checkpointing techniques by
   90\% and 85\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Research has identified barriers and facilitators affecting
   cancer survivors' return to work (RTW) following the end of active
   treatment (surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy). However, few
   studies have focused on barriers and facilitators that cancer survivors
   experience while working during active treatment. Strategies used by
   cancer survivors to solve work-related problems during active treatment
   are underexplored.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe factors that impact,
   either positively or negatively, breast cancer survivors' work
   activities during active treatment.
   METHODS: Semi-structured, recorded interviews were conducted with 35
   breast cancer survivors who worked during active treatment. Transcripts
   of interviews were analyzed using inductive content analysis to identify
   themes regarding work-related barriers, facilitators and strategies.
   RESULTS: Barriers identified included symptoms, emotional distress,
   appearance change, time constraints, work characteristics, unsupportive
   supervisors and coworkers, family issues and other illness. Facilitators
   included positive aspects of work, support outside of work, and coworker
   and supervisor support. Strategies included activities to improve
   health-related issues and changes to working conditions and tasks.
   CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer survivors encounter various barriers during
   active treatment. Several facilitators and strategies can help survivors
   maintain productive work activities.}},

Abstract = {{With the proliferation of hand-held devices in recent years, wireless
   video streaming has become an extremely popular application. Internet
   video streaming to mobile devices, however, faces several challenges,
   such as unstable connections, long latency, and high jitter. Bitrate
   adaptive streaming and video transcoding are widely used to overcome
   such problems. However, there are still several shortcomings of these
   approaches. Bitrate adaptive streaming cannot provide fine-grained
   adaptation. Moreover, video transcoding is expensive and is hard to
   apply for live streaming.
   In this work, we propose to use a low-cost video transcoding solution
   running at the wireless edge, such as home WiFi Access Points (APs).
   Instead of having expensive server-based transcoding, we designed and
   implemented a real-time video transcoding solution on a low-cost
   hardware, Raspberry Pi. By running our transcoding solution at the
   wireless edge, it can provide more agile adaptation to sudden network
   dynamics and is able to incorporate clients' feedback quickly. Our
   transcoding solution is transparent, low-cost, and scalable. Thus it
   allows broad and quick deployment in home WiFi APs (and also in cellular
   base stations). The evaluations reveal that our system enhances the
   performance of video streaming compared with other bitrate adaptive
   solutions. It provides higher video bitrates (at least 2.1x) without
   causing video stall or rebuffering.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this study is to find possible relationships between
   the smoothness of hand function during laparoscopic ventral hernia (LVH)
   repair and psychomotor skills in a defined virtual reality (VR)
   environment. Thirty four surgical residents N = 34 performed two
   scenarios. First, participants were asked to perform a simulated LVH
   repair during which their hand movement was tracked using
   electromagnetic sensors. Subsequently, the smoothness of hand function
   was calculated for each participant's dominant and non-dominate hand.
   Then participants performed two modules in a defined VR environment,
   which assessed their force matching and target tracking capabilities.
   More smooth hand function during the LVH repair correlated positively
   with higher performance in VR modules. Also, translational smoothness of
   dominant hand is found as the most informative smoothness metric in the
   LVH repair scenario. Therefore, defined force matching and target
   tracking assessments in VR can potentially be used as an indirect
   assessment of fine motor skills in the LVH repair.}},

Abstract = {{System-on-Chip is a promising model for design of complex integrated
   circuits. In this model, designers may easily incorporate licensed
   and/or purchased Intellectual Property (IP) modules from other vendors
   to significantly reduce the design cycle time. However, the need to
   fulfill the legal obligations in the associated license or purchase
   contracts usually imposes considerable burden on the design process. The
   burden is often in the form of design access constraints that have to be
   imposed on SoC design team and/or in the form of additional costs needed
   to acquire a less constraining contract. To alleviate these problems,
   this paper proposes a encryption approach that assures confidentiality
   of the gate-level circuit information for the module designer while
   allowing the SoC designers an ability to perform gate-level digital
   simulations with gate-level delays. Empirical evaluation on benchmark
   circuits shows that, in addition to not being able to identify the gate
   types, an attacker cannot decrypt the delays associated with most of the
   gates in the circuit.}},

Abstract = {{Graphs are used in a wide variety of application domains, from social
   science to machine learning. Graph algorithms present large numbers of
   irregular accesses with little data reuse to amortize the high cost of
   memory accesses, requiring high memory bandwidth. Processing in memory
   (PIM) implemented through 3D die-stacking can deliver this high memory
   bandwidth. In a system with multiple memory modules with PIM, the
   in-memory compute logic has low latency and high bandwidth access to its
   local memory, while accesses to remote memory introduce high latency and
   energy consumption. Ideally, in such a system, computation and data are
   partitioned among the PIM devices to maximize data locality. But the
   irregular memory access patterns present in graph applications make it
   difficult to guarantee that the computation in each PIM device will only
   access its local data. A large number of remote memory accesses can
   negate the benefits of using PIM.
   In this paper, we examine the feasibility and potential of fine-grained
   work migration to reduce remote data accesses in systems with multiple
   PIM devices. First, we propose a data-driven implementation of our study
   algorithms: breadth-first search (BFS), single source shortest path
   (SSSP) and betweenness centrality (BC) where each PIM has a queue where
   the vertices that it needs to process are held. New vertices that need
   to be processed are enqueued at the PIM device co-located with the
   memory that stores those vertices. Second, we propose hardware support
   that takes advantage of PIM to implement highly efficient queues that
   improve the performance of the queuing framework by up to 16.7\%. Third,
   we develop a timing model for the queueing framework to explore the
   benefits of work migration vs. remote memory accesses. And, finally, our
   analysis using the above framework shows that naive task migration can
   lead to performance degradations and identifies trade-offs among data
   locality, redundant computation, and load balance among PIM devices that
   must be taken into account to realize the potential benefits of
   fine-grain task migration.}},

Abstract = {{We present a coax-fed interstitial dipole antenna with a tapered-slot
   balun for minimally invasive microwave ablation (MWA). The balun is
   created using two tapered slots in the outer conductor of the feeding
   coaxial cable. This implementation allows for reducing the overall
   antenna diameter compared to coax-fed MWA antennas employing
   conventional coaxial baluns. The tapered balun connects the feed line to
   a dipole that consists of three segments. One segment is an extension of
   the inner conductor and constitutes one arm of the dipole. The other two
   segments are connected to the outer conductor of the coax cable and are
   located in the tapered slots; these segments constitute the second
   dipole arm. The tapered balun efficiently chokes the currents excited on
   the outer surface of the feeding cable and provides a good impedance
   match between the dipole and the feed line, as demonstrated by
   simulation and measurement results. The proposed antenna offers a less
   invasive alternative to conventional MWA antennas.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new technique for designing low-profile
   circularly-polarized reflectarrays with broadband true-time-delay (TTD)
   responses and linearly-polarized feeds. The proposed reflectarray
   exploits the unit cells of ground-plane-backed, anisotropic
   miniaturized-element frequency selective surfaces as its spatial
   time-delay units (TDUs). Each TDU is composed of a stack of non-resonant
   rectangular-shaped capacitive patches. Besides providing the necessary
   time delay to create beam collimation, each TDU creates a broadband 90
   degrees phase difference between the two orthogonal components of the
   incident field. This results in a wideband, TTD reflectarray that
   converts a linearly polarized spherical incident field to a
   circularly-polarized collimated beam. A prototype of such a reflectarray
   operating at X-band is designed, fabricated, and characterized.
   Measurement results show consistent radiation characteristics, excellent
   time domain performance, and an axial ratio lower than 1.5 over at least
   40\% bandwidth. The offset-fed versions of the prototype were also shown
   to be capable of providing off-axis, TTD UWB beams within the wide field
   of view of +/- 45 degrees.}},

Abstract = {{Many regenerative medicine applications seek to harness the biologic
   power of stem cells in architecturally complex scaffolds or
   microenvironments. Traditional tissue engineering methods cannot create
   such intricate structures, nor can they precisely control cellular
   position or spatial distribution. These limitations have spurred
   advances in the field of bioprinting, aimed to satisfy these structural
   and compositional demands. Bioprinting can be defined as the programmed
   deposition of cells or other biologics, often with accompanying
   biomaterials. In this concise review, we focus on recent advances in
   stemcell bioprinting, including performance, utility, and applications
   in regenerative medicine. More specifically, this review explores the
   capability of bioprinting to direct stemcell fate, engineer tissue(s),
   and create functional vascular networks. Furthermore, the unique
   challenges and concerns related to bioprinting living stem cells, such
   as viability and maintaining multi-or pluripotency, are discussed. The
   regenerative capacity of stem cells, when combined with the
   structural/compositional control afforded by bioprinting, provides a
   unique and powerful tool to address the complex demands of tissue
   engineering and regenerative medicine applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an atmospheric lidar photon-limited imaging problem
   in which observations are contaminated with Poisson noise. The
   observations are a nonlinear function of two spatially varying physical
   parameters. The first parameter, called the transmittance, is known to
   be a bounded monotonic non-increasing function. The second parameter,
   called the backscatter cross-section, is non-negative and can be
   approximated with a piecewise constant function. Current statistical
   estimators in the lidar community do not take these constraints in
   account, and at times the estimates violate the physical properties. The
   standard practice is such that estimation of the parameters are not
   treated as a statistical inference imaging problem, except that the only
   imaging technique that is used is averaging over non-overlapping blocks
   to reduce the noise variance. The proposed method of this paper
   leverages novel Poisson image reconstruction algorithms with
   monotonicity constraints. Specifically, an isotonic regression algorithm
   called PAV is incorporated into total-variation regularized Poisson
   estimation methods. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach -
   relative to competitor algorithms - consistently yields improved
   estimates (smaller MSE) of the transmittance parameter, with a
   negligible deterioration of the backscatter cross-section.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission has seen renewed investment in the U.S. over the past
   decade, as the nation seeks to modernize its aging power infrastructure.
   While the technical side of transmission planning seeks improvements to
   the grid to enhance reliability and/or economy of operation,
   transmission line siting (TLS) must include the very challenging process
   of routing transmission corridors to respect geographic and land-use
   constraints. Among other factors, acquisition of rights-of-way,
   compliance with state and federal agencies, and environmental impact of
   transmission lines are all investigated in transmission line siting.
   While strides have been made to improve the process in the past decade,
   transmission line siting remains a controversial and difficult process.
   Transmission line siting in a post-restructuring electric industry will
   be covered in this paper. We review the important role played by
   non-electric constraints such as geographic barriers, regulatory impact,
   public/stakeholder input, etc. in transmission expansion planning. We
   introduce an approach that provides a first step towards an automated,
   optimization-based approach incorporating geographic decision factors,
   and most critically, line length. This modification to the authors'
   previous transmission expansion work allows weighing of system-wide
   electrical performance contributions of a transmission line in
   conjunction with geographic impact.}},

Abstract = {{Consider observing a series of events associated with a group of
   interacting nodes in a network, where the interactions among those nodes
   govern the likelihood of future events. Such data are common in spike
   trains recorded from biological neural networks, interactions within a
   social network, and pricing changes within financial networks. Vector
   autoregressive point processes accurately model these settings and are
   widely used in practice. This paper addresses the inference of the
   network structure and autoregressive parameters from such data. A
   sparsity-regularized maximum likelihood estimator is proposed for a
   Poisson autoregressive process. While sparsity regularization is
   well-studied in the statistics and machine learning communities, common
   assumptions from that literature are difficult to verify here because of
   correlations and heteroscedasticity inherent in the problem. Novel
   performance guarantees characterize how much data must be collected to
   ensure reliable inference depending on the size and sparsity of the
   autoregressive parameters, and these bounds are supported by several
   simulation studies.}},

Abstract = {{The Astro-H (Hitomi) Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) was a pioneering
   imaging x-ray spectrometer with 5 eV energy resolution at 6 keV. The
   instrument used a microcalorimeter array at the focus of a
   high-throughput soft x-ray telescope to enable high-resolution
   non-dispersive spectroscopy in the soft x-ray waveband (0 : 3 12 keV).
   We present the suite of ground calibration measurements acquired from
   2012\{2015, including characterization of the detector system,
   anti-coincidence detector, optical blocking filters, and filter-wheel
   filters. The calibration of the 36-pixel silicon thermistor
   microcalorimeter array includes parameterizations of the energy gain
   scale and line spread function for each event grade over a range of
   instrument operating conditions, as well as quantum efficiency
   measurements. The x-ray transmission of the set of five Al/polyimide
   thin-film optical blocking filters mounted inside the SXS dewar has been
   modeled based on measurements at synchrotron beamlines, including with
   high spectral resolution at the C, N, O, and Al K-edges. In addition, we
   present the x-ray transmission of the dewar gate valve and of the
   filters mounted on the SXS filter wheel (external to the dewar),

Abstract = {{The Large Observatory For x-ray Timing (LOFT) is a mission concept which
   was proposed to ESA as M3 and M4 candidate in the framework of the
   Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 program. Thanks to the unprecedented combination
   of effective area and spectral resolution of its main instrument and the
   uniquely large field of view of its wide field monitor, LOFT will be
   able to study the behaviour of matter in extreme conditions such as the
   strong gravitational field in the innermost regions close to black holes
   and neutron stars and the supra-nuclear densities in the interiors of
   neutron stars. The science payload is based on a Large Area Detector
   (LAD, > 8m(2) effective area, 2-30 keV, 240 eV spectral resolution, 1
   degree collimated field of view) and a Wide Field Monitor (WFM, 2-50
   keV, 4 steradian field of view, 1 arcmin source location accuracy, 300
   eV spectral resolution). The WFM is equipped with an on-board system for
   bright events (e. g., GRB) localization. The trigger time and position
   of these events are broadcast to the ground within 30 s from discovery.
   In this paper we present the current technical and programmatic status
   of the mission.}},

Abstract = {{The Hitomi (ASTRO-H) mission is the sixth Japanese X-ray astronomy
   satellite developed by a large international collaboration, including
   Japan, USA, Canada, and Europe. The mission aimed to provide the highest
   energy resolution ever achieved at E > 2 keV, using a microcalorimeter
   instrument, and to cover a wide energy range spanning four decades in
   energy from soft X-rays to gamma-rays. After a successful launch on 2016
   February 17, the spacecraft lost its function on 2016 March 26, but the
   commissioning phase for about a month provided valuable information on
   the on-board instruments and the spacecraft system, including
   astrophysical results obtained from first light observations. The paper
   describes the Hitomi (ASTRO-H) mission, its capabilities, the initial
   operation, and the instruments/spacecraft performances confirmed during
   the commissioning operations for about a month.}},

Abstract = {{Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) onboard ASTRO-H (named Hitomi after
   launch) is a microcalorimeter-type spectrometer, installed in a dewar to
   be cooled at 50 mK. The energy resolution of the SXS engineering model
   suffered from micro-vibration from cryocoolers mounted on the dewar.
   This is mitigated for the flight model by introducing vibration
   isolation systems between the cryocoolers and the dewar. The detector
   performance of the flight model was verified before launch of the
   spacecraft in both ambient condition and thermal-vac condition, showing
   no detectable degradation in energy resolution. The in-orbit performance
   was also consistent with that on ground, indicating that the cryocoolers
   were not damaged by launch environment. The design and performance of
   the vibration isolation system along with the mechanism of how the
   micro-vibration could degrade the cryogenic detector is shown.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new process for developing biodiesel by polymer
   from crude cottonseed oil. The study was conducted to examine the
   effectiveness of the alkali
   transesterification-flocculation-sedimentation process on fast glycerol
   and other impurities in the separation from biodiesel by using
   quaternary polyamine-based cationic polymers SL2700 and polyacylamide
   cationic polymer SAL1100. The settling velocity of glycerol and other
   impurities in biodiesel was investigated through settling test
   experiments; the quality of the biodiesel was investigated by evaluating
   the viscosity and density. The results revealed that SL2700, SAL1100 and
   their combination dramatically improved the settling velocity of
   glycerol and other impurities materials than traditional method. SL 2700
   with molecular weight of 0.2 million Da and charge density of 50\% then
   plus SAL1100 with molecular weight of 11 million Da and charge density
   of 10\% induced observable particle aggregation with the best settling
   performance.}},

   physicochemical and adhesion properties of cow blood adhesive such as
   UV-visible spectra, particle size, viscosity were evaluated; share
   strength, water resistance were tested. UV-visible spectra indicates
   that the strong bonding strength of BA/ALB appeared after incorporating;
   the particle size of adhesive decreased with the increase of ALB
   concentration, by mixing ALB and BA, hydrophilic polymer tends locate or
   extand the protein chains and provide stability of the particles;
   viscosity decreased as shear rate increased in concordance with a
   pseudoplastic behavior; both at dry and soak conditions, BA and ALB/BA
   show significant difference changes when mass fraction of ALB in blend
   adhesive was over 30\% (p < 0.05). ALB/BA (ALB30\%) is not significant
   different than that of phenol formaldehyde which was used as control. A
   combination of cow blood and acrylic latex-based adhesive significantly
   increased the strength and water resistance of the resulting wood.}},

Abstract = {{Split manufacturing is a technique that allows manufacturing the
   transistor-level and lower metal layers of an IC at a high-end,
   untrusted foundry, while manufacturing only the higher metal layers at a
   smaller, trusted foundry. Using split manufacturing is only viable if
   the untrusted foundry cannot reverse engineer the higher metal layer
   connections (and thus the overall IC design) from the lower layers. This
   work studies the effectiveness of proximity attack as a key step to
   reverse engineer a design at the untrusted foundry. We propose and study
   different proximity attacks based on how a set of candidates are defined
   for each broken connection. The attacks use both placement and routing
   information along with factors which capture the router's behavior such
   as per-layer routing congestion. Our studies are based on designs having
   millions of nets routed across 9 metal layers and significant
   layer-by-layer wire size variation. Our results show that a common,
   Hamming Distance-based proximity attack seldom achieves a match rate
   over 5\%. But our proposed attack yields a relatively-small list of
   candidates which often contains the correct match. Finally, we propose a
   procedure to artificially insert routing blockages in a design at a
   desired split level, without causing any area overhead, in order to
   trick the router to make proximity-based reverse engineering
   significantly more challenging.}},

Abstract = {{Driven by recent advances in resistive random-access memory (RRAM),
   there have been growing interests in exploring alternative computing
   concept, i.e., in-memory processing, to address the classical von
   Neumann bottlenecks. Despite of their great promise in improving
   performance and energy efficiency, most existing works are built on the
   inherent matrix-vector multiplication capability of RRAM crossbar
   structure, and thus lack the flexibility to adapt to future
   market/technology induced changes in data-intensive applications. To
   address these challenges, we propose an in-memory reconfigurable
   architecture based on RRAM crossbar structure. For the first time, it
   achieves a full programmability across computation and storage, and
   thereby provides more flexibilities of partitioning the hardware
   resources based on applications' needs. We further develop two complete
   CAD design flows to facilitate development of applications written in
   hardware description languages (HDLs) for our architecture, based on: 1)
   adaption from existing tool set developed for FPGA, 2) a custom tool
   design optimized towards the new architecture. Our experiments show
   that, both design flows are effective in exploiting flexible resources
   offered by our architecture and thus achieves better efficiency than
   state-of-art FPGAs (30\% improvement in performance with 66\% reduction
   in area). In addition, compared to adapted design flow, our custom
   design flow achieves speedup by 3.3x, and further improves mapping
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{Beam angle selection (BAS) is an important part of intensity-modulated
   radiation therapy and can be very challenging due to its huge solution
   space and computational difficulty. In this research, we have developed
   a nested partitions (NP) framework to optimize beam angles. NP is a
   metaheuristic algorithm which successively partitions the entire
   solution space, evaluates the quality of each sub-region formed by
   partitioning, and concentrates the search for the optimum in promising
   sub-regions. Moreover, we construct a machine learning (ML) model to
   quickly estimate performance of the selected angle vectors so that
   thousands of angle vectors can be evaluated within seconds. We compare
   the ML-based NP (MLNP) framework with five other BAS methods. Numerical
   tests for five head and neck cases are performed. The results show that
   MLNP can generate solutions with better quality and achieve higher
   computational efficiency than the compared methods.}},

Abstract = {{For safety and security, surveillance cameras are widely deployed. A
   high percentage of the visual data, however, is never watched by humans
   nor analyzed by computer programs. Moreover, it is common practice to
   erase the data after a short duration (say, two weeks) and reuse the
   storage space. As a result, the data are non-persistent. Non-persistent
   data presents serious security risks: the unwatched and unanalyzed data
   may include evidence of security breaches. After the data is erased, it
   is no longer possible to detect the breaches nor prosecute the suspects.
   This paper proposes a potential solution to remedy this situation by
   adding automatic data sampling to a programming language. If a piece of
   data is marked as non-persistent, the compiler and the run-time system
   automatically sample and store the data, hence making a small fraction
   of the data persistent. The samples would allow post-event analysis to
   detect security breaches that are not detected earlier. The samples, due
   to the much smaller sizes compared with the original non-persistent
   data, may be analyzed using more sophisticated computer programs that
   are unable to keep up with the speeds of data generation.}},

Abstract = {{The National Center for Biotechnology Information
   {[}http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/guide/taxonomy/] database enlists more
   than 15,500 bacterial species. But this also includes a plethora of
   uncultured bacterial representations. Owing to their metabolism, they
   directly influence biogeochemical cycles, which underscores the the
   important status of bacteria on our planet. To study the function of a
   gene from an uncultured bacterium, we have undertaken a de novo gene
   synthesis approach. Actinobacteria of the acI-B subcluster are important
   but yet uncultured members of the bacterioplankton in temperate lakes of
   the northern hemisphere such as oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (NE Germany).
   This lake is relatively poor in phosphate (P) and harbors on average
   similar to 1.3 x 10(6) bacterial cells/ml, whereby Actinobacteria of the
   ac-I lineage can contribute to almost half of the entire bacterial
   community depending on seasonal variability. Single cell genome analysis
   of Actinobacterium SCGC AB141-P03, a member of the acI-B tribe in Lake
   Stechlin has revealed several phosphate-metabolizing genes. The genome
   of acI-B Actinobacteria indicates potential to degrade polyphosphate
   compound. To test for this genetic potential, we targeted the
   exoP-annotated gene potentially encoding polyphosphatase and synthesized
   it artificially to examine its biochemical role. Heterologous
   overexpression of the gene in Escherichia coli and protein purification
   revealed phosphatase activity. Comparative genome analysis suggested
   that homologs of this gene should be also present in other
   Actinobacteria of the acI lineages. This strategic retention of
   specialized genes in their genome provides a metabolic advantage over
   other members of the aquatic food web in a P-limited ecosystem.}},

   engineers to understand when using a reduced order model. This
   quantification requires multiple numerical simulations which can be

   Monte Carlo and Latin Hypercube, are explored while using the maximum
   entropy method to quantify the uncertainty. The maximum entropy method
   implements random matrices that maintain essential properties. This is
   explored on a planar frame using different types of substructure
   representations, such as Craig-Bampton. Along with the model form
   uncertainty of the substructure representation, the effect of component
   mode synthesis for each type of substructure representation on the model
   form uncertainty is studied.}},

Abstract = {{Methods to modify power system dynamics through the addition of
   synthetic inertia have gained increasing research attention over the
   past several years. Many researchers justify this focus by implicitly
   assuming that adding inertia increases a system's stability, and only
   focusing on the frequency nadir as a measure of performance. In this
   paper, we draw attention to the fact that adding synthetic inertia to a
   power system may not always increase the system stability when
   considering overall small signal behavior. We apply two different sets
   of dynamic parameters to the generators in the IEEE 14-bus test system
   and show an example in which increasing synthetic inertia exercised
   through loads may lead to problematic instabilities.}},

   of network elements' electrical behavior, employing transmission
   ({''}ABCD{''}) matrices for lines and transformers. We demonstrate that
   this allows straightforward representation of breaker action and
   controllable transformers compared to standard approaches based on the
   admittance matrix Y-bus. The proposed technique is tested on the RTS-96

   linear and nonlinear representation become particularly critical in the

Abstract = {{Transport of odiferous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas was evaluated using
   column tests simulating interim covers for waste containment consisting
   of a thin geomembrane overlain by cover soil. Tests were conducted with
   co-extruded geomembrane (GM) comprised of a thin inner layer (0.05 mm)
   of ethylene-vinyl alcohol (EVOH) sandwiched between two layers of linear
   low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), a 0.1-mm-thick polyethylene (PE)
   sheet, a 0.76-mm LLDPE GM, and a 0.76-mm polyvinyl chloride ( PVC) GM.
   In each case, the GM or sheet was overlain with a thin layer of silt
   intended to protect and anchor the GM. Breakthrough of H2S occurred from
   the column with an EVOH GM (approximate to 30 d) was five times slower
   than from columns with LLDPE and PVC GMs (approximate to 6 d). Relative
   concentrations on the cover surface from the column with the EVOH GM was
   lower than for all other GMs (relative concentrations were in the
   following order: PE > PVC > LLDPE >> EVOH). The diffusion coefficient
   for H2S in the EVOH GM back-calculated from the column test data was
   approximately 100 times lower than diffusion coefficients for the PE
   sheet and other GMs (1.1 x 10(-12) m(2)/s for co-extruded EVOH GM, 1.14
   x 10(-10) m(2)/s for 0.1-mm PE GM, 0.87 x 10(-10) m(2)/s for the 0.76-mm
   LLDPE GM, and 1.06 x 10(-10) m(2)/s for the 0.76-mm PVC GM). These
   findings suggest that interim covers with co-extruded EVOH GMs can be
   effective at reducing emission of odiferous H2S relative to interim
   covers with other geomembranes.}},

   conducted on non-prehydrated GCL specimens at an isotropic effective

   of the BPM GCLs did not vary systematically with ionic strength of the

Abstract = {{Bentonite-polymer mixtures ( B-P) used ingeosynthetic clay liners (GCLs)
   have been shown to maintain low hydraulic conductivity in aggressive
   (e.g., high ionic strength) permeant solutions detrimental to untreated
   sodium-bentonite (Na-B). While a number of hypotheses have been
   proposed, the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms for improved
   chemical compatibility and low hydraulic conductivity of B-P GCL remain
   poorly understood. This paper describes a suite of scanning electronic
   microscopy (SEM) analyses conducted to observe pore-scale structure of
   B-P hydrated with deionized water and saline solutions. Polymer observed
   in B-P exposed to deionized water had a remnant three-dimensional
   network structure, with polymer chains forming bridges among clay
   clusters and filling large voids in the inter-cluster pore space.

Abstract = {{Polymer-modified bentonites have been introduced in recent years to
   improve the chemical compatibility and performance of hydraulic barrier
   systems (e.g., geosynthetic clay liners) permeated with aggressive
   leachates. Laboratory experiments were conducted using a rotational
   torque viscometer to determine the viscosity of pure polymer and
   polymer-bentonite mixtures in suspension with saline solutions.
   Viscosity depends on the polymer-to-bentonite ratio, ionic strength, and
   anion and cation species. The bentonite fraction controls viscosity at
   polymer-to-bentonite ratios radi about 5\% by mass. Polymer fraction
   controls viscosity at ratios approaching 10\%. Low viscosity is
   interpreted to reflect a coiled polymer conformation, less effective
   hydrogel formation, and less effective bridging between polymer and clay
   units. Ongoing research is establishing potential links between the
   viscosity of polymer-bentonite suspensions and hydraulic performance of
   polymer-modified barrier systems in aggressive permeant solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Water vapor sorption behavior of clays gives valuable information on
   mineralogy and surface properties, and consequently on macro-scale
   engineering behavior of clays. Sorption isotherms can also indicate
   functional groups in polymers, and therefore their hydrated behavior.
   This paper evaluates the water vapor sorption behavior of
   polymer-modified bentonites prepared to be representative of materials
   used in composite systems for hydraulic barrier applications.
   Bentonite-polymer (B-P) mixtures were dry-mixed in mass-controlled
   ratios denoted by their respective polymer content (P) (0\% P, 2\% P,
   4\% P, 6\% P, and 100\% P). Hysteretic water vapor sorption isotherms
   for pure polymer, pure bentonite, and the B-P mixtures were obtained
   along adsorption and desorption paths using a dynamic water vapor
   sorption analyzer. Isotherms for bentonite-rich (<= 6\% polymer)
   mixtures at relative humidity (RH) less than about 70\% are essentially
   identical to the bentonite end-member, suggesting that the bentonite
   fraction dominates the initial sorption response. At RH greater than
   70\%, adsorbed water content systematically increases with increasing
   polymer fraction.}},

Abstract = {{Two methods to measure radon (Rn) flux from earthen Rn barriers were
   evaluated in this study as part of a larger project to evaluate how
   pedogenesis (structural development in response to soil formation
   processes) affects radon flux from earthen surface covers placed over
   disposal facilities for uranium mill tailings. Calibration methods and
   flux data are presented for activated carbon (AC) passive collectors and
   a solid-state alpha particle detector (RAD7). Tests using granite
   aggregate as Rn source material indicate that the average Rn flux
   measured using the RAD7 is in good agreement with measurements for
   similar rock types. Radon concentration measured using AC samplers can
   be up to 60\% less than concentrations measured using the RAD7. The
   underestimate is likely due to the presence of water vapor in the flux
   chambers, which reduces availability of Rn sorption sites on AC. Average
   Rn fluxes were similar for small (area = 0.017 m(2)), medium (0.071
   m(2)), and large (2.32 m(2)) flux chambers. However, variability in the
   flux decreased with increasing sample size due to the effects of spatial
   averaging, from 43.4\% for the small flux chamber to 2.4\% for the large
   flux chamber.}},

Abstract = {{Beneficial reuse of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash
   depends on demonstrating that this material presents acceptable
   environmental risk. Leaching characteristics of trace elements from
   municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash samples were
   investigated by laboratory leach tests. Concentrations of arsenic (As)
   and barium (Ba) from water leach tests (WLTs), synthetic precipitation
   leaching procedure (SPLP), and column leach tests (CLTs) were observed
   to exceed the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) according to US EPA
   drinking water standards. Concentrations of As from CLTs decreased
   steadily with increasing cumulative liquid-to-solid ratio (L/S), but
   still exceeded the MCL at L/S ratio of 10. pH dependent leaching of Ba
   was observed from batch and column leach tests. Leaching of Ba in one
   ash sample was 2-3 times higher than another sample in both WLTs and
   SPLP, with a higher leachate pH of 11.3. Lower concentrations of Ba (30
   to 300 mu g/L) were observed in CLTs with lower leachate pH.
   Concentrations of As decreased significantly below pH= 4, then showed a
   steady release with concentrations of 2-10 mu g/L for 4 < pH < 12.
   Leaching concentrations of boron (B) and Ba were independent of pH until
   pH= 9. Leaching behavior of copper (Cu) followed the cationic pattern in
   which the concentration of elements steadily decreased with pH.}},

Abstract = {{An engineering workforce of sufficient size and quality is essential for
   addressing significant global challenges such as climate change, world
   hunger, and energy demand. Future generations of engineers will need to
   identify challenging issues and design innovative solutions. To prepare
   young people to solve big and increasingly global problems, researchers
   and educators need to understand how we can best educate young people to
   use engineering design thinking. In this paper, we explore virtual
   internships, online simulations of 21st-century engineering design
   practice, as one method for teaching engineering design thinking. To
   assess the engineering design thinking, we use epistemic network
   analysis (ENA), a tool for measuring complex thinking as it develops
   over time based on discourse analysis. The combination of virtual
   internships and ENA provides opportunities for students to engage in
   authentic engineering design, potentially receive concurrent feedback on
   their engineering design thinking, and develop the identity, values, and
   ways of thinking of professional engineers.}},

Pages = {{A2733-A2744}},
Abstract = {{In this manuscript, carbon materials having different microstructural
   and electrochemical properties were coated with metal oxide thin-films
   of SiO2 or gamma-Al2O3/gamma-AlOOH. The metal oxide deposition was
   influenced by four factors: number of times dipped into the sol, sol
   concentration, proximity of the sol to its isoelectric pH and drying
   temperature. Upon coating, microstructural and electrochemical
   properties of the resulting composite electrode (metal oxide + carbon)
   were largely dependent upon the carbon material. For instance, an
   increase in specific surface area (by over a factor of 5) was observed
   when a low surface area carbon was coated; however, coating a high
   surface area carbon resulted in a decrease in the specific surface area
   of the composite. Likewise, surface groups associated with the coatings
   also appeared to increase the wettability of select carbons. When
   comparing the capacitance of the different carbon materials, it was
   shown that properties other than surface area (i.e. - wettability)
   played a role in performance. In several cases, the coated electrodes
   had increased capacities over that of the uncoated carbon supports;
   however, this was carbon specific as some materials experienced little
   change in capacity with the metal oxide coatings. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{We synthesized nanocomposite of polymerized
   8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (APTA) and single-walled carbon
   nanotubes (SWCNTs). To prepare the nanocomposite, SWCNTs were dispersed
   in aqueous solution of APTA (monomers) using a probe sonicator. The
   as-prepared APTA/SWCNTs dispersion was characterized using Raman, FT-IR,
   and UV-visible-near infrared (UVvis-NIR) spectroscopies. Cyclic
   voltammetrymeasurements indicated that polymerization of APTA occurred
   during probe sonication due to the oxidation of APTA molecules. Using
   the poly(APTA)/SWCNTs dispersion, a conducting thin film was prepared on
   a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and its electrochemical and catalytic
   properties were studied. The poly(APTA)/SWCNTs film coated electrode
   exhibited excellent electrochemical catalytic activity toward the
   oxidation of caffeine (CAF) with a linear range from 10 mu M to 0.76 mM
   with a linear regression equation; Ipa (mA) = 0.015 mM + 5.84 x 10(-7)
   (R2 = 0.993). In addition, the other common electroactive biomolecules
   such as dopamine (DA) and ascorbic acid (AA) did not interfere with the
   CAF oxidation peak. Well-defined oxidation peaks (with high catalytic
   currents) ofAA(+ 0.49 V), DA(+ 0.53 V) and CAF (+ 1.47 V) were
   simultaneously observed at the poly(APTA)/SWCNTs sensor. Selective
   detection of CAF in fruit juices was also demonstrated. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{With the emergence of connected and automated vehicle (CAV)
   technologies, research on traffic flow modeling and analysis will play a
   very important role in improving our understanding of the fundamental
   characteristics of traffic flow. The frontier of studies on CAV systems
   have examined the impacts of CAVs on freeway bottleneck capacity, and
   macroscopic traffic flow, CAV applications on optimization of individual
   vehicle trajectories, potentials of CAV in traffic signal control, and
   applications of CAV in network routing. For current and future research
   initiatives, the greatest challenge lies in the potential
   inconsistencies between user, operator, and manufacturer goals. Specific
   research needs were identified on data collection and analysis on CAV
   behavior and applications. This paper summarizes the presentations and
   discussions during the Automated Vehicles Symposium 2015 (AVS15) held in
   Ypsilanti, Michigan, on July 20-23, 2015.}},

   Detection Data}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2558}},
Pages = {{30-40}},
Abstract = {{Turning movement count data (i.e., vehicle volumes broken down by
   movement, approach, and time periods) are the foundation of signal
   performance evaluations and a crucial component of a data-driven
   decision-making process used by transportation agencies. In this paper,
   the authors show how data available from intersections equipped with
   radar-based vehicle detection can be used to produce turning movement
   counts. A classification algorithm developed and discussed by the
   authors is capable of producing turning movement counts regardless of
   lane configuration and without the need for definition of detection
   zones. The algorithm works by using the data produced by vehicle
   detection systems that go unused and are never communicated to the
   signal controller. The nature of the data collection process makes the
   algorithm independent of the controller used. Results from the algorithm
   are promising; an average error of 0.26 vehicles per 15-min count period
   (absolute error of 2.31 vehicles) was obtained with the algorithm.
   Furthermore, the application of the algorithm provides an opportunity
   beyond signal operations. Processed trajectory data and results from the
   algorithm could be used to break the boundary that often exists between
   operations, planning, and safety, and thus show how a monitoring system
   that relies on the algorithm could help a traffic monitoring program
   meet the different and sometimes competing interests of agencies.}},

Abstract = {{Grid-connected inverters (GCIs) are power electronics interfaces to
   connect distributed energy resources into the grid. In order to improve
   the performance of distributed energy resources as well as maintain the

   inductance on quality of the grid current when there are multiple
   parallel-connected inverters to the grid. The model includes three-phase
   two-level voltage source inverters, output LCL filter, the grid, and
   voltage-oriented PI controller with a power controller. Parallel GCI
   systems are mathematically modeled. Frequency responses of grid current
   are investigated according to different grid inductances. A parallel

Abstract = {{Three phase voltage source inverters typically feature a significant
   amount of dc energy storage to maintain a stiff dc bus. In these cases,
   the dc link capacitor is sized to store enough energy to maintain
   several tens of cycles of ac output at the rated power. In this paper,
   we propose to reduce the size of the dc link capacitor dramatically, to
   store enough energy to provide just one high frequency switching cycle
   of ac output power. The dc bus is no longer stiff and hence classical
   sinusoidal pulse width modulation cannot be used. But, the stored energy
   modulation (SEM) concept that we propose herein synthesizes high quality
   sinusoidal output voltage waveforms even with such tiny dc link
   capacitors. In SEM, the switching intervals of the interconnecting
   switches are carefully determined non-linear functions of various
   operating parameters such as reactive component sizing, switching
   frequency, load levels, etc. This paper presents the analytical and
   detailed design development of the stored energy modulation approach
   along with circuit simulation, experimental results and comparative
   evaluation of a dc to three phase system example.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies, using a variety of imaging techniques, have shown that
   deafness induces functional plasticity in the brain of adults with
   late-onset deafness, and in children changes the way the auditory brain
   develops. Cross modal plasticity refers to evidence that stimuli of one
   modality (e.g. vision) activate neural regions devoted to a different
   modality (e.g. hearing) that are not normally activated by those
   stimuli. Other studies have shown that multimodal brain networks (such
   as those involved in language comprehension, and the default mode
   network) are altered by deafness, as evidenced by changes in patterns of
   activation or connectivity within the networks. In this paper, we
   summarise what is already known about brain plasticity due to deafness
   and propose that functional near-infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an
   imaging method that has potential to provide prognostic and diagnostic
   information for cochlear implant users. Currently, patient history
   factors account for only 10 \% of the variation in post-implantation
   speech understanding, and very few post-implantation behavioural
   measures of hearing ability correlate with speech understanding. As a
   non-invasive, inexpensive and user-friendly imaging method, fNIRS
   provides an opportunity to study both pre- and post-implantation brain
   function. Here, we explain the principle of fNIRS measurements and
   illustrate its use in studying brain network connectivity and function
   with example data.}},

Title = {{Developing a Chained Fisher Construction Cost Index for a State Highway
   Agency}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2573}},
Pages = {{149-156}},
Abstract = {{Construction cost indexes (CCI) are important to state highway agencies
   (SHA) to provide an indicator of construction cost escalation over time
   and to update old bid cost information to current year pricing. The
   Federal Highway Administration publishes a National Highway Construction
   Cost Index (NHCCI) based upon cost data from several states for SHA to
   use. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation (DOT) uses a CCI to
   measure the changes in purchasing power of their construction dollar
   from one year to the next. Currently, the Wisconsin DOT uses a
   fixed-weight index to compute the CCI for a fixed basket of seven
   construction items. However, the current Wisconsin DOT CCI is subject to
   considerable short-term variation and does not accurately reflect the
   project bid costs that the department is experiencing. This paper
   presents results of a study requested by the Wisconsin DOT to develop an
   approach for calculating a more representative, reliable, and objective
   CCI. The paper presents various approaches to calculating a CCI,
   highlighting their properties and characteristics. The paper also
   outlines the process used to select a representative basket of items to
   calculate the index and outlines the data preparation steps needed to
   improve data quality. The recommended methodology uses a chained,
   two-stage aggregation computation process. This paper compares the newly
   constructed Wisconsin DOT CCI to the old CCI as well as to the NHCCI.
   The impact from selecting different size baskets of items is also
   investigated; it is concluded that a basket containing a representative
   number of items is sufficient to calculate a reliable CCI.}},

Abstract = {{Deep learning algorithms have been shown to perform extremely well on
   many classical machine learning problems. However, recent studies have
   shown that deep learning, like other machine learning techniques, is
   vulnerable to adversarial samples: inputs crafted to force a deep neural
   network (DNN) to provide adversary-selected outputs. Such attacks can
   seriously undermine the security of the system supported by the DNN,
   sometimes with devastating consequences. For example, autonomous
   vehicles can be crashed, illicit or illegal content can bypass content
   filters, or biometric authentication systems can be manipulated to allow
   improper access. In this work, we introduce a defensive mechanism called
   defensive distillation to reduce the effectiveness of adversarial
   samples on DNNs. We analytically investigate the generalizability and
   robustness properties granted by the use of defensive distillation when
   training DNNs. We also empirically study the effectiveness of our
   defense mechanisms on two DNNs placed in adversarial settings. The study
   shows that defensive distillation can reduce effectiveness of sample
   creation from 95\% to less than 0.5\% on a studied DNN. Such dramatic
   gains can be explained by the fact that distillation leads gradients
   used in adversarial sample creation to be reduced by a factor of 10(30).
   We also find that distillation increases the average minimum number of
   features that need to be modified to create adversarial samples by about
   800\% on one of the DNNs we tested.}},

Abstract = {{Selective modification (e.g. defect creation and amorphization) of
   diamond surfaces is of interests for functional diamond-based
   semiconductors and devices. Bombarding the diamond surface with high
   energy radiation sources such as electron, proton, and neutrons,
   however, often result in detrimental defects in deep bulk regions under
   the diamond surface. In this study, we utilized high energy carbon ions
   of 3 MeV to bombard the polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) specimen.
   The resultant microstructure of PDCs was investigated using micro Raman
   spectroscopy. The results show that the carbon bombardment successfully
   created point defects and amorphization in a shallow region of similar
   to 500 nm deep on the diamond surface. The new method has great
   potential to allow diamond-based semiconductor devices to be used in
   numerous applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/polyethylene (PE) nanohybrid
   shish-kebab (NHSK) structure was fabricated and subsequently coated with
   a polydopamine (PDA) layer. This work aims to introduce the nano-sized
   topography and the high biocompatibility of PDA into CNTs to enhance
   cell affinity. The NHSK architecture was fabricated with CNTs and PE via
   a solution crystallization technique. The nanotopology of the
   shish-kebab structure can be tailored by adjusting the PE concentration
   and crystallization time. Moreover, dopamine self-polymerization was
   subsequently utilized to coat a thin and immobilized layer of bioactive
   PDA around the NHSK, which showed enhanced hydrophilicity compared with
   uncoated NHSK scaffolds. Cell assays with fibroblasts demonstrated that
   the nanotopography of the kebab crystals and their dimensions enhanced
   cell attachment and spreading while the PDA functionalization on the
   NHSK scaffolds further facilitated cell adhesion and viability,
   indicating that this study has potential applications in tissue
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{A concept for an eye-safe, semiconductor-based high spectral resolution
   lidar has been developed at the National Center for Atmospheric
   Research. The lidar operates at a wavelength of 780 nm near several
   rubidium absorption peaks. A rubidium vapor cell is used to block
   aerosol backscatter in one channel to provide a molecular backscatter
   measurement for calculating extinction and backscatter ratio (calibrated
   backscatter).
   Laser and optical components around 780 nm are widely developed due to
   the large growth in atomic cooling and trapping of rubidium. Thus this
   instrument can be built largely using mature commercial-off-the-shelf
   parts. The simulation of the conceptual design shown here uses known
   commercial products and suggests that such an instrument could be used
   for quantitative profiling of the lower troposphere.}},

Abstract = {{Surface roughness is description of the surface micro topography of
   randomness or irregular. The standard deviation of surface height and
   the surface correlation length describe the statistical variation for
   the random component of a surface height relative to a reference
   surface. When the number of data points is large, calculation of surface
   roughness parameters is time-consuming. With the advent of Graphics
   Processing Unit (GPU) architectures, inherently parallel problem can be
   effectively solved using GPUs. In this paper we propose a GPU-based
   massively parallel computing method for 2D bare soil surface roughness
   estimation. This method was applied to the data collected by the surface
   roughness tester based on the laser triangulation principle during the
   field experiment in April 2012. The total number of data points was
   52,040. It took 47 seconds on a Fermi GTX 590 GPU whereas its serial CPU
   version took 5422 seconds, leading to a significant 115x speedup.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric lidar observations provide a unique capability to directly
   observe the vertical profile of cloud and aerosol scattering properties
   and have proven to be an important capability for the atmospheric
   science community. For this reason NASA and ESA have put a major
   emphasis on developing both space and ground based lidar instruments.
   Measurement noise (solar background and detector noise) has proven to be
   a significant limitation and is typically reduced by temporal and
   vertical averaging. This approach has significant limitations as it
   results in significant reduction in the spatial information and can
   introduce biases due to the non-linear relationship between the signal
   and the retrieved scattering properties. This paper investigates a new
   approach to de-noising and retrieving cloud and aerosol backscatter
   properties from lidar observations that leverages a technique developed
   for medical imaging to de-blur and de-noise images; the accuracy is
   defined as the error between the true and inverted photon rates. Hence
   non-linear bias errors can be mitigated and spatial information can be
   preserved.}},

Abstract = {{Photosynthetic cells make major contributions to many important
   processes on this planet, including solar energy capture, nitrogen or
   carbon dioxide sequestration and production of useful biocommodities.
   The sheer number of photosynthetic cells also makes them significant
   contributors to global nutrient cycling, especially in aquatic
   ecosystems. For each of these activities, photosynthetic cells need
   efficient systems for production and distribution of reducing power
   among the myriad of cellular pathways that depend on reductant. This
   chapter focuses on the partitioning of reductant in purple nonsulfur
   photosynthetic bacteria. It summarizes known membrane and cytoplasmic
   enzymes and pathways that need the reductant produced via photochemical
   activity (quinol in these organisms). These observations illustrate that
   quinol is used to provide reducing power to a variety of crucial
   processes (cellular biosynthesis, maintenance of a proton motive force)
   and key assimilatory pathways (carbon dioxide and nitrogen fixation),
   depending on the availability of nutrients. We also summarize data
   illustrating that cells use a variety of pathways to recycle excess
   reductant. Finally, we illustrate how the recent use of genomic and
   computational approaches to the analysis of these and other
   photosynthetic organisms has provided testable predictions and
   considerable new insight into the partitioning of reductant that is
   produced from solar energy capture.}},

Abstract = {{The number of ac drives present in the power systems of most industrial
   facilities has shown a significant increase in the past 3 decades,
   taking an important percentage of the total power demand. Two options to
   produce energy savings on these drives is the use of an optimized flux
   level, and the operation with reduced switching frequency.
   Paper reports the development of a complete loss model for vector
   controlled low-voltage ac drives, which includes all converter and motor
   loss components. Using this loss model, an algorithm is implemented to
   run detailed loss evaluations in the entire constant-torque zone. Four
   ac drives of 4 kW, 11 kW, 55 kW and 110 kW are evaluated considering
   switching frequencies of 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz and 8 kHz. Results confirm
   that reducing the switching frequency from 8 kHz to 2 kHz produce
   interesting power savings, while keeping a low level of harmonic content
   and a safe operation of the ac drive.}},

Abstract = {{Structures undergoing large amplitude deformations usually include
   nonlinear strain-displacement relationships defining a geometric
   nonlinearity. This type of nonlinearity can be observed in structures
   with fixed boundary conditions where mid-plane stretching occurs at
   large deflections. When considering the dynamic response of the
   structure under these circumstances, the once uncoupled linear normal
   modes become coupled at large response amplitudes changing the
   characteristic deformation shape as the fundamental frequency of
   vibration changes. Therefore, the development of nonlinear reduced order
   models to predict the dynamic response of such structures should account
   for any potential coupling between the linear normal modes. In this
   context, a structures' nonlinear normal modes provide a compact
   characterization of modal coupling in the structural response in
   nonlinear regimes. This work uses experimentally measured and
   numerically calculated nonlinear normal modes for a curved axi-symmetric
   perforated plate to build a nonlinear reduced order model and gain
   insight to the underlying modal coupling. A comparison is made between
   two models and corresponding experimental structures to assess the
   model's ability to describe the modal coupling.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced order modeling of geometrically nonlinear structures has gained
   significant attention over the recent years due to its ability to reduce
   detailed finite element models into computationally efficient yet
   accurate models. The reduced order models (ROMs) generated can be used
   to compute the nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) of a structure which serve
   as a metric to determine the accuracy of the reduced order models; if
   the NNMs are reproduced accurately then the response to various inputs
   can also be shown to be accurate. A majority of work has been focused on
   flat structures while relatively few works have focused on curved
   structures, those that have, suggested that these structures may
   introduce complexities to the system. This paper will provide a criteria
   for selecting basis vectors and load amplitudes for generating accurate
   ROMs for a curved beam, where softening nonlinearity and snap through
   are significant. Two methods will be considered: implicit condensation
   and expansion (ICE) and enforced displacements (ED). A framework for
   mode selection, load scaling factors and model sensitivity testing will
   be presented in order to accurately compute the NNMs.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the development of a reduced-order nonlinear dynamic
   phasor modeling tool for distribution networks containing a large number
   of P-f and Q-v droop-controlled inverters. Attention is focused on
   constructing reduced-order models that accurately predict the nonlinear
   behavior of coherent clusters of droop-controlled inverters in response
   to a large disturbance, such as an asymmetric fault. In such a scenario,
   dynamic phasor models are shown to offer valuable insights into how the
   signal conditioning associated with local power measurement can have a
   significant effect on the large-signal stability of a droop-controlled
   inverter or inverter cluster. An algorithm conventionally used to
   identify coherent groups of synchronous generators is adopted for the
   investigation of coherency between large numbers of droop-controlled
   inverters within a distribution network. The coherency results help
   guide the aggregation of droop-controlled inverters and enable nonlinear
   reduced-order dynamic phasor modeling. For large disturbances, a
   reduced-order dynamic phasor simulation of a 50-inverter system is
   validated against full-order simulation results obtained using an

Abstract = {{Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy that exploits historical
   correlation between stocks to achieve statistical arbitrage. Existing
   pairs-trading algorithms in the literature require rather restrictive
   assumptions on the underlying stochastic stock-price processes and the
   so-called spread function. In contrast to existing literature, we
   consider an algorithm for pairs trading which requires less restrictive
   assumptions than heretofore considered. Since our point of view is
   control theoretic in nature, the analysis and results are
   straightforward to follow by a non-expert in finance. To this end, we
   describe a general pairs-trading algorithm which allows the user to
   define a rather arbitrary spread function which is used in a feedback
   context to modify the investment levels dynamically over time. When this
   function, in combination with the price process, satisfies a certain
   mean-reversion condition, we deem the stocks to be a tradeable pair. For
   such a case, we prove that our control-inspired trading algorithm
   results in positive expected growth in account value. Finally, we
   describe tests of our algorithm on historical trading data by fitting
   stock price pairs to a popular spread function used in literature.
   Simulation results from these tests demonstrate robust growth while
   avoiding huge drawdowns.}},

Title = {{Interactions Between Fe(III)-Oxides and Fe(III)-Phyllosilicates During
   Microbial Reduction 1: Synthetic Sediments}},
Journal = {{GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Fe(III)-oxides and Fe(III)-bearing phyllosilicates are the two major
   iron sources utilized as electron acceptors by dissimilatory
   iron-reducing bacteria (DIRB) in anoxic soils and sediments. Although
   there have been many studies on microbial Fe(III)-oxide and
   Fe(III)-phyllosilicate reduction with both natural and specimen
   materials, no controlled experimental information is available on the
   interaction between these two phases when both are available for
   microbial reduction. In this study, the model DIRB Geobacter
   sulfurreducens was used to examine the pathways of Fe(III) reduction in
   Fe(III)-oxide stripped subsurface sediment that was coated with
   different amounts of synthetic high surface area (HSA) goethite.
   Cryogenic (12K) Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy was used to determine
   changes in the relative abundances of Fe(III)-oxide,
   Fe(III)-phyllosilicate, and phyllosilicate-associated Fe(II)
   {[}Fe(II)-phyllosilicate] in bioreduced samples. Analogous Mossbauer
   analyses were performed on samples from abiotic Fe(II) sorption
   experiments in which sediments were exposed to a quantity of exogenous
   soluble Fe(II) (FeCl(2)2H(2)O) comparable to the amount of Fe(II)
   produced during microbial reduction. A Fe partitioning model was
   developed to analyze the fate of Fe(II) and assess the potential for
   abiotic Fe(II)-catalyzed reduction of Fe(III)-phyllosilicates. The
   microbial reduction experiments indicated that although reduction of
   Fe(III)-oxide accounted for virtually all of the observed bulk Fe(III)
   reduction activity, there was no significant abiotic electron transfer
   between oxide-derived Fe(II) and Fe(III)-phyllosilicatesilicates, with
   26-87\% of biogenic Fe(II) appearing as sorbed Fe(II) in the
   Fe(II)-phyllosilicate pool. In contrast, the abiotic Fe(II) sorption
   experiments showed that 41 and 24\% of the added Fe(II) engaged in
   electron transfer to Fe(III)-phyllosilicate surfaces in synthetic
   goethite-coated and uncoated sediment. Differences in the rate of Fe(II)
   addition and system redox potential may account for the microbial and
   abiotic reaction systems. Our experiments provide new insight into
   pathways for Fe(III) reduction in mixed
   Fe(III)-oxide/Fe(III)-phyllosilicate assemblages, and provide key
   mechanistic insight for interpreting microbial reduction experiments and
   field data from complex natural soils and sediments.}},

Abstract = {{It is not known whether computerized cognitive assessments, like the
   CogState battery, are sensitive to preclinical cognitive changes or
   pathology in people at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In 469 late
   middle-aged participants from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's
   Prevention (mean age 63.8 +/- 7 years at testing; 67\% female; 39\%
   APOE4+), we examined relationships between a CogState abbreviated
   battery (CAB) of seven tests and demographic characteristics,
   traditional paper-based neuropsychological tests as well as a composite
   cognitive impairment index, cognitive impairment status (determined by
   consensus review), and biomarkers for amyloid and tau (CSF
   phosphorylated-tau/A beta(42) and global PET-PiB burden) and neural
   injury (CSF neurofilament light protein). CSF and PET-PiB were collected
   in n = 71 and n = 91 participants, respectively, approximately four
   years prior to CAB testing. For comparison, we examined three
   traditional tests of delayed memory in parallel. Similar to studies in
   older samples, the CAB was less influenced by demographic factors than
   traditional tests. CAB tests were generally correlated with most
   paper-based cognitive tests examined and mapped onto the same cognitive
   domains. Greater composite cognitive impairment index was associated
   with worse performance on all CAB tests. Cognitively impaired
   participants performed significantly worse compared to normal controls
   on all but one CAB test. Poorer One Card Learning test performance was
   associated with higher levels of CSF phosphorylated-tau/A beta(42).
   These results support the use of the CogState battery as measures of
   early cognitive impairment in studies of people at risk for AD.}},

Abstract = {{Compressive sensing (CS) is applied to enable real time data
   transmission in a wireless sensor network by significantly reduce the
   local computation and sensor data volume that needs to be transmitted
   over wireless channels to a remote fusion center. By exploiting the
   sparse structure of commonly used signals in Wireless Sensor Network
   (WSN) applications, a Compressed Sensing on WSN (CS-WSN) framework is
   proposed. This is accomplished by (i) random sub-sampling of data
   collected at sensor node, (ii) transmitting only the sign-bit of the
   data samples over wireless channels. It is shown that this CS-WSN
   framework is capable of delivering similar performance as conventional
   local data compression method while greatly reduce the data volume and
   local computation. This proposed scheme is validated using a prototype
   wireless sensor network test bed. Preliminary experimental results
   clearly validate the superior performance of this proposed scheme.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON OPTIMIZATION}},

Pages = {{1147-1173}},
Abstract = {{Signomial programs (SPs) are optimization problems specified in terms of
   signomials, which are weighted sums of exponentials composed with linear
   functionals of a decision variable. SPs are nonconvex optimization
   problems in general, and families of NP-hard problems can be reduced to
   SPs. In this paper we describe a hierarchy of convex relaxations to
   obtain successively tighter lower bounds of the optimal value of SPs.
   This sequence of lower bounds is computed by solving increasingly
   larger-sized relative entropy optimization problems, which are convex
   programs specified in terms of linear and relative entropy functions.
   Our approach relies crucially on the observation that the relative
   entropy function, by virtue of its joint convexity with respect to both
   arguments, provides a convex parametrization of certain sets of globally
   nonnegative signomials with efficiently computable nonnegativity
   certificates via the arithmetic-geometric-mean inequality. By appealing
   to representation theorems from real algebraic geometry, we show that
   our sequences of lower bounds converge to the global optima for broad
   classes of SPs. Finally, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   methods via numerical experiments.}},

   droplets}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{8781-8789}},
Abstract = {{We report on the internal configurations of aqueous dispersions of
   droplets of cholesteric liquid crystals (LCs; 5-50 mu m-in-diameter;
   comprised of 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl and
   4-(1-methylheptyloxycarbonyl)-phenyl-4-hexyloxybenzoate) and their
   influence on the positioning of surface-adsorbed colloids (0.2 or 1
   mm-in-diameter polystyrene (PS)). When N = 2D/P was less than 4, where D
   is the droplet diameter and P is the cholesteric pitch, the droplets
   adopted a twisted bipolar structure (TBS) and colloids were observed to
   assume positions at either the poles or equator of the droplets. A
   statistical analysis of the distribution of locations of the colloids
   revealed a potential well of depth 2.7 k(B)T near the equator, a
   conclusion that was supported by computer simulations performed via the
   minimization of the Landau-de Gennes free energy (well depth of 7 k(B)T
   from simulation). In contrast, for N > 4, a majority of the droplets
   exhibited a radial spherical structure (RSS) characterized by a pair of
   closely spaced surface defects (angle of separation with respect to the
   center of the droplet theta < 5 degrees) connected by a disclination
   winding to/from the droplet center, which led to the positioning of
   pairs of colloids with well-defined spacing at these surface defects.
   The separation of the pairs of surface-adsorbed colloids was colloid
   size-dependent, ranging from 1.11 +/- 0.04 mu m for 1 mu m-in-diameter
   colloids to 1.7 +/- 0.2 mu m for 200 nm-in-diameter colloids. We also
   observed long-lived metastable configurations in which the two surface
   point defects were separated by much larger distances (corresponding to
   populations with angles of theta = 20 +/- 10 degrees and 85 +/- 101 with
   respect to the center), and observed these pairs of defects to also
   position pairs of colloids. A third configuration, the diametrical
   spherical structure (DSS) was also observed. Consistent with the
   predictions of computer simulations, we found experimentally that the
   DSS is indeed composed of disconnected defect rings positioned along the
   diameter of the droplet. Overall, these results reveal that the rich
   palette of defects exhibited by confined cholesteric LC systems
   (equilibrium and metastable) provide the basis of a versatile class of
   templates that enable the surface positioning of colloids in ways that
   are not possible with achiral LC droplets.}},

   Asphalt Binders}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2574}},
Pages = {{28-37}},
Abstract = {{Oxidative aging causes hardening of asphalt binders and, consequently,
   contributes to the deterioration of asphalt pavements. The principal
   cause of asphalt aging and embrittlement in service is the atmospheric
   oxidation of molecules with the formation of highly polar and strongly
   interacting functional groups containing oxygen. Therefore, aging is a
   complex process in unmodified asphalt binders, and the complexity
   increases for modified binders. The dynamics of world resource economics
   suggest that the asphalt pavement industry should be exploring
   economically and environmentally sustainable approaches to development,
   such as the addition of recycled oils to the base asphalt binder, and
   thus research activities are noteworthy in this area. The effect of oil
   and polymer modification on asphalt binder rheology and oxidative aging
   has become a popular topic for research in recent years. However, the
   effects of oil and polymers are often studied independently. The
   objective of this study was to investigate the modification effects of
   bio-oil, re-refined wasted engine oil, polymers, and the interaction
   between polymers and oil on the aging susceptibility of asphalt binders.
   After laboratory accelerated aging procedures were conducted, dynamic
   shear rheometer and bending beam rheometer tests were used for the
   rheological performance evaluation. Gel permeation chromatography and
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to verify the
   rheological results with chemical analysis tools. Results indicate that
   the aging susceptibility of modified asphalt binders is dependent on
   modification chemistry. Certain polymers and combinations of polymers
   with oil can reduce the base asphalt binder's susceptibility to aging.}},

Abstract = {{Deep learning takes advantage of large datasets and computationally
   efficient training algorithms to outperform other approaches at various
   machine learning tasks. However, imperfections in the training phase of
   deep neural networks make them vulnerable to adversarial samples: inputs
   crafted by adversaries with the intent of causing deep neural networks
   to misclassify. In this work, we formalize the space of adversaries
   against deep neural networks (DNNs) and introduce a novel class of
   algorithms to craft adversarial samples based on a precise understanding
   of the mapping between inputs and outputs of DNNs. In an application to
   computer vision, we show that our algorithms can reliably produce

Abstract = {{Millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communications systems offer a promising
   solution to meeting the increasing data demands on wireless networks.
   Not only do mm-wave systems allow orders of magnitude larger bandwidths,
   they also create a high-dimensional spatial signal space due to the
   small wavelengths, which can be exploited for beamforming and
   multiplexing gains. However, the complexity of digitally processing the
   entire high-dimensional signal is prohibitive. By exploiting the
   inherent channel sparsity in beamspace due to highly directional
   propagation at mm-wave, it is possible to design near-optimal
   transceivers with dramatically lower complexity. In such beamspace MIMO
   systems, it is first necessary to determine the set of beams which
   define the low-dimensional communication subspace. In this paper, we
   address this beam selection problem and introduce a simple power-based
   classifier for determining the beamspace sparsity pattern that
   characterizes the communication subspace. We first introduce a physical
   model for a small cell which will serve as the setting for our analysis.
   We then develop a classifier for the physical model, and show its
   optimality for a class of ideal signals. Finally, we present
   illustrative numerical results and show the feasibility of the
   classifier in mobile settings.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we have built upon our previous discovery of strontium
   vanadate (SrVO3) as a new, low work function electron emission material.
   Using Density Functional Theory methods, we have alloyed pure SrVO3 with
   46 different elements and predicted work function changes from pure
   SrVO3 using the oxygen 2p energy states as a bulk electronic structure
   descriptor. We have shown that bulk doping of SrVO3 is not expected to
   result in a lowered work function. Instead, it is purely by enhancement
   of surface dipoles that Ba, when residing directly at the emitting
   surface, creates an ultra-low predicted work function of just 1.07 eV.
   In addition, thermodynamic phase stability calculations under realistic
   cathode operating conditions demonstrate that small additions of Cr, Mn,
   Fe, and Mo on the SrVO3 B-site may further improve the stability of
   SrVO3 while maintaining its metallic conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Tetrahydropyran-2-methanol undergoes selective C-O-C hydrogenolysis to
   produce 1,6-hexanediol using a bifunctional RhRe (reducible metal with
   an oxophilic promoter) catalyst supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon (VXC)
   with >90\% selectivity. This RhRe/VXC catalyst is stable over 40 h of
   reaction in a continuous flow fixed bed reactor. The hydrogenolysis
   activity of RhRe/VXC is two orders-of-magnitude higher than that of RhRe
   supported on Norit Darco 12X40 activated carbon (NDC). STEM-EDS analysis
   reveals that, compared to the RhRe/VXC catalyst, the Re and Rh component
   metals are segregated on the surface of the low activity RhRe/NDC
   catalyst, suggesting that Rh and Re in close proximity
   ({''}bimetallic{''} particles) are required for an active hydrogenolysis
   catalyst. Differences in metal distribution on the carbon surfaces are,
   in turn, linked to the properties of the carbons: NDC has both a higher
   surface area and surface oxygen content. The low areal density of Rh and
   Re precursors on the high area NDC and/or interactions of the precursors
   with its O functional groups may interfere with the formation of the
   bimetallic species required for an active catalyst.}},

   improving the efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting

   novel 3D p-Si/NiCoSex core/shell nanopillar (NP) array photocathode via
   uniform photo-assisted electrodeposition of NiCoSex electrocatalyst on
   bamboo shoot-like Si NP array back-bones. We demonstrate its enhanced
   PEC performance with a photocurrent density of -37.5 mA cm(-2) at 0 V
   (vs. RHE) under simulated 100 mW cm(-2) (1 Sun) irradiation with an AM
   1.5 G filter, which is the highest value reported for p-type Si
   photocathodes. The synergistic effects of the excellent light harvesting
   of the Si NP array core and the good optical transparency, as well as
   the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the NiCoSex shell, boost the
   production and utilization of photogenerated electrons. The design of
   p-Si/NiCoSex core/shell NP arrays offers a new strategy for preparing

Title = {{An engineered solvent system for sugar production from lignocellulosic
   biomass using biomass derived gamma-valerolactone}},
Journal = {{GREEN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{5756-5763}},
Abstract = {{gamma-Valerolactone (GVL) is a biomass-derived solvent which completely
   solubilizes all fractions of lignocellulosic biomass, leading to the
   recovery of polysaccharides (cellulose and hemicellulose) as soluble
   carbohydrates at high yields (>70\%) without the use of expensive
   reagents, like enzymes and ionic liquids. Biological upgrading of
   carbohydrates to biofuels or bio-based chemicals requires that the
   carbohydrates are separated from GVL. We demonstrate that an engineered
   solvent system consisting of GVL, water and an organic co-solvent is
   mono-phasic at the temperatures used for biomass fractionation (e.g.,
   160 degrees C) and is bi-phasic at lower temperatures (e.g., room
   temperature). The advantage of using this engineered solvent system is
   that the carbohydrates are spontaneously separated from organic solvent
   components into an aqueous hydrolysate stream, thereby avoiding the need
   for expensive and potentially hazardous separation processes, such as
   operation at elevated pressures required for separation using liquid
   CO2. We also show that the organic co-solvent can be selected from an
   array of organic components, leading to a trade-off between the efficacy
   of carbohydrate separation and the `greenness' of the solvent. We show
   further that toluene is a promising co-solvent component, and
   techno-economic analyses of the process, wherein toluene is used as a
   co-solvent, lead to a minimum selling price of ethanol of \$3.10 per
   gallon of gasoline equivalent.}},

Abstract = {{Two-electrode photovoltaically self-charging cells (PSCs) possess
   compact structures for both energy conversion and storage with shared
   electrolyte and electrodes. It remains challenging to develop PSCs that
   are efficient in both energy conversion and storage. In this work, WO3
   center dot H2O nanoplates were synthesized by a modified acid-directed
   hydrothermal process and used to prepare a WO3 center dot H2O/CNTs/PVDF
   composite film for energy storage in PSCs. The method with the
   assistance of polyethylenimine was essential to form smaller sized WO3
   center dot H2O nanoplates, thus larger surface area and higher columbic
   efficiency in cyclic voltammetry tests. Such an electrode composite made
   it more facile to assemble PSCs, which displayed an energy conversion
   efficiency of 2.12\% with simultaneous energy storage of 1.38 C cm(-2).
   Higher Li+ concentration in the electrolyte will be helpful to maintain
   the photocurrent at a larger value during irradiation. A higher
   performance of PSCs can be potentially obtained by optimizing the
   contact of electron collector and pseudocapacitive electrode materials.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{99}},
Pages = {{96518-96526}},
Abstract = {{Fully biobased chemically crosslinked anisotropic carboxymethyl
   cellulose (CMC)/cellulose nanofibril (CNF) aerogels were prepared using
   an environmentally friendly directional freeze-drying method. The
   resulting cellulose aerogels were characterized using various
   techniques. It was found that the CMC/CNF aerogel exhibited a honeycomb
   structure, and thus possessed anisotropic properties. Moreover, the
   fully biobased crosslinked organic aerogel possessed excellent
   mechanical properties based on both compression and three-point bending
   tests. For instance, it exhibited a remarkable compressive modulus (up
   to 10 MPa) along the vertical direction (parallel to the freezing
   direction) as well as a high flexural modulus (up to 54 MPa)
   perpendicular to the freezing direction. The effects of different
   aerogel densities and CNF contents on the mechanical properties of
   CMC/CNF aerogels have been studied. With increasing aerogel density or
   CNF content, the modulus and strength of the CMC/CNF aerogel increased
   in both compression and three-point bending tests. In addition, these
   cellulose aerogels also exhibited relatively low thermal conductivities
   (<54 mW m(-1) K-1). Considering their excellent mechanical properties,
   very low densities, and the ``green{''} synthesis process, these CMC/CNF
   aerogels hold great promise for potential industrial applications such
   as green thermal insulation building materials.}},

Title = {{Work Zone Crash Cost Prediction with a Least Median Squares Linear
   Regression Model}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2555}},
Pages = {{38-45}},
Abstract = {{Traffic safety considerations are an important component of work zone
   design and implementation plans. This study aimed to develop a safety
   estimation approach on the basis of work zone scheduling and
   configuration parameters to help engineers and decision makers during
   the work zone traffic management design stage. This approach has its
   basis in the fusion of multiple years of statewide work zone records,
   work zone-related crash reports, and traffic detection data. First, a
   matching algorithm was used to integrate those data sets to provide
   detailed circumstances of work zone crashes. Second, the actual vehicle
   miles traveled in work zones were calculated and used as the exposure
   measure. The work zone crash costs also were calculated. Third, a least
   median squares linear regression model was used to build the crash cost
   prediction tool on the basis of the work zone configurations and vehicle
   miles traveled. This model was tested, and the results indicated that it
   could accurately predict work zone crash costs. Recommendations for work
   zone scheduling and configuration parameters therefore could be made.
   Although the Wisconsin Lane Closure System work zone configurations are
   used for operational purposes and differ from the ones in the Manual on
   Uniform Traffic Control Devices, other types of work zone configurations
   in similar systems can be incorporated easily into this approach. Thus
   this approach would be easy to adopt for use with the existing traffic
   management plan process as a proactive method to avoid high-risk work
   zone scenarios.}},

Title = {{DIMENSIONAL STABILITY AND FUNGAL DURABILITY OF ACETYLATED WOOD}},
Journal = {{DREWNO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{197}},
Pages = {{139-150}},
Abstract = {{The reaction of wood to acetic anhydride greatly reduces moisture
   sorption and improves the dimensional stability of the wood due to the
   esterification of the accessible hydroxyl groups in the cell wall,
   reducing hydrogen bonding with water and bulking the cell wall back to
   its green volume. The sorption of both primary and secondary water are
   reduced. Dimensional stability is not 100\% since the water molecule is
   smaller than the acetyl group, therefore water can access hydroxyl sites
   even when the wood is fully acetylated. The equilibrium moisture content
   is reduced in a linear relationship to the level of acetyl content. This
   means that the reduction in moisture content is not dependent on where
   the acetylation reaction takes place in the cell wall. Resistance to
   fungal attack increases as the level of acetylation increases.
   Resistance to attack by white-rot fungus occurs at a much lower level of
   acetylation (7-10\%) than that to brown-rot fungal attack (17-19\%). The
   cell wall moisture content may be too low at high levels of acetylation
   to support fungal attack, therefore initial colonization does not take
   place.}},

Abstract = {{Application of the principles of metrology for the NASA Climate Absolute
   Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) infrared high spectral
   resolution measurements is presented, starting with the use of a
   Standard International (SI) reference source on orbit, developing
   uncertainty traceability for intercalibration to other spaceborne
   sensors, and finally tracing the direct effects of radiance uncertainty
   on climate products originating from state parameter retrievals. The
   Absolute Radiance Interferometer (ARI) IR prototype employs an On-orbit
   Absolute Radiance Standard (OARS), developed under the NASA Instrument
   Incubator Program for CLARREO, for on-orbit calibration verification to
   better than 0.1 K 3-sigma. The OARS consists of a variable temperature,
   high emissivity blackbody with temperature calibration established to
   better than 16 mK on-orbit and provision for on-orbit emissivity
   monitoring. The temperature scale is established using miniature melt
   cells of Ga, H2O, and Hg. Transferring the high accuracy of ARI
   measurements to other IR instruments, especially the high spectral
   resolution operational sounders (AIRS, CrIS and IASI), is an important
   objective of CLARREO. The mathematical approach to rigorous traceability
   of sampling uncertainties is explained and applied in simulations of the
   intercalibration process. Results show that it will be possible to make
   intercomparisons of better than 0.05 K 3-sigma with just 6 months of
   observations from a single CLARREO in true polar orbit. Finally, the
   effects of radiance perturbations representing realistic uncertainties
   (for the CrIS on Suomi NPP) on retrieved temperature and water vapor
   profiles are evaluated. The results demonstrate a stable, physically
   reasonable impact of Dual regression retrievals.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale silver has been incorporated into a variety of products where
   its antimicrobial properties enhance their functionality. One particular
   application is hospital linens, potential vectors of disease
   transmission. There is an on-going debate as to whether it is more
   beneficial to use disposable versus reusable hospital gowns in efforts
   to prevent nosocomial infections. This work models the life cycle
   impacts of nanoscale silver (nAg)-enabled, reusable hospital gowns from
   a life cycle assessment perspective and then compares the midpoint
   environmental impact data to the use of disposable hospital gowns. A key
   finding of this work is the environmental parity (when the environmental
   impact of nAg and disposable gowns are equal) of a nAg-enabled gown is
   12 wearings. These results suggest that nAg textiles may be key in
   reducing the environmental impact of hospitals, while still preventing
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{This letter presents a compact planar flexible antenna designed for
   wireless local area network (WLAN) using simple microfabrication
   techniques that are compatible with existing state-of-the-art flexible
   electronic devices. The antenna is fully insulated with biocompatible
   Parylene C film, which shows a cost-effective and highly feasible
   approach to making flexible antennas for implantable applications.
   Coating of ultrathin Parylene C film has shown negligible effects on the
   return loss and the radiation patterns of the antennas. The
   characteristics of the proposed antenna have also shown negligible
   change under different bending conditions. The original WLAN antenna

Title = {{Dmp1 Null Mice Develop a Unique Osteoarthritis-like Phenotype}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{1203-1212}},
Abstract = {{Patients with hypophosphatemia rickets (including DMP1 mutations)
   develop severe osteoarthritis (OA), although the mechanism is largely
   unknown. In this study, we first identified the expression of DMP1 in
   hypertrophic chondrocytes using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and X-gal
   analysis of Dmp1-knockout-lacZ-knockin heterozygous mice. Next, we
   characterized the OA-like phenotype in Dmp1 null mice from 7-week-old to
   one-year-old using multiple techniques, including X-ray, micro-CT, H\&E
   staining, Goldner staining, scanning electronic microscopy, IHC assays,
   etc. We found a classical OA-like phenotype in Dmp1 null mice such as
   articular cartilage degradation, osteophyte formation, and subchondral
   osteosclerosis. These Dmp1 null mice also developed unique pathological
   changes, including a biphasic change in their articular cartilage from
   the initial expansion of hypertrophic chondrocytes at the age of 1-month
   to a quick diminished articular cartilage layer at the age of 3-months.
   Further, these null mice displayed severe enlarged knees and poorly
   formed bone with an expanded osteoid area. To address whether DMP1 plays
   a direct role in the articular cartilage, we deleted Dmp1 specifically
   in hypertrophic chondrocytes by crossing the Dmp1-loxP mice with Col X
   Cre mice. Interestingly, these conditional knockout mice didn't display
   notable defects in either the articular cartilage or the growth plate.
   Because of the hypophosphatemia remained in the entire life span of the
   Dmp1 null mice, we also investigated whether a high phosphate diet would
   improve the OA-like phenotype. A 8-week treatment of a high phosphate
   diet significantly rescued the OA-like defect in Dmp1 null mice,
   supporting the critical role of phosphate homeostasis in maintaining the
   healthy joint morphology and function. Taken together, this study
   demonstrates a unique OA-like phenotype in Dmp1 null mice, but a lack of
   the direct impact of DMP1 on chondrogenesis. Instead, the regulation of
   phosphate homeostasis by DMP1 via the axis of ``FGF23-renal phosphorus
   reabsorption{''} is vital for maintaining a healthy joint.}},

Abstract = {{Key performance indicators (KPIs) are critical for manufacturing
   operation management and continuous improvement (CI). In modern
   manufacturing systems, KPIs are defined as a set of metrics to reflect
   operation performance, such as efficiency, throughput, availability,
   from productivity, quality and maintenance perspectives. Through
   continuous monitoring and measurement of KPIs, meaningful quantification
   and identification of different aspects of operation activities can be
   obtained, which enable and direct CI efforts. A set of 34 KPIs has been
   introduced in ISO 22400. However, the KPIs in a manufacturing system are
   not independent, and they may have intrinsic mutual relationships. The
   goal of this paper is to introduce a multi-level structure for
   identification and analysis of KPIs and their intrinsic relationships in
   production systems. Specifically, through such a hierarchical structure,
   we define and layer KPIs into levels of basic KPIs, comprehensive KPIs
   and their supporting metrics, and use it to investigate the
   relationships and dependencies between KPIs. Such a study can provide a
   useful tool for manufacturing engineers and managers to measure and
   utilize KPIs for CI.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{21, SI}},
Pages = {{6579-6593}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a statistical monitoring scheme for
   multivariate count data. In many applications involving multivariate
   count data, individual variables are not only correlated to each other,
   but also over-dispersed. Traditional statistical monitoring methods for
   multivariate count data that assume simple statistical models fail to
   fit the data collected when the underlying process is under normal
   working state, also referred to as the in-control state. Therefore, we
   propose a monitoring scheme which is based on the Poisson-multivariate
   Gaussian mixed model. Although such models are quite flexible, efficient
   statistical monitoring schemes for such models have not been developed.
   In this paper, we develop likelihood ratio test-based monitoring schemes
   that are shown to be superior to standard multivariate statistical
   monitoring schemes. The key challenge in developing likelihood ratio
   test for the Poisson-multivariate Gaussian mixed models is that the
   likelihood function can only be calculated by multidimensional numerical
   integration. We tackle this issue using an approximation of this complex
   likelihood function.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},

Abstract = {{Freeway traffic state information from multiple sources provides
   sufficient support to the traffic surveillance but also brings
   challenges. This paper made an investigation into the fusion of a new
   data combination from cellular handoff probe system and microwave
   sensors. And a fusion method based on the neural network technique was
   proposed. To identify the factors influencing the accuracy of fusion
   results, we analyzed the sensitivity of those factors by changing the
   inputs of neural- network- based fusion model. The results showed that
   handoff link length and sample size were identified as the most
   influential parameters to the precision of fusion. Then, the
   effectiveness and capability of proposed fusion method under various
   traffic conditions were evaluated. And a comparative analysis between
   the proposed method and other fusion approaches was conducted. The
   results of simulation test and evaluation showed that the fusion method
   could complement the drawback of each collection method, improve the
   overall estimation accuracy, adapt to the variable traffic condition
   (free flow or incident state), suit the fusion of data from cellphone
   probes and fixed sensors, and outperform other fusion methods.}},

Abstract = {{The Simons Array is a next generation cosmic microwave background (CMB)
   polarization experiment whose science target is a precision measurement
   of the B-mode polarization pattern produced both by inflation and by
   gravitational lensing. As a continuation and extension of the successful
   POL ARBEAR experimental program, the Simons Array will consist of three
   cryogenic receivers each featuring multichroic bolometer arrays mounted
   onto separate 3.5m telescopes. The first of these, also called
   POLARBEAR-2A, will be the first to deploy in late 2016 and has a large
   diameter focal plane consisting of dual-polarization dichroic pixels
   sensitive at 95 GHz and 150 GHz. The POLARBEAR-2A focal plane will
   utilize 7,588 antenna-coupled superconducting transition edge sensor
   (TES) bolometers read out with SQUID amplifiers using frequency domain
   multiplexing techniques. The next two receivers that will make up the
   Simons Array will be nearly identical in overall design but will feature
   extended frequency capability. The combination of high sensitivity,
   multichroic frequency coverage and large sky area available from our
   mid-latitude Chilean observatory will allow Simons Array to produce high
   quality polarization sky maps over a wide range of angular scales and to
   separate out the CMB B-modes from other astrophysical sources with high
   fidelity. After accounting for galactic foreground separation, the
   Simons Array will detect the primordial gravitational wave B-mode signal
   to r > 0.01 with a significance of > 5a and will constrain the sum of
   neutrino masses to 40 meV (lo-) when cross-correlated with galaxy
   surveys. We present the current status of this funded experiment, its
   future, and discuss its projected science return.}},

Journal = {{OPTIK}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{127}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{10389-10398}},
Abstract = {{A new regime of chaotic flows is explored in which one of the variables
   has the freedom of offset boosting. By a single introduced constant, the
   DC offset of the variable can be boosted to any level, and therefore the
   variable can switch between a bipolar signal and a unipolar signal
   according to the constant. This regime of chaotic flows is convenient
   for chaos applications since it can reduce the number of components
   required for signal conditioning. Offset boosting can be combined with
   amplitude control to achieve the full range of linear transformations of
   the signal. The symmetry of the variable-boostable system may be
   destroyed by the new introduced boosting controller; however, a
   different symmetry is obtained that preserves any existing
   multistability. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier GmbH.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale sorption is a promising strategy for catalyst and purification
   system design. In this paper, cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) were densely
   attached with aldehyde functional groups on the surface via a mild
   periodate oxidation process, and then applied as mesoporous sorbents to
   remove Cu(II) and Pb(II) from aqueous solutions. In the studied
   concentration range (0.6-1.0 mmol L-1), a removal capacity of 0.75 mmol
   g(-1) for Pb(II) and 0.58 mmol g(-1) for Cu(II) was obtained. It is
   higher than most reported results over a much broader concentration
   range. Furthermore, the physical chemistry of the sorption process was
   studied in terms of sorption kinetics, sorption isotherm study and
   thermodynamic study. The results showed that the sorption process is
   under the combined influences of reaction kinetics, film diffusion and
   intraparticle diffusion, and follows the Langmuir model of monolayer
   adsorption. The sorption is spontaneous and endothermic. This
   development demonstrates an ecofriendly and cost-effective method with
   high level effectiveness of metal ion removal.}},

Abstract = {{Most compressive imaging architectures rely on programmable
   light-modulators to obtain coded linear measurements of a signal. As a
   consequence, the properties of the light modulator place fundamental
   limits on the cost, performance, practicality, and capabilities of the
   compressive camera. For example, the spatial resolution of the single
   pixel camera is limited to that of its light modulator, which is seldom
   greater than 4 megapixels. In this paper, we describe a novel approach
   to compressive imaging that avoids the use of spatial light modulator.
   In its place, we use novel cylindrical optics and a rotation gantry to
   directly sample the Radon transform of the image focused on the sensor
   plane. We show that the reconstruction problem is identical to sparse
   tomographic recovery and we can leverage the vast literature in
   compressive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to good effect.
   The proposed design has many important advantages over existing
   compressive cameras. First, we can achieve a resolution of N x N pixels
   using a sensor with N photodetectors; hence, with commercially available
   SWIR line-detectors with 10k pixels, we can potentially achieve spatial
   resolutions of 100 megapixels, a capability that is unprecedented.
   Second, our design is scalable more gracefully across wavebands of light
   since we only require sensors and optics that are optimized for the
   wavelengths of interest; in contrast, spatial light modulators like DMDs
   require expensive coatings to be effective in non-visible wavebands.
   Third, we can exploit properties of line-detectors including electronic
   shutters and pixels with large aspect ratios to optimize light
   throughput. On the flip side, a drawback of our approach is the need for
   moving components in the imaging architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Many engineered structures are assembled using different kinds of joints
   such as bolted, riveted and clamped joints. Even if joints are often a
   small part of the overall structure, they can have a massive impact on
   its dynamics due to the introduction of nonlinearities. Thus, joints are
   considered a design liability. Significant effort has been spent in
   joint characterization and modelling, but a predictive joint model is
   still non-existent. To overcome these uncertainties and ensure certain
   safety standards, joints are usually overdesigned according to static
   considerations and their stiffness. Especially damping and nonlinearity
   are not considered during the design process. This can lead to lower
   performance, lower payload, and as result of the joints structural
   dynamic models often do a poor job of predicting the dynamic response.
   However, it is well-known that, particularly for metal structures,
   joints represent the main source of energy dissipation. In this work a
   minimal model is used to show how structural performance can be improved
   using joints as a design variable. Common optimization tools are applied
   to a nonlinear joint model in order to damp undesired structural
   vibrations. Results illustrate how the intentional choice of joint
   parameters and locations can effectively reduce vibration level for a
   given operating point of a jointed structure.}},

Title = {{RECALIBRATION METHODOLOGY TO COMPENSATE FOR CHANGING FLUID PROPERTIES IN
   AN INDIVIDUAL NOZZLE DIRECT INJECTION SYSTEM}},
Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{847-859}},
Abstract = {{Limited advancement of direct injection pesticide application systems
   has been made in recent years, which has hindered further
   commercialization of this technology. One approach to solving the lag
   and mixing issues typically associated with injection-based systems is
   high-pressure individual nozzle injection. However, accurate monitoring
   of the chemical concentrate flow rate can pose a challenge due to the
   high pressure, low flow, and changing viscosities of the fluid. A
   methodology was developed for recalibrating high-pressure chemical
   concentrate injectors to compensate for fluid property variations and
   evaluate the performance of this technique for operating injectors in an
   open-loop configuration. Specific objectives were to (1) develop a
   method for continuous recalibration of the chemical concentrate
   injectors to ensure accurate metering of chemicals of varying
   viscosities and (2) evaluate the recalibration method for estimating
   individual injector flow rates from a system of multiple injectors to
   assess potential errors. Test results indicated that the recalibration
   method was able to compensate for changes in fluid kinematic viscosity
   (e.g., from temperature changes and/or product variation). Errors were
   less than 3.4\% for the minimum injector duty cycle (DCi) (at 10\%) and
   dropped 0.2\% for the maximum DCi (at 90\%) for temperature changes of
   up to 20 degrees C. While larger temperature changes may be expected,
   these test results showed that the proposed method could be successfully
   implemented to meet desired injection rates. Because multiple injectors
   would be used in commercial deployment of this technology, a method was
   developed to calculate the desired injector flow rate using initial
   injector calibration factors. Using this multi-injector recalibration
   method, errors ranged from 0.23\% to 0.66\% between predicted and actual
   flow rates for all three injectors.}},

Title = {{Analysis of Rear-End Collisions at Roundabout Approaches}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2585}},
Pages = {{29-38}},
Abstract = {{Roundabouts are common alternatives to stop- and signal-controlled
   intersections and have grown in popularity in response to the promise to
   reduce traffic crash severity at intersections. In Wisconsin, more than
   300 roundabouts have been installed. Studies of these intersections have
   found a 38\% reduction in fatal and injury crashes. However, a 12\%
   overall increase also was found, and this finding is not unique to
   Wisconsin. An increase in less-serious crashes can lead to a negative
   public perception about roundabout benefits. The causes of rear-end
   collisions (a common type of low-severity crash) were examined. Four
   years of crash reports from 55 roundabouts were analyzed along with the
   geometric conditions of the roundabouts. The 16- to 24-year-old driver
   age group represented a significantly higher proportion of involvement
   in rear-end collisions than in total crashes across the state. Negative
   binomial models were created for roundabout approaches. For combined
   one-lane and multilane roundabout approaches, annual average daily
   traffic, sawtooth pavement markings, and high deflection angles were
   significantly correlated with an increase in the expected number of
   rear-end collisions, and wider entry was significantly correlated with a
   decrease in the expected number of rear-end collisions. For one-lane
   approaches, ``Yield{''} pavement markings led to an expected reduction
   in crashes, as did the presence of horizontal curves within 250 feet of
   a roundabout. These findings reflect the complexity of driving at
   roundabout approaches, especially for younger drivers. Results also
   indicate the importance of proper pavement markings at approaches.}},

Title = {{Statistical Analysis for Assessing Highway Maintenance Level of Service}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2551}},
Pages = {{73-81}},
Abstract = {{Many transportation agencies have a maintenance quality assurance
   program and most use level of service (LOS) to measure the condition of
   highway features or the performance of maintenance services. If the
   necessary condition or performance data cannot be obtained from
   established inventory databases, most agencies use sampling techniques
   to collect what they need. Many agencies may be able to reduce the
   number of samples they collect or greatly improve the precision of the
   condition estimates by employing stratified sampling techniques rather
   than simple random sampling. The analysis of stratified samples depends
   on characteristics of the measure being collected. The most common types
   of measures for estimating LOS for maintenance quality assurance
   programs are simple binomial, domain binomial, and ratios in which the
   LOS scale is based on percentage of inventory in deficient maintenance
   condition. This paper, which is based on NCHRP Project 14-25, presents a
   statistical analysis for estimating the deficiency rate and confidence
   interval. Having an adequate sample size is a challenge for some
   measures. This paper introduces a visual tool for assessing the adequacy
   of the margin of error associated with LOS estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Glycation can change DNA structure and cause strand breaks, mutations,
   and changes in gene expression. DNA damage may also contribute to the
   pathogenesis of some diseases, including cancer, aging, inflammation,
   and neurological disorders. The 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate is a ketone body,
   and is produced in the liver. Here we report the inhibition of
   glucose-mediated DNA glycation by 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate for the first
   time. The effect of 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate on the formation of Amadori
   and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) of DNA incubated with glucose
   for 4 weeks were investigated using various techniques. These included
   UV-vis, circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence spectroscopy, and agarose
   gel electrophoresis. The results of UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy
   demonstrated that DNA-AGE formation was decreased in the presence of
   3-beta-hydroxybutyrate. The NBT test indicated that the Amadori product
   formation of glycated DNA was also reduced in the presence of
   3-beta-hydroxybutyrate. Also, according to CD and agarose gel
   electrophoresis results, the structural change of glycated DNA in the
   presence of 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate was decreased. Thus,
   3-beta-hydroxybutyrate possesses an inhibitory role in DNA glycation and
   can reduce the adverse effects of glycation under high glucose
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This work is the first to present global routing models for capturing
   the impact of local congestion caused by varying-size vias. The models
   are then incorporated to dynamically drive a proposed layer assignment
   algorithm. A typical characteristic of advanced technology nodes is
   significantly-high variation in wire sizes that may exist between
   adjacent metal layers. Routing from a global cell (g-cell) to its top
   metal layer results in using a via which may be up to twice the size of
   unit wire track within that g-cell. This results in significant decrease
   in the available routing tracks that could pass the boundaries of the
   g-cell. Ignoring this issue hampers the effectiveness of traditional
   global routing algorithms due to acting as, now, a significant source of
   mismatch with the detailed routing stage. Based on these observations,
   we propose ``via-aware edge overflow{''} and ``edge-aware via
   overflow{''} models for capturing the impact of both unstacked and
   stacked vias of arbitrary sizes during global routing. Our models can be
   used to drive any layer assignment algorithm and replace the traditional
   edge overflow and via overflow metrics. To show the impact of our
   models, we also incorporate them in a proposed two-stage layer
   assignment algorithm and compare with a competitive layer assignment
   technique. This is also the first work to actually evaluate the impact
   of global routing solutions using a commercial detailed router. In our
   experiments we report less number of DRC violations by only changing the
   layer assignment at global routing, and detailed route using the
   Olympus-SoC of Mentor Graphics.}},

Title = {{A facile and fast method for quantitating lignin in lignocellulosic
   biomass using acidic lithium bromide trihydrate (ALBTH)}},
Journal = {{GREEN CHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{18}},

Pages = {{5367-5376}},
Abstract = {{Lignin quantitation of lignocellulosic biomass is an essential and
   routine assay in the areas of plant chemistry, forage, biomass
   conversion, and pulp \& paper. The two-step sulfuric acid method (or the
   Klason method) is the most widely used protocol for lignin quantitation,
   but the method is a time-consuming and labor-intensive procedure. In
   this study, a facile and quick method was developed to quantitate lignin
   in lignocellulosic biomass. The new method used acidic lithium bromide
   trihydrate (ALBTH, LiBr center dot 3H(2)O) as a reaction medium, which
   was able to quickly and completely dissolve and hydrolyze cellulose and
   hemi-celluloses in the biomass under mild conditions and leave lignin as
   an insoluble residue for gravimetric quantitation. The soluble lignin
   generated in the ALBTH assay was determined by UV spectrophotometry. The
   recommended conditions for the ALBTH method were 60 wt\% LiBr solution
   containing 40 mM HCl, 110 degrees C, and 30 min. The ALBTH method was
   applied to different species of biomass including softwood (Douglas
   fir), hardwood (aspen, poplar, and eucalyptus), and herbage (corn stover
   and switchgrass). The results indicated that the ALBTH method gave a
   comparable lignin (both insoluble and soluble lignin) quantity with the
   Klason method for the biomass investigated. The ALBTH method is a
   one-step procedure and much faster for lignin quantitation (similar to
   30 min) than the Klason method (>3 h). In addition, the ALBTH assay was
   conducted in glass vials under atmospheric pressure, and no autoclave
   was required. The ALBTH method also avoided the potential hazard of
   concentrated sulfuric acid.}},

Title = {{Effects of Cyclic Temperature on the Time-Dependent Behavior of
   Posttensioned Concrete Bridges}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{10}},
Abstract = {{Typically, measurement and analysis of concrete time-dependent behaviors
   such as creep and shrinkage are performed under the assumption of
   constant temperature conditions. However, many structures in the field
   are subject to variable seasonal and daily temperatures. This paper
   explores how changes in temperature affect the time-dependent behavior
   of concrete structures, with a particular focus on posttensioned
   concrete bridges. Temperature-dependent creep, shrinkage, aging, and
   relaxation models were incorporated into structural finite-element
   analyses examining a posttensioned concrete beam under variable thermal
   loading. The impacts of uniform temperature changes on the
   time-dependent deflections, strains, and stresses were accounted for
   using an Arrhenius-adjusted age based on the structure temperature.
   However, nonuniform temperature changes, such as thermal gradients
   through the depth of the cross-section, caused time-dependent behavior
   that could not be accounted for using the Arrhenius-adjusted age based
   on the average structure temperature. Time-dependent vertical
   deflections and especially longitudinal stresses throughout the
   structure were altered by the repeated application of thermal gradients.
   The different creep and shrinkage strain rates through the depth of the
   section, driven by the temperature and stress differences from the
   applied thermal gradients, induced residual stresses. The presence of
   these residual stresses implies that time-dependent stress changes from
   a creep and shrinkage analysis at a constant temperature cannot be
   linearly superimposed with the stresses caused by thermal gradients
   computed using an independent elastic analysis.}},

Title = {{Multimode trip information detection using personal trajectory data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{449-460}},
Abstract = {{Handheld global positioning system (GPS) devices can serve as a new tool
   to collect an individual's trip information with advantages of low cost,
   accurate data, and intensive spatial coverage. Various machine learning
   algorithms have been explored to detected trip train information in
   previous studies; however, few of them focused on the evaluation and
   comparison of the performance and applicability of different models.
   Meanwhile, according to previous studies, car and bus mode detection is
   a thorny issue due to their similar travel characteristics, and
   algorithms still need to be well explored and improved to solve this
   problem. In this article, an innovative method is proposed to detect
   trip information, including trip modes, mode-changing time and location,
   and other attributes, from personal trajectory data. The method is a
   two-step process. A machine learning algorith-based module (including
   artificial neural network, support vector machine, random forests, and
   Bayesian network) is firstly used to identify walk, bicycle, and
   motorized trip modes (bus or car); we thoroughly compared the
   performance of these four algorithms. Then a second module, using
   critical points on the GPS trajectories, is further developed to
   distinguish car and bus mode, incorporated with GIS map information.
   Field test results show that the proposed machine learning models can
   all be applied for walk, bicycle, and motorized mode detection with high
   detection rates exceeding 90\%; however, the algorithms work relatively
   poorly for bus and car mode detection, with results mostly below 75\%.
   The proposed two-step method can greatly improve bus and car mode
   detection accuracy by 14-30\%. As a result, the average mode detection
   rates for all the four modes are above 90\%. Compared with mode
   detection results by using only the machine learning algorithm, the
   proposed two-step method has much better performance in both accuracy
   and consistency.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore providers'
   perspectives on the use of a novel technology, ``Large Customizable
   Interactive Monitor{''} (LCIM), a novel application of the electronic
   health record system implemented in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.
   Methods: We employed a qualitative approach to collect and analyze data
   from pediatric intensive care physicians, pediatric nurse practitioners,
   and acute care specialists. Using semi-structured interviews, we
   collected data from January to April, 2015. The research team analyzed
   the transcripts using an iterative coding method to identify common
   themes.
   Results: Study results highlight contextual data on providers' use
   routines of the LCIM. Findings from thirty six interviews were
   classified into three groups: 1) providers' familiarity with the LCIM;
   2) providers' use routines (i.e. when and how they use it); and 3)
   reasons why they use or do not use it.
   Conclusion: It is important to conduct baseline studies of the use of
   novel technologies. The importance of training and orientation affects
   the adoption and use patterns of this new technology. This study is
   notable for being the first to investigate a LCIM system, a next
   generation system implemented in the pediatric critical care setting.
   Our study revealed this next generation HIT might have great potential
   for family-centered rounds, team education during rounds, and family
   education/engagement in their child's health in the patient room. This
   study also highlights the effect of training and orientation on the
   adoption patterns of new technology.}},

Abstract = {{The simplification of fabrication processes that can define very fine

   very desirable because it is generally very challenging to realize
   submicron scale patterns on flexible substrates. Here we report a
   generic strategy for fabricating high-performance flexible Si
   nanomembrane (Si NM)-based RF thin-film transistors (TFTs) with
   nanoimprint lithography patterned deep-submicron-scale channel lengths
   which can be easily adapted for large-area and high throughput
   roll-to-roll manufacturing processes. A unique etched-channel
   configuration was used to allow for device fabrication compatible with
   flexible substrates. Optimal device parameters were obtained through
   device simulation to understand the underlying device physics and to
   enhance device controllability. Theoretically, the maximum frequency
   (f(max)) of flexible Si NM TFTs can exceed 100 GHz. Experimentally,
   record breaking 5 GHz and 38 GHz f(T) and f(max) values, respectively,

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{The extent to which water uptake influences the light scattering ability
   of marine sea spray aerosol (SSA) particles depends critically on SSA
   chemical composition. The organic fraction of SSA can increase during
   phytoplankton blooms, decreasing the salt content and therefore the
   hygroscopicity of the particles. In this study, subsaturated hygroscopic
   growth factors at 85\% relative humidity (GF(85 \%)) of predominately
   submicron SSA particles were quantified during two induced phytoplankton
   blooms in marine aerosol reference tanks (MARTs). One MART was
   illuminated with fluorescent lights and the other was illuminated with
   sunlight, referred to as the ``indoor{''} and ``outdoor{''} MARTs,
   respectively. Optically weighted GF(85 \%) values for SSA particles were
   derived from measurements of light scattering and particle size
   distributions. The mean optically weighted SSA diameters were 530 and
   570 nm for the indoor and outdoor MARTs, respectively. The GF(85 \%)
   measurements were made concurrently with online particle composition
   measurements, including bulk composition (using an Aerodyne
   high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer) and single particle (using an
   aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer) measurement, and a variety of
   water-composition measurements. During both microcosm experiments, the
   observed optically weighted GF(85 \%) values were depressed
   substantially relative to pure inorganic sea salt by 5 to 15 \%. There
   was also a time lag between GF(85 \%) depression and the peak
   chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations by either 1 (indoor MART) or 3-to-6
   (outdoor MART) days. The fraction of organic matter in the SSA particles
   generally increased after the Chl a peaked, also with a time lag, and
   ranged from about 0.25 to 0.5 by volume. The observed depression in the
   GF(85 \%) values (relative to pure sea salt) is consistent with the
   large observed volume fractions of nonrefractory organic matter (NR-OM)
   comprising the SSA. The GF(85 \%) values exhibited a reasonable negative
   correlation with the SSA NR-OM volume fractions after the peak of the
   blooms (i.e., Chl a maxima); i.e., the GF(85 \%) values generally
   decreased when the NR-OM volume fractions increased. The GF(85 \%) vs.
   NR-OM volume fraction relationship was interpreted using the
   Zdanovskii-Stokes-Robinson (ZSR) mixing rule and used to estimate the

Abstract = {{Measurements of OH reactivity, the inverse lifetime of the OH radical,
   can provide a top-down estimate of the total amount of reactive carbon
   in an air mass. Using a comprehensive measurement suite, we examine the
   measured and modeled OH reactivity above an isoprene-dominated forest in
   the southeast United States during the 2013 Southern Oxidant and Aerosol
   Study (SOAS) field campaign. Measured and modeled species account for
   the vast majority of average daytime reactivity (80-95 \%) and a smaller
   portion of nighttime and early morning reactivity (68-80 \%). The
   largest contribution to total reactivity consistently comes from primary
   biogenic emissions, with isoprene contributing similar to 60\% in the
   afternoon, and similar to 30-40\% at night and monoterpenes contributing
   similar to 15-25\% at night. By comparing total reactivity to the
   reactivity stemming from isoprene alone, we find that similar to 20\% of
   the discrepancy is temporally related to isoprene reactivity, and an
   additional constant similar to 1 s(-1) offset accounts for the remaining
   portion. The model typically overestimates measured OVOC concentrations,
   indicating that unmeasured oxidation products are unlikely to influence
   measured OH reactivity. Instead, we suggest that unmeasured primary
   emissions may influence the OH reactivity at this site.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the structure of the Euler-Lagrange (EL) conditions of a
   long-horizon optimal control problem. The analysis reveals that the
   conditions can be solved by using block Gauss-Seidel (GS) schemes. We
   prove that such schemes can be implemented in the primal space by
   solving sequences of short-horizon optimal control problems. This
   analysis also reveals that a traditional receding-horizon (RH) scheme is
   equivalent to performing a single GS sweep. We have also found that we
   can use adjoint information from a coarse long-horizon problem to
   construct terminal penalties that correct the policies of the RH scheme.
   We observe that this scheme can be interpreted as a hierarchical
   controller in which a coarse high-level controller transfers
   long-horizon information to a low-level, short-horizon controller of
   fine resolution. The results open the door to a new family of
   hierarchical control architectures that can handle multiple time scales
   systematically. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic

Abstract = {{III-V multi-junction solar cells are based on a triple-junction design
   that consists of an InGaP top junction, a GaAs middle junction, and a
   bottom junction that employs either a 1eV material grown on the GaAs
   substrate or InGaAs grown on the Ge substrate. The most promising 1 eV
   materials under extensive investigation are the bulk dilute nitride such
   as InGaAsN(Sb) lattice-matched to GaAs substrate and the dilute-bismide
   quantum well materials, such as GaAsBi, strain-compensated with GaAsP
   barriers. Both approaches have the potential to achieve high performance
   triple-junction solar cells. In addition, space satellite applications
   utilizing III-V triple-junction solar cells can have significantly
   reduced weight and high efficiency. An attractive approach to achieve
   these goals is to employ full-wafer epitaxial lift off (ELO) technology,
   which can eliminate the substrate weight and also enable multiple
   substrate re-usages. For the present study, we employed time-resolved
   photoluminescence (TR-PL) techniques to study carrier dynamics in
   MOVPE-grown bulk dilute bismide double heterostructures (DH). Carrier
   lifetime measurements are crucial to optimizing MOVPE materials growth.
   We have studied carrier dynamics in GaAsBi QW structures with GaAsP
   barriers. Carrier lifetimes were measured from GaAsBi DH samples at
   different stages of post-growth thermal annealing steps. Post-growth
   annealing yielded significant improvements in carrier lifetimes. Based
   on this study, single junction solar cells (SJSC) were grown and
   annealed under a variety of conditions and characterized. The SJSC
   annealed at 600 - 650 degrees C exhibited improved response in EQE
   spectra. In addition, we studied carrier dynamics in MOVPE-grown
   GaAs-In(Al) GaP DH samples grown on GaAs substrates. The structures were
   grown on top of a thin AlAs release layer, which allowed epitaxial
   layers grown on top of the A1As layer to be removed from the substrate.
   The GaAs active layers had various doping densities and thicknesses. Our
   TR-PL results from both pre- and post-ELO processed GaAs-In(Al) GaP DH
   samples are reported.}},

Abstract = {{This work introduces a procedure which takes as input a global routing
   solution that is already improved for routability based on the
   traditional total overflow (TOF) metric, and then improves the
   distribution of congestion without increasing the TOF. Our router is
   able to significantly decrease the number of edges in undesirable ranges
   of congestion by optimizing a convex piece-wise linear penalty function.
   The penalties are flexible and may be specified by the user. In our
   experiments, using the already-optimized global routing solutions of the
   ISPD'11 benchmarks-mostly have 0 units of TOF-we show the number of
   edges which are utilized very close to capacity can be significantly
   reduced. This work is the first to explicitly target improving the
   distribution of edge congestion corresponding to an already-optimized
   global routing solution without sacrificing the TOF.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in additive manufacturing technology have made feasible
   the use of materials such as titanium and high-temperature nickel alloys
   in the construction of complex parts intended for production through
   techniques such as direct laser melting or direct laser sintering. These
   parts can be manufactured at a level of quality suitable not only for
   prototyping, but even for use as flight hardware. However, the
   evaluation of material properties is a challenge; melted metals will not
   retain the same properties as an equivalent cast metal, and factors such
   as part geometry, print density, and any post-processing techniques used
   will all influence the material properties of a given component. This
   paper uses modal analysis to update the isotropic material properties of
   metal components which are representative of flight hardware within the
   subsystems of a liquid rocket motor. Two different materials are
   examined: Ti 64 titanium alloy and INCONEL 718 nickel alloy.}},

Abstract = {{Sensors placement is important in vibration testing. The method of
   effective independence, recently extended to account for triaxial
   sensors, is widely used for this purpose in case a finite element model
   of the structure is available. In this paper a criteria is added to
   reject redundant information that usually arises in symmetric structures
   or finite element models with high candidate sensor density. A sensor
   placement strategy is proposed in which, initially, the method of
   effective independence is used to select the best sensors from a
   candidate set by maximising the Fisher information matrix determinant.
   Next, the gramians of a balanced realisation is used to compare the
   information between systems consisting of only previously added sensors
   to the final set with systems of the previous and candidate sensors.
   Sensors with redundant information will have negligible effect on the
   gramian and can be rejected. The method is fast, as gramians of systems
   with only one or two outputs are evaluated. It is sub-optimal in the
   sense that all possible sensor placement combinations are not evaluated
   for optimality. A test case, consisting of a rectangular plate, is
   presented, but the method has been used on a large scale industrial
   model with good results.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, experimental and operational modal analysis requires
   wired sensors that are physically attached to the structure of interest
   for vibration measurements. The instrumentation of these sensors on
   structures for long-term applications (e.g., structural health
   monitoring) is costly, time-consuming, and requires significant
   maintenance. Even if a wireless sensor network is used, there still
   exist substantial challenges associated with security, available
   bandwidth, and providing energy to the network. As a non-contact method,
   optics measurements from digital cameras combined with vision based
   algorithms have been successfully used for experimental vibration
   measurement and analysis. This opens the door to replacing physical
   sensors with remote sensing techniques, which could eliminate many of
   the problems associated with conventional distributed sensor networks.
   However, research to date has focused on simple structures that can be
   represented using a single edge. In this work, we propose a novel
   phase-based video motion magnification and Blind Source Separation (BSS)
   based method to perform operational modal analysis in a relatively
   efficient and automated manner.}},

   Incineration Fly Ash for Use as Embankment Fill Material}},

Pages = {{70-78}},
Abstract = {{The beneficial use of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash
   promotes sustainability in highway construction. This study investigated
   the geotechnical and chemical leaching characteristics of fresh and aged
   MSWI fly ash samples for use of the material in highway construction
   applications. The results show that the geotechnical properties of MSWI
   fly ash resemble those of silty sands with poor drainage capacity.
   Compared with fresh ash (<10 days since placement), aged ash (3 to 6
   months) has a higher California bearing ratio, higher unconfined
   compressive strength, and greater freeze-thaw durability. The
   concentrations of cadmium, chromium, selenium, silver, and sulfate from
   water leach tests are below the limits stipulated in Wisconsin NR 538.
   The concentrations of heavy metals in leachate from Synthetic
   Precipitation Leaching Procedure tests are below the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency's standard maximum contaminant level, with the
   exception of arsenic. Cumulative mass release from column leach tests
   indicates that fresh ash will release more heavy metals than aged ash
   during long-term leaching processes. According to the geotechnical and
   environmental test results in this investigation, aged MSWI fly ash is
   identified as a viable material for potential use in roadway
   construction.}},

Abstract = {{Low temperature performance grading currently relies solely on Bending
   Beam Rheometer (BBR) for determining low temperature creep stiffness (S)
   and rate of modulus relaxation (m-value) at 60 s, both determined at low
   stress-strain levels, in the pre-failure zones. This aspect raises
   questions with regard to applicability of properties derived from the
   linear viscoelastic range for prediction of asphalt binder thermal
   cracking behavior. Furthermore, many researchers have reported a
   discrepancy between field cracking severity and predictions based on
   asphalt binder properties since the asphalt binder-aggregate interaction
   is non-existent in asphalt binder testing. Therefore evaluation of
   asphalt mastics properties which could save a considerable amount of
   time and equipment in comparison to mixture testing should be
   prioritized. These challenges indicate that considering fracture
   properties of asphalt mastics could be a better approach for prediction
   of thermal cracking in asphalt pavements. It is believed that
   development of failure master curves for the damage characterization of
   asphalt mastics at different temperatures and loading rates would be
   beneficial for better characterization of resistance to thermal
   cracking. Therefore, this study presents framework and preliminary
   results on the development of such asphalt mastic failure master curves
   using the new BBR-SENB test for damage resistance characterization. The
   complexity of the visco-elastic behavior of asphalt mastics in terms of
   time and temperature dependency is also recognized by the sensitivity of
   the failure properties to changes in loading time and temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The durability of the bitumen-aggregate system is a critical factor
   affecting the performance of asphalt pavements. It is achieved by a
   careful selection of the materials based on the analysis of their
   compatibility and their water sensitivity. Currently, a variety of
   analytical test methods are used to evaluate the power of the binder to
   adhere to various aggregates and their susceptibility to moisture. Many
   of these methods are time consuming and/or require sophisticated and
   expensive instrumentation. The most common procedure, the indirect
   tensile strength (ITS) test, has been questioned by many researchers and
   simpler testing procedures, such as the rolling bottle test, are
   considered to be an indicative measure. Several studies have introduced
   a new test procedure, the binder bond strength (BBS) test. The test,
   based on the pull-off strength of the bond between asphalt and aggregate
   measured before after water conditioning, has shown good repeatability,
   reliability and the ability to determine the effects of different
   aggregate type, conditioning time and moisture on the aggregate-asphalt
   system. This paper explores the potential of the BBS test by correlating
   the results of test methods presently used to evaluate the strength of
   the bond of the asphalt-aggregate system measured with the BBS test.
   Four different aggregate types and a traditional bitumen were tested
   according to the respective European standard, including type, length
   and temperature of conditioning. However, the different aspects of the
   mixture considered in each test method determine a poor agreement of the
   results. Comparable levels of moisture resistance are observable only in
   the long term.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing of the earth and its atmosphere in the infrared spectrum
   has become a mainstay in environmental monitoring for weather and
   climate. From the start of occasional rocket-borne camera pictures, to
   the first global measurements of outgoing longwave infrared radiation,
   to global day and night visible and infrared picture mosaics, to
   complementary hourly full earth disk visible and infrared measurements,
   to full spectral (visible, near infrared, infrared, and microwave)
   global measurements of the earth surface and atmosphere, it is a history
   of continuing improvement in environmental remote sensing capabilities.
   Snapshots and mosaics gave way to seamless global coverage in

   This chapter gives a brief history of the evolution of meteorological
   satellite sensors in polar and geostationary orbit, explores the
   characteristics of radiative transfer through the atmosphere (with a
   focus on infrared radiation that is dominated by CO2, H2O, and O-3

Title = {{Evidence for ambient dark aqueous SOA formation in the Po Valley, Italy}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments suggest that water-soluble products from the
   gas-phase oxidation of volatile organic compounds can partition into
   atmospheric waters where they are further oxidized to form low
   volatility products, providing an alternative route for oxidation in
   addition to further oxidation in the gas phase. These products can
   remain in the particle phase after water evaporation, forming what is
   termed as aqueous secondary organic aerosol (aqSOA). However, few
   studies have attempted to observe ambient aqSOA. Therefore, a suite of
   measurements, including near-real-time WSOC (water-soluble organic
   carbon), inorganic anions/cations, organic acids, and gas-phase glyoxal,
   were made during the PEGASOS (Pan-European Gas-AeroSOls-climate
   interaction Study) 2012 campaign in the Po Valley, Italy, to search for
   evidence of aqSOA. Our analysis focused on four periods: Period A on
   19-21 June, Period B on 30 June and 1-2 July, Period C on 3-5 July, and
   Period D on 6-7 July to represent the first (Period A) and second
   (Periods B, C, and D) halves of the study. These periods were picked to
   cover varying levels of WSOC and aerosol liquid water. In addition, back
   trajectory analysis suggested all sites sampled similar air masses on a
   given day. The data collected during both periods were divided into
   times of increasing relative humidity (RH) and decreasing RH, with the
   aim of di-minishing the influence of dilution and mixing on SOA
   concentrations and other measured variables. Evidence for local aqSOA
   formation was only observed during Period A. When this occurred, there
   was a correlation of WSOC with organic aerosol (R-2 = 0.84), aerosol
   liquid water (R-2 = 0.65), RH (R-2 = 0.39), and aerosol nitrate (R-2 =
   0.66). Additionally, this was only observed during times of increasing
   RH, which coincided with dark conditions. Comparisons of WSOC with
   oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) factors, determined from application of
   positive matrix factorization analysis on the aerosol mass spectrometer
   observations of the submicron non-refractory organic particle
   composition, suggested that the WSOC differed in the two halves of the
   study (Period A WSOC vs. OOA-2 R-2 = 0.83 and OOA-4 R-2 = 0.04, whereas
   Period C WSOC vs. OOA-2 R-2 = 0.03 and OOA-4 R-2 = 0.64). OOA-2 had a
   high O = C (oxygen = carbon) ratio of 0.77, providing evidence that
   aqueous processing was occurring during Period A. Key factors of local
   aqSOA production during Period A appear to include air mass stagnation,
   which allows aqSOA precursors to accumulate in the region; the formation
   of substantial local particulate nitrate during the overnight hours,
   which enhances water uptake by the aerosol; and the presence of
   significant amounts of ammonia, which may contribute to ammonium nitrate
   formation and subsequent water uptake and/or play a more direct role in
   the aqSOA chemistry.}},

Title = {{Developing Australia's Highway Safety Professionals What Can the United
   States Learn?}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2582}},
Pages = {{87-94}},
Abstract = {{Highway safety is a complex issue that requires the combined skills of
   many different types of professionals, including engineers, public
   administrators, first responders, and public health officials. Although
   the United States and Australia are culturally similar countries with
   high levels of motor vehicle use, for historical reasons Australia has
   typically reached road safety milestones earlier than the United States
   has. Although a few American universities offer classes on road safety,
   current U.S. offerings predominantly consist of professional development
   short courses (often with a programmatic focus). In addition to
   professional development courses, some undergraduate and postgraduate
   courses in Australian universities offer electives on the principles of
   road safety engineering and methods for influencing road user behavior.
   This coursework can be viewed as part of a wider effort to implement
   scientifically validated methods and the safe system approach
   recommended by the International Transport Forum of the Organisation for
   Economic Co-operation and Development. Deeper integration of highway
   safety principles into the undergraduate curriculum could assist both
   countries' students in developing the leadership skills necessary to
   achieve higher levels of safety performance.}},

Title = {{Instrumentation and measurement strategy for the NOAA SENEX aircraft
   campaign as part of the Southeast Atmosphere Study 2013}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{3063-3093}},
Abstract = {{Natural emissions of ozone-and-aerosol-precursor gases such as isoprene
   and monoterpenes are high in the southeastern US. In addition,
   anthropogenic emissions are significant in the southeastern US and
   summertime photochemistry is rapid. The NOAA-led SENEX (Southeast Nexus)
   aircraft campaign was one of the major components of the Southeast
   Atmosphere Study (SAS) and was focused on studying the interactions
   between biogenic and anthropogenic emissions to form secondary
   pollutants. During SENEX, the NOAA WP-3D aircraft conducted 20 research
   flights between 27 May and 10 July 2013 based out of Smyrna, TN.
   Here we describe the experimental approach, the science goals and early
   results of the NOAA SENEX campaign. The aircraft, its capabilities and
   standard measurements are described. The instrument payload is
   summarized including detection limits, accuracy, precision and time
   resolutions for all gas-and-aerosol phase instruments. The
   inter-comparisons of compounds measured with multiple instruments on the
   NOAA WP-3D are presented and were all within the stated uncertainties,
   except two of the three NO2 measurements.
   The SENEX flights included day-and nighttime flights in the southeastern
   US as well as flights over areas with intense shale gas extraction
   (Marcellus, Fayetteville and Haynesville shale). We present one example
   flight on 16 June 2013, which was a daytime flight over the Atlanta
   region, where several crosswind transects of plumes from the city and
   nearby point sources, such as power plants, paper mills and landfills,
   were flown. The area around Atlanta has large biogenic isoprene
   emissions, which provided an excellent case for studying the
   interactions between biogenic and anthropogenic emissions. In this
   example flight, chemistry in and outside the Atlanta plumes was observed
   for several hours after emission. The analysis of this flight showcases
   the strategies implemented to answer some of the main SENEX science
   questions.}},

Abstract = {{Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) requires navigation and
   deployment of a prosthetic valve within the aortic annulus under
   fluoroscopic guidance. To support improved device visualization in this
   procedure, this study investigates the feasibility of frame-by-frame 3D
   reconstruction of a moving and expanding prosthetic valve structure from
   simultaneous bi-plane x-ray views. In the proposed method, a dynamic 3D
   model of the valve is used in a 2D/3D registration framework to obtain a
   reconstruction of the valve. For each frame, valve model parameters
   describing position, orientation, expansion state, and deformation are
   iteratively adjusted until forward projections of the model match both
   bi-plane views. Simulated bi-plane imaging of a valve at different
   signal-difference-to-noise ratio (SDNR) levels was performed to test the
   approach. 20 image sequences with 50 frames of valve deployment were
   simulated at each SDNR. The simulation achieved a target registration
   error (TRE) of the estimated valve model of 0.93 +/- 2.6 mm (mean +/-
   S.D.) for the lowest SDNR of 2. For higher SDNRs (5 to 50) a TRE of 0.04
   mm +/- 0.23 mm was achieved. A tabletop phantom study was then conducted
   using a TAVR valve. The dynamic 3D model was constructed from high
   resolution CT scans and a simple expansion model. TRE was 1.22 +/- 0.35
   mm for expansion states varying from undeployed to fully deployed, and
   for moderate amounts of inter-frame motion. Results indicate that it is
   feasible to use bi-plane imaging to recover the 3D structure of
   deformable catheter devices.}},

Abstract = {{This work proposes a means whereby weak nonlinearity in a substructure,
   as typically arises due to friction in bolted interfaces, can be
   captured experimentally on a mode-by-mode basis and then used to predict
   the nonlinear response of an assembly. The method relies on the fact
   that the modes of a weakly nonlinear structure tend to remain uncoupled
   so long as their natural frequencies are distinct and higher harmonics
   generated by the nonlinearity do not produce significant response in
   other modes. Recent experiments on industrial hardware with bolted
   joints has shown that this type of model can be quite effective, and
   that a single degree-of-freedom (DOF) system with an Iwan joint, which
   is known as a modal Iwan model, effectively captures the way in which
   the stiffness and damping depend on amplitude. Once the modal Iwan
   models have been identified for each mode of the subcomponent(s) of
   interest, they can be assembled using standard techniques and used with
   a numerical integration routine to compute the nonlinear transient
   response of the assembled structure. The proposed methods are
   demonstrated by coupling a modal model of a 3DOF system with three
   discrete Iwan joints to a linear model for a 2DOF system.}},

   modal mass to ground through the traditional spring and damper, a
   nonlinear Iwan element was added. This assumes that the mode shapes do
   not change with amplitude and there are no interactions between modal
   degrees of freedom. This work expands on these previous studies. An
   impact experiment is performed on a structure which exhibits typical
   structural dynamic nonlinear response, i.e. weak frequency dependence
   and strong damping dependence on the amplitude of vibration. Use of low
   level modal test results in combination with high level impacts are
   processed using various combinations of modal filtering, the Hilbert
   Transform and band-pass filtering to develop response data that are then
   fit with various nonlinear elements to create a nonlinear pseudo-modal
   model. Simulations of forced response are compared with high level
   experimental data for various nonlinear element assumptions.}},

Abstract = {{We study stress wave propagation in two impulsively forced split
   Hopkinson bar systems: one with a prestressed interface and one with a
   frictional interface. We first consider only primary wave transmission
   and reflection, allowing for reduction of the problem to a first-order,
   strongly, nonlinear ordinary differential equation. A high-order finite
   element model is then developed and used to validate the results of the
   primary-pulse model. A spring that hardens with increasing preload is
   used to model the prestressed interface while an Iwan element is used to
   model the frictional interface. Using the primary-wave propagation
   model, we perform nonlinear system identification by matching simulation
   and experiment results and identify the nonlinear hardening
   characteristics for the prestressed interface and Iwan parameters for
   the frictional interface. These parameters are then used in the finite
   element model to compare the experimentally measured secondary effects
   with the simulated effects. Our results demonstrate that the
   primary-wave propagation model can be used as a reduced order model for
   nonlinear system identification at a fraction of the computational cost
   of higher-order models.}},

Abstract = {{Background: It remains controversial whether hormone therapy in recently
   postmenopausal women modifies the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   Objective: To investigate the effects of hormone therapy on amyloid-beta
   deposition in recently postmenopausal women.
   Methods: Participants within 5-36 months past menopause in the Kronos
   Early Estrogen Prevention Study, a randomized, double blinded
   placebo-controlled clinical trial, were randomized to: 1) 0.45 mg/day
   oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE); 2) 50 mu g/day transdermal 17
   beta-estradiol; or 3) placebo pills and patch for four years. Oral
   progesterone (200 mg/day) was given to active treatment groups for 12
   days each month. C-11 Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging was
   performed in 68 of the 118 participants at Mayo Clinic approximately
   seven years post randomization and three years after stopping randomized
   treatment. PiB Standard unit value ratio (SUVR) was calculated.
   Results: Women (age = 52-65) randomized to transdermal 17 beta-estradiol
   (n = 21) had lower PiB SUVR compared to placebo (n = 30) after adjusting
   for age {[}odds ratio (95\% CI) = 0.31(0.11-0.83)]. In the APOE epsilon
   4 carriers, transdermal 17 beta-estradiol treated women (n = 10) had
   lower PiB SUVR compared to either placebo (n = 5) {[}odds ratio (95\%
   CI) = 0.04(0.004-0.44)], or the oral CEE treated group (n = 3) {[}odds
   ratio (95\% CI) = 0.01(0.0006-0.23)] after adjusting for age. Hormone
   therapy was not associated with PiB SUVR in the APOE epsilon 4
   non-carriers.
   Conclusion: In this pilot study, transdermal 17 beta-estradiol therapy
   in recently postmenopausal women was associated with a reduced
   amyloid-beta deposition, particularly in APOE epsilon 4 carriers. This
   finding may have important implications for the prevention of AD in
   postmenopausal women, and needs to be confirmed in a larger sample.}},

Abstract = {{Abandoned objects in a road can be a potential threat to urban traffic.
   In this article we present a new threat degree analysis method of
   abandoned objects, which is based on dynamic multifeature fusion to
   detect the abandoned objects and analyze the threat degree
   automatically. The image sequence is acquired with a visible sensor
   installed at overbridges, and is processed by a PC-based
   image-processing system. In this method, we first put forward a
   multivehicle tracking algorithm to acquire the vehicles' moving
   information as preprocessing. Then we extracted the dynamic features and
   built a security threat model upstream of the abandoned object to
   facilitate further analysis. Finally, we proposed a fusion decision
   method, based on dynamic multiple features, to analyze the threat
   degree. The experiments show that the developed method can determine the
   threat degree of abandoned objects well and truly, and it is appropriate
   in the intelligent traffic monitoring system.}},

Abstract = {{Aldehyde-functionalized cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were applied to
   synthesize Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on CNF surfaces via on-site Pt ion
   reduction and achieve high concentration and uniform Pt NP loading. ALD
   could then selectively deposit TiO2 on CNFs and keep the Pt NPs
   uncovered due to their drastically different hydro-affinity properties.
   The high-temperature ALD process also simultaneously improved the
   crystallinity of Pt NPs and decomposed the CNF template leaving a pure
   anatase phase TiO2 nanofiber network decorated with high-density Pt NPs
   (up to 11.05 wt\%). The as-prepared fibrous Pt-TiO2 network
   photocatalyst was integrated with CNF strips to develop a capillary
   setup for photocatalyzed hydrogen generation. Better reaction kinetics
   and higher efficiency were achieved from the capillary design compared
   to conventional in-electrolyte reactions. The initial H-2 generation
   rates were 100.56-138.69 mmol g(-1) h(-1) from the capillary setup based
   on different Pt NP loadings, which were 123.3-288.6\% larger than those
   of the in-electrolyte setup (25.88-62.11 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). This 3D

Abstract = {{Panels and plates are an important structural element in many
   engineering applications, such as aircraft skin panels, ship hulls, and
   civil shell structures. These structures, particularly when their
   boundaries are in some way constrained, exhibit highly nonlinear
   behavior (e.g. spring hardening) even for relatively small deformations
   due to induced axial loading. An extreme, but highly important, example
   is dynamic snap-through buckling of curved or post-buckled thin panels.
   This phenomena is well represented in the literature, both for plates
   and for the simplified case of curved beams. The majority of the
   experimental studies, especially for panels, have been carried out using
   either wind tunnels or acoustic drivers to generate transverse loading.
   While this is directly applicable to real-world scenarios, say aircraft
   panel loading, it does not permit direct control of the loads that are
   applied. In this work, we instead apply loads to a thermally buckled
   panel using an electrodynamic shaker. This, along with the use of
   digital image correlation to capture the full field dynamic response
   allows for a complete picture of the complex characteristics of dynamic
   snap-through.}},

Abstract = {{A structure undergoing large amplitude deformations can exhibit
   nonlinear behavior which is not predicted by traditional linear
   theories. Structures with some initial curvature offer an additional
   complication due to buckling and snap through phenomena, and can exhibit
   softening, hardening and, internal resonance. As a structure transitions
   into a region of nonlinear response, a structure's nonlinear normal
   modes (NNMs) can provide insight into the forced responses of the
   nonlinear system. Mono-harmonic excitations can often be used to
   experimentally isolate a dynamic response in the neighborhood of a
   single NNM. This is accomplished with an extension of the modal
   indicator function and force appropriation to ensure the dynamic
   response of the structure is on the desired NNM. This work explores
   these methods using two structures: a nominally-flat beam and a curved
   axi-symmetric plate. Single-point force appropriation is used by
   manually tuning the excitation frequency and amplitude until the mode
   indicator function is satisfied for the fundamental harmonic. The
   results show a reasonable estimate of the NNM backbone, the occurrence
   of internal resonance, and couplings between the underlying linear modes
   along the backbone.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few decades, there have been many developments in
   techniques that extract a reduced order model (ROM) from a geometrically
   nonlinear finite element model. The enforced displacement ROM strategy
   that is of interest in this work is known as an indirect approach
   because it does not require altering the finite element code. Instead,
   one uses a series of static displacement fields applied to the nonlinear
   finite element model to estimate the nonlinear stiffness coefficients in
   the reduced equations. Geometric nonlinearity causes the bending and
   membrane displacements to become coupled, and the enforced displacements
   method requires that the kinematics of the membrane motion be explicitly
   included in the basis using either axial vibration modes or dual modes.
   This work explores the accuracy of the enforced displacements ROM
   strategy by comparing the efficiency of these basis vectors, as well as
   the use of three different parameter estimation procedures and the
   effect of scaling factors on the static load cases used to generate the
   ROM. The different modeling decisions are shown to have a very
   significant effect on the accuracy of the ROMs, and the comparisons are
   used to suggest best practices that result in the most accurate ROMs.
   These issues are explored using finite element models of a flat
   geometrically nonlinear beam with fixed-fixed boundary conditions and a
   flat geometrically nonlinear exhaust cover plate. The effect of each of
   the modeling decisions on the resulting enforced displacement ROM is

Abstract = {{We develop a new nonlinear model updating strategy based on global/local
   nonlinear system identification of general mechanical systems. The
   approach relies on analyzing system time series in the frequency-energy
   domain by constructing Hamiltonian, and forced/damped frequency-energy
   plots (FEPs). The system parameters are then characterized and updated
   by matching the backbone branches of the FEPs with the frequency-energy
   wavelet transforms of experimental and/or computational time series. The
   main advantage of this method is that no nonlinearity model is assumed a
   priori, and the system model is updated solely based on simulation
   and/or experimental results. By matching the frequency-energy plots of
   the benchmark system and its reduced order model, we show that we are
   able to retrieve the global dynamics in the frequency and energy ranges
   of interest, identify bifurcations, characterize local nonlinearities,
   and accurately reconstruct time series.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, nonlinear reduced order models (ROMs) of large scale finite
   element models have been used to approximate the nonlinear normal modes
   (NNMs) of detailed structures with geometric nonlinearity distributed
   throughout all of its elements. The ROMs provide a low order
   representation of the full model, and are readily used with numerical
   continuation algorithms to compute the NNMs of the system. In this work,
   the NNMs computed from the reduced equations serve as candidate periodic
   solutions for the full order model. A subset of these are used to define
   a set of initial conditions and integration periods for the full order
   model and then the full model is integrated to check the quality of the
   NNM estimated from the ROM. If the resulting solution is not periodic,
   then the initial conditions can be iteratively adjusted using a shooting
   algorithm and a Newton-Raphson approach. These converged solutions give
   the true NNM of the finite element model, as they satisfy the full order
   equations, and they can be compared to the ROM predictions to validate
   the ROM at selected points along the NNM branch. This gives a
   load-independent metric that may provide confidence in the accuracy of
   the ROM while avoiding the excessive cost of computing the complete NNM
   of the full order model. This approach is demonstrated on two models
   with geometric nonlinearity: a beam with clamped-clamped boundary
   conditions, and a cantilevered plate used to study fatigue and crack
   propagation.}},

Abstract = {{When a structure is subjected to an extreme environment, its linear
   normal modes, which are uncoupled under small loads, begin to influence
   each other and exchange energy. This is easily explained when the
   nonlinear normal modes of the structure are computed, since they show
   internal resonances where the underlying linear modes combine to produce
   the NNM solution at each excitation level. This paper examines the
   degree to which nonlinear modal coupling can serve as an energy transfer
   mechanism in order to reduce the vibration levels of a structure
   subjected to a broadband, random forcing. The structure in question is a
   beam with an intermediate support that is adjusted in order to vary the
   frequency ratios between modes. To explore the significance of modal
   coupling, two types of reduced order models are examined: A customary
   model including all of the coupling terms between the linear modes, and
   an uncoupled reduced order model which contains nonlinear stiffness
   terms in single modes only. The differences in response between the two
   models are used to quantify the effect of nonlinear modal coupling in
   the structure.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the associations between the oxidative potential of
   ambient PM(2.)5 and PM0.18, measured by means of the dithiothreitol
   (DTT) assay, and their chemical constituents and modeled sources.
   Particulate matter (PM) samples were collected from 2012-2013 in Central
   Los Angeles (LA) and 2013-2014 in Anaheim, California, USA. Detailed
   chemical analyses of the PM samples, including carbonaceous species,
   inorganic elements and water-soluble ions, were conducted. Univariate
   analysis indicated a high correlation (R > 0.60) between the DTT
   activity and the concentrations of carbonaceous species at both sites.
   The strongest correlations were observed between DTT and organic tracers
   of primary vehicle tailpipe emissions including polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) and hopanes as well as EC, with higher correlations
   for PM0.18 versus PM2.5 components. Moreover, metals and trace elements
   (e.g., Ba, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Sb) in both size ranges were also
   associated with DTT activity. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis
   was performed on DTT activity and PM sources identified by a Molecular
   Marker-Chemical Mass Balance (MM-CMB) model (i.e. major carbonaceous
   sources: vehicle tailpipe emissions, wood smoke, primary biogenic and
   secondary organic carbon) together with other typical sources of ambient
   PM (i.e. crustal material, vehicular abrasion, secondary ions and sea
   salt). Overall, our findings illustrate the relative importance of
   different traffic sources on the oxidative potential of ambient PM.
   Despite major reductions of tailpipe emissions, the lack of similar
   reductions (and possibly an increase) in non-tailpipe emissions makes
   them an important source of traffic-related PM in Los Angeles and their
   increasing role in the overall PM toxicity raises concerns for public
   health.}},

Abstract = {{The uncertainty of a system is usually quantified with the use of
   sampling methods such as Monte-Carlo or Latin hyper cube sampling. These
   sampling methods require many computations of the model and may include
   re-meshing. The re-solving and re-meshing of the model is a very large
   computational burden. One way to greatly reduce this computational
   burden is to use a parameterized reduced order model. This is a model
   that contains the sensitivities of the desired results with respect to
   changing parameters such as Young's modulus. The typical method of
   computing these sensitivities is the use of finite difference technique
   that gives an approximation that is subject to truncation error and
   subtractive cancellation due to the precision of the computer. One way
   of eliminating this error is to use hyper dual numbers, which are able
   to generate exact sensitivities that are not subject to the precision of
   the computer. This paper uses the concept of hyper-dual numbers to
   parameterize a system that is composed of two substructures in the form
   of Craig-Bampton substructure representations, and combine them using
   component mode synthesis. The synthesis transformations using other
   techniques require the use of a nominal transformation while this
   approach allows for exact transformations when a perturbation is
   applied. This paper presents this technique for a planar motion frame
   and compares the use and accuracy of the approach against the true full
   system. This work lays the groundwork for performing component mode
   synthesis using hyper-dual numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Several of the authors, and others, have explored the use of modal-like
   models for structures having nonlinearities associated with compressive
   joints (such as bolted connections.) In these models, the deformations
   are treated as consisting of modal expansions, but with the modal
   coordinates that evolving nonlinearly over time. There have been several
   theoretical treatments of this strategy and the authors report here on
   an early effort to confirm the approach through experiment.
   For this purpose simple structures consisting of pairs of plates were
   assembled using four bolted connections. The structures were excited by
   modal hammer at various locations and the modes identified by scanning
   laser vibrometer. In each case, multiple modes were excited and the
   evolution of modal coordinates was achieved by band-pass filtering at
   the relevant frequencies.
   Making some simple kinematic assumptions about relative deformations of
   the component plates and exploiting symmetries permits the mapping from
   ring-down of each mode to constitutive behavior of each joint. If the
   strategy of using joint-like modal models for bolted structures is
   valid, the joint constitutive models deduced from any mode should be
   adequate to predict the apparent, but nonlinear modal behavior at other
   resonances. Multiple test specimens were manufactured to assess this
   predictive capability in the context of part-to-part variability
   intrinsic to the dynamics of such structures.}},

Abstract = {{The stiffness of the uterine cervix changes during pregnancy,
   significantly softening at term. A pathologically rapid softening can
   result in preterm birth. Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging (SWEI) methods
   can be used to track these changes. Difficulties of in vivo human
   research during pregnancy motivate the study of animal models with
   anatomy and physiology similar to humans. This work presents preliminary
   results of the use of SWEI methods to assess cervical stiffness changes
   during pregnancy in a rhesus macaque non-human primate (NHP) model.
   Pregnant NHP subjects are being scanned during two consecutive menstrual
   cycles before pregnancy and five times between weeks 4 to 23 after
   conception and once two weeks after delivery. Shear waves are remotely
   induced with an Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse excitation within
   regions of interest (ROIs) centered in the uterine end of cervix. Shear
   wave speed (SWS) was quantified with different estimators and at various
   ROI locations to choose the more consistent and precise estimates. From
   25 subjects currently enrolled, 8 have successfully completed the study.
   At late pregnancy, SWS values significantly decreased to less than 40\%
   of their pre-pregnancy values, and recovered two weeks after delivery.
   SWS changes in the same subject at early pregnancy compared to
   pre-pregnancy and late-pregnancy values were statistically significant.
   Our results motivate further investigation of SWEI to track cervical
   softening during pregnancy in the NHP model.}},

Abstract = {{Fast numerical approaches have recently been proposed to compute the
   undamped nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) of discrete and structural
   systems, and these have enabled remarkable insights into the nonlinear
   behavior of more complicated systems than are tractable analytically.
   Ardeh et al. recently proposed the multi-point, multi-harmonic
   collocation (MMC) method, which finds a truncated harmonic description
   of a structure's NNMs. The MMC algorithm resembles harmonic balance but
   doesn't require any analytical pre-processing nor the computational
   expense of the alternating time-frequency method. In a previous work
   this method showed significantly faster performance than the shooting
   method and it also allows the possibility of truncating the description
   of the NNM to avoid having to compute every internal resonance. This
   work presents a pseudo-arc length continuation version of the MMC
   algorithm which can compute a branch of NNMs and compares its
   performance with the shooting/pseudo-arc length continuation algorithm
   presented by Peeters and Kerschen in 2009. The algorithms are compared
   for two systems, a two degree-of-freedom (DOE) spring-mass system and a
   10-DOF model of a simply supported beam.}},

Abstract = {{Isolated resonance curves are separate from the main nonlinear
   forced-response branch, so they can easily be missed by a continuation
   algorithm and the resonant response might be underpredicted. The present
   work explores the connection between these isolated resonances and the
   nonlinear normal modes of the system and adapts an energy balance
   criterion to connect the two. This approach provides new insights into
   the occurrence of isolated resonances as well as a method to find an
   initial guess to compute the isolated resonance curve using numerical
   continuation.
   The concepts are illustrated on a finite element model of a cantilever
   beam with a nonlinear spring at its tip. This system presents jumps in
   both frequency and amplitude in its response to a swept sinusoidal
   excitation. The jumps are found to be the result of a modal interaction
   that creates an isolated resonance curve that eventually merges with the
   main resonance branch as the excitation force increases. Excellent
   insight into the observed dynamics is provided with the NNM theory,
   which supports that NNMs can also be a useful tool for predicting
   isolated resonance curves and other behaviors in the damped, forced
   response.}},

Abstract = {{Topology optimization is a systematic method of generating designs that
   maximize specific objectives. While it offers significant benefits over
   traditional shape optimization, topology optimization can be
   computationally demanding and laborious. Even a simple 3D compliance
   optimization can take several hours. Further, the optimized topology
   must typically be manually interpreted and translated into a
   CAD-friendly and manufacturing friendly design.
   This poses a predicament: given an initial design, should one optimize
   its topology? In this paper, we propose a simple metric for predicting
   the benefits of topology optimization. The metric is derived by
   exploiting the concept of topological sensitivity, and is computed via a
   finite element swapping method. The efficacy of the metric is
   illustrated through numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{The usage of molten nitrate salt as heat transfer fluid and thermal
   storage medium decouples the generation of electricity from the variable
   nature of the solar resource, allowing CSP plants to avoid curtailment
   and match production with demand. This however brings some unique
   challenges for the design of the molten salt central receiver (MSCR). An
   aspect critical to the use of molten nitrate (60wt\%/40wt\% -
   NaNO3/KNO3) salt as heat transfer fluid in the MSCR is to understand its
   heat transfer behavior. Alstom collaborated with the University of
   Wisconsin to conduct a series of experiments and experimentally
   determined the heat transfer coefficients of molten nitrate salt up to
   high Reynolds number (Re > 2.0E5) and heat flux (q `' > 1000 kW/m(2)),
   conditions heretofore not reported in the literature. A cartridge heater
   instrumented with thermocouples was installed inside a stainless steel
   pipe to form an annular test section. The test section was installed in
   the molten salt flow loop at the University of Wisconsin facility, and
   operated over a range of test conditions to determine heat transfer data
   that covered the expected operating regime of a practical molten salt
   receiver. Heat transfer data were compared to widely accepted
   correlations found in heat transfer literature, including that of
   Gnielinski. At lower Reynolds number conditions, the results from this
   work concurred with the molten salt heat transfer data reported in
   literature and followed the aforementioned correlations. However, in the
   region of interest for practical receiver design, the correlations did
   not accurately model the experimentally determined heat transfer data.
   Two major effects were observed: (i) all other factors remaining
   constant, the Nusselt numbers gradually plateaued at higher Reynolds
   number; and (ii) at higher Reynolds number a positive interaction of
   heat flux on Nusselt number was noted. These effects are definitely not
   modeled by the existing correlations. In this paper a new Nusselt number
   correlation is shown to accurately model the experimental data. A theory
   to explain the heat transfer trends at higher Reynolds number and heat
   flux is proposed. Finally, the impact of these results on receiver
   design is discussed, with comparison between correlations available from
   literature and that proposed in this study.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{565-579}},
Abstract = {{The photolysis of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypochlorite (OCl-)
   produces a suite of reactive oxidants, including hydroxyl radical
   ((OH)-O-center dot), chlorine radical (Cl.), and ozone (O-3). Therefore,
   the addition of light to chlorine disinfection units could effectively
   convert existing drinking water treatment systems into advanced
   oxidation processes. This review critically examines existing studies on
   chlorine photolysis as a water treatment process. After describing the
   fundamental chemistry of chlorine photolysis, we evaluate the ability of
   chlorine photolysis to transform model probe compounds, target organic
   contaminants, and chlorine-resistant microorganisms. The efficacy of
   chlorine photolysis to produce reactive oxidants is dependent on
   solution and irradiation conditions (e.g., pH and irradiation
   wavelengths). For example, lower pH values result in higher steady-state
   concentrations of. OH and Cl., resulting in enhanced contaminant
   removal. We also present the current state of knowledge on the
   alteration of dissolved organic matter and subsequent formation of
   disinfection by-products (DBPs) during chlorine photolysis. Although the
   relative yields of DBPs during chlorine photolysis are also dependent on
   solution conditions (e.g., higher organic DBP yields at low pH values),
   there is conflicting evidence on whether chlorine photolysis increases
   or decreases DBP production compared to thermal reactions between
   chlorine and dissolved organic matter in the dark. We conclude the
   review by identifying knowledge gaps in the current body of literature.}},

   eigenvalue problem. Popular methods for solving such problems tend to be
   memory-hungry, and therefore slow for large degrees of freedom.
   The main contribution of this paper is a low-memory assembly-free linear
   buckling analysis method. In particular, we employ the classic inverse
   iteration, in conjunction with an assembly-free deflated linear solver.
   The resulting implementation is simple, fast and particularly well
   suited for parallelization. The proposed method is used here to solve
   large scale 3D topology optimization problems subject to buckling
   constraints, where buckling problems must be solved repeatedly.}},

Abstract = {{There is significant interest today in the finite element simulation of
   various Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. AM simulation is
   time-dependent, inherently non-linear, and involves multiple physics. In
   addition, repeated meshing and insertion of new elements during material
   deposition can pose significant implementation challenges.
   Currently; AM simulation is handled either through a `quiet' approach or
   an `inactive' approach. In the quiet approach, all finite elements
   within the workspace are assembled into the global stiffness matrix, and
   the elements yet to be deposited are assigned `void' material
   properties. In the inactive approach, only the elements that have been
   deposited are assembled into the global stiffness matrix. The advantages
   and disadvantages of the two methods are well documented.
   In this paper, we propose a voxel-based, assembly-free framework for AM
   simulation. This framework presents several advantages including. (1)
   The workspace is meshed only once at the start of the simulation, (2)
   addition and deletion of elements is trivial, (3) reduced memory
   requirement as the global stiffness matrix is never assembled and (4)
   the underlying linear systems of equations can be solved efficiently
   through assembly-free methods. We demonstrate the framework here by
   simulating transient non-linear thermal behaviour of a laser deposition
   process, with material deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing (AM) and topology optimization strongly
   complement each other in that the complex and optimal designs created
   through the latter can directly be fabricated through AM, leading to
   reduced design and fabrication time.
   As AM expands into multi-material fabrication, there is a natural need
   for efficient multi-material topology optimization methods, where one
   must simultaneously optimize the topology, and the distribution of
   various materials within the topology.
   In this paper we generalize the single-material Pareto tracing method of
   topology optimization to multiple materials, and discuss its
   implementation using assembly -free finite element analysis, and
   first-order element-sensitivity. The effectiveness of the algorithm is
   demonstrated through illustrative examples.}},

Abstract = {{Topology optimization is a systematic method of generating designs to
   meet specific engineering requirements. It is exploited today in several
   industries including aircraft, automobile, and machinery, and it
   strongly complements the emerging field of additive manufacturing. Yet,
   the wide-spread use of topology optimization has been deterred due to
   high computational cost and significant software/hardware investment.
   In this paper, we propose a cloud based topology optimization (CTO)
   framework to overcome these challenges, thereby promoting the wider use
   of topology optimization. CTO requires a confluence of several methods
   and technologies, each of which is discussed in this paper.
   First and foremost, CTO requires a fast 3D topology optimization method
   that can respond rapidly to multiple clients. Here, PareTO, a
   topological sensitivity based method is used as the backbone of the
   framework. PareTO relies on limited memory finite element analysis with
   a deflated linear solver that is designed to exploit multi-core and
   many-core architectures. At the client-end, the framework relies on
   JavaScript based WebGL and ThreeJS technologies to display 3D geometry
   and formulate structural problems within a browser. Finally, Ajax, php
   and HTML5 technologies are exploited to achieve asynchronous and robust
   user experience. An implementation of this framework is available at
   www.cloudtopopt.com; to use this free service, JavaScript must be
   enabled within the browser.}},

Abstract = {{The degree of surface roughness of ice particles within thick, cold ice
   clouds is inferred from multi-directional, multi-spectral satellite
   polarimetric observations over oceans, assuming a column-aggregate
   particle habit. An improved roughness inference scheme is employed that
   provides a more noise-resilient roughness estimate than the conventional
   best-fit approach. The improvements include the introduction of a
   quantitative roughness parameter based on empirical orthogonal function
   analysis and proper treatment of polarization due to atmospheric
   scattering above clouds. A global 1-month data sample supports the use
   of a severely roughened ice habit to simulate the polarized reflectivity
   associated with ice clouds over ocean. The density distribution of the
   roughness parameter inferred from the global 1-month data sample and
   further analyses of a few case studies demonstrate the significant
   variability of ice cloud single-scattering properties. However, the
   present theoretical results do not agree with observations in the
   tropics. In the extratropics, the roughness parameter is inferred but
   74aEuro-\% of the sample is out of the expected parameter range.
   Potential improvements are discussed to enhance the depiction of the
   natural variability on a global scale.}},

Title = {{Understanding isoprene photooxidation using observations and modeling

Abstract = {{The emission, dispersion, and photochemistry of isoprene (C5H8) and
   related chemical species in the convective boundary layer (CBL) during
   sunlit daytime were studied over a mixed forest in the southeastern
   United States by combining ground-based and aircraft observations.
   Fluxes of isoprene and monoterpenes were quantified at the top of the
   forest canopy using a high-resolution proton transfer reaction
   time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS). Snapshot (similar to
   aEuro-2aEuro-min sampling duration) vertical profiles of isoprene,
   methyl vinyl ketone (MVK)aEuro-+aEuro-methacrolein (MACR), and
   monoterpenes were collected from aircraft every hour in the CBL
   (100-1000aEuro-m). Both ground-based and airborne collected volatile
   organic compound (VOC) data are used to constrain the initial conditions
   of a mixed-layer chemistry model (MXLCH), which is applied to examine
   the chemical evolution of the O-3-NOx-HOx-VOC system and how it is
   affected by boundary layer dynamics in the CBL. The chemical loss rate
   of isoprene (similar to aEuro-1aEuro-h) is similar to the turbulent
   mixing timescale (0.1-0.5aEuro-h), which indicates that isoprene
   concentrations are equally dependent on both photooxidation and boundary
   layer dynamics. Analysis of a model-derived concentration budget
   suggests that diurnal evolution of isoprene inside the CBL is mainly
   controlled by surface emissions and chemical loss; the diurnal evolution
   of O-3 is dominated by entrainment. The NO to HO2 ratio
   (NOaEuro-:aEuro-HO2) is used as an indicator of anthropogenic impact on
   the CBL chemical composition and spans a wide range (1-163). The fate of
   hydroxyl-substituted isoprene peroxyl radical (HOC5H8OO center dot;
   ISOPOO) is strongly affected by NOaEuro-:aEuro-HO2, shifting from
   NO-dominant to NO-HO2-balanced conditions from early morning to
   noontime. This chemical regime change is reflected in the diurnal
   evolution of isoprene hydroxynitrates (ISOPN) and isoprene hydroxy
   hydroperoxides (ISOPOOH).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an extension of the B-spline based density
   representation to a robust formulation of topology optimization. In our
   B-spline based topology optimization approach, we use separate
   representations for material density distribution and analysis.
   B-splines are used as a representation of density and the usual finite
   elements are used for analysis. The density undergoes a Heaviside
   projection to reduce the grayness in the optimized structures. To ensure
   minimal length control so the resulting designs are robust with respect
   to manufacturing imprecision, we adopt a three-structure formulation
   during the optimization. That is, dilated, intermediate and eroded
   designs are used in the optimization formulation. We give an analytical
   description of minimal length of features in optimized designs.
   Numerical examples have been implemented on three common topology
   optimization problems: minimal compliance, heat conduction and compliant
   mechanism. They demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in
   generating designs with crisp black/white transition and is accurate in
   minimal length control.}},

Title = {{Recovery of slow-5 oscillations in a longitudinal study of ischemic
   stroke patients}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{398-407}},
Abstract = {{Functional networks in resting-state fMRI are identified by
   characteristics of their intrinsic low-frequency oscillations, more
   specifically in terms of their synchronicity. With advanced aging and in
   clinical populations, this synchronicity among functionally linked
   regions is known to decrease and become disrupted, which may be
   associated with observed cognitive and behavioral changes. Previous work
   from our group has revealed that oscillations within the slow-5
   frequency range (0.01-0.027 Hz) are particularly susceptible to
   disruptions in aging and following a stroke. In this study, we
   characterized longitudinally the changes in the slow-5 oscillations in
   stroke patients across two different time-points. We followed a group of
   ischemic stroke patients (n = 20) and another group of healthy older
   adults (n = 14) over two visits separated by a minimum of three months
   (average of 9 months). For the stroke patients, one visit occurred in
   their subacute window (10 days to 6 months after stroke onset), the
   other took place in their chronic window (>6 months after stroke). Using
   a mid-order group ICA method on 10-minutes eyes-closed resting-state
   fMRI data, we assessed the frequency distributions of a component's
   representative time-courses for differences in regards to slow-5
   spectral power. First, our stroke patients, in their subacute stage,
   exhibited lower amplitude slow-5 oscillations in comparison to their
   healthy counterparts. Second, over time in their chronic stage, those
   same patients showed a recovery of those oscillations, reaching near
   equivalence to the healthy older adult group. Our results indicate the
   possibility of an eventual recovery of those initially disrupted network
   oscillations to a near-normal level, providing potentially a biomarker
   for stroke recovery of the cortical system. This finding opens new
   avenues in infra-slow oscillation research and could serve as a useful
   biomarker in future treatments aimed at recovery. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{A numerical model was developed which describes the combined phenomena
   occurring during an ice cream meltdown test which is a test used by ice
   cream producers to estimate the quality of ice cream. It is based on the
   measurement of the drip loss and the deformation during melting of an
   ice cream block placed onto a grid at ambient temperature. This
   information is related to the ice cream structure and reflects the
   quality of the product: even partially melted, the ice cream structure
   should retain the liquid phase and show low deformation. The proposed
   model takes into account melting, liquid migration inside the ice cream
   structure (which is considered as an unsaturated porous medium) and
   deformation. The objective in developing the model is to better
   understand the mechanisms of the ice cream structure evolution when it
   is submitted to ambient conditions.
   To describe the multiphysics phenomena first, energy equation is solved
   to describe temperature evolution of the sample. Ice crystal melting was
   computed by using the enthalpic approach. After partial melting, water
   movement inside ice cream structure is predicted by Richard's equation.
   The hydraulic conductivity, the water retention characteristic and the
   differential moisture capacity are the parameters that control water
   movement inside the ice cream. Deformation of the partially melted ice
   cream was described by an elasticity model, Youngs' modulus being
   function of the fraction of melted ice. The set of equations was solved
   using the CFD finite element method implemented in Comsol software. The
   numerical model was validated with experimental results of temperature,
   drip loss and deformation. The model allows determining the main
   parameters, related to product structure, controlling the drip loss.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid crystals (LCs) are widely known for their use in liquid crystal
   displays (LCDs). Indeed, LCDs represent one of the most successful
   technologies developed to date using a responsive soft material: An
   electric field is used to induce a change in ordering of the LC and thus
   a change in optical appearance. Over the past decade, however, research
   has revealed the fundamental underpinnings of potentially far broader
   and more pervasive uses of LCs for the design of responsive soft
   material systems. These systems involve a delicate interplay of the
   effects of surface-induced ordering, elastic strain of LCs, and
   formation of topological defects and are characterized by a chemical
   complexity and diversity of nano-and micrometer-scale geometry that goes
   well beyond that previously investigated. As a reflection of this
   evolution, the community investigating LC-based materials now relies
   heavily on concepts from colloid and interface science. In this context,
   this review describes recent advances in colloidal and interfacial
   phenomena involving LCs that are enabling the design of new classes of
   soft matter that respond to stimuli as broad as light, airborne
   pollutants, bacterial toxins in water, mechanical interactions with
   living cells, molecular chirality, and more. Ongoing efforts hint also
   that the collective properties of LCs (e.g., LC-dispersed colloids)
   will, over the coming decade, yield exciting new classes of driven or
   active soft material systems in which organization (and useful
   properties) emerges during the dissipation of energy.}},

Abstract = {{To solve problems in polymer fluid dynamics, one needs the equations of
   continuity, motion, and energy. The last two equations contain the
   stress tensor and the heat-flux vector for the material. There are two
   ways to formulate the stress tensor: (a) One can write a continuum
   expression for the stress tensor in terms of kinematic tensors, or (b)
   one can select a molecular model that represents the polymer molecule
   and then develop an expression for the stress tensor from kinetic
   theory. The advantage of the kinetic theory approach is that one gets
   information about the relation between the molecular structure of the
   polymers and the rheological properties. We restrict the discussion
   primarily to the simplest stress tensor expressions or constitutive
   equations containing from two to four adjustable parameters, although we
   do indicate how these formulations may be extended to give more
   complicated expressions. We also explore how these simplest expressions
   are recovered as special cases of a more general framework, the Oldroyd
   8-constant model. Studying the simplest models allows us to discover
   which types of empiricisms or molecular models seem to be worth
   investigating further. We also explore equivalences between continuum
   and molecular approaches. We restrict the discussion to several types of
   simple flows, such as shearing flows and extensional flows, which are of
   greatest importance in industrial operations. Furthermore, if these
   simple flows cannot be well described by continuum or molecular models,
   then it is not necessary to lavish time and energy to apply them to more
   complex flow problems.}},

Title = {{F-19-MRI for monitoring human NK cells in vivo}},
Journal = {{ONCOIMMUNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5}},
Abstract = {{The availability of clinical-grade cytokines and artificial
   antigen-presenting cells has accelerated interest in using natural
   killer (NK) cells as adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) for cancer. One of
   the technological shortcomings of translating therapies from animal
   models to clinical application is the inability to effectively and
   non-invasively track these cells after infusion in patients. We have
   optimized the nonradioactive isotope fluorine-19 (F-19) as a means to
   label and track NK cells in preclinical models using magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI). Human NK cells were expanded with interleukin (IL)-2 and
   labeled in vitro with increasing concentrations of F-19. Doses as low as
   2 mg/mL F-19 were detected by MRI. NK cell viability was only decreased
   at 8 mg/mL F-19. No effects on NK cell cytotoxicity against K562
   leukemia cells were observed with 2, 4 or 8 mg/mL F-19. Higher doses of
   F-19, 4 mg/mL and 8 mg/mL, led to an improved F-19 signal by MRI with 3
   x 10(11) F-19 atoms per NK cell. The 4 mg/mL F-19 labeling had no effect
   on NK cell function via secretion of granzyme B or interferon gamma (IFN
   gamma), compared to NK cells exposed to vehicle alone. F-19-labeled NK
   cells were detectable immediately by MRI after intratumoral injection in
   NSG mice and up to day 8. When F-19-labeled NK cells were injected
   subcutaneously, we observed a loss of signal through time at the site of
   injection suggesting NK cell migration to distant organs. The F-19
   perfluorocarbon is a safe and effective reagent for monitoring the
   persistence and trafficking of NK cell infusions in vivo, and may have
   potential for developing novel imaging techniques to monitor ACT for
   cancer.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to develop a methodology for targeted
   pavement friction data collection based on the analysis of
   weather-related crashes. Furthermore, the aim was to identify threshold
   values of pavement friction characteristics indicating a significant
   impact on safety prompting the need for maintenance and improvements.
   Spatial analysis using Local Moran's I statistic identified hotspots
   where pavement friction data were collected. A master database was
   assembled including Wisconsin State Trunk Network (STN) road attributes,
   hotspots of weather- related crashes, and pavement friction data
   collected based on hotspot analysis. The analysis results provide
   evidence in support of hotspot analysis as a viable procedure for
   targeted pavement friction data collection to enable efficiency and cost
   reductions. Classification tree analysis using GUIDE (Generalized,
   Unbiased, Interaction Detection and Estimation) algorithm was used to
   further explore the relationship between pavement friction
   characteristics and safety. Statistically significant hotspots were
   observed below a pavement friction number of approximately 57 and very
   high hotspots below a pavement friction number of approximately 42. The
   results indicate that pavement friction thresholds identified in the
   literature between 20 and 32 may be too low and that safety may be
   impacted at friction numbers as high as in the forties. The results also
   show differences in friction and safety for various types of pavement
   surfaces. The use of weather-related crashes provides a data-driven and
   cost-effective method of prioritizing locations for pavement friction
   data collection and maintenance. Results from this research can be
   readily used in initial steps of systemic road safety management
   procedures by practitioners.}},

Title = {{The application of halloysite tubule nanoclay in drug delivery}},
Journal = {{EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DELIVERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{977-986}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Natural and biocompatible clay nanotubes are among the
   best inorganic materials for drug nanoformulations. These halloysite
   tubes with SiO2 on the outermost surface have diameter of ca. 50 nm,
   length around 1 micrometer and may be loaded with drugs at 10-30 wt. \%.
   Narrow tube openings allow for controllable sustained drug release for
   hours, days or even weeks.
   Areas covered: Physical-chemical properties of these nanotubes are
   described followed by examples of drug-loading capabilities, release
   characteristics, and control of duration of release through the end tube
   capping with polymers. Development of halloysite-polymer composites such
   as tissue scaffolds and bone cement/dentist resin formulations with
   enhanced mechanical properties and extension of the drug release to 2-3
   weeks are described. Examples of the compression properties of
   halloysite in tablets and capsules are also shown.
   Expert opinion: We expect that clay nanotubes will be used primarily for

Abstract = {{We study the chance-constrained vehicle routing problem (CCVRP), a
   version of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) with stochastic demands,
   where a limit is imposed on the probability that each vehicle's capacity

   that they allow correlation between random demands, whereas nearly all
   existing methods for the stochastic VRP require independent demands. We
   first study an edge-based formulation for the CCVRP, in particular
   addressing the challenge of how to determine a lower bound on the number
   of trucks required to serve a subset of customers. We then investigate
   the use of a branch-and-cut-and-price (BCP) algorithm. While BCP
   algorithms have been considered the state of the art in solving the
   deterministic VRP, few attempts have been made to extend this framework
   to the stochastic VRP.}},

Abstract = {{We study valid inequalities for a set relevant for optimization models
   that have both binary indicator variables, which indicate positivity of
   associated continuous variables, and separable concave constraints. Such
   models reduce to a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) when the concave
   constraints are ignored, and to a nonconvex global optimization problem
   when the binary restrictions are ignored. In algorithms to solve such
   problems to global optimality, relaxations are traditionally obtained by
   using valid inequalities for the MILP ignoring the concave constraints,
   and by independently relaxing each concave constraint using the secant
   obtained from the bounds of the associated variable. We propose a
   technique to obtain valid inequalities that are based on both the MILP
   and the concave constraints. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional set
   that contains a single binary indicator variable, a single concave
   constraint, and three continuous variables. Using this analysis, for the
   canonical Single Node Flow Set (SNFS), we demonstrate how to ``tilt{''}
   a given valid inequality for the SNFS to obtain additional valid
   inequalities that account for separable concave functions of the arc
   flows. We present computational results demonstrating the utility of the
   new inequalities on a fixed plus concave cost transportation problem. To
   our knowledge, this is one of the first works that simultaneously
   convexifies both nonconvex functions and binary variables to strengthen
   the relaxations of practical mixed integer nonlinear programs.}},

   techniques and their adaptation to multi-culture (including three or

   conditioned media, direct contact, and indirect interactions have been
   informative, we examined many advances that have been made more recently

Abstract = {{Currently, the urban road traffic congestion is serious and the traffic
   accident is happening at a high frequency; thus it has not satisfied the
   travel needs of security and affects the quality of urban trips. In
   order to effectively relieve the confliction of people and motor
   vehicle, to make sure of the safety of pedestrians crossing the road,
   and to improve the capacity of urban roads, this passage focuses on
   studying the influence of pedestrians crossing the roads on the capacity
   of urban roads in three pedestrian crossing approaches including freely
   crossing the street, uncontrolled crossing of the pedestrian crosswalk,
   and controlled crossing of the pedestrian crosswalk. Firstly, it
   confirms the general formula of the road capacity when pedestrians are
   crossing the road based on three preassumptions, combined with the
   survey data, and then constructs the empirical mathematical model of
   pedestrian crossing on the capacity impact. Lastly, it takes the step of
   case calculation and simulation evaluation and calculates errors between
   them, finding that the error between the model calculation and software
   simulation is small. The efficiency of the model is validated and
   improved.}},

Abstract = {{A conventional 3D/4D digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) requires two
   rotational acquisitions (mask and fill) to compute the log-subtracted
   projections that are used to reconstruct a 3D/4D volume. Since all of
   the vascular information is contained in the fill acquisition, it is
   hypothesized that it is possible to reduce the x-ray dose of the mask
   acquisition substantially and still obtain subtracted projections
   adequate to reconstruct a 3D/4D volume with noise level comparable to a
   full dose acquisition. A full dose mask and fill acquisition were
   acquired from a clinical study to provide a known full dose reference
   reconstruction. Gaussian noise was added to the mask acquisition to
   simulate a mask acquisition acquired at 10\% relative dose. Noise in the
   low-dose mask projections was reduced with a weighted edge preserving
   (WEP) filter designed to preserve bony edges while suppressing noise. 2D
   log-subtracted projections were computed from the filtered low-dose mask
   and full-dose fill projections, and then 3D/4D-DSA reconstruction
   algorithms were applied. Additional bilateral filtering was applied to
   the 3D volumes. The signal-to-noise ratio measured in the filtered
   3D/4D-DSA volumes was compared to the full dose case. The average ratio
   of filtered low-dose SNR to full-dose SNR was 1.07 for the 3D-DSA and
   1.05 for the 4D-DSA, indicating the method is a feasible approach to
   restoring SNR in DSA scans acquired with a low-dose mask. The method was
   also tested in a phantom study with full dose fill and 22\% dose mask.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and artifact free reconstruction of tomographic images requires
   precise knowledge of the imaging system geometry. This work proposes a
   novel projection matrix (P-matrix) based calibration method to enable
   C-arm inverse geometry CT (IGCT). The method is evaluated for
   scanning-beam digital x-ray (SBDX), a C-arm mounted inverse geometry
   fluoroscopic technology. A helical configuration of fiducials is imaged
   at each gantry angle in a rotational acquisition. For each gantry angle,
   digital tomosynthesis is performed at multiple planes and a composite
   image analogous to a cone-beam projection is generated from the plane
   stack. The geometry of the C-arm, source array, and detector array is
   determined at each angle by constructing a parameterized 3D-to-2D
   projection matrix that minimizes the sum-of-squared deviations between
   measured and projected fiducial coordinates. Simulations were used to
   evaluate calibration performance with translations and rotations of the
   source and detector. In a geometry with 1 mm translation of the central
   ray relative to the axis-of-rotation and 1 degree yaw of the detector
   and source arrays, the maximum error in the recovered translational
   parameters was 0.4 mm and maximum error in the rotation parameter was
   0.02 degrees. The relative root mean-square error in a reconstruction of
   a numerical thorax phantom was 0.4\% using the calibration method,
   versus 7.7\% without calibration. Changes in source-detector-distance
   were the most challenging to estimate. Reconstruction of experimental
   SBDX data using the proposed method eliminated double contour artifacts
   present in a non-calibrated reconstruction. The proposed IGCT geometric
   calibration method reduces image artifacts when uncertainties exist in
   system geometry.}},

Abstract = {{Dual-energy CT (DECT) imaging has gained a lot of attenuation because of
   its capability to discriminate materials. We proposes a flexible DECT
   scan strategy which can be realized on a system with general X-ray
   sources and detectors. In order to lower dose and scanning time, our
   DECT acquires two projections data sets on two arcs of limited-angular
   coverage (one for each energy) respectively. Meanwhile, a certain number
   of rays from two data sets form conjugate sampling pairs. Our
   reconstruction method for such a DECT scan mainly tackles the consequent
   limited-angle problem. Using the idea of artificial neural network, we
   excavate the connection between projections at two different energies by
   constructing a relationship between the linear attenuation coefficient
   of the high energy and that of the low one. We use this relationship to
   cross-estimate missing projections and reconstruct attenuation images
   from an augmented data set including projections at views covered by
   itself (projections collected in scanning) and by the other energy
   (projections estimated) for each energy respectively.
   Validated by our numerical experiment on a dental phantom with rather
   complex structures, our DECT is effective in recovering small structures
   in severe limited-angle situations. This DECT scanning strategy can much
   broaden DECT design in reality.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we present an easy-to-implement Multi-energy CT
   scanning strategy and a corresponding reconstruction method, which
   facilitate spectral CT imaging by improving the data effciency the
   number-of-energy-channel fold without introducing visible limited-angle
   artifacts caused by reducing projection views. Leveraging the structure
   coherence at different energies, we first pre-reconstruct a prior
   structure information image using projection data from all energy
   channels. Then, we perform a k-means clustering on the prior image to
   generate a sparse dictionary representation for the image, which severs
   as a structure information constraint. We combine this constraint with
   conventional compressed sensing method and proposed a new model which we
   referred as Joint Clustering Prior and Sparsity Regularization (CPSR).
   CPSR is a convex problem and we solve it by Alternating Direction Method
   of Multipliers (ADMM).
   We verify our CPSR reconstruction method with a numerical simulation
   experiment. A dental phantom with complicate structures of teeth and
   soft tissues is used. X-ray beams from three spectra of different peak
   energies (120kVp, 90kVp, 60kVp) irradiate the phantom to form tri-energy
   projections. Projection data covering only 75 degrees from each energy
   spectrum are collected for reconstruction. Independent reconstruction
   for each energy will cause severe limited-angle artifacts even with the
   help of compressed sensing approaches. Our CPSR provides us with images
   free of the limited-angle artifact. All edge details are well preserved
   in our experimental study.}},

Abstract = {{Grating-coupled, surface-emitting (GCSE) quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs)
   are demonstrated with high-power, single-lobe surface emission. A
   2nd-order Au-semiconductor distributed-feedback (DFB)/
   distributed-Bragg-reflector (DBR) grating is used for feedback and
   out-coupling. The DFB and DBR grating regions are 2.55 mm- and 1.28
   mm-long, respectively, for a total grating length of 5.1 mm. The lasers
   are designed to operate in a symmetric longitudinal mode by causing
   resonant coupling of the guided optical mode to the antisymmetric
   surface-plasmon modes of the 2nd-order metal/semiconductor grating. In
   turn, the antisymmetric longitudinal modes are strongly absorbed by the
   metal in the grating, causing the symmetric longitudinal mode to be
   favored to lase, which produces a single lobe beam over a grating
   duty-cycle range of 36-41 \%. Simulations indicate that the symmetric
   mode is always favored to lase, independent of the random phase of
   residual reflections from the device's cleaved ends. Peak pulsed output
   powers of similar to 0.4 W were measured with single-lobe, single-mode
   operation near 4.75 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{By stepwise tapering both the barrier heights and quantum-well depths in
   the active regions of 8.7 mu m- and 8.4 mu m-emitting quantum cascade
   lasers (QCLs) virtually complete carrier-leakage suppression is
   achieved, as evidenced by high values for both the threshold-current
   characteristic temperature coefficient T-0 (283 K and 242 K) and the
   slope-efficiency characteristic temperature coefficient T-1 (561 K and
   279 K), over the 20-60 degrees C heatsink-temperature range, for low-
   and high-doped devices, respectively. Such high values are obtained
   while the threshold-current density is kept relatively low for
   35-period, low- and high-doped devices: 1.58 kA/cm(2) and 1.88 kA/cm2,
   respectively. In addition, due to resonant extraction from the lower
   laser level, high differential-transition-efficiency values (89-90\%)
   are obtained. In turn, the slope-efficiency for 3 mm-long, 35-period
   high-reflectivity (HR)-coated devices are: 1.15-1.23 W/A; that is, 30-40
   \% higher than for same-geometry and similar-doping conventional 8-9 mu
   m-emitting QCLs. As a result of both efficient carrier-leakage
   suppression as well as fast and efficient carrier extraction, the values
   for the internal differential efficiency are found to be approximate to
   86\%, by comparison to typical values in the 58-67 \% range for
   conventional QCLs emitting in the 7-11 mu m wavelength range.}},

Abstract = {{Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is not commonly used to study lake ice,
   and in general, the ground-based use of radar frequencies greater than
   500 MHz in cryosphere geophysics is rare, due to a general interest in
   deeper stratigraphy and the difficulty of extensive profiling over rough
   snow surfaces. Our goal was to find further information on the origin of
   the deposition and formation of intra-ice layers, bottom topography, and
   subbottom deposits using GPR with pulses centered near 850 MHz on two
   permanently ice-covered lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica.
   The profiles were obtained using a one-person sled operation over Lake
   Bonney, which is typical of lakes in the region, having an ice thickness
   that ranges between 3 and 5 m, and Lake Vida, where the maximum ice
   depth is at least 27 m. Lake Bonney exhibits a semicontinuous sediment
   horizon at approximately a 2-m depth and several minor horizons. In
   contrast, Lake Vida contains unconformably eroded and folded continuous
   reflection horizons, packages of minor horizons between major horizons,
   evidence of incised fluvial deposition along the bottom, and subbottom
   penetration of at least 4.5 m in some areas. Where the ice thickness is
   less than 20 m, the lake is frozen to the bottom. Most horizon waveform
   phase attributes indicate relatively lower permittivity than in the
   surrounding matrix. Consequently, we interpreted these strata to be
   caused by layers of pure ice embedded within a salty and dirty ice
   matrix, which were formed during minor flooding. These findings
   supported previous conclusions that Lake Vida ice formed from surface
   runoff in combination with periods of ablation.}},

Title = {{Trends and abrupt changes in 104 years of ice cover and water
   temperature in a dimictic lake in response to air temperature, wind
   speed, and water clarity drivers}},

Abstract = {{The one-dimensional hydrodynamic ice model, DYRESM-WQ-I, was modified to
   simulate ice cover and thermal structure of dimictic Lake Mendota,
   Wisconsin, USA, over a continuous 104-year period (1911-2014). The model
   results were then used to examine the drivers of changes in ice cover
   and water temperature, focusing on the responses to shifts in air
   temperature, wind speed, and water clarity at multiyear timescales.
   Observations of the drivers include a change in the trend of warming air
   temperatures from 0.081 degrees C per decade before 1981 to 0.334
   degrees C per decade thereafter, as well as a shift in mean wind speed
   from 4.44 ms(-1) before 1994 to 3.74 ms(-1) thereafter. Observations
   show that Lake Mendota has experienced significant changes in ice cover:
   later ice-on date(9.0 days later per century), earlier ice-off date
   (12.3 days per century), decreasing ice cover duration (21.3 days per
   century), while model simulations indicate a change in maximum ice
   thickness (12.7 cm decrease per century). Model simulations also show
   changes in the lake thermal regime of earlier stratification onset (12.3
   days per century), later fall turnover (14.6 days per century), longer
   stratification duration (26.8 days per century), and decreasing summer
   hypolimnetic temperatures (-1.4 degrees C per century). Correlation
   analysis of lake variables and driving variables revealed ice cover
   variables, stratification onset, epilimnetic temperature, and
   hypolimnetic temperature were most closely correlated with air
   temperature, whereas freeze-over water temperature, hypolimnetic
   heating, and fall turnover date were more closely correlated with wind
   speed. Each lake variable (i.e., ice-on and ice-off dates, ice cover
   duration, maximum ice thickness, freeze-over water temperature,
   stratification onset, fall turnover date, stratification duration,
   epilimnion temperature, hypolimnion temperature, and hypolimnetic
   heating) was averaged for the three periods (1911-1980, 1981-1993, and
   1994-2014) delineated by abrupt changes in air temperature and wind
   speed. Average summer hypolimnetic temperature and fall turnover date
   exhibit significant differences between the third period and the first
   two periods. Changes in ice cover (ice-on and ice-off dates, ice cover
   duration, and maximum ice thickness) exhibit an abrupt change after
   1994, which was related in part to the warm El Nino winter of 1997-1998.
   Under-ice water temperature, freeze-over water temperature, hypolimnetic
   temperature, fall turnover date, and stratification duration demonstrate
   a significant difference in the third period (1994-2014), when air
   temperature was warmest and wind speeds decreased rather abruptly. The
   trends in ice cover and water temperature demonstrate responses to both
   long-term and abrupt changes in meteorological conditions that can be
   complemented with numerical modeling to better understand how these
   variables will respond in a future climate.}},

Pages = {{452-466}},
Abstract = {{When patient anatomy is positioned away from a CT scanner's isocenter,
   scans of limited diagnostic value may result. Yet in some cases,
   positioning of patient anatomy far from isocenter is unavoidable. This
   study examines the effect of position and reconstruction algorithm on
   image resolution achieved by a CT scanner operating in a high resolution
   (HR) scan mode which incorporates focal spot deflection and acquires an
   increased number of projections per rotation. Images of a metal bead
   contained in a phantom were acquired on a GE CT750 HD scanner with
   multiple reconstruction algorithms, in the normal and HR scan mode, and
   at two positions, scanner isocenter and 15 cm directly above isocenter.
   The images of the metal bead yielded two-dimensional point spread
   functions which were averaged along two perpendicular directions to
   yield line spread functions. Fourier transforms of the line spread
   functions yielded radial and azimuthal modulation transfer functions
   (MTFs). At isocenter, the radial and azimuthal MTFs were averaged. MTF
   improvement depended on image position and modulation direction. The
   results from a single algorithm, Edge, can be generalized to other
   algorithms. At isocenter, the 10\% MTF cutoff was 14.4 cycles/cm in
   normal and HR mode. At 15 cm above isocenter, the 10\% cutoff was 6.0
   and 8.5 cycles/cm for the azimuthal and radial MTFs in normal mode. In
   HR mode, the azimuthal and radial MTF 10\% cutoff was 8.3 and 10.3
   cycles/cm. Our results indicate that the best image resolution is
   achieved at scanner isocenter and that the azimuthal resolution degrades
   more significantly than the radial resolution. For the GE CT750 HD CT
   scanner, the resolution is significantly enhanced by the HR scan mode
   away from scanner isocenter, and the use of the HR scan mode has much
   more of an impact on image resolution away from isocenter than the
   choice of algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) hold great
   potential in many areas of research such as cardiac tissue regeneration,
   cardiotoxicity screening and human heart disease models; however, before
   any of these applications can be realized, hESC-CMs need to progress
   from an immature phenotype to one that more closely resembles their
   adult counterparts in vivo. Current immature hESC-CMs can be
   characterized by their rounded morphology, disorganized contractile
   apparatus and circumferential gap junction expression. In an effort to
   improve the maturation of hESCCMs, prior work in our lab used
   micropatterned lanes of Matrigel and fibronectin extracellular matrix
   proteins on glass slides to control cell shape. From these experiments
   it was found that widths ranging from 30 to 80 mu m promoted the best
   sarcomere development and nuclear alignment in a pure population of
   hESC-CMs. In this new system, a pure population of hESCCMs are seeded
   onto lanes of Matrigel on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to investigate the
   portability of this technique to other substrate systems and how the
   substrate stimuli influences maturation. The same trend in nuclear
   alignment and sarcomere organization with lane width was observed when
   hESC-CMs were seeded onto lanes of Matrigel on PDMS as was found in the
   experiments utilizing glass as the substrate. By restricting cell
   adhesion and controlling substrate stiffness it may be possible to
   enhance the maturation of hESC-CMs in vitro which will provide a more
   physiological relevant phenotype that can then be used in the
   aforementioned applications.}},

Title = {{Enhancing radiative energy transfer through thermal extraction}},
Journal = {{NANOPHOTONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{22-30}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Thermal radiation plays an increasingly important role in many emerging
   energy technologies, such as thermophotovoltaics, passive radiative
   cooling and wearable cooling clothes {[}1]. One of the fundamental
   constraints in thermal radiation is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which
   limits the maximum power of far-field radiation to P-0 = sigma(TS)-S-4,
   where sigma is the Boltzmann constant, S and T are the area and the
   temperature of the emitter, respectively (Fig. 1a). In order to overcome
   this limit, it has been shown that near-field radiations could have an
   energy density that is orders of magnitude greater than the
   Stefan-Boltzmann law {[}2-7]. Unfortunately, such near-field radiation
   transfer is spatially confined and cannot carry radiative heat to the
   far field. Recently, a new concept of thermal extraction was proposed
   {[}8] to enhance far-field thermal emission, which, conceptually,
   operates on a principle similar to oil immersion lenses and light
   extraction in light-emitting diodes using solid immersion lens to
   increase light output {[}62]. Thermal extraction allows a black-body to
   radiate more energy to the far field than the apparent limit of the
   Stefan-Boltzmann law without breaking the second law of thermodynamics.
   Thermal extraction works by using a specially designed thermal extractor
   to convert and guide the near-field energy to the far field, as shown in
   Fig. 1b. The same blackbody as shown in Fig. 1a is placed closely below
   the thermal extractor with a spacing smaller than the thermal
   wavelength. The near-field coupling transfers radiative energy with a
   density greater than sigma T-4. The thermal extractor, made from
   transparent and high-index or structured materials, does not emit or
   absorb any radiation. It transforms the near-field energy and sends it
   toward the far field. As a result, the total amount of far-field
   radiative heat dissipated by the same blackbody is greatly enhanced
   above S sigma T-4, where S is the area of the emitter. This paper will
   review the progress in thermal extraction. It is organized as follows.
   In Section 1, we will discuss the theory of thermal extraction {[}8]. In
   Section 2, we review an experimental implementation based on natural
   materials as the thermal extractor {[}8]. Lastly, in Section 3, we
   review the experiment that uses structured metamaterials as thermal
   extractors to enhance optical density of states and far-field emission
   {[}9].}},

   poly(4-tert-butylstyrene-block-2-vinylpyridine) to pattern high density

   temperature allows thermal annealing to drive the assembly of ordered
   2-vinylpyridine cylinders that can be selectively complexed with the
   organometallic precursor trimethylaluminum. This unique chemistry
   converts organic 2-vinylpyridine cylinders into alumina nanowires with
   diameters ranging from 8 to 11 nm, depending on the copolymer molecular
   weight. Graphoepitaxy of this block copolymer aligns and registers
   sub-12 nm diameter nanowires to larger-scale rectangular, curved, and
   circular features patterned by optical lithography. The alumina
   nanowires function as a robust hard mask to withstand the conditions

Abstract = {{Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) combustion in a
   light-duty multi-cylinder engine over transient operating conditions
   using fast response exhaust UHCI, NO and PM measurement instruments was
   investigated. RCCI has demonstrated improvements in efficiency along
   with low NOx and PM emissions by utilizing in-cylinder fuel blending,
   generally using two fuels with different reactivity in order to optimize
   stratification. In the present work, a ``single-fuel{''} approach for
   RCCI combustion using port-injected gasoline and direct-injected
   gasoline mixed with a small amount of the cetane improver 2-ethyihexyl
   nitrate (EHN) was studied with custom designed, compression ratio of
   13.75:1, pistons under transient conditions. The EHN volume percentage
   in the mixture for the direct-injected fuel was set at 3\%. In an
   experimental investigation, comparisons were made to transient RCCI
   combustion operation with gasoline/diesel. The experiments were
   performed over a step load change from 1 to 4 bar brake mean effective
   pressure (BMEP) at constant 1,500 rev/min on a General Motors Z19DTH 1.9
   liter diesel engine The transients were conducted by changing the
   accelerator pedal command to provide a desired torque output with a
   DRIVVEN engine control unit (ECU) that replaced the original Bosch ECU.
   All relevant engine parameters are adjusted accordingly, based on
   2D-tables. Previous to the transient engine operation, 4 steady-state
   points were used to obtain performance and emission values. Engine
   calibration at these 4 points, as well as the interpolation of the
   intermediate points, allowed for smooth operation during the
   instantaneous step changes. Differences between the steady-state and
   transient results indicate the complexity of transient operation and
   show the need for additional controls to minimize undesirable effects.
   The steady-state points were calibrated by modifying the fuel injection
   strategy (actual Start of Injection (aSOI) timing, port fuel injection
   (PH) fraction, etc.), EGR and rail pressure in order to obtain
   predefined values for the crank angle at 50\% of total heat release
   (CA50). Furthermore, emission targets (HQ(1) < 1500ppmC3, NO < 10ppm,
   FSN < 0.1 with a maximum pressure rise rate < 10bar/deg) and noise level
   targets (<95dB) for RCCI combustion were maintained during the
   calibration and mapping. The tests were performed with a closed-loop
   (CL) calibration by using a next-cycle (NC) controller to adjust the PFI
   ratio of each cycle in order to reach the steady-state CA50 values in
   the table. The results show that single-fuel RCCI operation can be
   achieved, but requires significant alteration of the operating
   conditions, and NOx emissions were significantly elevated for
   gasoline/gasoline-EHN operation. While combustion phasing could not be
   matched, UHCI emissions were at a similar level as for gasoline/diesel
   combustion. It is expected that the implementation of different
   injection strategies and boosted operation, combined with use of higher
   compression ratio pistons in order to compensate for the lower
   reactivity direct injection (DI) fuel, could raise the potential for

Abstract = {{Due to growing interest in utilizing natural gas as an alternative fuel
   in internal combustion engines, a study on the use of natural gas for
   dual-fuel combustion strategies in a heavy-duty engine was performed to
   examine the diesel pilot ignition (DPI) and reactivity controlled
   compression ignition (RCCI) combustion strategies. In Part 1 of this
   work, the transition between the DPI and RCCI combustion regimes was
   studied via the direct control of the SOI timing. At the relatively rich
   condition of phi = 0.72, the performance of both combustion strategies
   was comparable. In Part 2 of this work, the effect of the equivalence
   ratio on each combustion regime was examined. It was observed that at
   richer conditions the performance of each combustion regime was similar.
   However as the conditions became leaner, the performance improved for
   RCCI combustion and was degraded for DPI combustion. In Part 3 of this
   work, the effect of fueling rate was explored at a relatively lean
   operating condition (phi = 0.52). It was seen that the fueling rate has
   little effect on the combustion performance as the engine load was
   increased. The strong influence of the equivalence ratio on the
   combustion performance of the RCCI and DPI combustion strategies
   indicates the both combustion regimes are recommended to engine
   applications with air handling systems which generate relatively rich
   in-cylinder conditions; for engine applications with air handling
   systems which allow for relatively lean in-cylinder conditions, the RCCI
   combustion regime is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{The Kelvin-Helmholtz/Rayleigh-Taylor (KH-RT) wave breakup model is a
   commonly used model in predicting primary and secondary atomization and
   breakup processes in Lagrangian-Eulerian Diesel spray simulations.
   Droplet sizes predicted by :this model are dependent on several
   parameters. The parameters include fuel physical properties, such as
   density, viscosity, and surface tension, and a number of adjustable
   model constants, such as KH and RT time constants, KH and RT size
   constants, and the breakup length constant. The purpose of this study is
   to investigate the effects of these parameters on predicting spray
   motions using large-eddy simulation with the dynamic structure sub-grid
   stress model. The code used in this study is OpenFOAM. This study has
   three major parts. Firstly, effects of the model constants on the
   prediction of momentum exchange process were examined by comparing
   liquid and gas momentum fluxes. Drag Forces exerted on liquid spray by
   gas phase can be determined from the slopes of gas and liquid momentum
   fluxes plotted against axial distance. We found that the prediction of
   momentum exchange between gas and liquid is most sensitive to the KH
   time constant, B-1, among the other model constants. Secondly, effects
   of fuel physical properties were investigated by using four different
   fuels in the simulations of non-vaporizing and vaporizing sprays. The
   four fuels used were n-dodecane, F76 fuel, n-hexadecane, and methyl
   tetradecanoate. The F76 fuel is a multi-component fuel containing
   twenty-one hydrocarbons. Global spray quantities such as liquid and
   vapor penetrations, Sauter mean diameter, total liquid mass, number of
   parcels, and breakup model quantities such as Ohnesorge number and KH
   wave speed were compared. The key finding is that not all of these
   quantities monotonically increase or decrease with fuel molecular
   weight. Lastly, effects of fuel physical properties on sensitivities of
   the breakup model constants were studied. We compared liquid penetration
   and vapor penetration for each fuel using different values of the model
   constants. We found that the prediction of vapor penetrations is more
   sensitive to the KH time constant B-1 when a fuel with lighter molecular
   weight was used, and the prediction of liquid penetrations is sensitive
   to the breakup length constant, C-b, in all of the four fuels. The
   computational investigations in this study reveal some limitations of
   the current spray breakup model, and motivate us to develop more
   advanced models to overcome these limitations.}},

Title = {{Resolving ice cloud optical thickness biases between CALIOP and MODIS
   using infrared retrievals}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Pages = {{5075-5090}},
Abstract = {{Despite its importance as one of the key radiative properties that
   determines the impact of upper tropospheric clouds on the radiation
   balance, ice cloud optical thickness (IOT) has proven to be one of the
   more challenging properties to retrieve from space-based remote sensing
   measurements. In particular, optically thin upper tropospheric ice
   clouds (cirrus) have been especially challenging due to their tenuous
   nature, extensive spatial scales, and complex particle shapes and
   light-scattering characteristics. The lack of independent validation
   motivates the investigation presented in this paper, wherein systematic
   biases between MODIS Collection 5 (C5) and CALIOP Version 3 (V3)
   unconstrained retrievals of tenuous IOT (< 3) are examined using a month
   of collocated A-Train observations. An initial comparison revealed a
   factor of 2 bias between the MODIS and CALIOP IOT retrievals. This bias
   is investigated using an infrared (IR) radiative closure approach that
   compares both products with MODIS IR cirrus retrievals developed for
   this assessment. The analysis finds that both the MODIS C5 and the
   unconstrained CALIOP V3 retrievals are biased (high and low,
   respectively) relative to the IR IOT retrievals. Based on this finding,
   the MODIS and CALIOP algorithms are investigated with the goal of
   explaining and minimizing the biases relative to the IR. For MODIS we
   find that the assumed ice single-scattering properties used for the C5
   retrievals are not consistent with the mean IR COT distribution. The C5
   ice scattering database results in the asymmetry parameter (g) varying
   as a function of effective radius with mean values that are too large.
   The MODIS retrievals have been brought into agreement with the IR by
   adopting a new ice scattering model for Collection 6 (C6) consisting of
   a modified gamma distribution comprised of a single habit (severely
   roughened aggregated columns); the C6 ice cloud optical property models
   have a constant g a parts per thousand 0.75 in the mid-visible spectrum,
   5-15aEuro-\% smaller than C5. For CALIOP, the assumed lidar ratio for
   unconstrained retrievals is fixed at 25aEuro-sr for the V3 data
   products. This value is found to be inconsistent with the constrained
   (predominantly nighttime) CALIOP retrievals. An experimental data set
   was produced using a modified lidar ratio of 32aEuro-sr for the
   unconstrained retrievals (an increase of 28aEuro-\%), selected to
   provide consistency with the constrained V3 results. These modifications
   greatly improve the agreement with the IR and provide consistency
   between the MODIS and CALIOP products. Based on these results the
   recently released MODIS C6 optical products use the single-habit
   distribution given above, while the upcoming CALIOP V4 unconstrained
   algorithm will use higher lidar ratios for unconstrained retrievals.}},

Abstract = {{In today's global business environment, an effective and reliable supply
   chain substantially increases a company's competitive advantage. Supply
   chain management has played a crucial role in a business's success.
   Optimization has been sought to model and solve many of these supply
   chain problems. However, as the size of the optimization model grows,
   the difficulty of finding the optimal or near-optimal solution typically
   grows exponentially. Nested partitions is one of the algorithms
   developed to tackle these large-scale optimization problems. In this
   chapter, the nested partitions method, and its implementation in two
   critical supply chain problems, are reviewed. One problem is the
   intermodal hub location problem, a special case of facility location
   problems, and the other is the multilevel capacitated lot-sizing problem
   with backlogging, a complex problem in production planning. The
   computational results show that the hybrid nested partitions approaches
   are superior to standard mathematical programming and specialized
   heuristic approaches, and thus provide an effective alternative in
   enhancing supply chain performance.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{819-825}},
Abstract = {{Platelets contain an abundance of growth factors that mimic the
   composition of the wound healing milieu, and platelet-derived VEGF in
   particular can negatively influence wound healing if unregulated. Here,
   we sought to capture and regulate the activity of VEGF factor from human
   platelets using poly(ethylene glycol) microspheres. In this
   communication, we demonstrate that platelet freeze/thaw produced
   significantly higher levels of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)
   than either calcium chloride treatment, protease activated receptor 1
   activating peptide (PAR1AP) treatment, or thrombin treatment. PEG
   microspheres containing a VEGF-binding peptide (VBP), derived from
   VEGFR2, sequestered VEGF from platelet concentrate, prepared via
   freeze/thaw, and reduced the bioactivity of platelet concentrate in
   HUVEC culture, which suggests that VBP microspheres sequestered and
   reduced the activity of VEGF from patient-derived platelets. Here, we
   demonstrate the ability of VEGF sequestering microspheres to regulate
   the activity of VEGF derived from a growth factor-rich autologous human

Title = {{Leveraging a high resolution microfluidic assay reveals insights into
   pathogenic fungal spore germination}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{603-615}},
Abstract = {{Germination of spores into actively growing cells is a process essential
   for survival and pathogenesis of many microbes. Molecular mechanisms
   governing germination, however, are poorly understood in part because
   few tools exist for evaluating and interrogating the process. Here, we
   introduce an assay that leverages developments in microfluidic
   technology and image processing to quantitatively measure germination
   with unprecedented resolution, assessing both individual cells and the
   population as a whole. Using spores from Cryptococcus neoformans, a
   leading cause of fatal fungal disease in humans, we developed a platform
   to evaluate spores as they undergo morphological changes during
   differentiation into vegetatively growing yeast. The assay uses
   pipet-accessible microdevices that can be arrayed for efficient testing
   of diverse microenvironmental variables, including temperature and
   nutrients. We discovered that temperature influences germination rate, a
   carbon source alone is sufficient to induce germination, and the
   addition of a nitrogen source sustains it. Using this information, we
   optimized the assay for use with fungal growth inhibitors to pinpoint
   stages of germination inhibition. Unexpectedly, the clinical antifungal
   drugs amphotericin B and fluconazole did not significantly alter the
   process or timing of the transition from spore to yeast, indicating that
   vegetative growth and germination are distinct processes in C.
   neoformans. Finally, we used the high temporal resolution of the assay
   to determine the precise defect in a slow-germination mutant. Combining
   advances in microfluidics with a robust fungal molecular genetic system
   allowed us to identify and alter key temporal, morphological, and
   molecular events that occur during fungal germination.}},

Title = {{Modeling Left-Turn Driving Behavior at Signalized Intersections with
   Mixed Traffic Conditions}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{In many developing countries, mixed traffic is the most common type of
   urban transportation; traffic of this type faces many major problems in
   traffic engineering, such as conflicts, inefficiency, and security
   issues. This paper focuses on the traffic engineering concerns on the
   driving behavior of left-turning vehicles caused by different degrees of
   pedestrian violations. The traffic characteristics of left-turning
   vehicles and pedestrians in the affected region at a signalized
   intersection were analyzed and a cellular-automata-based
   ``following-conflict{''} driving behavior model that mainly addresses
   four basic behavior modes was proposed to study the conflict and
   behavior mechanisms of left-turning vehicles by mathematic
   methodologies. Four basic driving behavior modes were reproduced in
   computer simulations, and a logit model of the behavior mode choice was
   also developed to analyze the relative share of each behavior mode.
   Finally, the microscopic characteristics of driving behaviors and the
   macroscopic parameters of traffic flow in the affected region were all
   determined. These data are important reference for geometry and capacity
   design for signalized intersections. The simulation results show that
   the proposed models are valid and can be used to represent the behavior
   of left-turning vehicles in the case of conflicts with illegally
   crossing pedestrians. These results will have potential applications on
   improving traffic safety and traffic capacity at signalized
   intersections with mixed traffic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Surface properties of tissue engineering scaffolds such as topography,
   hydrophilicity, and functional groups play a vital role in cell
   adhesion, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis. First,
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) shish-kebab scaffolds (PCL-SK), which
   feature a three-dimensional structure comprised of electrospun PCL
   nanotibers covered by periodic, self-induced PCL crystal lamellae on the
   surface, was created to mimic the nanotopography of native collagen
   fibrils in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Second, matrigel was
   covalently immobilized on the surface of alkaline hydrolyzed PCL-SK
   scaffolds to enhance their hydrophilicity. This combined approach not
   only mimics the nanotopography of native collagen fibrils, but also
   simulates the surface features of collagen fibrils for cell growth. To
   investigate the viability of such scaffolds, HEFT fibroblast cell assays
   were conducted and the results revealed that the nanotopography of the
   PCL-SK scaffolds facilitated cell adhesion and proliferation. The
   matrigel functionalization on PCL-SK scaffolds further enhanced cellular
   response, which suggested elevated biocompatibility and greater
   potential for skin tissue engineering applications.}},

   CORN-SILAGE}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{157-167}},
Abstract = {{Two common variants to conventional whole-plant corn silage (WP) are
   high-cut silage (HC) and snaplage (SNPL) which are harvested to alter DM
   content, fiber, and starch contents compared to WP silage. A
   conventional ear-snapper (ES) header is used to harvest SNPL which
   creates a low-fiber, starch-rich feed. However, the plant fractions in
   SNPL can dry quickly, creating issues with digestibility, palatability,
   fermentation, and aerobic stability. Stalk cut-off knives were added to
   the ES header to harvest more leaves and upper stalk to increase SNPL
   fiber content, yield and moisture. The DM content, yield and nutrient
   composition of the resulting material, referred to here as ``toplage{''}
   (TPL), was between that of HC and SNPL. TPL yield averaged 72\% to 77\%
   of WP yield. Compared to HC or WP silages, TPL starch concentration was
   greater but the concentrations of fiber and lignin were less. To offset
   the loss in yield with harvesting only TPL, the biomass remaining after
   TPL was then harvested as a high-fiber roughage feed, referred to here
   as ``stalklage{''} (STKL). STKL was either direct harvested or windrowed
   and then wilted to greater DM content before final harvest. The
   combination of TPL followed by STKL resulted in total yield 3\% to 8\%
   less than achieved with conventional WP silage. Windrowing increased
   STKL yield by collecting more leaves that had been dropped during TPL
   harvest compared to direct cutting, resulting in STKL with greater
   protein and lower fiber content. STKL had similar or better nutrient
   composition than reported values for corn stover harvested after grain
   harvest. Both TPL and STKL fermented well in mini-silos across a wide
   range of DM contents. The stalk cut-off knives are simple to adapt to
   the ES header, and by altering the number of knives, producers can
   easily change corn silage yield, DM content, and nutrient composition,
   offering an alternative to conventional SNPL or WP silages.}},

   carbon uptake}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3711-3726}},
Abstract = {{Carbonyl sulfide (COS) measurements are one of the emerging tools to
   better quantify gross primary production (GPP), the largest flux in the
   global carbon cycle. COS is a gas with a similar structure to CO2; COS
   uptake is thought to be a proxy for GPP. However, soils are a potential
   source or sink of COS. This study presents a framework for understanding
   soil-COS interactions. Excluding wetlands, most of the few observations
   of isolated soils that have been made show small uptake of atmospheric
   COS. Recently, a series of studies at an agricultural site in the
   central United States found soil COS production under hot conditions an
   order of magnitude greater than fluxes at other sites. To investigate
   the extent of this phenomenon, soils were collected from five new sites
   and incubated in a variety of soil moisture and temperature states. We
   found that soils from a desert, an oak savannah, a deciduous forest, and
   a rainforest exhibited small COS fluxes, behavior resembling previous
   studies. However, soil from an agricultural site in Illinois, >
   800aEuro-km away from the initial central US study site, demonstrated
   comparably large soil fluxes under similar conditions. These new data
   suggest that, for the most part, soil COS interaction is negligible
   compared to plant uptake of COS. We present a model that anticipates the
   large agricultural soil fluxes so that they may be taken into account.
   While COS air-monitoring data are consistent with the dominance of plant
   uptake, improved interpretation of these data should incorporate the
   soil flux parameterizations suggested here.}},

Abstract = {{In order to safely negotiate cluttered and dangerous environments,
   firefighters must efficiently and effectively make affordance judgments.
   Failure to do so could put them at risk for slips, trips, and falls,
   which are major causes of injuries for firefighters. We examined how
   well firefighters were able to perceive their obstacle crossing
   abilities while wearing firefighting protective equipment. Firefighters
   were asked to judge whether they could cross over, under, and through
   different obstacles that simulated idealized fireground situations.
   Perceptual judgment errors were found for each obstacle type, the
   largest occurring with an overestimation of ability to pass under an
   obstacle. Years of experience had a moderate positive correlation with
   absolute judgment error in the over and under obstacles. Overall, a
   general lack of awareness of their personal protective equipment for
   obstacle crossing ability was observed. A better understanding of how to
   reduce judgment error while wearing firefighter protective gear would
   likely decrease the risk of injuries on the fireground.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is devoted to modeling, analysis, and improvement of flexible
   manufacturing systems with asynchronous exponential machines and finite
   nondedicated buffers. In such systems, each machine may process multiple
   types of products with different speeds, and buffers are shared for all
   products. Efficient algorithms to evaluate the system performance are
   developed. Formulas are derived to calculate line throughput in one-and
   two-machine lines, and a convergent recursive algorithm is introduced
   for longer lines. The numerical results show that the method leads to a
   high accuracy in performance evaluation. Using such a model, bottleneck
   analysis has been carried out to identify the machine or product whose
   improvement will lead to the largest improvement in system throughput.
   Indicators based on the collected data to identify bottleneck machine
   and product are derived without complete calculation of the partial
   derivatives of system performance. Such efficient algorithms provide a
   quantitative tool for analysis and improvement of flexible manufacturing
   systems.}},

Title = {{Integration of Data Fusion Methodology and Degradation Modeling Process

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of sensing and computing technologies has enabled
   multiple sensors embedded in a system to simultaneously monitor the
   degradation status of an operation unit. This creates a data-rich
   environment for degradation modeling and prognostics that could
   potentially lead to an accurate inference about the remaining lifetime
   of the degraded unit. However, as data collected from multiple sensors
   are often correlated and each sensor data contains only partial
   information about the same degradation process, there is a pressing need
   to develop data fusion methodologies that can integrate the data from
   multiple sensors for better characterizing the stochastic nature of the
   degradation process. Unlike other existing data fusion methodologies
   that treat the fusion procedure and the degradation modeling as two
   separate tasks, this paper aims at solving these two challenging
   problems in a unified manner. Specifically, we develop a methodology to
   construct a health index via fusion of multiple degradation-based sensor
   data. Our goal is that the developed health index provides a much better
   characterization of the condition of the unit and thus leads to a better
   prediction of the remaining lifetime. A case study that involves a
   degradation dataset of an aircraft gas turbine engine is implemented to
   numerically evaluate and compare the prognostic performance of the
   developed health index with existing literature.}},

Abstract = {{C-Arm CT three-dimensional (3-D) digital subtraction angiography (DSA)
   reconstructions cannot provide temporal information to radiologists.
   Four-dimensional (4-D) DSA provides a time series of 3-D volumes
   utilizing temporal dynamics in the two-dimensional (2-D) projections
   using a constraining image reconstruction approach. Volumetric limiting
   spatial resolution (VLSR) of 4-D DSA is quantified and compared to a 3-D
   DSA. The effects of varying 4-D DSA parameters of 2-D projection
   blurring kernel size and threshold of the 3-D DSA (constraining image)
   of an in silico phantom (ISPH) and physical phantom (PPH) were
   investigated. The PPH consisted of a 76-micron tungsten wire. An
   8-s/248-frame/198-deg scan protocol acquired the projection data. VLSR
   was determined from MTF curves generated from each 2-D transverse slice
   of every (248) 4-D temporal frame. 4-D DSA results for PPH and ISPH were
   compared to the 3-D DSA. 3-D DSA analysis resulted in a VLSR of 2.28 and
   1.69 lp/mm for ISPH and PPH, respectively. Kernel sizes of either 10 x
   10 or 20 x 20 pixels with a 3-D DSA constraining image threshold of 10\%
   provided 4-D DSA VLSR nearest to the 3-D DSA. 4-D DSA yielded 2.21 and
   1.67 lp/mm with a percent error of 3.1 and 1.2\% for ISPH and PPH,
   respectively, as compared to 3-D DSA. This research indicates 4-D DSA is
   capable of retaining the resolution of 3-D DSA. (C) The Authors.

Abstract = {{Fluence field modulated (FFM) CT allows for improvements in image
   quality and dose reduction. To date, only one-dimensional modulators
   have been proposed, as the extension to two-dimensional (2-D) modulation
   is difficult with solid-metal attenuation-based fluence field modulated
   designs. This work proposes to use liquid and gas to attenuate the x-ray
   beam, as unlike solids, these materials can be arranged allowing for 2-D
   fluence modulation. The thickness of liquid and the pressure for a given
   path length of gas were determined that provided the same attenuation as
   30 cm of soft tissue at 80, 100, 120, and 140 kV. Liquid iodine, zinc
   chloride, cerium chloride, erbium oxide, iron oxide, and gadolinium
   chloride were studied. Gaseous xenon, uranium hexafluoride, tungsten
   hexafluoride, and nickel tetracarbonyl were also studied. Additionally,
   we performed a proof-of-concept experiment using a 96 cell array in
   which the liquid thickness in each cell was adjusted manually. Liquid
   thickness varied as a function of kV and chemical composition, with
   erbium oxide allowing for the smallest thickness. For the gases,
   tungsten hexaflouride required the smallest pressure to compensate for
   30 cm of soft tissue. The 96 cell iodine attenuator allowed for a
   reduction in both dynamic range to the detector and scatter-to-primary
   ratio. For both liquids and gases, when k-edges were located within the
   diagnostic energy range used for imaging, the mean beam energy exhibited
   the smallest change with compensation amount. The thickness of liquids
   and the gas pressure seem logistically implementable within the space
   constraints of C-arm-based cone beam CT (CBCT) and diagnostic CT
   systems. The gas pressures also seem logistically implementable within
   the space and tube loading constraints of CBCT and diagnostic CT
   systems. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {{Large dairy farms produce equally large quantities of manure that must
   be managed for effective waste disposal, nutrient utilization, and
   material recycling of bedding or flush water, all while minimizing risks
   to surrounding ecosystems. This study evaluated a large dairy farm's
   (approx. 4,000 cows) manure treatment system in terms of solids,
   nutrients, protein, and pathogen indicator levels. The farm studied was
   selected because it employed different manure treatment operations,
   including drum screens, a clarifier, an anaerobic digester, a
   screw-press, and a dissolved air floatation (DAF) unit. The separation
   processes studied all generally fractionated the nutrients along with
   the solids. Among the processes, the greatest separation of solids and
   nutrients on the study farm was achieved by the clarifier. This study
   also looked at manure proteins, with the data demonstrating that most of
   the soluble protein was partitioned from crude protein, which remained
   in the high solids fraction. Beyond nutrients and solids, total
   coliforms and E. coli were tested as pathogen indicators throughout the
   treatment system to determine if the separation operations impacted
   pathogen levels. Results showed a fairly stable pathogen level through
   the process, with the exception of a significant reduction from
   anaerobic digestion. Longitudinal data revealed that pathogen indicator
   densities fluctuated by season in the final holding lagoon, likely
   influenced by water dilution and temperature. Data from this study
   should help farmers and agricultural engineers design systems to
   implement on-farm manure management for targeted economic or
   environmental goals.}},

Abstract = {{A new liquid ammonia pretreatment methodology called Extractive Ammonia
   (EA) was developed to simultaneously convert native crystalline
   cellulose I-beta (CI) to a highly digestible cellulose IIII (CIII)
   allomorph and selectively extract up to B45\% of the lignin from
   lignocellulosic biomass with near-quantitative retention of all
   polysaccharides. EA pretreated corn stover yielded a higher fermentable
   sugar yield compared to the older Ammonia Fiber Expansion (AFEX) process
   while using 60\% lower enzyme loading. The EA process preserves
   extracted lignin functionalities, offering the potential to co-produce
   lignin-derived fuels and chemicals in the biorefinery. The single-stage
   EA fractionation process achieves high biofuel yields (18.2 kg ethanol
   per 100 kg untreated corn stover, dry weight basis), comparable to those
   achieved using ionic liquid pretreatments. The EA process achieves these
   ethanol yields at industrially-relevant conditions using low enzyme
   loading (7.5 mg protein per g glucan) and high solids loading (8\%

Abstract = {{Using robust chemistry to graft polymer brushes on graphene nanosheets
   would promote the development of graphene nanomaterials as a versatile
   platform for biomedical applications. Based on surface-initiated
   activators regenerated by the electron transfer atom transfer radical
   polymerization (ARGET ATRP) technique, the study developed a protocol to
   prepare well-defined poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (HEMA) brushes on
   chemically reduced graphene oxide surfaces. ATR-FTIR, XPS and TEM
   characterizations demonstrate tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate to be an
   efficient reducing agent that provides controlled polymerization with a
   significant decreased Cu catalyst usage (down to about 20 ppm), and
   prevents trace amounts of elemental Cu residue on the graphene surface.
   Fetal bovine serum protein absorption assay reveals the effect of brush
   backbone structure change to tune the interfacial interaction between
   graphene nanosheets and proteins. Further, NIH-3T3 fibroblast cell and
   human umbilical vein endothelial cell viability assays indicate that the
   obtained graphene nanosheets meet the biocompatibility requirements to
   support fibroblast cells, even human cells, attach and proliferate. The
   approach and the graphene-polymer brush hybrid developed in this work
   should open new opportunities for a broader range of biomedical
   applications of carbon nanomaterials.}},

Title = {{Microwave signatures of ice hydrometeors from ground-based observations
   above Summit, Greenland}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{4743-4756}},
Abstract = {{Multi-instrument, ground-based measurements provide unique and
   comprehensive data sets of the atmosphere for a specific location over
   long periods of time and resulting data compliment past and existing
   global satellite observations. This paper explores the effect of ice
   hydrometeors on ground-based, high-frequency passive microwave
   measurements and attempts to isolate an ice signature for summer seasons
   at Summit, Greenland, from 2010 to 2013. Data from a combination of
   passive microwave, cloud radar, radiosonde, and ceilometer were examined
   to isolate the ice signature at microwave wavelengths. By limiting the
   study to a cloud liquid water path of 40aEuro-gaEuro-m(-2) or less, the
   cloud radar can identify cases where the precipitation was dominated by
   ice. These cases were examined using liquid water and gas microwave
   absorption models, and brightness temperatures were calculated for the
   high-frequency microwave channels: 90, 150, and 225aEuro-GHz. By
   comparing the measured brightness temperatures from the microwave
   radiometers and the calculated brightness temperature using only gas and
   liquid contributions, any residual brightness temperature difference is
   due to emission and scattering of microwave radiation from the ice
   hydrometeors in the column. The ice signature in the 90, 150, and
   225aEuro-GHz channels for the Summit Station summer months was isolated.
   This measured ice signature was then compared to an equivalent
   brightness temperature difference calculated with a radiative transfer
   model including microwave single-scattering properties for several ice
   habits. Initial model results compare well against the 4 years of summer
   season isolated ice signature in the high-frequency microwave channels.}},

Abstract = {{Safety-related training policies restrict pilots from encountering
   challenging weather during flight training. This potentially inhibits
   the development of critical decision-making skills. To identify gaps in
   weather-related flight training, high-fidelity weather-simulation was
   developed to re-create historical weather events. Sixteen visual-only
   pilots and 16 instrument-rated pilots flew a simulated cross-country
   flight under visual flight rules in marginally visual weather that
   encountered instrument conditions. Procedural performance and
   experience-related demographic factors were analyzed to identify key
   flight skills and experience that contributed to safe weather-related
   decisions. Previous experience with actual instrument weather was found
   to be the only statistically significant demographic predictor of safe
   performance. Pilots who performed more safely were more likely to use
   in-cockpit weather information during the flight to detect and avoid
   instrument weather. Implications of this study and opportunities for
   future research are discussed.}},

   model}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3414-3428}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an integrated model of both productivity and
   energy consumptions in serial production lines with two machines.
   Bernoulli reliability is assumed for both machines and the capacity of
   the buffer is finite. The energy consumption of each machine includes
   the energy required to set up the machine until it is ready for
   processing, and the additional energy needed to carry out the processing
   operation to make the product. The former is typically fixed for a
   specific manufacturing process, while the latter is proportional to the
   processing rate. The objective of the model is to minimise energy
   consumption, while maintaining the desired production rate.
   Specifically, analytical investigation has been carried out to discover
   the conditions that energy consumption can be minimised with and without
   the constraints of workforce or machine processing capability. Optimal
   allocations of them under different scenarios have been derived.
   Insights for reducing energy consumption while still ensuring desired
   productivity have been obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Static analysis has been successfully used in many areas, from verifying
   mission-critical software to malware detection. Unfortunately, static
   analysis often produces false positives, which require significant
   manual effort to resolve. In this paper, we show how to overlay a
   probabilistic model, trained using domain knowledge, on top of static
   analysis results, in order to triage static analysis results. We apply
   this idea to analyzing mobile applications. Android application
   components can communicate with each other, both within single
   applications and between different applications. Unfortunately,
   techniques to statically infer Inter-Component Communication (ICC) yield
   many potential inter-component and inter application links, most of
   which are false positives. At large scales, scrutinizing all potential
   links is simply not feasible. We therefore overlay a probabilistic model
   of ICC on top of static analysis results. Since computing the
   inter-component links is a prerequisite to inter-component analysis, we
   introduce a formalism for inferring ICC links based on set constraints.
   We design an efficient algorithm for performing link resolution. We
   compute all potential links in a corpus of 11,267 applications in 30
   minutes and triage them using our probabilistic approach. We find that
   over 95.1\% of all 636 million potential links are associated with
   probability values below 0.01 and are thus likely unfeasible links Thus,
   it is possible to consider only a small subset of all links without
   significant loss of information. This work is the first significant step
   in making static inter-application analysis more tractable, even at
   large scales.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Primary care efficiency and quality are essential for the
   nation's health. The demands on primary care physicians (PCPs) are
   increasing as healthcare becomes more complex. A more complete
   understanding of PCP workflow variation is needed to guide future
   healthcare redesigns.
   Methods This analysis evaluates workflow variation in terms of the
   sequence of tasks performed during patient visits. Two patient visits
   from 10 PCPs from 10 different United States Midwestern primary care
   clinics were analyzed to determine physician workflow. Tasks and the
   progressive sequence of those tasks were observed, documented, and coded
   by task category using a PCP task list. Variations in the sequence and
   prevalence of tasks at each stage of the primary care visit were
   assessed considering the physician, the patient, the visit's
   progression, and the presence of an electronic health record (EHR) at
   the clinic.
   Results PCP workflow during patient visits varies significantly, even
   for an individual physician, with no single or even common workflow
   pattern being present. The prevalence of specific tasks shifts
   significantly as primary care visits progress to their conclusion but,
   notably, PCPs collect patient information throughout the visit.
   Discussion PCP workflows were unpredictable during face-to-face patient
   visits. Workflow emerges as the result of a ``dance{''} between
   physician and patient as their separate agendas are addressed, a side
   effect of patient-centered practice.
   Conclusions Future healthcare redesigns should support a wide variety of
   task sequences to deliver high-quality primary care. The development of
   tools such as electronic health records must be based on the realities
   of primary care visits if they are to successfully support a PCP's
   mental and physical work, resulting in effective, safe, and efficient
   primary care.}},

Title = {{The Aspergillus fumigatus Damage Resistance Protein Family Coordinately
   Regulates Ergosterol Biosynthesis and Azole Susceptibility}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Ergosterol is a major and specific component of the fungal plasma
   membrane, and thus, the cytochrome P450 enzymes (Erg proteins) that
   catalyze ergosterol synthesis have been selected as valuable targets of
   azole antifungals. However, the opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus
   fumigatus has developed worldwide resistance to azoles largely through
   mutations in the cytochrome P450 enzyme Cyp51 (Erg11). In this study, we
   demonstrate that a cytochrome b(5)-like heme-binding damage resistance
   protein (Dap) family, comprised of DapA, DapB, and DapC, coordinately
   regulates the functionality of cytochrome P450 enzymes Erg5 and Erg11
   and oppositely affects susceptibility to azoles. The expression of all
   three genes is induced in an azole concentration-dependent way, and the
   decreased susceptibility to azoles requires DapA stabilization of
   cytochrome P450 protein activity. In contrast, overexpression of DapB
   and DapC causes dysfunction of Erg5 and Erg11, resulting in abnormal
   accumulation of sterol intermediates and further accentuating the
   sensitivity of Delta dap A strains to azoles. The results of
   exogenous-hemin rescue and heme-binding-site mutagenesis experiments
   demonstrate that the heme binding of DapA contributes the decreased
   azole susceptibility, while DapB and -C are capable of reducing the
   activities of Erg5 and Erg11 through depletion of heme. In vivo data
   demonstrate that inactivated DapA combined with activated DapB yields an
   A. fumigatus mutant that is easily treatable with azoles in an
   immunocompromised mouse model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.
   Compared to the single Dap proteins found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
   and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we suggest that this complex Dap family
   regulatory system emerged during the evolution of fungi as an adaptive
   means to regulate ergosterol synthesis in response to environmental
   stimuli.
   IMPORTANCE Knowledge of the ergosterol biosynthesis route in fungal
   pathogens is useful in the design of new antifungal drugs and could aid
   in the study of antifungal-drug resistance mechanisms. In this study, we
   demonstrate that three cytochrome b5-like Dap proteins coordinately
   regulate the azole resistance and ergosterol biosynthesis catalyzed by
   cytochrome P450 proteins. Our new insights into the Dap regulatory
   system in fungal pathogens may have broad therapeutic ramifications
   beyond their usefulness for classic azole antifungals. Moreover, our
   elucidation of the molecular mechanism of Dap regulation of cytochrome
   P450 protein functionality through heme-binding activity may extend
   beyond the Kingdom Fungi with applicability toward Dap protein
   regulation of mammalian sterol synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) of tensile-strained GaAs1-yPy
   layers on GaAs substrates was carried out over the temperature range
   from 380 to 650 degrees C. The P content in the GaAs1-yPy epitaxial
   layers initially decreases with decreasing growth temperature from 550
   to 650 degrees C, while then exhibiting an increase with decreasing
   growth temperature from 550 to 380 degrees C. Thermodynamic calculations
   indicate that P incorporation is far from thermodynamic equilibrium at
   all growth temperatures. Related surface kinetics for the anion
   incorporation competition are discussed and it is suggested that the P
   incorporation is assisted by the increased P surface coverage at low
   growth temperatures. GaAs1-yPy tensile strained layers with layer
   thickness exceeding the critical thickness exhibit an early stage of
   strain relaxation by the formation of cracks rather than misfit
   dislocations. (c) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, a testing protocol was developed to measure the flexural
   strength, flexural modulus, and fatigue failure of cementitiously
   stabilized materials (CSMs) for both lightly and heavily stabilized
   soils. Four soils (sand, gravel, silt, and clay) and four binders
   (cement, lime, class C fly ash, and class F fly ash) were used in this
   study. Beam specimens (100mm high by 100mm wide by 400mm long) were
   prepared and tested using third-point flexural beam tests. A fatigue
   distress model was developed, and the data from this study was validated
   using other existing stress-based fatigue models. Results indicated that
   the testing protocol could be used to determine the flexural strength,
   flexural modulus, and fatigue behavior of the cementitiously stabilized
   layers (CSL). A stress-based fatigue performance model was a good fit
   for the whole range of CSMs, which is needed to predict the fatigue
   performance of CSL in the field and to determine the fatigue life of the
   CSLs.}},

Title = {{Precise measurement of stable potassium isotope ratios using a single

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{1023-1029}},
Abstract = {{High precision potassium isotope ratio measurements were made using a
   collision-cell equipped single focusing Multi-Collector Inductively
   Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS). Interferences on K-41 from
   (ArH+)-Ar-40 were largely suppressed through collision with He gas
   atoms, and reaction with H-2 or D-2 gas molecules in the collision cell
   under optimum collision gas flow conditions. Using H-2 or D-2 as the
   collision gas, we distinguish charged argon-deuterium molecules (ArD+)
   generated in the collision cell from argon hydride (ArH+) generated in
   the plasma or in the interface region (referred to as ``plasma-related
   AH(+){''} hereafter), and demonstrate, for the first time, that both
   plasma-related and collision cell-generated ArH+ are important sources
   of ArH+ that interfere with K-41(+) in collision-cell ICP-MS instruments
   that use H-2 as a collision gas. The use of D-2 instead of H-2 as a
   reactive gas in the collision cell resulted in better overall
   performance in K isotope ratio measurements. By combining these mass
   spectrometry methods with chemical purification of K by ion exchange
   chromatography, we achieved an internal precision of <+/- 0.07 parts per
   thousand (2 standard error) and an external reproducibility of <+/- 0.21
   parts per thousand (2 standard deviation, or 95\% confidence) in the
   K-41/K-39 ratio measurement for geological and biological samples. With
   the improved precision, it is possible to distinguish a similar to 1.3
   parts per thousand variation in K isotope compositions (K-41/K-39
   ratios) among seawater, igneous rocks, and biological samples. The K
   isotope system is likely to be beneficial in providing a better
   understanding of potassium cycling during continental weathering and the
   uptake of nutrients by plants.}},

   investigate the various strain distributions of panels with different
   face/core configurations that identified the critical failure modes for
   future design. In this research, four panels with different
   configurations were constructed to analyze the influence of strain
   distributions for bending behavior. Either maximum localized normal
   strain or shear strain were used to judge failures and associated
   failure modes through observation. Test results of strain distribution
   showed normal strain was primarily carried by both top and bottom faces.
   As bending load increased, compression buckling occurred on the top
   surface of some panels with thinner faces. Face thickness and stiffness
   significantly affected the strength of the panel as evident by nonlinear
   strain behavior. Meanwhile, the shear strain was primarily taken by the
   ribs in the structural core, and shear failure always occurred in the
   longitudinal linear ribs of core with thicker faces. The shear strain in
   the cross ribs was approximately half that of the longitudinal linear
   ribs in the same section of shear zone, which was consistent with the
   geometric formula. The problem of panel imperfections resulting in
   either face compression buckling or rib shear buckling could be overcome
   by further design optimization, and the analytical modeling for bending
   design and evaluation was presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a new framework to analyze and design iterative
   optimization algorithms built on the notion of integral quadratic
   constraints (IQCs) from robust control theory. IQCs provide sufficient
   conditions for the stability of complicated interconnected systems, and
   these conditions can be checked by semidefinite programming. We discuss
   how to adapt IQC theory to study optimization algorithms, proving new
   inequalities about convex functions and providing a version of IQC
   theory adapted for use by optimization researchers. Using these
   inequalities, we derive numerical upper bounds on convergence rates for
   the Gradient method, the Heavy-ball method, Nesterov's accelerated
   method, and related variants by solving small, simple semidefinite
   programming problems. We also briefly show how these techniques can be
   used to search for optimization algorithms with desired performance
   characteristics, establishing a new methodology for algorithm design.}},

Title = {{Formaldehyde production from isoprene oxidation across NOx regimes}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2597-2610}},
Abstract = {{The chemical link between isoprene and formaldehyde (HCHO) is a strong,
   nonlinear function of NOx (i. e., NO + NO2). This relationship is a
   linchpin for top-down isoprene emission inventory verification from
   orbital HCHO column observations. It is also a benchmark for overall
   photochemical mechanism performance with regard to VOC oxidation. Using
   a comprehensive suite of airborne in situ observations over the
   southeast US, we quantify HCHO production across the urban-rural
   spectrum. Analysis of isoprene and its major first-generation oxidation
   products allows us to define both a ``prompt{''} yield of HCHO
   (molecules of HCHO produced per molecule of freshly emitted isoprene)
   and the background HCHO mixing ratio (from oxidation of longer-lived
   hydrocarbons). Over the range of observed NOx values (roughly 0.1-2
   ppbv), the prompt yield increases by a factor of 3 (from 0.3 to 0.9 ppbv
   ppbv(-1)), while background HCHO increases by a factor of 2 (from 1.6 to
   3.3 ppbv). We apply the same method to evaluate the performance of both
   a global chemical transport model (AM3) and a measurement-constrained
   0-D steady-state box model. Both models reproduce the NOx dependence of
   the prompt HCHO yield, illustrating that models with updated isoprene
   oxidation mechanisms can adequately capture the link between HCHO and
   recent isoprene emissions. On the other hand, both models underestimate
   background HCHO mixing ratios, suggesting missing HCHO precursors,
   inadequate representation of later-generation isoprene degradation
   and/or underestimated hydroxyl radical concentrations. Detailed process
   rates from the box model simulation demonstrate a 3-fold increase in
   HCHO production across the range of observed NOx values, driven by a
   100\% increase in OH and a 40\% increase in branching of organic peroxy
   radical reactions to produce HCHO.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid growth in the field of stem cell research has generated a lot of
   interest in their therapeutic use, especially in the treatment of
   neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, human neural progenitor cells
   (hNPCs), unique in their capability to differentiate into cells of the
   neural lineage, have been widely investigated due to their ability to
   survive, thrive, and migrate toward injured tissues. Still, one of the
   major roadblocks for clinical applicability arises from the inability to
   monitor these cells following transplantation. Molecular imaging
   techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have been explored
   to assess hNPC transplant location, migration, and survival. Here we
   investigated whether inducing hNPCs to overexpress ferritin
   (hNPCs(Fer)), an iron storage protein, is sufficient to track these
   cells long term in the rat striatum using MRI. We found that increased
   hypointensity on MRI images could establish hNPC(Fer) location.
   Unexpectedly, however, wild-type hNPC transplants were detected in a
   similar manner, which is likely due to increased iron accumulation
   following transplantation-induced damage. Hence, we labeled hNPCs with
   superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles to further increase
   iron content in an attempt to enhance cell contrast in MRI.
   SPIO-labeling of hNPCs (hNPCs-SPIO) achieved increased hypointensity,
   with significantly greater area of decreased T2{*} compared to hNPC(Fer)
   (p < 0.0001) and all other controls used. However, none of the
   techniques could be used to determine graft rejection in vivo, which is
   imperative for understanding cell behavior following transplantation. We
   conclude that in order for cell survival to be monitored in preclinical
   and clinical settings, another molecular imaging technique must be
   employed, including perhaps multimodal imaging, which would utilize MRI
   along with another imaging modality.}},

Abstract = {{The current research addressed synthesizing and studying

   and Y2O3 as the typical additives on photoluminescence behaviour was
   evaluated. The beta-Si3N4 with MgO and Y2O3 additive specimens were
   fabricated by a solid state technique (ball-milled method). The
   as-prepared products were characterized by X-ray diffraction technique,
   transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron
   microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Raman analysis. The
   results showed that after ball-milled process, hexagonal beta-Si3N4 with
   MgO or Y2O3 as the additives with the size distribution of 45-50 nm was
   obtained. The optical properties of the as-synthesized product were also
   investigated by photoluminescence and diffuse reflection spectroscopy.
   The obtained results confirmed that employing MgO as an additive, in
   comparison to the Y2O3, could enhance emission properties in the
   synthesized silicon nitride nanoparticles. The obtained results also
   showed that MgO-Si3N4 pair acted as FRET system to enhance the emission

Abstract = {{Vapor-deposited glasses can be anisotropic and molecular orientation is
   important for organic electronics applications. In organic light
   emitting diodes (OLEDs), for example, the orientation of dye molecules
   in two-component emitting layers significantly influences emission
   efficiency. Here we investigate how substrate temperature during vapor
   deposition influences the orientation of dye molecules in a model
   two-component system. We determine the average orientation of a linear
   blue light emitter 1,4-di-{[}4-(N,N-diphenyl) amino] styrylbenzene
   (DSA-Ph) in mixtures with aluminum-tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) (Alq3) by
   spectroscopic ellipsometry and IR dichroism. We find that molecular
   orientation is controlled by the ratio of the substrate temperature
   during deposition and the glass transition temperature of the mixture.
   These findings extend recent results for single component
   vapor-deposited glasses and suggest that, during vapor deposition,
   surface mobility allows partial equilibration towards orientations
   preferred at the free surface of the equilibrium liquid.}},

Title = {{Recommendations for calibration factors for a photo-reference method for
   aerosol black carbon concentrations}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{75-81}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Large measurement networks of Black Carbon (BC) aerosol are important
   for understanding its impacts on climate and health. PM2.5 filter
   samples were collected at three urban US locations and one India urban
   location and were analyzed for Elemental Carbon (EC) and Organic Carbon
   (OC) concentrations using thermo-optical analysis (TO) following the
   IMPROVE protocol for US samples and NIOSH protocol for India samples.
   Site and season-specific calibrations of an inexpensive photo-reference
   (PR) method were created with TO EC measurements of the US filter
   samples whereas method-specific calibration was prepared using India
   filter samples. Piece-wise calibration based on filter loading was also
   explored. Calibrations were applied across different sites, seasons and
   methods to determine Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and average absolute
   error in each calibration by comparing with reference EC measurements.
   This paper investigates various calibrations of PR method to improve the
   agreement between PR method and TO EC measurements. Difference in BC
   estimated error remained within +/- 10\% among three urban US
   site-specific calibrations, which suggests that site-specific
   calibrations are not necessary. Season based calibrations were found to
   perform best (least RMSE/Mean EC), when applied to same season test
   samples but resulted in large errors of up to 60\% RMSE/Mean EC when
   applied to different seasons, thus warranting the use of season-specific
   calibrations of the PR method. RMSE relative to mean EC was 50\% when
   calibration prepared from US samples (IMPROVE protocol) was used to test
   India samples (NIOSH protocol). However, method-specific calibration
   prepared from India samples reduced the error to 24\%, showing the large
   dependency of PR method on reference BC measurement method. Calibration
   based on filter loading reduced the RMSE slightly for both US urban and
   India samples and indicated that filters with loadings higher than 20 mu
   g cm(-2) are not suitable for estimating BC by PR method. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Ventilation distribution calculation using 4D CT has shown promising
   potential in several clinical applications. This study evaluated the
   direct geometric ventilation calculation method, namely the.V method,
   with xenon-enhanced CT (XeCT) ventilation data from four sheep, and
   compared it with two other published methods, the Jacobian and the
   Hounsfield unit (HU) methods. Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) and
   Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) were used for the evaluation and
   comparison. The average SCC with one standard deviation was 0.44 +/-
   0.13 with a range between 0.29 and 0.61 between the XeCT and Delta V
   ventilation distributions. The average DSC value for lower 30\%
   ventilation volumes between the XeCT and Delta V ventilation
   distributions was 0.55 +/- 0.07 with a range between 0.48 and 0.63.
   Ventilation difference introduced by deformable image registration
   errors improved with smoothing. In conclusion, ventilation distributions
   generated using Delta V-4D CT and deformable image registration are in
   reasonably agreement with the in vivo XeCT measured ventilation
   distribution.}},

Title = {{Facile synthesis of NiCoMnO4 nanoparticles as novel electrode materials
   for high-performance asymmetric energy storage devices}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{34}},
Pages = {{28970-28980}},
Abstract = {{In attempt to reduce the amount of toxic Co in cobalt oxides, NiCoMnO4
   nanoparticles were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route and their
   electrochemical properties have been investigated as a novel electrode
   material for supercapacitors. Samples have been characterized using
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), and
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). N-2 adsorption/desorption
   measurements demonstrated a high specific surface area of 175 m(2)
   g(-1). The morphology of the samples has been probed with scanning (SEM)
   and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy. The electrochemical
   properties of the NiCoMnO4 nanoparticles have been evaluated as
   electrode materials for energy storage application by means of various
   electrochemical techniques including cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic
   charge-discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy. According to the obtained results, the NiCoMnO4 electrodes
   showed significant improved capacitive performance in comparison with
   pure oxides (e. g. NiO, Co3O4, and Mn3O4). The NiCoMnO4 electrodes with
   a high mass loading of similar to 10 mg cm(-2) exhibited a high specific
   capacitance of 510 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), and a desirable rate capability
   (retaining 285 F g(-1) at 10 A g(-1)). Finally, asymmetric devices based
   on NiCoMnO4 nanoparticles as positive electrodes and reduced graphene
   oxide nanosheets as negative electrodes were assembled, showing a
   remarkable performance including high energy (20 W h kg(-1)), and
   stunning power density (37.5 kW kg(-1)).}},

Title = {{A simulation framework for studying blocking effects in warehouse
   systems with autonomous vehicles}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{51-80}},
Abstract = {{Autonomous vehicles-based storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) have
   been shown to offer greater flexibility to improve cycle time and
   throughput capacity in the transfer of unit loads in high-density
   storage areas of warehouses. In these systems, loads are transferred by
   autonomous vehicles that move horizontally along aisles and cross-aisles
   within a tier, while lifts support vertical movement of loads between
   tiers. For analytical tractability, prior studies on performance
   evaluation of AVS/RS have ignored the blocking effects of vehicles and
   lifts while estimating throughput capacity and cycle times. To evaluate
   the effects of blocking on system performance, this paper first develops
   protocols to address vehicle blocking that are subsequently incorporated
   in a detailed simulation model. The blocking effects are studied for a
   variety of tier configurations that differ in depth/width ratio, number
   of locations, number of available vehicles, and transaction arrival
   rates. Results suggest that blocking delays could account for 2\%-20\%
   of the transaction cycle times.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2942-2947}},
Abstract = {{Physical vapor deposition (PVD) has been used to prepare glasses of
   itraconazole, a smectic A liquid crystal. Glasses were deposited onto
   subtrates at a range of temperatures (T-substrate) near the glass
   transition temperature (T-g), with T-substrate/T-g ranging from 0.70 to
   1.02. Infrared spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry were used to
   characterize the molecular orientation using the orientational order
   parameter, S-z, and the birefringence. We find that the molecules in
   glasses deposited at T-substrate = T-g are nearly perpendicular to the
   substrate (S-z = +0.66) while at lower T-substrate molecules are nearly
   parallel to the substrate (S-z = -0.45). The molecular orientation
   depends on the temperature of the substrate during preparation, allowing
   layered samples with differing orientations to be readily prepared. In
   addition, these vapor-deposited glasses are macroscopically homogeneous
   and molecularly flat. We interpret the combination of properties
   obtained for vapor-deposited glasses of itraconazole to result from a
   process where molecular orientation is determined by the structure and
   dynamics at the free surface of the glass during deposition. Vapor
   deposition of liquid crystals is likely a general approach for the
   preparation of highly anisotropic glasses with tunable molecular
   orientation for use in organic electronics and optoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the algorithms used by the CMS experiment to
   reconstruct and identify tau -> hadrons + nu(tau) decays during Run 1 of
   the LHC. The performance of the algorithms is studied in proton-proton
   collisions recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding
   to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb(-1). The algorithms achieve an
   identification efficiency of 50-60\%, with misidentification rates for
   quark and gluon jets, electrons, and muons between per mille and per
   cent levels.}},

Abstract = {{Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy {[}Co/Pd](15) and L1(0)-FePt nanowire
   arrays of period 63 nm with line-widths 38 nm and 27 nm and film
   thickness 27 nm and 20 nm respectively were fabricated using a
   self-assembled PS-b-PDMS diblock copolymer film as a lithographic mask.
   The wires are predicted to support Neel walls in the Co/Pd and Bloch
   walls in the FePt. Magnetostatic interactions from nearest neighbor
   nanowires promote a ground state configuration consisting of alternating
   up and down magnetization in adjacent wires. This was observed over
   similar to 75\% of the Co/Pd wires after ac-demagnetization but was less
   prevalent in the FePt because the ratio of interaction field to
   switching field was much smaller. Interactions also led to correlations
   in the domain wall positions in adjacent Co/Pd nanowires. The reversal
   process was characterized by nucleation of reverse domains, followed at
   higher fields by propagation of the domains along the nanowires. These
   narrow wires provide model system for exploring domain wall structure
   and dynamics in perpendicular anisotropy systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, flexible phototransistors with a back gate configuration
   based on transferrable single-crystalline Si nanomembrane (Si NM) have
   been demonstrated. Having the Si NM as the top layer enables full
   exposure of the active region to an incident light and thus allows for
   effective light sensing. Flexible phototransistors are performed in two
   operation modes: 1) the high light detection mode that exhibits a
   photo-to-dark current ratio of 10 5 at voltage bias of V-GS < 0.5 V, and
   V-DS = 50 mV and 2) the high responsivity mode that shows a maximum
   responsivity of 52 A W-1 under blue illumination at voltage bias of V-GS
   = 1 V, and V-DS = 3 V. Due to the good mechanical flexibility of Si NMs
   with the assistance of a polymer layer to enhance light absorption, the
   device exhibits stable responsivity with less than 5\% of variation
   under bending at small radii of curvatures (up to 15 mm). Overall, such
   flexible phototransistors with the capabilities of high sensitivity
   light detection and stable performance under the bending conditions
   offer great promises for high-performance flexible optical sensor
   applications, with easy integration for multifunctional applications.}},

   River Basin}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{This study analyzed the top 1\% 24-hour rainfall events from 1994 to
   2013 at eight climatological sites that represent the east to west
   precipitation gradient across the Arkansas-Red River Basin in North
   America. A total of 131 cases were identified and subsequently
   classified on the synoptic-scale, mesoscale, and local-scale to compile
   a climatological analysis of these extreme, heavy rainfall events based
   on atmospheric forcings. For each location, the prominent
   midtropospheric pattern, mesoscale feature, and predetermined
   thermodynamic variables were used to classify each 1\% rainfall event.
   Individual events were then compared with other cases throughout the
   basin. The most profound results were that the magnitudes of the
   thermodynamic variables such as convective available potential energy
   and precipitable water values were poor predictors of the amount of
   rainfall produced in these extreme events. Further, the mesoscale
   forcings had more of an impact during the warm season and for the
   westernmost locations, whereas synoptic forcings were extremely
   prevalent during the cold season at the easternmost locations in the
   basin. The implications of this research are aimed at improving the
   forecasting of heavy precipitation at individual weather forecasts
   offices within the basin through the identified patterns at various
   scales.}},

Abstract = {{Arabidopsis thaliana was the first higher organism to have its genome

   plants, Arabidopsis develops distinct growth patterns in response to
   different environmental stimuli. This can be seen in the gravitropic
   response of roots. Methods to investigate this particular tropism are
   presented here. First, we describe a high-throughput time-lapse
   photographic analysis of root growth and curvature response to
   gravistimulation allowing the quantification of gravitropic kinetics and
   growth rate at high temporal resolution. Second, we present a protocol
   that allows a quantitative evaluation of gravitropic sensitivity using a
   homemade 2D clinostat. Together, these approaches allow an initial
   comparative analysis of the key phenomena associated with root
   gravitropism between different genotypes and/or accessions.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{We propose a two-dimensional asymptotic preserving scheme for linear
   transport equations with diffusive scalings. It is an extension of the
   time splitting developed by Jin, Pareschi, and Toscani {[}SIAM J. Numer.
   Anal., 38 (2000), pp. 913-936] but uses spatial discretizations on
   staggered grids, which preserves the discrete diffusion limit with a
   more compact stencil. The first novelty of this paper is that we propose
   a staggering in two dimensions that requires fewer unknowns than one
   could have naively expected. The second contribution of this paper is
   that we rigorously analyze the scheme of Jin, Pareschi, and Toscani. We
   show that the scheme is AP and obtain an explicit CFL condition, which
   couples a hyperbolic and a parabolic condition. This type of condition
   is common for asymptotic preserving schemes and guarantees uniform
   stability with respect to the mean free path. In addition, we obtain an
   upper bound on the relaxation parameter, which is the crucial parameter
   of the used time discretization. Several numerical examples are provided
   to verify the accuracy and asymptotic property of the scheme.}},

Journal = {{TOPICS IN CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{19-28}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This work uses transition state theory as applied to thermodynamically
   non-ideal systems to explore the origins of improvements in the
   stability and activity of supported metal catalysts containing
   polymer-derived microenvironments. The hydrogenation of triacetic acid
   lactone (TAL), which is the first step in the production of biorenewable
   sorbic acid, is used as a probe for the influence of a poly(vinyl
   alcohol)-derived (PVA-derived) microenvironment on the reduction of
   moderately polar compounds. The presence of the microenvironment causes
   a moderate decrease in the rate of TAL hydrogenation without causing a
   substantial change in the measured activation barrier or reaction
   orders. This decrease is explained in the context of a local solvation
   environment generated by the PVA. For comparison, the hydrogenation of
   lactic acid (LA) is used as a probe for the influence of a PVA-derived
   microenvironment on the adsorption of polar compounds. In this case, the
   reaction order in LA increases from zero-order to 0.3-order, indicating
   that the surface coverage by lactate is decreased by the presence of the
   microenvironment. The results presented indicate that polymer-derived
   microenvironments act as pseudo-solvents that alter the surface
   properties of supported metal catalysts, and we suggest that modifying
   catalysts with polymer-derived microenvironments is a generalizable
   methodology with applications in liquid-phase biomass conversion
   reactions.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{118-121}},
Abstract = {{We present a new technique for designing a dual-band patch antenna with
   closely spaced bands of operation, whose response can be changed
   dynamically using a fluidic tuning mechanism. Using this technique, a
   dual-band tunable patch antenna operating at around 2.5 GHz is designed
   and fabricated using 3-D printing. Two oil-filled channels are placed in
   the substrate of the antenna along the nonradiating edges of the patch
   and filled with movable metal cylinders. As the cylinders are introduced
   underneath the patch, it starts to exhibit a dual resonant behavior with
   both resonances having a similar electric current distribution. The
   separation between the two resonant frequencies is a function of the
   relative position of the metallic cylinders underneath the patch
   antenna. As the overlap volume between the metal cylinders and the patch
   increases, the frequency of the first band, f(1), starts to decrease and
   that of the second band, f(2), increases. The maximum separation between
   f(1) and f(2) is achieved when half of the lengths of the metallic
   cylinders are underneath the patch. The prototype device designed in
   this work can achieve frequency ratios in the range of f(2)/f(1) =
   1.08-1.30. The antenna demonstrates similar radiation characteristics at
   both bands of operation.}},

Abstract = {{Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were first reported in 2004, and
   since their discovery, there has been an increasing interest in NETs,
   how they are formed, their role in controlling infections, and their
   contribution to disease pathogenesis. Despite this rapid expansion of
   our understanding of NETs, many details remain unclear including the
   role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the formation of NETs. Further,
   to study NETs, investigators typically require a large number of cells
   purified via a lengthy purification regimen. Here, we report a
   microfluidic device used to quantify both ROS and NET production over
   time in response to various stimulants, including live bacteria. This
   device enables ROS and NET analysis using a process that purifies
   primary human neutrophils in less than 10 minutes and requires only a
   few microliters of whole blood. Using this device we demonstrate the
   ability to identify distinct capabilities of neutrophil subsets
   (including ROS production and NET formation), the ability to use
   different stimulants/inhibitors, and the ability to effectively use
   samples stored for up to 8 hours. This device permits the study of ROS
   and NETs in a user-friendly format and has potential for widespread
   applications in the study of human disease.}},

   nanocomposites}},

Abstract = {{The self-healing capability is particularly desirable for
   multifunctional polymeric materials because it can make the materials
   more reliable, reduce repair costs, and extend their lifetime in many
   applications. Herein, a multi-stimuli responsive self-healing
   metallo-supramolecular polymer nanocomposite exhibiting superior
   mechanical properties was developed and demonstrated. Terpyridine
   ligand-terminated polyurethane (PU) was prepared by in situ
   polymerization on the surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs).
   The terpyridine ligand-terminated CNT/PU prepolymers were dynamically
   crosslinked with the metal ion Zn2+ to obtain a metallo-supramolecular
   polymer nanocomposite. The tensile strength and tensile strain-at-break
   of the CNT/PU polymer nanocomposite increased from 14.2 MPa and 620\% to
   22.8 MPa and 1076\%, respectively, with the addition of Zn2+. The
   Zn2+-coordinated metallo-supramolecular polymer nanocomposite showed a
   rare combination of strong, tough, and elastic mechanical properties and
   was able to self-heal via multiple stimuli, including remotely
   controlled near infrared (NIR) light (4.2 mW mm(-2), 30 min), relatively
   low temperatures (90 degrees C, 1 h), and/or solvents, all with
   excellent healing efficiencies (i.e., higher than 93\%) and short
   healing times. Therefore, this unique multi-stimuli responsive
   self-healing metallo-supramolecular polymer nanocomposite has the
   potential to provide advances in structural component, microelectronic
   and sporting equipment applications, to name just a few.}},

   activity}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{16177-16182}},
Abstract = {{TiO2-B is a metastable phase of titania with an interesting crystal
   structure and electrochemical properties. N-Doped and Cu-doped TiO2-B
   nanowires (NWs) were synthesized by hydrothermal and microwave-assisted
   hydrothermal methods, respectively. All the NWs are single crystal with
   the same crystal orientation regardless of the synthesis method and
   doping situation. The doped NWs together with their corresponding
   pristine NWs were fabricated into a photoelectrochemical (PEC) anode for
   water oxidation and their photoactivity performances were studied and
   compared under different illumination wavelength ranges. The Cu-doped
   TiO2-B NWs exhibited a significantly higher photocurrent density than
   all the other samples under direct Xe lamp illumination; while their
   performance rapidly dropped below the hydrothermal NWs when the UV
   illumination was cut off. On the contrary, N-doped TiO2-B NWs exhibited
   significantly enhanced photoactivity particularly in the visible light
   range. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that N-doping could
   narrow the electronic bandgap of TiO2, while the Cu-doping had little
   impact on the bandgap but rather improved the electrical conductivity.
   This research provides a new insight into elemental and phase control of
   TiO2-based solar energy harvesters.}},

   lyotropic gyroid phase stability}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Arising from the water-driven self-assembly of amphiphiles over
   generally narrow temperature and composition phase windows, aqueous
   lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) network phases are useful in applications
   as therapeutic delivery vehicles and templates for mesoporous material
   syntheses. While a clear set of amphiphile design rules that enables
   access to these intricate three-dimensional structures has yet to
   emerge, recent work indicates that bis(ammonium), bis(phosphonium), and
   dicarboxylate gemini ({''}twin tail{''}) surfactants enable enhanced
   access to LLC network phases such as the double gyroid (G). In order to
   better understand the scope of this amphiphile design strategy, we
   investigated the synthesis and aqueous LLC self-assembly behaviors of a
   homologous series of quaternary gemini bis(ammonium) dichloride
   surfactants, in which we varied the position of the hydrophobic linker
   that connects the constituent single tail surfactants. These experiments
   demonstrate that the position of the linker directly impacts the maximum
   counterion-headgroup hydration capacity and the extent of
   counterion-headgroup association, all of which contribute to the aqueous
   lyotropic double gyroid network phase stability. Thus, judicious
   selection of the linker position in ionic gemini surfactants provides a
   new molecular design tool for manipulating LLC network phase stability.}},

Abstract = {{A highly strained BiFeO3 (BFO) thin film is transformed between phases
   with distinct structures and properties by nanosecond-duration applied
   electric field pulses. Time-resolved synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction
   shows that the steady-state transformation between phases is accompanied
   by a dynamical component that is reversed upon the removal of the field.
   Steady-state measurements reveal that approximate to 20\% of the volume
   of a BFO thin film grown on a LaAlO3 substrate can be reproducibly
   transformed between rhombohedral-like and tetragonal-like phases by
   electric field pulses with magnitudes up to 2 MV cm(-1). A transient
   component, in which the transformation is reversed following the end of
   the electric field pulse, can transform a similar fraction of the BFO
   layer and occurs rapidly time scale limited by the charging time
   constant of the thin film capacitor. The piezoelectric expansion of the
   tetragonal-like phase leads to a strain of up to 0.1\%, with a lower
   limit of 10 pm V-1 for the piezoelectric coefficient of this phase.
   Density functional theory calculations provide insight into the
   mechanism of the phase transformation showing that imparting a transient
   strain of this magnitude favors a transformation from rhombohedral-like
   to tetragonal-like phase.}},

Abstract = {{In photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer both the light and the
   photosensitizing agent are normally harmless, but in combination they
   could result in selective tumor killing. Zinc oxide nanoparticles were
   synthesized and coated with the amino acid cysteine to provide an
   adequate arm for conjugation with porphyrin photosensitizers (meso-tetra
   (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin {[}MTCP] and CuMTCP). Porphyrin-conjugated
   nanoparticles were characterized by TEM, FTIR, and UV-vis, and
   fluorescence spectrophotometry. The 3-{[}4,
   5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was
   used to measure cell viability in the presence or absence of porphyrin
   conjugates following UV and X-ray irradiation. The uptake of the
   porphyrin-conjugated ZnO nanoparticles by cells was detected using
   fluorescence microscopy. Our results indicated that the survival of
   T-47D cells was significantly compromised in the presence of
   ZnO-MTCP-conjugated nanostructures with UV light exposure. Exhibition of
   cytotoxic activity of ZnO-MTCP for human prostate cancer (Du145) cells
   occurred at a higher concentration, indicating the more resistant nature
   of these tumor cells. ZnO-CuMTCP showed milder cytotoxic effects in
   human breast cancer (T-47D) and no cytotoxic effects in Du145 with UV
   light exposure, consistent with its lower cytotoxic potency as well as
   cellular uptake. Surprisingly, none of the ZnO-porphyrin conjugates
   exhibited cytotoxic effects with X-ray irradiation, whereas ZnO alone
   exerted cytotoxicity. Thus, ZnO and ZnO-porphyrin nanoparticles with UV
   or X-ray irradiation may provide a suitable treatment option for various
   cancers. (C) 2015 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular

Abstract = {{Due to severe weather events, there is a growing need for more accurate
   weather predictions. Climate change has increased both frequency and
   severity of such events. Optimizing weather model source code would
   result in reduced run times or more accurate weather predictions. One
   such weather model is the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model,
   which is designed for both numerical weather prediction (NWP) and
   atmospheric research. The WRF software infrastructure consists of
   several components such as dynamic solvers and physics schemes.
   Purdue-Lin scheme is a relatively sophisticated microphysics scheme in
   the WRF model. The scheme includes six classes of hydro meteors: 1)
   water vapor; 2) cloud water; 3) raid; 4) cloud ice; 5) snow; and 6)
   graupel. The scheme is very suitable for massively parallel computation
   as there are no interactions among horizontal grid points. Thus, we
   present our optimization results for the Purdue-Lin microphysics scheme.
   Those optimizations included improved vectorization of the code to
   utilize multiple vector units inside each processor code better.
   Performed optimizations improved the performance of the original
   unmodified Purdue-Lin microphysics code running natively on Xeon Phi
   7120P by a factor of 4.7x. Similarly, the same optimizations improved
   the performance of the Purdue-Lin microphysics scheme on a dual socket

Abstract = {{In this paper, a vernier motor with a spoke permanent-magnet (PM)
   structure instead of a surface PM is proposed in order to obtain higher
   power factor (PF) and flux density. However, upon investigating this
   structure with a single gap, unique effects that virtually eliminate the
   vernier effect are analytically identified. To avoid these effects and
   improve the PF, a spoke PM vernier motor with a double gap is then
   proposed. Analytic equations for back electromotive force and the PF are
   then derived for this motor in terms of various geometric factors such
   as the numbers of magnets and winding poles, the magnet thickness, etc.
   For a case study, the practical achievable maximum power and PF are
   calculated and verified with accurate simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Watermelon belongs to the genus Citrullus. There have been continuing
   interests in breeding of watermelon for economic benefits, but
   information on the scope and utilization of genetic variations in
   Citrullus is still limited. The present study was conducted in 2012-13,
   to evaluate the genetic diversity and population structure of the 1197
   line watermelon collection maintained by the Beijing Vegetable Research
   Center (BVRC), which belongs to seven Citrullus species including
   Citrullus naudinianus, Citrullus colocynthis, Citrullus rehmii,
   Citrullus ecirrhosus, Citrullus amarus, Citrullus mucosospermus, and
   Cirullus lanatus subsp. vulgaris. Twenty-three highly informative
   microsatellite markers evenly distributed in the watermelon genome were
   used to assess genetic diversity in this collection. The markers
   detected on an average of 6.05 alleles per locus with the average value
   of polymorphism information content (PIC) at 0.49. A high level of gene
   diversity {[}Nei's gene diversity index (Nei) = 0.56] and a low observed
   heterozygosity (H-o = 0.10) were revealed within the collection.
   Structure analysis grouped the 1197 accessions into two main populations
   (Pop I and Pop II) and an admixture group. Pop I contained 450
   accessions from C. lanatus subsp. vulgaris (446) and C. mucosospermus
   (4). Pop II comprised 465 accessions, 379 of which belonged to C.
   lanatus subsp. vulgaris and 86 to C. naudinianus (3), C. ecirrhosus (2),
   C rehmii (2), C. colocynthis (11), C. amarus (58), and C. mucosospermus
   (10). The remaining 282 accessions were classified as an admixture
   group. The two main populations were further subdivided into four
   subgroups. The groupings were consistent with the estimation of F
   statistics (F-st) and Nei's genetic distances in collections. We
   confirmed the distinct genetic backgrounds between American and East
   Asian ecotypes. Subsequently, we defined a core set consisting of 130
   accessions including 47 from Pop I, 68 from Pop II, and 15 from the
   Admixture group. This core set was able to capture all 133 alleles
   detected by 23 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in 1197 accessions. These
   results will facilitate efficient use of genetic variations in Citrullus
   in watermelon breeding and help optimization of accessions in genomewide
   association studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of different searches for correlations
   between very high-energy neutrino candidates detected by IceCube and the
   highest-energy cosmic rays measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory and
   the Telescope Array. We first consider samples of cascade neutrino
   events and of high-energy neutrino-induced muon tracks, which provided
   evidence for a neutrino flux of astrophysical origin, and study their
   cross-correlation with the ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) samples
   as a function of angular separation. We also study their possible
   directional correlations using a likelihood method stacking the neutrino
   arrival directions and adopting different assumptions on the size of the
   UHECR magnetic deflections. Finally, we perform another likelihood
   analysis stacking the UHECR directions and using a sample of
   through-going muon tracks optimized for neutrino point-source searches
   with sub-degree angular resolution. No indications of correlations at
   discovery level are obtained for any of the searches performed. The
   smallest of the p-values comes from the search for correlation between
   UHECRs with IceCube high-energy cascades, a result that should continue
   to be monitored.}},

Title = {{Low Temperature Soda-Oxygen Pulping of Bagasse}},
Journal = {{MOLECULES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Wood shortages, environmental pollution and high energy consumption
   remain major obstacles hindering the development of today's pulp and
   paper industry. Energy-saving and environmental friendly pulping
   processes are still needed, especially for non-woody materials. In this
   study, soda-oxygen pulping of bagasse was investigated and a successful
   soda-oxygen pulping process for bagasse at 100 degrees C was
   established. The pulping parameters of choice were under active alkali
   charge of 23\%, maximum cooking temperature 100 degrees C, time hold at
   maximum temperature 180 min, initial pressure of oxygen 0.6 MPa, MgSO4
   charge 0.5\%, and de-pithed bagasse consistency 12\%. Properties of the
   resultant pulp were screened yield 60.9\%, Kappa number 14, viscosity
   766 dm(3)/kg, and brightness 63.7\% ISO. Similar pulps were also
   obtained at 110 degrees C or 105 degrees C with a cooking time of 90
   min. Compared with pulps obtained at higher temperatures (115-125
   degrees C), this pulp had higher screened yield, brightness, and
   acceptable viscosity, while the delignification degree was moderate.
   These results indicated that soda-oxygen pulping at 100 degrees C, the
   lowest cooking temperature reported so far for soda-oxygen pulping, is a
   suitable process for making chemical pulp from bagasse. Pulping at lower
   temperature and using oxygen make it an environmental friendly and
   energy-saving pulping process.}},

   suspensions of deformable capsules}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1683-1700}},
Abstract = {{We present detailed simulations and theory for flow-induced segregation
   in suspensions of deformable fluid-filled capsules with different shapes
   during simple shear flow in a planar slit. This system is an idealized
   model for transport for blood cells and/or drug carriers in the
   microcirculation or in microfluidic devices. For the simulations, an
   accelerated implementation of the boundary integral method was employed.
   We studied the binary mixtures of spherical and ellipsoidal capsules,
   varying the aspect ratio kappa of the ellipsoid while keeping constant
   either (a) equatorial radius or (b) volume. Effects of a variety of
   parameters was studied, including k, volume fraction and number fraction
   of the spherical capsules in the mixture. In suspensions where the
   ellipsoids have the same equatorial radius as the spheres, capsules with
   lower kappa marginate. In suspension where the ellipsoids have the same
   volume as the spheres, ellipsoidal (both oblate and prolate) capsules
   are seen to demarginate in a mixture of primarily spherical capsules. To
   understand these results, a mechanistic framework based on the
   competition between wall-induced migration and shear-induced collisions
   is presented. A simplified drift-diffusion theory based on this
   framework shows excellent qualitative agreement with simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{Since hydroxyapatite and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) can
   regulate chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, their individual and combined
   effects on endochondral ossification within human bone marrow-derived
   stem cell (hMSC) aggregates were investigated. Hydroxyapatite was
   presented in the form of mineral-coated hydroxyapatite microparticles
   (MCM) capable of controlled BMP-2 delivery. Aggregates were treated with
   varied BMP-2 concentrations supplemented in the media and loaded onto
   MCM to examine the influence of BMP-2 amount and spatial presentation on
   regulating chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. MCM alone induced GAG and
   type II collagen production by week 5 for two of three donors, and BMP-2
   may have accelerated MCM-induced chondrogenesis. ALP activity and
   calcium content of cells-only aggregates suggest that the BMP-2-induced
   osteogenic response may be concentration-dependent. Treatment with MCM
   and BMP-2 resulted in chondrogenesis as early as week 2, which may have
   promoted additional mineralization by week 5, suggesting the induction
   of endochondral ossification. Released BMP-2 had similar if not higher
   levels of bioactivity compared to that of exogenous BMP-2 with regard to
   chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. In addition to providing localized and
   sustained BMP-2 delivery, MCM incorporation within aggregates yields a
   self-sustaining system that may be injected or implanted more rapidly to
   heal bone defects through endochondral ossification without extended in
   vitro culture.}},

Abstract = {{Candida albicans is the most prevalent cause of hospital-acquired fungal
   infections and forms biofilms on indwelling medical devices that are
   notoriously difficult to treat or remove. We recently demonstrated that
   the colonization of C. albicans on the surfaces of catheter tube
   segments can be reduced in vitro by coating them with polyelectrolyte
   multilayers (PEMs) that release a potent antifungal beta-peptide. Here,
   we report on the impact of polymer structure and film composition on
   both the inherent and beta-peptide-mediated ability of PEM-coated
   catheters to prevent or reduce the formation of C. albicans biofilms in
   vitro and in vivo using a rat model of central venous catheter
   infection. Coatings fabricated using polysaccharide-based components
   {[}hyaluronic acid (HA) and chitosan (CH)] and coatings fabricated using
   polypeptide-based components {[}poly-L-lysine (PLL) and poly-L-glutamic
   acid (PGA)] both served as reservoirs for the loading and sustained
   release of beta-peptide, but differed substantially in loading and
   release profiles and in their inherent antifungal properties (e.g., the
   ability to prevent colonization and biofilm growth in the absence of
   beta-peptide). In particular, CH/HA films exhibited inherent antifungal
   and antibiofilm behaviors in vitro and in vivo, a result we attribute to
   the incorporation of CH, a weak polycation demonstrated to exhibit
   antimicrobial properties in other contexts. The antifungal properties of
   both types of films were improved substantially when beta-peptide was
   incorporated. Catheter segments coated with beta-peptide-loaded CH/HA
   and PLL/PGA films were both strongly antifungal against planktonic C.
   albicans and the formation of surface-associated biofilms in vitro and
   in vivo. Our results demonstrate that PEM coatings provide a useful
   platform for the design of new antifungal materials, and suggest
   opportunities to design multifunctional or dual-action platforms to
   prevent or reduce the severity of fungal infections in applied
   biomedical contexts or other areas in which fungal biofilms are endemic.}},

Abstract = {{In 1988, the first contrast agent specifically designed for magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI), gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist(A (R))),
   became available for clinical use. Since then, a plethora of studies
   have investigated the potential of MRI contrast agents for diagnostic
   imaging across the body, including the central nervous system, heart and
   circulation, breast, lungs, the gastrointestinal, genitourinary,
   musculoskeletal and lymphatic systems, and even the skin. Today, after
   25 years of contrast-enhanced (CE-) MRI in clinical practice, the
   utility of this diagnostic imaging modality has expanded beyond initial
   expectations to become an essential tool for disease diagnosis and
   management worldwide. CE-MRI continues to evolve, with new techniques,
   advanced technologies, and novel contrast agents bringing exciting
   opportunities for more sensitive, targeted imaging and improved patient
   management, along with associated clinical challenges. This review aims
   to provide an overview on the history of MRI and contrast media
   development, to highlight certain key advances in the clinical
   development of CE-MRI, to outline current technical trends and clinical
   challenges, and to suggest some important future perspectives.

Abstract = {{Bacteria use a wide variety of methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins
   (MCPs) to mediate their attraction to or repulsion from different
   chemical signals in their environment. The bioluminescent marine
   bacterium Vibrio fischeri is the monospecific symbiont of the Hawaiian
   bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and encodes a large repertoire of MCPs
   that are hypothesized to be used during different parts of its complex,
   multistage lifestyle. Here, we report the initial characterization of
   two such MCPs from V. fischeri that are responsible for mediating
   migration toward short-and medium-chain aliphatic (or fatty) acids.
   These receptors appear to be distributed among only members of the
   family Vibrionaceae and are likely descended from a receptor that has
   been lost by the majority of the members of this family. While
   chemotaxis greatly enhances the efficiency of host colonization by V.
   fischeri, fatty acids do not appear to be used as a chemical cue during
   this stage of the symbiosis. This study presents an example of
   straight-chain fatty acid chemoattraction and contributes to the growing
   body of characterized MCP-ligand interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Microcellular injection molding of neat isotactic polypropylene (iPP)
   and isotactic polypropylene/nano-calcium carbonate composites
   (iPP/nano-CaCO3) was performed using supercritical carbon dioxide as the
   physical blowing agent. The influences of filler content and operating
   conditions on microstructure morphology of iPP and iPP/nano-CaCO3
   microcellular samples were studied systematically. The results showed
   the bubble size of the microcellular samples could be effectively
   decreased while the cell density increased for iPP/nano-CaCO3
   composites, especially at high CO2 concentration and back pressure, low
   mold temperature and injection speed, and high filler content. Then
   Moldex 3D was applied to simulate the microcellular injection molding
   process, with the application of the measured ScCO2 solubility and
   diffusion data for iPP and iPP/nano-CaCO3 composites respectively. For
   neat iPP, the simulated bubble size and density distribution in the
   center section of tensile bars showed a good agreement with the
   experimental values. However, for iPP/nano(-)CaCO3 composites, the
   correction factor for nucleation activation energy F and the
   pre-exponential factor of nucleation rate f(0) were obtained by
   nonlinear regression on the experimental bubble size and density
   distribution. The parameters F and f(0) can be used to predict the
   microcellular injection molding process for iPP/nano-CaCO3 composites by
   Moldex 3D. (C) 2015 The Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of

Abstract = {{We investigate model magnetorheological (MR) fluids (inverse
   ferrofluids) under both steady and dynamic oscillatory shear. Analytical
   theories, particle-level simulations, and magnetorheometry are used in
   an attempt to obtain universal master curves. Steady shear flow data can
   be collapsed when plotted as a function of a dimensionless Mason number.
   The critical Mason number associated with the transition from
   magnetostatic to hydrodynamic control of the suspension structure is
   demonstrated to linearly increase with particle concentration which is
   in good agreement with theories and our simulations. Experimental linear
   viscoelastic moduli are in good agreement with micromechanical and
   macroscopic models in the dilute regime. However, upon increasing
   particle concentration, theoretical predictions underestimate
   experimental data while particle-level simulations are in good
   agreement. The accordance with particle-level simulations suggests that
   the mean (average) magnetization approximation gives a good prediction
   and multibody and hydrodynamic forces are not expected to play a crucial
   role in the shear flow behavior of model MR fluids. (C) 2016 The Society

Abstract = {{It has been a long-standing challenge to produce air-stable few-or
   monolayer samples of phosphorene because thin phosphorene films degrade
   rapidly in ambient conditions. Here we demonstrate a new highly
   controllable method for fabricating high quality, air-stable phosphorene
   films with a designated number of layers ranging from a few down to
   monolayer. Our approach involves the use of oxygen plasma dry etching to
   thin down thick-exfoliated phosphorene flakes, layer by layer with
   atomic precision. Moreover, in a stabilized phosphorene monolayer, we
   were able to precisely engineer defects for the first time, which led to
   efficient emission of photons at new frequencies in the near infrared at
   room temperature. In addition, we demonstrate the use of an
   electrostatic gate to tune the photon emission from the defects in a
   monolayer phosphorene. This could lead to new electronic and
   optoelectronic devices, such as electrically tunable, broadband near
   infrared lighting devices operating at room temperature.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{To date, the preparation of free-standing 2D nanomaterials has been
   largely limited to the exfoliation of van der Waals solids. The lack of
   a robust mechanism for the bottom-up synthesis of 2D nanomaterials from
   non-layered materials has become an obstacle to further explore the
   physical properties and advanced applications of 2D nanomaterials. Here
   we demonstrate that surfactant monolayers can serve as soft templates
   guiding the nucleation and growth of 2D nanomaterials in large area
   beyond the limitation of van der Waals solids. One-to 2-nm-thick,
   single-crystalline free-standing ZnO nanosheets with sizes up to tens of
   micrometres are synthesized at the water-air interface. In this process,
   the packing density of surfactant monolayers adapts to the sub-phase
   metal ions and guides the epitaxial growth of nanosheets. It is thus
   named adaptive ionic layer epitaxy (AILE). The electronic properties of
   ZnO nanosheets and AILE of other materials are also investigated.}},

Title = {{Single-Cell, Time-Resolved Antimicrobial Effects of a Highly Cationic,
   Random Nylon-3 Copolymer on Live Escherichia coli}},
Journal = {{ACS CHEMICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{113-120}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Synthetic random copolymers based on the nylon-3 (beta-peptide) backbone
   show promise as inexpensive antimicrobial agents resistant to
   proteolysis. We present a time-resolved observational study of the
   attack of a particular copolymer MM63:CHx(37) on single, live
   Escherichia coli cells. The composition and chain length of MM63:CHx(37)
   (63\% cationic subunits, 37\% hydrophobic subunits, 35-subunit average
   length) were optimized to enhance antibacterial activity while
   minimizing lysis of human red blood cells. For E. coli cells that export
   GFP to the periplasm, we obtain alternating phase-contrast and green
   fluorescence images with a time resolution of 12 s over 60 min following
   initiation of copolymer flow. Within seconds, cells shrink and exhibit
   the same plasmolysis spaces that occur following abrupt external osmotic
   upshift. The osmoprotection machinery attempts to replenish cytoplasmic
   water, but recovery is interrupted by permeabilization of the
   cytoplasmic membrane (CM) to GFP. Evidently, the highly cationic
   copolymer and its counterions rapidly translocate across the outer
   membrane without permeabilizing it to GFP. The CM permeabilization event
   is spatially localized. Cells whose CM has been permeabilized never
   recover growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for cells
   lacking the osmolyte importer ProP is 4-fold smaller than for normal
   cells, suggesting that osmoprotection is an important survival strategy.
   In addition, at the time of CM permeabilization, we observe evidence of
   oxidative stress. The MIC under anaerobic conditions is at least 8-fold
   larger than under aerobic conditions, further implicating oxidative
   damage as an important bacteriostatic effect. Once the copolymer reaches
   the periplasm, multiple growth-halting mechanisms proceed in parallel.}},

Abstract = {{Background: NIH Mentored Career Development (K) Awards bridge
   investigators from mentored to independent research. A smaller
   proportion of women than men succeed in this transition. The aim of this
   qualitative study was to analyze reviewers' narrative critiques of K
   award applications and explore thematic content of feedback provided to
   male and female applicants. Method: We collected 88 critiques, 34 from 9
   unfunded and 54 from 18 funded applications, from 70\% (n=26) of
   investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with K awards
   funded between 2005 and 2009 on the first submission or after revision.
   We qualitatively analyzed text in the 5 critique sections: candidate,
   career development plan, research plan, mentors, and environment and
   institutional commitment. We explored thematic content within these
   sections for male and female applicants and for applicants who had
   received a subsequent independent research award by 2014. Results:
   Themes revealed consistent areas of criticism for unfunded applications
   and praise for funded applications. Subtle variations in thematic
   content appeared for male and female applicants: For male applicants
   criticism was often followed by advice but for female applicants it was
   followed by questions about ability; praise recurrently characterized
   male but not female applicants' research as highly significant with
   optimism for future independence. Female K awardees that obtained
   subsequent independent awards stood out as having track records
   described as outstanding. Conclusion: This exploratory study suggests
   that K award reviewer feedback, particularly for female applicants,
   should be investigated as a potential contributor to research
   persistence and success in crossing the bridge to independence.}},

Abstract = {{The genome is the target of some of the most effective
   chemotherapeutics, but most of these drugs lack DNA sequence
   specificity, which leads to dose-limiting toxicity and many adverse side
   effects. Targeting the genome with sequence-specific small molecules may
   enable molecules with increased therapeutic index and fewer off-target
   effects. N-methylpyrrole/N-methylimidazole polyamides are molecules that
   can be rationally designed to target specific DNA sequences with
   exquisite precision. And unlike most natural transcription factors,
   polyamides can bind to methylated and chromatinized DNA without a loss
   in affinity. The sequence specificity of polyamides has been extensively
   studied in vitro with cognate site identification (CSI) and with
   traditional biochemical and biophysical approaches, but the study of
   polyamide binding to genomic targets in cells remains elusive. Here we
   report a method, the crosslinking of small molecules to isolate
   chromatin (COSMIC), that identifies polyamide binding sites across the
   genome. COSMIC is similar to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), but
   differs in two important ways: (1) a photocrosslinker is employed to
   enable selective, temporally-controlled capture of polyamide binding
   events, and (2) the biotin affinity handle is used to purify
   polyamide-DNA conjugates under semi-denaturing conditions to decrease
   DNA that is non-covalently bound. COSMIC is a general strategy that can
   be used to reveal the genome-wide binding events of polyamides and other
   genome-targeting chemotherapeutic agents.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter demonstrates the ability to determine experimentally the
   complete state of stress throughout a compressively-loaded rectangular
   aluminum plate containing an irregularly-shaped asymmetrically
   orientated hole. This is achieved by processing the recorded associated
   stress-induced temperature information with a stress function and
   discretely imposing the boundary conditions. The challenges include
   handling the total lack of symmetry and satisfying the traction-free
   conditions on the edge of the irregularly-shaped inclined hole.}},

Journal = {{TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Abstract = {{A novel chaotic attractor with a fractal wing structure is proposed and
   analyzed in terms of its basic dynamical properties. The most
   interesting feature of this system is that it has complex dynamical
   behavior, especially coexisting attractors for particular ranges of the
   parameters, including two coexisting periodic or strange attractors that
   can coexist with a third strange attractor. Amplitude and phase control
   methods are described since they are convenient for circuit design and
   chaotic signal applications. An appropriately chosen parameter in a
   particular quadratic coefficient can realize partial amplitude control.
   An added linear term can change the symmetry and provide an accessible
   knob to control the phase polarity. Finally, an amplitude-phase
   controllable circuit is designed using PSpice, and it shows good
   agreement with the theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts to implement quality improvements in surgery are notoriously
   problematic.(1,2) One needs to look no farther than recent attempts to
   implement checklists, team training, and surgical briefings. These
   interventions have been empirically shown to improve team communication
   and performance.(3,4) Yet numerous barriers to implementation have
   limited their broad adoption and use. Apparently, knowing the remedy
   (intervention) does not translate into knowing how to administer
   (implement) it.(5) Or in surgical terms, knowing what procedure needs to
   be performed does not necessarily mean that one knows how to perform
   it.Surgeons serve a vital leadership role in driving quality and patient
   safety initiatives in the operating room. Achieving success requires
   both an in-depth understanding of the intervention and the complex
   dynamics of the elements involved in the implementation process. To aid
   in this endeavor, the present article describes a Model for
   Understanding System Transitions Associated with the Implementation of
   New Goals (MUSTAING). The model highlights important variables
   associated with implementation success. It also provides a tool for
   diagnosing why certain interventions may not have worked as intended so
   that improvements in the implementation process can be made. Finally,
   the model offers a general framework for guiding future implementation
   or how to research.}},

Title = {{Expression of the Drosophila Homeobox Gene, Distal-less, Supports an
   Ancestral Role in Neural Development}},
Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{245}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{87-95}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Distal-less (Dll) encodes a homeodomain transcription factor
   expressed in developing appendages of organisms throughout metazoan
   phylogeny. Based on earlier observations in the limbless nematode
   Caenorhabditis elegans and the primitive chordate amphioxus, it was
   proposed that Dll had an ancestral function in nervous system
   development. Consistent with this hypothesis, Dll is necessary for the
   development of both peripheral and central components of the Drosophila
   olfactory system. Furthermore, vertebrate homologs of Dll, the Dlx
   genes, play critical roles in mammalian brain development. Results:
   Using fluorescent immunohistochemistry of fixed samples and multiphoton
   microscopy of living Drosophila embryos, we show that Dll is expressed
   in the embryonic, larval and adult central nervous system and peripheral
   nervous system (PNS) in embryonic and larval neurons, brain and ventral
   nerve cord glia, as well as in PNS structures associated with
   chemosensation. In adult flies, Dll expression is expressed in the optic
   lobes, central brain regions and the antennal lobes. Conclusions:
   Characterization of Dll expression in the developing nervous system
   supports a role of Dll in neural development and function and
   establishes an important basis for determining the specific functional
   roles of Dll in Drosophila development and for comparative studies of
   Drosophila Dll functions with those of its vertebrate counterparts. (C)

Title = {{Are Harmful Algal Blooms Becoming the Greatest Inland Water Quality
   Threat to Public Health and Aquatic Ecosystems?}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{6-13}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this Focus article, the authors ask a seemingly simple question: Are
   harmful algal blooms (HABs) becoming the greatest inland water quality
   threat to public health and aquatic ecosystems? When HAB events require
   restrictions on fisheries, recreation, and drinking water uses of inland
   water bodies significant economic consequences result. Unfortunately,
   the magnitude, frequency, and duration of HABs in inland waters are
   poorly understood across spatiotemporal scales and differentially
   engaged among states, tribes, and territories. Harmful algal bloom
   impacts are not as predictable as those from conventional chemical
   contaminants, for which water quality assessment and management programs
   were primarily developed, because interactions among multiple natural
   and anthropogenic factors determine the likelihood and severity to which
   a HAB will occur in a specific water body. These forcing factors can
   also affect toxin production. Beyond site-specific water quality
   degradation caused directly by HABs, the presence of HAB toxins can
   negatively influence routine surface water quality monitoring,
   assessment, and management practices. Harmful algal blooms present
   significant challenges for achieving water quality protection and
   restoration goals when these toxins confound interpretation of
   monitoring results and environmental quality standards implementation
   efforts for other chemicals and stressors. Whether HABs presently
   represent the greatest threat to inland water quality is debatable,
   though in inland waters of developed countries they typically cause more
   severe acute impacts to environmental quality than conventional chemical
   contamination events. The authors identify several timely research
   needs. Environmental toxicology, environmental chemistry, and
   risk-assessment expertise must interface with ecologists, engineers, and
   public health practitioners to engage the complexities of HAB assessment
   and management, to address the forcing factors for HAB formation, and to
   reduce the threats posed to inland surface water quality. (C) 2015 SETAC}},

Abstract = {{Although nanomaterials have been widely investigated for drug delivery,
   imaging and immunotherapy, their potential roles in triggering innate
   cellular immune responses while simultaneously serving as imaging
   enhancer remain unexplored. In this work, gold nanoparticles (GNPs)
   conjugated to the tumortargeting anti-GD2 antibody hu14.18K322A, namely
   HGNPs, were designed and synthesized to specifically enhance
   computerized tomography (CT) imaging contrast and to stimulate the
   attack of neuroblastoma and melanoma cells by natural killer (NK) cells.
   The HGNPs specifically targeted GD2-positive neuroblastoma (NB1691) and
   melanoma (M21) cells, with an enhancement of CT contrast images of the
   HGNP-labeled cell pellets by 5.27- and 7.66-fold, respectively, compared
   to images of unlabeled cell pellets. The HGNPs also triggered
   NK-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in
   NB1691 and M21 cells with a two-fold higher efficacy compared to that
   elicited by hu14.18K322A alone, with no adverse effect to GD2-negative
   PC-3 cells. These results suggest that HGNPs are promising theranostic
   agents for neuroblastoma and melanoma cancers.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoresistive polymer nanocomposites are highly desirable for flexible
   mechanical sensing applications. In this study, a family of multi-walled
   carbon nanotube (CNT)/elastomeric triisocyanate-crosslinked
   polytetrahydrofuran (ETC-PTHF) nanocomposites that are highly
   stretchable and highly sensitive to mechanical stimuli were designed,
   synthesized, and characterized. The CNTs in the CNT/ETC-PTHF
   nanocomposites were initially dispersed in the ETC-PTHF matrix
   uniformly, leading to a relatively high electrical conductivity. Upon
   stretching, both the degree of CNT alignment along the stretching
   direction and the degree of PTHF crystallinity increased consistently
   with the tensile strain. The strain-induced microstructure change
   adversely affected the CNT conducting pathways, thereby reducing the
   electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites. For instance, the
   electrical conductivity of the 15 wt\% CNT/ETC-PTHF nanocomposites
   decreased by approximately 7.3\%, 29.2\%, and 19.76, 169.2 and 1291
   times when the tensile strain was 1\%, 5\%, 50\%, 250\%, and 500\%,
   respectively. The nanocomposite film was able to detect a mechanical
   stimulus (poking) weaker than the landing force of a mosquito.
   Furthermore, the nanocomposite film demonstrated rapid and highly
   sensitive responses to continuous finger motion. These new
   piezoresistive CNT/ETC-PTHF nanocomposites possess a number of desirable
   characteristics including ease of fabrication, low cost, and high
   sensitivity, thereby making them very promising candidates for
   applications in electronic skins, electronic textiles, and biomedical
   detectors.}},

Abstract = {{The hanging droplet technique for three-dimensional tissue culture has
   been used for decades in biology labs, with the core technology
   remaining relatively unchanged. Recently microscale approaches have
   expanded the capabilities of the hanging droplet method, making it more
   user-friendly. We present a spontaneously driven, open hanging droplet
   culture platform to address many limitations of current platforms. Our
   platform makes use of two interconnected hanging droplet wells, a larger
   well where cells are cultured and a smaller well for user interface via
   a pipette. The two-well system results in lower shear stress in the
   culture well during fluid exchange, enabling shear sensitive or
   non-adherent cells to be cultured in a droplet. The ability to perform
   fluid exchanges in-droplet enables long-term culture, treatment, and
   characterization without disruption of the culture. The open well format
   of the platform was utilized to perform time-dependent coculture,
   enabling culture configurations with bone tissue scaffolds and cells
   grown in suspension. The open nature of the system allowed the direct
   addition or removal of tissue over the course of an experiment,
   manipulations that would be impractical in other microfluidic or hanging
   droplet culture platforms.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the performance of 4H-SiC betavoltaic
   microbatteries under exposure to the practical Ni-63 sources using the
   Monte Carlo method and Synopsys (R) Medici device simulator. A typical
   planar p-n junction betavoltaic device with the Ni-63 source of 20\%
   purity on top is modeled in the simulation. The p-n junction structure
   includes a p+ layer, a p- layer, an n+ layer, and an n- layer. In order
   to obtain an accurate and valid predication, our simulations consider
   several practical factors, including isotope impurities,
   self-absorption, and full beta energy spectra. By simulating the effects
   of both the p-n junction configuration and the isotope source thickness
   on the battery output performance, we have achieved the optimal design
   of the device and maximum energy conversion efficiency. Our simulation
   results show that the energy conversion efficiency increases as the
   doping concentration and thickness of the p- layer increase, whereas it
   is independent of the total depth of the p-n junction. Furthermore, the
   energy conversion efficiency decreases as the thickness of the practical
   Ni-63 source increases, because of self-absorption in the isotope
   source. Therefore, we propose that a p-n junction betavoltaic cell with
   a thicker and heavily doped p- layer under exposure to a practical Ni-63
   source with an appreciable thickness could produce the optimal energy
   conversion efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To improve velocity vector field reconstruction from
   undersampled four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI by penalizing divergence of
   the measured flow field.
   Theory and Methods: Iterative image reconstruction in which magnitude
   and phase are regularized separately in alternating iterations was
   implemented. The approach allows incorporating prior knowledge of the
   flow field being imaged. In the present work, velocity data were
   regularized to reduce divergence, using either divergence-free wavelets
   (DFW) or a finite difference (FD) method using the l(1)-norm of
   divergence and curl. The reconstruction methods were tested on a
   numerical phantom and in vivo data.
   Results of the DFW and FD approaches were compared with data obtained
   with standard compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction. Results: Relative
   to standard CS, directional errors of vector fields and divergence were
   reduced by 55-60\% and 38-48\% for three-and six-fold undersampled data
   with the DFW and FD methods. Velocity vector displays of the numerical
   phantom and in vivo data were found to be improved upon DFW or FD
   reconstruction.
   Conclusion: Regularization of vector field divergence in image
   reconstruction from undersampled 4D flow data is a valuable approach to
   improve reconstruction accuracy of velocity vector fields. (C) 2014

Volume = {{75}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Demonstration of feasibility and protocol optimization for the
   combined use of gadofosveset trisodium with gadoxetic acid for delayed
   T1-weighted liver MRI.
   Methods: Eleven healthy volunteers underwent hepatobiliary phase imaging
   at 3 Tesla (T) using gadoxetic acid. Multiple breathheld T1-weighted
   three-dimensional spoiled gradient echo sequences were performed at
   varying flip angles before and after injection of gadofosveset.
   Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were
   measured to determine optimal T1-weighting. Examples of three patients
   with focal liver lesions were acquired.
   Results: The addition of gadofosveset to the hepatobiliary phase of
   gadoxetic acid renders vessels isointense to liver tissue at low flip
   angles due to increased vessel SNR (P<0.001). The lowest CNR of liver
   relative to portal vein (CNR = 15; 95\% confidence interval {[} CI]: -
   14-44) was observed at a 10 degrees flip angle. The highest CNR of liver
   relative to muscle (CNR = 214; 95\% CI: 191-237) was observed at a 20
   degrees flip angle. The combined enhancement leads to homogenously
   enhanced liver tissue and liver vasculature. Cysts were detected in
   three volunteers and metastases were detected in two patients. In these
   anecdotal cases the cysts and metastases stood out as conspicuous focal
   hypointensities on combined gadoxetic acid and gadofosveset enhanced
   images.
   Conclusion: Combined gadoxetic acid and gadofosveset enhanced liver MRI
   is feasible, with low flip angles minimizing contrast between vessels
   and liver. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm that low flip
   angles provide an optimal combination of sensitivity and specificity for
   lesion detection in patients. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   embryonic stem cell aggregates}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{29}},
Pages = {{42-51}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Pluripotent stem cell aggregates offer an attractive approach to emulate
   embryonic morphogenesis and skeletal development. Calcium phosphate
   (Cap) based biomaterials have been shown to promote bone healing due to
   their osteoconductive and potential osteoinductive properties. In this
   study, we hypothesized that incorporation of Cap-coated hydroxyapatite
   mineral particles (MPs) within murine embryonic stem cell (ESC)
   aggregates could promote osteo-chondrogenic differentiation. Our results
   demonstrated that MP alone dose-dependently promoted the gene expression
   of chondrogenic and early osteogenic markers. In combination with
   soluble osteoinductive cues, MPs enhanced the hypertrophic and
   osteogenic phenotype, and mineralization of ESC aggregates.
   Additionally, MPs dose-dependently reduced ESC pluripotency and thereby
   decreased the size of teratomas derived from MP-incorporated ESC
   aggregates in vivo. Our data suggested a novel yet simple means of using
   mineral particles to control stem cell fate and create an osteochondral
   niche for skeletal tissue engineering applications.
   Statement of Significance
   Directing stem cell differentiation and morphogenesis via biomaterials
   represents a novel strategy to promote cell fates and tissue formation.
   Our study demonstrates the ability of calcium phosphate-based mineral
   particles to promote osteochondrogenic differentiation of embryonic stem
   cell aggregates as well as modulate teratoma formation in vivo. This
   hybrid biomaterial-ESC aggregate approach serves as an enabling platform
   to evaluate the ability of biomaterials to regulate stem cell fate and
   regenerate functional skeletal tissues for clinical applications. (C)

Abstract = {{Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is the most lethal naturally produced
   neurotoxin. Due to the extreme toxicity, BoNTs are implicated in
   bioterrorism, while the specific mechanism of action and long-lasting
   effect was found to be medically applicable in treating various
   neurological disorders. Therefore, for both public and patient safety, a
   highly sensitive, physiologic, and specific assay is needed. In this
   paper, we show a method for achieving a highly sensitive cell-based
   assay for BoNT/A detection using the motor neuron-like continuous cell
   line NG108-15. To achieve high sensitivity, we performed a media
   optimization study evaluating three commercially available neural
   supplements in combination with retinoic acid, purmorphamine,
   transforming growth factor 1 (TGF1), and ganglioside GT1b. We found
   nonlinear combinatorial effects on BoNT/A detection sensitivity,
   achieving an EC50 of 7.4 U +/- 1.5 SD (or similar to 7.9 pM). The
   achieved detection sensitivity is comparable to that of assays that used
   primary and stem cell-derived neurons as well as the mouse lethality
   assay.}},

Abstract = {{In (x) Al(1-x)N (InAlN) thin films, lattice-matched to GaN with an In
   composition of similar to 17\%, are of interest for GaN-based devices.
   However, InAlN thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy exhibit a
   characteristic lateral composition modulation, or nanocolumnar
   microstructure, with an Al-rich center region and an In-rich boundary.
   The mechanism driving the formation of this microstructure remains
   unknown. To date, the structural characterization of the nanocolumn
   domain size and its associated compositional variation is challenging,
   requiring either transmission electron microscopy or atomic probe
   microscopy. We show that the nanocolumnar microstructure can be
   characterized using x-ray diffraction and is associated with increased
   diffuse scattering. Using this technique, we show that the development
   of the microstructure is dependent on growth temperature.}},

Title = {{Crystal Structure of the Core Region of Hantavirus Nucleocapsid Protein
   Reveals the Mechanism for Ribonucleoprotein Complex Formation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Hantaviruses, which belong to the genus Hantavirus in the family
   Bunyaviridae, infect mammals, including humans, causing either
   hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or hantavirus
   cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in humans with high mortality.
   Hantavirus encodes a nucleocapsid protein (NP) to encapsidate the genome
   and form a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) together with viral
   polymerase. Here, we report the crystal structure of the core domains of
   NP (NPcore) encoded by Sin Nombre virus (SNV) and Andes virus (ANDV),
   which are two representative members that cause HCPS in the New World.
   The constructs of SNV and ANDV NPcore exclude the N- and C-terminal
   portions of full polypeptide to obtain stable proteins for
   crystallographic study. The structure features an N lobe and a C lobe to
   clamp RNA-binding crevice and exhibits two protruding extensions in both
   lobes. The positively charged residues located in the RNA-binding
   crevice play a key role in RNA binding and virus replication. We further
   demonstrated that the C-terminal helix and the linker region connecting
   the N-terminal coiled-coil domain and NPcore are essential for
   hantavirus NP oligomerization through contacts made with two adjacent
   protomers. Moreover, electron microscopy (EM) visualization of native
   RNPs extracted from the virions revealed that a monomer-sized NP-RNA
   complex is the building block of viral RNP. This work provides insight
   into the formation of hantavirus RNP and provides an understanding of
   the evolutionary connections that exist among bunyaviruses.
   IMPORTANCE
   Hantaviruses are distributed across a wide and increasing range of host
   reservoirs throughout the world. In particular, hantaviruses can be
   transmitted via aerosols of rodent excreta to humans or from human to
   human and cause HFRS and HCPS, with mortalities of 15\% and 50\%,
   respectively. Hantavirus is therefore listed as a category C pathogen.
   Hantavirus encodes an NP that plays essential roles both in RNP
   formation and in multiple biological functions. NP is also the exclusive
   target for the serological diagnoses. This work reveals the structure of
   hantavirus NP, furthering the knowledge of hantavirus RNP formation,
   revealing the relationship between hantavirus NP and serological
   specificity and raising the potential for the development of new
   diagnosis and therapeutics targeting hantavirus infection.}},

Title = {{A porphyrin-PEG polymer with rapid renal clearance}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{25-32}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Tetracarboxylic porphyrins and polyethylene glycol (PEG) diamines were
   crosslinked in conditions that gave rise to a water-soluble porphyrin
   polyamide. Using PEG linkers 2 kDa or larger prevented fluorescence
   self-quenching. This networked porphyrin mesh was retained during
   dialysis with membranes with a 100 kDa pore size, yet passed through the
   membrane when centrifugal filtration was applied. Following intravenous
   administration, the porphyrin mesh, but not the free porphyrin, was
   rapidly cleared via renal excretion. The process could be monitored by
   fluorescence analysis of collected urine, with minimal background due to
   the large Stokes shift of the porphyrin (230 nm separating excitation
   and emission peaks). In a rhabdomyolysis mouse model of renal failure,
   porphyrin mesh urinary clearance was significantly impaired. This led to
   slower accumulation in the bladder, which could be visualized
   non-invasively via fluorescence imaging. Without further modification,
   the porphyrin mesh was chelated with Cu-64 for dynamic whole body
   positron emission tomography imaging of renal clearance. Together, these
   data show that small porphyrin-PEG polymers can serve as effective
   multimodal markers of renal function. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The removal of nitrogen compounds (N-compounds) from fuels has attracted
   considerable attention because of the necessity to reduce nitrogen oxide
   emission and improve sulfur elimination. In this work, we reported a
   novel denitrogenation method of fuels using deep eutectic solvents
   (DESs) as extractants, and demonstrated the essential role of a rational
   control of the physicochemical character of DESs in achieving superior
   denitrogenation performance. Among the investigated DESs, the 1 : 2
   molar mixture of choline chloride and phenylacetic acid presented the
   best denitrogenation performance, showing simultaneous efficient removal
   of both basic and non-basic N-compounds. Without chemical reactions, the
   extraction efficiencies of pyridine and carbazole at 308 K with a 1 : 1
   DES : oil mass ratio were 99.2\% and 98.2\%, respectively, and the
   selectivities to n-heptane were higher than 10 000. This was better than
   the performance of compared conventional solvents. The extraction
   efficiency was not sensitive to the DES : oil mass ratio and
   temperature, and remained unchanged after four regeneration cycles. In
   addition to the ``green solvents{''} character of DESs, these results
   collectively demonstrate the considerable potential of DESs as promising
   materials for the green and efficient denitrogenation of fuels.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrolytic lignin and hydrogenated pyrolytic lignin were characterized by
   2D H-1-C-13 HSQC and quantitative C-13 NMR techniques. The pyrolytic
   lignin was produced from a mixed maple wood feedstock and separated from
   the bio-oil by water extraction. p-Hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and
   syringyl (S) aromatics were the basic units of pyrolytic lignin. The
   native lignin beta-aryl ether, phenylcoumaran and resinol structures
   were not present in the pyrolytic lignin. The hydrogenation was
   conducted with a Ru/TiO2 catalyst at temperatures ranging from 25-150
   degrees C with higher temperatures exhibiting higher levels of
   hydrogenation. Solid coke formed on the catalyst surface (1\% coke
   yield) even for hydrogenation at 25 degrees C. The carbon yield of
   pyrolytic lignin to coke increased from 1\% to 5\% as the hydrogenation
   temperature increased from 25 to 150 degrees C. A single-step
   hydrogenation at 150 degrees C resulted in a reduction from 65\% to 39\%
   aromatic carbons. A three-step hydrogenation scheme at this same
   temperature resulted in a reduction of aromatic carbons from 65\% to
   17\%. The decrease in the aromatic carbon corresponded with an increase
   in the aliphatic carbon. Coke formation reduced from a 5\% carbon yield
   of pyrolytic lignin in the first hydrogenation step to a 1\% carbon
   yield in each of the second and third hydrogenation steps. The pyrolytic
   lignin could be separated into a high and low molecular weight fraction.
   The coke yield from the high molecular weight fraction was twice as much
   as that from the low molecular weight fraction.}},

Abstract = {{Mammography is the standardized testing process for early detection of
   breast cancer. In this paper, a system-theoretic method based on a
   Markov chain model is presented to analyze such processes. Specifically,
   the general testing process in a single exam room is formulated using a
   Markov chain model. To resolve the dimensionality issue, an iteration
   method, referred to as shared resource iteration, is introduced to
   analyze the scenarios of two or more exam rooms. Formulas to evaluate
   the patient length of stay and staff efficiency are developed. The
   extension to non-Markovian scenarios is also investigated and an
   empirical formula is proposed. The experimental results indicate that
   such a method results in a high accuracy of performance estimation. A
   case study at a breast imaging center of the University of Wisconsin
   Medical Foundation is presented to illustrate the applicability of the
   model. In addition, the impact of patient volume increase is also
   studied, which shows that a capacity increase is necessary to
   accommodate the high demand.}},

Title = {{Surgeons' Leadership Styles and Team Behavior in the Operating Room}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The importance of leadership is recognized in surgery, but
   the specific impact of leadership style on team behavior is not well
   understood. In other industries, leadership is a well-characterized
   construct. One dominant theory proposes that transactional
   (task-focused) leaders achieve minimum standards and transformational
   (team-oriented) leaders inspire performance beyond expectations.
   STUDY DESIGN: We videorecorded 5 surgeons performing complex operations.
   Each surgeon was scored on the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, a
   validated method for scoring transformational and transactional
   leadership style, by an organizational psychologist and a surgeon
   researcher. Independent coders assessed surgeons' leadership behaviors
   according to the Surgical Leadership Inventory and team behaviors
   (information sharing, cooperative, and voice behaviors). All coders were
   blinded. Leadership style (Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire) was
   correlated with surgeon behavior (Surgical Leadership Inventory) and
   team behavior using Poisson regression, controlling for time and the
   total number of behaviors, respectively.
   RESULTS: All surgeons scored similarly on transactional leadership
   (range 2.38 to 2.69), but varied more widely on transformational
   leadership (range 1.98 to 3.60). Each 1-point increase in
   transformational score corresponded to 3 times more information-sharing
   behaviors (p < 0.0001) and 5.4 times more voice behaviors (p = 0.0005)
   among the team. With each 1-point increase in transformational score,
   leaders displayed 10 times more supportive behaviors (p < 0.0001) and
   displayed poor behaviors 12.5 times less frequently (p < 0.0001).
   Excerpts of representative dialogue are included for illustration.
   CONCLUSIONS: We provide a framework for evaluating surgeons' leadership
   and its impact on team performance in the operating room. As in other
   fields, our data suggest that transformational leadership is associated
   with improved team behavior. Surgeon leadership development, therefore,
   has the potential to improve the efficiency and safety of operative
   care. (C) 2016 by the American College of Surgeons. Published by

Abstract = {{A land suitability analysis, one of the oldest forms of decision-making
   support systems in the field of planning is still referred as an
   effective decision-helping aid that will enhance the complicate planning

   have accelerated the movements toward more technical solutions. The GIS
   implemented decision-making support system is a particularly good way to
   handle the difficult planning situations. Within this regard, this paper
   utilizes a suitability analysis to determine the most acceptable
   location for a proposed landfill facility in Hays County in the State of
   Texas. Using the Delphi panel discussion, Analytic Hierarchical Process
   (AHP), and map algebra in GIS environment, three most suitable sites for
   a future landfill facility are identified. This paper also has provided
   an in-depth overview on the latest decision support systems research and
   spatial multi-criteria decision sciences. Land suitability analysis is
   one of many possibilities that GIS could bring to the field of land use
   planning, and should be studied constantly.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We performed a quantitative intraindividual comparison of the
   performance of 0.025- and 0.05-mmol/kg doses for gadoxetic acid-enhanced
   liver magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
   Materials and Methods: Eleven healthy volunteers underwent liver MR
   imaging twice, once with a 0.025- and once with a 0.05-mmol/kg dose of
   gadoxetic acid. MR spectroscopy and 3-dimensional gradient-echo
   T-1-weighted images (3D-GRE) were obtained before and 3, 10, and 20 mm
   after injection of the contrast medium to measure T-1 and T-2 values and
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)
   performance. During the dynamic phase, highly time-resolved 3D-GRE was
   used to estimate the relative CNR (CNRrel) of the hepatic artery and
   portal vein (PV) to the liver. We used paired t-tests to compare the
   results of different doses.
   Results: During the hepatobiliary phase, we observed shorter T-1 values
   and higher SNRs of the liver (P < 0.001) and higher liver-to-PV and
   liver-to-muscle CNRs (P < 0.002) using 0.05 mmol/kg compared to 0.025
   mmol/kg. Increasing the dose to 0.05 mmol/kg yielded a greater
   T-1-shortening effect at 10 mm delay even compared with 0.025 mmol/kg at
   20 mm (P < 0.001). During the dynamic phase, the peak CNRrel for the
   hepatic artery and portal vein were higher using 0.05 mmol/kg (P = 0.007
   to 0.035).
   Conclusion: Use of gadoxetic acid at a dose of 0.05 mmol/kg leads to
   significantly higher SNR and CNR performance than with 0.025 mmol/kg.
   Quantitatively, a 10-min delay may be feasible for hepatobiliary-phase
   imaging when using 0.05 mmol/kg of gadoxetic acid.}},

Abstract = {{Following previous work, this paper introduces a new dynamical model
   involving two differential equations describing the time variation of
   behavior displayed by a couple in a romantic relationship. This model is
   different from previous ones because it uses complex variables. Since
   complex variables have both magnitude and phase, they are better able to
   represent love and can represent more complex emotions such as
   coexisting love and hate. The model treats feelings as a two-dimensional
   vector rather than a scalar, which is a step closer to reality. Another
   interesting characteristic of the new model is its ability to show
   transiently chaotic behavior between only two individuals, which in
   previous models appeared only in love triangles. The sensitive
   dependence on initial conditions represents the unpredictable dynamics
   of love affairs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the adaptive modified hybrid function projective
   synchronization with complex function transformation matrix (CMHFPS) for
   different dimensional chaotic (hyperchaotic) systems with complex

   considerably different from those in the existing closely related
   literature. Moreover, the transformation matrix in this type of chaos
   synchronization is not a square matrix, and its elements are complex
   functions. In particular, by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions
   dependent on complex variables, the adaptive controllers are designed to
   synchronize different dimensional complex chaos (hyperchaos) with
   complex parameters in the sense of CMHFPS, and the complex update laws
   for estimating unknown complex parameters of complex chaotic systems are
   also given. Finally, two examples are presented to illustrate the

Title = {{Evaluating Integrated Project Delivery Using the Project Quarterback
   Rating}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development, validation, and implementation of
   an innovative comprehensive project performance metric specifically
   developed for architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)
   projects. The project quarterback rating (PQR) combines key performance
   metrics of a project into a single number to provide a basis for
   quantifying project success. The combined performance areas include
   customer relations, schedule and budget compliance, quality and safety
   statistics, financial metrics, and communication among the different
   project stakeholders. The existing literature is analyzed to identify
   key performance metrics. A data-collection instrument is developed and
   then used to gather quantitative performance data from recently
   completed projects. Data are collected from industry professionals
   across the United States, and multivariate data analysis techniques are
   used to validate the model. PQR can compare the overall performance for
   different AEC projects, in addition to the performance of various
   project delivery systems. In this paper, PQR scores are calculated for
   projects completed under different delivery systems. The results clearly
   show differences in performance for projects delivered with
   design-bid-build (DBB), construction management at risk (CMR),
   design-build (DB), and integrated project delivery (IPD). This paper
   offers three major contributions to the construction engineering and
   management literature: (1) it presents the development and validation of
   the comprehensive performance model; (2) it provides the first
   comparison of project delivery systems through a single comprehensive
   metric; and (3) it offers an evaluation of the emerging IPD system,
   demonstrating superior overall performance when compared with other
   delivery systems. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene oxide (GO) was incorporated into poly(lactic acid) (PLA) as a
   reinforcing nanofiller to produce composite nanofibrous scaffolds using
   the electrospinning technique. To improve the dispersion of GO in PLA
   and the interfacial adhesion between the filler and matrix, GO was
   surface-grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Morphological,
   thermal, mechanical, and wettability properties, as well as preliminary
   cytocompatibility with Swiss mouse NIH 3T3 cells of PLA, PLA/GO, and
   PLA/GO-g-PEG electrospun nanofibers, were characterized. Results showed
   that the average diameter of PLA/GO-g-PEG electrospun nanofibers
   decreased with filler content. Both GO and GO-g-PEG improved the thermal
   stability of PLA, but GO-g-PEG was more effective. The water contact
   angle test of the nanofiber mats showed that the addition of GO in PLA
   did not change the surface wettability of the materials, but
   PLA/GO-g-PEG samples exhibited improved wettability with lower water
   contact angles. The tensile strength of the composite nanofiber mats was
   improved with the addition of GO, and it was further enhanced when GO
   was surface grafted with PEG. This suggested that improved interfacial
   adhesion between GO and PLA was achieved by grafting PEG onto the GO.
   The cell viability and proliferation results showed that the
   cytocompatibility of PLA was not compromised with the addition of GO and
   GO-g-PEG. With enhanced mechanical properties as well as good
   wettability and cytocompatibility, PLA/GO-g-PEG composite nanofibers
   have the potential to be used as scaffolds in tissue engineering. (C)

   self-assembly}},
Journal = {{NATURE MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{106+}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Topological defects in liquid crystals (LCs) have been widely used to
   organize colloidal dispersions and template polymerization, leading to a
   range of assemblies, elastomers and gels. However, little is understood
   about molecular-level assembly processes within defects. Here, we report
   that nanoscopic environments defined by LC topological defects can
   selectively trigger processes of molecular self-assembly. By using
   fluorescence microscopy, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and
   super-resolution optical microscopy, we observed signatures of molecular
   self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules in topological defects, including
   cooperativity, reversibility and controlled growth. We also show that
   nanoscopic o-rings synthesized from Saturn-ring disclinations and other
   molecular assemblies templated by defects can be preserved by using
   photocrosslinkable amphiphiles. Our results reveal that, in analogy to
   other classes of macromolecular templates such as polymer-surfactant
   complexes, topological defects in LCs are a versatile class of
   three-dimensional, dynamic and reconfigurable templates that can direct
   processes of molecular self-assembly.}},

   monomers and oligomers}},
Journal = {{PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{35-43}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Human cystatin C (cysC) is a soluble basic protein belonging to the
   cysteine protease inhibitor family. CysC is a potent inhibitor of
   cathepsins - proteolytic enzymes that degrade intracellular and
   endocytosed proteins, remodel extracellular matrix, and trigger
   apoptosis. Inhibition is via tight reversible binding involving the
   N-terminus as well as two beta-hairpin loops of cysC. As a significant
   component of cerebrospinal fluid, cysC has numerous other functions,
   including support of neural stem cell growth and differentiation.
   Several studies suggest that cysC may bind to the Alzheimer-related
   protein beta-amyloid (AB), and inhibit its aggregation and toxicity.
   Because of an increasing recognition of its important biological roles,
   there is considerable interest in methods to produce full-length
   recombinant human cysC. Several researchers have reported success, but
   with processes that require multiple purification steps. Here we report
   successful production of human cysC using an intein-based expression
   system and a simple one-column purification scheme. The recombinant
   protein so obtained was natively folded and active as an enzyme
   inhibitor. Unexpectedly, even mild concentration by ultrafiltration
   caused significant oligomerization. The oligomers are noncovalent and
   retain the native secondary structure and inhibitory activity of the
   monomer. The oligomers, but not the monomers, were highly effective at
   inhibiting aggregation of AB. These results demonstrate the critical
   importance of careful physicochemical characterization of recombinant
   cysC protein prior to evaluation of its biological functions. (C) 2015

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We investigate how and when to diversify capital over assets, i.e., the
   portfolio selection problem, from a signal processing perspective. To
   this end, we first construct portfolios that achieve the optimal
   expected growth in i.i.d. discrete-time two-asset markets under
   proportional transaction costs. We then extend our analysis to cover
   markets having more than two stocks. The market is modeled by a sequence
   of price relative vectors with arbitrary discrete distributions, which
   can also be used to approximate a wide class of continuous
   distributions. To achieve the optimal growth, we use threshold
   portfolios, where we introduce a recursive update to calculate the
   expected wealth. We then demonstrate that under the threshold
   rebalancing framework, the achievable set of portfolios elegantly form
   an irreducible Markov chain under mild technical conditions. We evaluate
   the corresponding stationary distribution of this Markov chain, which
   provides a natural and efficient method to calculate the cumulative
   expected wealth. Subsequently, the corresponding parameters are
   optimized yielding the growth optimal portfolio under proportional
   transaction costs in i.i.d. discrete-time two-asset markets. As a widely
   known financial problem, we also solve the optimal portfolio selection
   problem in discrete-time markets constructed by sampling continuous-time
   Brownian markets. For the case that the underlying discrete
   distributions of the price relative vectors are unknown, we provide a
   maximum likelihood estimator that is also incorporated in the
   optimization framework in our simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Effect of Roughness on Frictional Energy Dissipation in Presliding
   Contacts}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRIBOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A finite element model (FEM) is used to investigate the effect of
   roughness on the frictional energy dissipation for an elastic contact
   subjected to simultaneous normal and tangential oscillations. Frictional
   energy losses are correlated against the maximum tangential load as a
   power-law where the exponents show the degree of nonlinearity.
   Individual asperity is shown to undergo similar stick-slip cycles during
   a loading period. Taller asperities are found to contribute
   significantly to the total energy dissipation and dominate the trends in
   the total energy dissipation. The authors' observations for spherical
   contacts are extended to the rough surface contact, which shows that
   power-law exponent depends on stick durations individual asperity
   contacts experience. A theoretical model for energy dissipation is then
   validated with the FEM, for both spherical and rough surface contacts.
   The model is used to study the influence of roughness parameters
   (asperity density, height distribution, and fractal dimension) on
   magnitude of energy dissipation and power-law exponents. Roughness
   parameters do not influence the powerlaw exponents. For a phase
   difference of pi/2 between normal and tangential oscillations, the
   frictional energy dissipation shows quadratic dependence on the
   tangential fluctuation amplitude, irrespective of the roughness
   parameters. The magnitude of energy dissipation is governed by the real
   area of contact and, hence, depends on the surface roughness parameters.
   Larger real area of contact results in more energy under similar loading

Abstract = {{A key challenge to the clinical implementation of decellularized
   scaffold-based tissue engineering lies in understanding the process of
   removing cells and immunogenic material from a donor tissue/organ while
   maintaining the biochemical and biophysical properties of the scaffold
   that will promote growth of newly seeded cells. Current criteria for
   evaluating whole organ decellularization are primarily based on nucleic
   acids, as they are easy to quantify and have been directly correlated to
   adverse host responses. However, numerous proteins cause immunogenic
   responses and thus should be measured directly to further understand and
   quantify the efficacy of decellularization. In addition, there has been
   increasing appreciation for the role of the various protein components
   of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in directing cell growth and
   regulating organ function. We performed in-depth proteomic analysis on
   four types of biological scaffolds and identified a large number of both
   remnant cellular and ECM proteins. Measurements of individual protein
   abundances during the decellularization process revealed significant
   removal of numerous cellular proteins, but preservation of most
   structural matrix proteins. The observation that decellularized
   scaffolds still contain many cellular proteins, although at decreased
   abundance, indicates that elimination of DNA does not assure adequate
   removal of all cellular material. Thus, proteomic analysis provides
   crucial characterization of the decellularization process to create
   biological scaffolds for future tissue/organ replacement therapies. (C)

Abstract = {{Plant derived cellulose nano-fibers (CNF) are a material with remarkable
   mechanical properties compared to other natural fibers. However, efforts
   to produce nano-composites on a large scale using CNF have yet to be
   investigated. In this study, scalable CNF nano-composites were made from
   isotropically porous CNF preforms using a freeze drying process. An
   improvised Liquid Composite Molding (LCM) process was used to make the
   nano-composites using a high bio-content `green' epoxy resin. Formation
   of the freeze dried CNF preforms' porous network highly affects the
   mechanical properties of the composite, therefore mechanical testing was
   performed to characterize the effects of pore structure on global
   mechanical properties. The level of cure was investigated by comparing
   DSC results and the effect of curing on the composites was studied by
   tensile and dynamic mechanical analysis tests. The efficacy of
   silylation on the CNF preforms was analyzed with Water Contact Angle
   (WCA) measurements where the treatment led to hydrophobicity and hence
   better wettability by the non-polar resin. The causes of the failure in
   the composites were investigated using SEM analysis of the fractured
   surfaces. In general, silylation improved the infusion of resin into CNF
   preforms and resulted in better mechanical properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Passive microwave sensors have better capability of penetrating forest
   layers to obtain more information from forest canopy and ground surface.
   For forest management, it is useful to study passive microwave signals
   from forests. Passive microwave sensors can detect signals from
   needleleaf, broadleaf, and mixed forests. The observed brightness
   temperature of a mixed forest can be approximated by a linear
   combination of the needleleaf and broadleaf brightness temperatures
   weighted by their respective abundances. For a mixed forest observed by
   an N-band microwave radiometer with horizontal and vertical
   polarizations, there are 2 N observed brightness temperatures. It is
   desirable to infer 4 N + 2 unknowns: 2 N broadleaf brightness
   temperatures, 2 N needleleaf brightness temperatures, 1 broadleaf
   abundance, and 1 needleleaf abundance. This is a challenging
   underdetermined problem. In this paper, we devise a novel method that
   combines microwave unmixing with video segmentation for inferring
   broadleaf and needleleaf brightness temperatures and abundances from
   mixed forests. We propose an improved Otsu method for video segmentation
   to infer broadleaf and needleleaf abundances. The brightness
   temperatures of needleleaf and broadleaf trees can then be solved by the
   nonnegative least squares solution. For our mixed forest unmixing
   problem, it turns out that the ordinary least squares solution yields
   the desired positive brightness temperatures. The experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed method is able to unmix broadleaf and
   needleleaf brightness temperatures and abundances well. The absolute
   differences between the reconstructed and observed brightness
   temperatures of the mixed forest are well within 1 K.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the possibilities of making valuable products

   arabinoxylan-protein gum (APG) was extracted from distillers' grains

   with succinic anhydride. The effects of pH and degree of substitution
   (DS) on the emulsifying properties of succinylated APG, referred to as
   SAPG, were investigated. Emulsion particle size and stability of APG and
   gum arabic were comparable at pH 3.5-6.5. Succinylation could enhance
   the emulsifying properties of APG. Compared to gum arabic, at pH < 5,
   SAPG emulsions had larger particle size but comparable stability,
   whereas at pH > 5, SAPG had much smaller particle size and better
   stability than gum arabic. The results suggested that SAPG, compared to
   gum arabic, could be a comparable emulsifier at low pH values and a
   better emulsifier at neutral pH values. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{The goal of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) systems is to provide rapid
   response to emergency calls in order to save lives. This paper proposes
   a relocation strategy to improve the performance of EMS systems. In
   practice, EMS systems often use a compliance table to relocate
   ambulances. A compliance table specifies ambulance base stations as a
   function of the state of the system. We consider a nested-compliance
   table, which restricts the number of relocations that can occur
   simultaneously. We formulate the nested-compliance table model as an
   integer programming model in order to maximize expected coverage. We
   determine an optimal nested-compliance table policy using steady state
   probabilities of a Markov chain model with relocation as input
   parameters. These parameter approximations are independent of the exact
   compliance table used. We assume that there is a single type of medical
   unit, single call priority, and no patient queue. We validate the model
   by applying the nested-compliance table policies in a simulated system
   using real-world data. The numerical results show the benefit of our
   model over a static policy based on the adjusted maximum expected
   covering location problem (AMEXCLP). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A statistical atlas based approach to automated subject-specific FE

Journal = {{COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{67-77}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Subject-specific modeling is increasingly important in biomechanics
   simulation. However, how to automatically create high-quality finite
   element (FE) mesh and how to automatically impose boundary condition are
   challenging.
   This paper presents a statistical atlas based approach for automatic
   meshing of subject-specific shapes. In our approach, shape variations
   among a shape population are explicitly modeled and the correspondence
   between a given subject-specific shape and the statistical atlas is
   sought within the ``legal{''} shape variations. This approach involves
   three parts: (1) constructing a statistical atlas from a shape
   population, including the statistical shape model and the FE model of
   the mean shape; (2) establishing the correspondence between a given
   subject shape and the atlas; and (3) deforming the atlas to the subject
   shape based on the shape correspondence. Numerical results on 2D hands,
   3D femur bones and 3D aorta demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Slips, trips, and falls are a leading cause of injury to firefighters
   with many injuries occurring while traversing stairs, possibly
   exaggerated by acute fatigue from firefighting activities and/or
   asymmetric load carriage. This study examined the effects that fatigue,
   induced by simulated firefighting activities, and hose load carriage
   have on foot clearance while traversing stairs. Landing and passing foot
   clearances for each stair during ascent and descent of a short staircase
   were investigated. Clearances decreased significantly (p < 0.05)
   post-exercise for nine of 12 ascent parameters and increased for two of
   eight descent parameters. Load carriage resulted in significantly
   decreased (p < 0.05) clearance over three ascent parameters, and one
   increase during descent. Decreased clearances during ascent caused by
   fatigue or load carriage may result in an increased trip risk. Increased
   clearances during descent may suggest use of a compensation strategy to
   ensure stair clearance or an increased risk of over-stepping during
   descent. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society. All rights

Abstract = {{It is widely acknowledged that gallium nitride (GaN)-based power
   switching devices are superior to conventional silicon (Si) devices in
   terms of lower semiconductor loss and faster switching speed. However,
   the deadtime related losses in GaN HEMT-based converters can be
   detrimental if not optimized, especially when operating at very high
   switching frequencies. This paper proposes an original analytical model
   for deadtime optimization for the GaN converters. The proposed model is
   more accurate than conventional deadtime optimization methods used in Si
   converters. A GaN-based synchronous boost converter is used as a case
   study. Circuit simulation and experimental tests are successfully
   performed to verify the analysis and proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{CH4 adsorption was studied experimentally and theoretically on ZSM-5,
   MOR, and ZSM-12 zeolites using calorimetric measurements at 195 K and
   plane wave DFT calculations. Differential heats measured on four
   different H-ZSM-5 samples were determined to be 22.5 + 1 kJ/mol,
   independent of Bronsted site density or defect concentration. However,
   DFT calculations performed using various functionals and on the most
   stable Br-misted site indicated that CH4 should bind to this site by an
   additional 1-7 kJ/mol, a discrepancy that is due to the inability of
   standard DFT methods to capture hydrogen-bonding effects accurately with
   CH4. Differential heats for CH4 in MOR were 30 + 1 kJ/mol at low
   coverages, falling to 25 kJ/mol for coverages above one molecule per
   8-membered-ring side pocket, while differential heats on ZSM-12 were
   initially 22.5 kJ/mol, decreasing to 21 kJ/mol with coverage. DFT
   calculations on the siliceous form of the zeolites were able to predict
   these values within.5 kJ/mol in most cases. The results indicate that
   CH4 is an excellent probe molecule for characterizing the pore structure
   of zeolites.}},

Abstract = {{In this work a microchannel array device was used to implement passive
   pumping through the channels to enhance cell-free protein synthesis
   yield by delivering nutrients to the protein synthesis reactions. The
   setup enhanced the sensitivity of ricin detection where the
   implementation of the device caused the positive control with no ricin
   to be 33 times greater than samples with ricin in contrast to
   implementing the reaction in a microcentrifuge tube where the positive
   control had only twice the amount of protein with ricin present.
   Furthermore, the use of the device helped reduce the reagent consumption
   and the cost by a factor of eight and the assay time by a factor of 7
   while allowing for high-throughput studies by enabling running 192
   parallel experiments. Finally, the setup was used to test the presence
   of ricin in beverages where the limit of detection ranged from 2 pM for
   orange juice and 170 pM for diet soda, an interesting observation
   highlighted the importance of testing the effect of the beverage on the
   luminescence signal which could be a direct effect on the enzymatic
   reaction or an indirect one by affecting the protein synthesis reaction
   itself. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The persistence of bacterial biofilms in chronic wounds delays wound
   healing. Although Ga3+ can inhibit or kill biofilms, precipitation as
   Ga(OH)(3) has prevented its use as a topical wound treatment. The design
   of a microfilm construct comprising a polyelectrolyte film that releases
   noncytotoxic concentrations of Ga3+ over 20 d and a dissolvable
   micrometer-thick film of polyvinylalcohol that enables facile transfer
   onto biomedically important surfaces is reported. By using infrared
   spectroscopy, it is shown that the density of free
   carboxylate/carboxylic acid and amine groups within the polyelectrolyte
   film regulates the capacity of the construct to be loaded with Ga3+ and
   that the density of covalent cross-links introduced into the
   polyelectrolyte film (amide-bonds) controls the release rate of Ga3+.
   Following transfer onto the wound-contact surface of a biologic wound
   dressing, an optimized construct is demonstrated to release approximate
   to 0.7 mu g cm(-2) d(-1) of Ga3+ over 3 weeks, thus continuously
   replacing Ga3+ lost to precipitation. The optimized construct inhibits
   formation of P. aeruginosa (two strains; ATCC 27853 and PA01) biofilms
   for up to 4 d and causes pre-existing biofilms to disperse. Overall,
   this study provides designs of polymeric constructs that permit facile
   modification of the wound-contacting surfaces of dressings and
   biomaterials to manage biofilms.}},

Abstract = {{With an integrated luminosity of 2.47 fb(-1) recorded by the ATLAS
   experiment at the LHC, the exclusive decays B-s(0) -> J/psi phi and
   B-d(0) -> J/psi K{*}(0) of B mesons produced in pp collisions at root s
   = 7 TeV are used to determine the ratio of fragmentation fractions
   f(s)/f(d). From the observed B-s(0) -> J/psi phi and B-d(0) -> J/psi
   K{*}(0) yields, the quantity (f(s)/f(d)){[}B(B-s(0) -> J/psi
   phi)/B(B-d(0) -> J/psi K{*}(0) )] is measured to be 0.199 +/-
   0.004(stat) +/- 0.008(syst). Using a recent theory prediction for
   {[}B(B-s(0) -> J/psi phi)/B(B-d(0) -> J/psi K{*}(0))] yields (f(s)/f(d))
   = 0.240 +/- 0.004(stat) +/- 0.010(syst) +/- 0.017(th). This result is
   based on a new approach that provides a significant improvement of the
   world average.}},

Abstract = {{The equilibrium binding affinity of receptor-ligand or antibody-antigen
   pairs may be modulated by protonation of histidine side-chains, and such
   pH-dependent mechanisms play important roles in biological systems,
   affecting molecular uptake and trafficking. Here, we aimed to manipulate
   cellular transport of single-chain antibodies (scFvs) against the
   transferrin receptor (TfR) by engineering pH-dependent antigen binding.
   An anti-TfR scFv was subjected to histidine saturation mutagenesis of a
   single CDR. By employing yeast surface display with a pH-dependent
   screening pressure, scFvs having markedly increased dissociation from
   TfR at pH 5.5 were identified. The pH-sensitivity generally resulted
   from a central cluster of histidine residues in CDRH1. When soluble,
   pH-sensitive, scFv clone M16 was dosed onto live cells, the internalized
   fraction was 2.6-fold greater than scFvs that lacked pH-sensitive
   binding and the increase was dependent on endosomal acidification.
   Differences in the intracellular distribution of M16 were also observed
   consistent with an intracellular decoupling of the scFv M16-TfR complex.
   Engineered pH-sensitive TfR binding could prove important for increasing
   the effectiveness of TfR-targeted antibodies seeking to exploit
   endocytosis or transcytosis for drug delivery purposes.}},

Abstract = {{In this first worldwide synthesis of in situ and satellite-derived lake
   data, we find that lake summer surface water temperatures rose rapidly
   (global mean=0.34 degrees C decade(-1)) between 1985 and 2009. Our
   analyses show that surface water warming rates are dependent on
   combinations of climate and local characteristics, rather than just lake
   location, leading to the counterintuitive result that regional
   consistency in lake warming is the exception, rather than the rule. The
   most rapidly warming lakes are widely geographically distributed, and
   their warming is associated with interactions among different climatic
   factorsfrom seasonally ice-covered lakes in areas where temperature and
   solar radiation are increasing while cloud cover is diminishing (0.72
   degrees C decade(-1)) to ice-free lakes experiencing increases in air
   temperature and solar radiation (0.53 degrees C decade(-1)). The
   pervasive and rapid warming observed here signals the urgent need to
   incorporate climate impacts into vulnerability assessments and
   adaptation efforts for lakes.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of a Stratospheric-Tropospheric Exchange (STE) event from
   4 to 8 August 2014 at Fort Collins, Colorado, is described. The event is
   characterized with observations from the Goddard Space Flight Center
   TROPospheric OZone (TROPOZ) Differential Absorption Lidar, the
   University of Wisconsin High Spectral Resolution Lidar, and multiple
   ozonesondes during NASA's Deriving Information on Surface Conditions
   from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality
   and the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE)
   campaigns. Based on the extended TROPOZ observations throughout the
   entire campaign, it was found that STE events have largely contributed
   to an additional 10-30 ppbv of ozone at Fort Collins. Additional
   measurements of ozone and relative humidity from the Atmospheric
   Infrared Sounder are characterize the transport of the intrusion. The
   Real-time Air Quality Modeling System simulated ozone agrees well with
   the TROPOZ ozone concentrations and altitude during the STE event. To
   extend the analysis into other seasons and years, the modeled ozone to
   potential vorticity ratio is used as a tracer for stratospheric air
   residing below the tropopause. It is found that at Fort Collins, CO, and
   depending on season from 2012 to 2014, between 18 and 31\% of
   tropospheric ozone corresponds to stratospheric air. A relationship to
   determine the lifetime of stratospheric air below the tropopause is
   derived using the simulated ratio tracer. Results indicate that
   throughout summer 2014, 43\% of stratospheric air resided below the
   tropopause for less than 12 h. However, nearly 39\% persisted below the
   tropopause for 12-48 h and likely penetrated deeper in the troposphere.}},

Title = {{Evidence for an increase in the ozone photochemical lifetime in the

Abstract = {{Measures to control surface ozone rely on quantifying production
   attributable to local versus regional (upwind) emissions. Here we
   simulate the relative contribution of local (i.e., within a particular
   state) and regional sources of surface ozone in the eastern United
   States (66-94 degrees W longitude) for July 2002, 2011, and 2018 using
   the Comprehensive Air-quality Model with Extensions (CAMx). To determine
   how emissions and chemistry within the domain affect the production,
   loss, lifetime, and transport of trace gases, we initialize our model
   with identical boundary conditions in each simulation. We find that the
   photochemical lifetime of ozone has increased as emissions have
   decreased. The contribution of ozone from outside the domain (boundary
   condition ozone, BCO3) to local surface mixing ratios increases in an
   absolute sense by 1-2 ppbv between 2002 and 2018 due to the longer
   lifetime of ozone. The photochemical lifetime of ozone lengthens because
   the two primary gas phase sinks for odd oxygen (O-x approximate to NO2 +
   O-3)-attack by hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2) on ozone and formation of
   nitrate-weaken with decreasing pollutant emissions. The relative role of
   BCO3 will also increase. For example, BCO3 represents 34.5\%, 38.8\%,
   and 43.6\% of surface ozone in the Baltimore, MD, region during July
   2002, 2011, and 2018 means, respectively. This unintended consequence of
   air quality regulation impacts attainment of the National Ambient Air
   Quality Standard for surface ozone because the spatial and temporal
   scales of photochemical smog increase; the influence of pollutants
   transported between states and into the eastern U.S. will likely play a
   greater role in the future.}},

Title = {{Age-Related Changes in Inter-Network Connectivity by Component Analysis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{Healthy aging is associated with brain changes that reflect an
   alteration to a functional unit in response to the available resources
   and architecture. Even before the onset of noticeable cognitive decline,
   the neural scaffolds underlying cognitive function undergo considerable
   change. Prior studies have suggested a disruption of the connectivity
   pattern within the ``default-mode{''} network (DMN), and more
   specifically a disruption of the anterio-posterior connectivity. In this
   study, we explored the effects of aging on within network connectivity
   of three DMN subnetworks: a posterior DMN (pDMN), an anterior DMN
   (aDMN), and a ventral DMN (vDMN); as well as between-network
   connectivity during resting-state. Using groupICA on 43 young and 43
   older healthy adults, we showed a reduction of network co-activation in
   two of the DMN subnetworks (pDMN and aDMN) and demonstrated a difference
   in between component connectivity levels. The older group exhibited more
   numerous high-correlation pairs (Pearson's rho > 0.3, Number of
   comp-pairs = 46) in comparison to the young group (Number of comp-pairs
   = 34), suggesting a more connected/less segregated cortical system.
   Moreover, three component pairs exhibited statistically significant
   differences between the two populations. Visual areas V2-V1 and V2-V4
   were more correlated in the older adults, while aDMN pDMN correlation
   decreased with aging. The increase in the number of high correlation
   component pairs and the elevated correlation in the visual areas are
   consistent with the prior hypothesis that aging is associated with a
   reduction of functional segregation. However, the aDMN-pDMN
   dis-connectivity may be occurring under a different mechanism, a
   mechanism more related to a breakdown of structural integrity along the
   anterio-posterior axis.}},

Abstract = {{Microsupercapacitors (MSCs) are promising energy storage devices to
   power miniaturized portable electronics and microelectromechanical
   systems. With the increasing attention on all-solid-state flexible
   supercapacitors, new strategies for high-performance flexible MSCs are
   highly desired. Here, we demonstrate all-solid-state, flexible
   micropseudocapacitors via direct laser patterning on crack-free,
   flexible WO3/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/multiwalled carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNTs) composites containing high levels of porous hierarchically
   structured WO3 nanomaterials (up to 50 wt \%) and limited binder (PVDF,
   <25 wt \%). The work leads to an areal capacitance of 62.4 mF.cm(-2) and
   a volumetric capacitance of 10.4 F.cm(-3), exceeding that of graphene
   based flexible MSCs by a factor of 26 and 3, respectively. As a
   noncarbon based flexible MSC, hierarchically nanostructured WO3 in the
   narrow finger electrode is essential to such enhancement in energy
   density due to its pseudocapacitive property. The effects of
   WO3/PVDF/MWCNTs composite composition and the dimensions of interdigital
   structure on the performance of the flexible MSCs are investigated.}},

Abstract = {{A search is presented for pair production of a new heavy quark (Q) that
   decays into aW boson and a light quark (q) in the final state where one
   W boson decays leptonically (to an electron or muon plus a neutrino) and
   the other W boson decays hadronically. The analysis is performed using
   an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb(-1) of pp collisions at root s = 8
   TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. No evidence of Q (Q)
   over bar production is observed. New chiral quarks with masses below 690
   GeVare excluded at 95\% confidence level, assuming BR(Q -> Wq) = 1.
   Results are also interpreted in the context of vectorlike quark models,
   resulting in the limits on the mass of a vectorlike quark in the
   two-dimensional plane of BR(Q -> Wq) versus BR(Q -> Hq).}},

Title = {{Braid Entropy of Two-Dimensional Turbulence}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{The evolving shape of material fluid lines in a flow underlies the
   quantitative prediction of the dissipation and material transport in
   many industrial and natural processes. However, collecting quantitative
   data on this dynamics remains an experimental challenge in particular in
   turbulent flows. Indeed the deformation of a fluid line, induced by its
   successive stretching and folding, can be difficult to determine because
   such description ultimately relies on often inaccessible multi-particle
   information. Here we report laboratory measurements in two-dimensional
   turbulence that offer an alternative topological viewpoint on this
   issue. This approach characterizes the dynamics of a braid of Lagrangian
   trajectories through a global measure of their entanglement. The
   topological length NE of material fluid lines can be derived from these
   braids. This length is found to grow exponentially with time, giving
   access to the braid topological entropy S-Braid. The entropy increases
   as the square root of the turbulent kinetic energy and is directly
   related to the single-particle dispersion coefficient. At long times,
   the probability distribution of N-E is positively skewed and shows
   strong exponential tails. Our results suggest that S-Braid may serve as
   a measure of the irreversibility of turbulence based on minimal
   principles and sparse Lagrangian data.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental-analytical substructuring is attractive when there is
   motivation to replace one or more system subcomponents with an
   experimental model. This experimentally derived substructure can then be
   coupled to finite element models of the rest of the structure to predict
   the system response. The transmission simulator method couples a fixture
   to the component of interest during a vibration test in order to improve
   the experimental model for the component. The transmission simulator is
   then subtracted from the tested system to produce the experimental
   component. The method reduces ill-conditioning by imposing a least
   squares fit of constraints between substructure modal coordinates to
   connect substructures, instead of directly connecting physical interface
   degrees of freedom. This paper presents an alternative means of deriving
   the experimental substructure model, in which a Craig-Bampton
   representation of the transmission simulator is created and subtracted
   from the experimental measurements. The corresponding modal basis of the
   transmission simulator is described by the fixed-interface modes, rather
   than free modes that were used in the original approach. These modes do
   a better job of representing the shape of the transmission simulator as
   it responds within the experimental system, leading to more accurate
   results using fewer modes. The new approach is demonstrated using a
   simple finite element model based example with a redundant interface.

Abstract = {{Tumor acute hypoxia has a dynamic component that is also, at least
   partially, coherent. Using blood oxygen level dependent magnetic
   resonance imaging, we observed coherent oscillations in hemoglobin
   saturation dynamics in cell line xenograft models of head and neck
   squamous cell carcinoma. We posit a well-established biochemical
   nonlinear oscillatory mechanism called the glycolytic oscillator as a
   potential cause of the coherent oscillations in tumors. These data
   suggest that metabolic changes within individual tumor cells may affect
   the local tumor microenvironment including oxygen availability and
   therefore radiosensitivity. These individual cells can synchronize the
   oscillations in patches of similar intermediate glucose levels. These
   alterations have potentially important implications for radiation
   therapy and are a potential target for optimizing the cancer response to
   radiation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE}},

Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Short cellulose nanofibrils (SCNF) were investigated as a new kind of
   reinforcement for polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) films. SCNF were mechanically
   isolated from hardwood pulp after enzymatic pretreatment. Various
   concentrations of SCNF were added to an aqueous PVA solution, which were
   cast into composite films and then hot drawn with various draw ratios at
   200 degrees C. SCNF were effective in improving PVA film tensile
   properties (i.e., ultimate strength and elastic modulus), which depended
   on SCNF loading, PVA crystal orientation, and the draw ratio. For
   example, the ultimate strength and modulus of a composite film with a
   SCNF weight ratio of 3\% and a draw ratio of 7.5 were nearly 46 and 61\%
   higher than that of the neat PVA. The PVA crystal orientation increased
   when small amounts of SCNF were added but decreased as the SCNF content
   increased above about 6\%, likely due to SCNF percolation resulting in
   network formation that inhibited alignment. Stress-induced
   crystallization during hot drawing increased the crystallinity of PVA in
   both the PVA and its composites. Cryogenic and tensile-fractured SEM
   images of PVA/SCNF composite films showed a uniform SCNF dispersion in
   the PVA matrix. Young's moduli of drawn composite films were predicted
   surprisingly well by the rule of mixtures except at intermediate levels
   of SCNF where the increased orientation of the matrix was not considered
   in the model. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the role of intrinsic chain susceptibility anisotropy in
   magnetic field directed self-assembly of a block copolymer using in situ
   x-ray scattering. Alignment of a lamellar mesophase is observed on
   cooling across the disorder-order transition with the resulting
   orientational order inversely proportional to the cooling rate. We
   discuss the origin of the susceptibility anisotropy,Delta chi, that
   drives alignment and calculate its magnitude using coarse-grained
   molecular dynamics to sample conformations of surface-tethered chains,
   finding Delta chi approximate to 2 x 10(-8). From field-dependent
   scattering data, we estimate that grains of approximate to 1.2 mu m are
   present during alignment. These results demonstrate that intrinsic
   anisotropy is sufficient to support strong field-induced mesophase
   alignment and suggest a versatile strategy for field control of
   orientational order in block copolymers.}},

Abstract = {{An observation of the Lambda(0)(b) -> Psi (2S) Lambda(0) decay and a
   comparison of its branching fraction with that of the Lambda(0)(b) ->
   Psi (2S) Lambda(0) decay has been made with the ATLAS detector in
   proton-proton collisions at root s = 8 TeVat the LHC using an integrated
   luminosity of 20.6fb(-1). The J/Psi and Psi(2S) mesons are reconstructed
   in their decays to a muon pair, while the Lambda(0) -> p pi(-) decay is
   exploited for the Lambda(0) 0baryon reconstruction. The Lambda(0)(b)
   baryons are reconstructed with transverse momentum p(T)> 10 GeVand
   pseudorapidity vertical bar eta vertical bar < 2.1. The measured
   branching ratio of the Lambda(0)(b) -> Psi (2S) Lambda(0) and
   Lambda(0)(b) -> Psi (2S) Lambda(0) decays is Gamma(Lambda(0)(b) -> Psi
   (2S) Lambda(0)) / Gamma(Lambda(0)(b) -> Psi (2S) Lambda(0)) = 0.501 +/-
   0.033(stat) +/- 0.019(syst), lower than the expectation from the
   covariant quark model. (C) 2015 CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS

Abstract = {{The pseudorapidity distribution of charged hadrons in pp collisions at
   root s = 13 TeV is measured using a data sample obtained with the CMS
   detector, operated at zero magnetic field, at the CERN LHC. The yield of
   primary charged long-lived hadrons produced in inelastic pp collisions
   is determined in the central region of the CMS pixel detector (vertical
   bar eta vertical bar < 2) using both hit pairs and reconstructed tracks.
   For central pseudorapidities (vertical bar eta vertical bar < 0.5), the
   charged-hadron multiplicity density is dN(ch)/d eta vertical
   bar(vertical bar eta vertical bar) < 0.5= 5.49 +/- 0.01 (stat) +/- 0.17
   (syst), a value obtained by combining the two methods. The result is
   compared to predictions from Monte Carlo event generators and to similar
   measurements made at lower collision energies. (C) 2015 CERN for the

Abstract = {{This Letter presents measurements of correlated production of nearby
   jets in Pb+Pb collisions at root s(NN) = 2.76 TeV using the ATLAS
   detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The measurement was performed
   using 0.14 nb(-1)of data recorded in 2011. The production of correlated
   jet pairs was quantified using the rate, R-Delta R, of
   ``neighbouring{''} jets that accompany ``test{''} jets within a given
   range of angular distance, Delta R, in the pseudorapidity-azimuthal
   angle plane. The jets were measured in the ATLAS calorimeter and were
   reconstructed using the anti-ktalgorithm with radius parameters d = 0.2,
   0.3, and 0.4. R-Delta R was measured in different Pb+Pbcollision
   centrality bins, characterized by the total transverse energy measured
   in the forward calorimeters. Acentrality dependence of R-Delta R is
   observed for all three jet radii with R-Delta R found to be lower in
   central collisions than in peripheral collisions. The ratios formed by
   the R-Delta R values in different centrality bins and the values in the
   40-80\% centrality bin are presented. (C) 2015 CERN for the benefit of
   the ATLAS Collaboration. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Differential cross sections for the production of at least four jets
   have been measured in proton-proton collisions at root s = 8 TeV at the
   Large Hadron Collider using the ATLAS detector. Events are selected if
   the four anti-k(t) R = 0.4 jets with the largest transverse momentum
   (p(T)) within the rapidity range vertical bar y vertical bar < 2 : 8 are
   well separated (Delta R-4j(min) > 0.65), all have p(T) > 64 GeV, and
   include at least one jet with p(T) > 100 GeV. The dataset corresponds to
   an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb(-1). The cross sections, corrected
   for detector effects, are compared to leading-order and
   next-to-leading-order calculations as a function of the jet momenta,
   invariant masses, minimum and maximum opening angles and other kinematic
   variables.}},

Abstract = {{Flux-dependent inactivation that arises from functional coupling between
   the inner gate and the selectivity filter is widespread in ion channels.
   The structural basis of this coupling has only been well characterized
   in KcsA. Here we present NMR data demonstrating structural and dynamic
   coupling between the selectivity filter and intracellular constriction
   point in the bacterial nonselective cation channel, NaK. This
   transmembrane allosteric communication must be structurally different
   from KcsA because the NaK selectivity filter does not collapse under
   low-cation conditions. Comparison of NMR spectra of the nonselective NaK
   and potassium-selective NaK2K indicates that the number of ion binding
   sites in the selectivity filter shifts the equilibrium distribution of
   structural states throughout the channel. This finding was unexpected
   given the nearly identical crystal structure of NaK and NaK2K outside
   the immediate vicinity of the selectivity filter. Our results highlight
   the tight structural and dynamic coupling between the selectivity filter
   and the channel scaffold, which has significant implications for channel
   function. NaK offers a distinct model to study the physiologically
   essential connection between ion conduction and channel gating.}},

Title = {{Atmospheric impacts of black carbon emission reductions through the
   strategic use of biodiesel in California}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{538}},
Pages = {{412-422}},

Abstract = {{The use of biodiesel as a replacement for petroleum-based diesel fuel
   has gained interest as a strategy for greenhouse gas emission
   reductions, energy security, and economic advantage. Biodiesel adoption
   may also reduce particulate elemental carbon (EC) emissions from
   conventional diesel engines that are not equipped with after-treatment
   devices. This study examines the impact of biodiesel blends on EC
   emissions from a commercial off-road diesel engine and simulates the
   potential public health benefits and climate benefits.
   EC emissions from the commercial off-road engine decreased by 76\% when
   ultra-low sulfur commercial diesel (ULSD) fuel was replaced by
   biodiesel. Model calculations predict that reduced EC emissions
   translate directly into reduced EC concentrations in the atmosphere, but
   the concentration of secondary particulate matter was not directly
   affected by this fuel change. Redistribution of secondary particulate
   matter components to particles emitted from other sources did change the
   size distribution and therefore deposition rates of those components.
   Modification of meteorological variables such as water content and
   temperature influenced secondary particulate matter formation.
   Simulations with a source-oriented WRF/Chem model (SOWC) for a severe
   air pollution episode in California that adopted 75\% biodiesel blended
   with ULSD in all non-road diesel engines reduced surface EC
   concentrations by up to 50\% but changed nitrate and total PM2.5 mass
   concentrations by less than +/- 5\%. These changes in concentrations
   will have public health benefits but did not significantly affect
   radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere. The removal of EC due to
   the adoption of biodiesel produced larger coatings of secondary
   particulate matter on other atmospheric particles containing residual EC
   leading to enhanced absorption associated with those particles. The net
   effect was a minor change in atmospheric optical properties despite a
   large change in atmospheric EC concentrations. These results emphasize
   the importance of considering EC mixing state in climate research. (C)

Abstract = {{The energetic and transport properties of a double-stranded DNA
   dodecamer encapsulated in hydrophobic carbon nanotubes are probed
   employing two limiting nanotube diameters, D=4 nm and D=3 nm,
   corresponding to (51,0) and (40,0) zig-zag topologies, respectively. It
   is observed that the thermodynamically spontaneous encapsulation in the
   4 nm nanopore (Delta G approximate to -40 kJ/mol) is annihilated when
   the solid diameter narrows down to 3 nm, and that the confined DNA
   termini directly contact the hydrophobic walls with no solvent slab
   in-between. During the initial moments after confinement (t <= 2-3 ns),
   the biomolecule translocates along the nanopore's inner volume according
   to Fick's law (similar to t) with a self-diffusion coefficient D=1.713 x
   10(-9) m(2)/s, after which molecular diffusion assumes a single-file
   type mechanism (similar to t(1/2)). As expected, diffusion is
   anisotropic, with the pore main axis as the preferred direction, but an
   in-depth analysis shows that the instantaneous velocity probabilities
   are essentially identical along the x, y and z directions. The 3D
   velocity histogram shows a maximum probability located at < v > = 30.8
   m/s, twice the observed velocity for a single-stranded three nucleotide
   DNA encapsulated in comparable armchair geometries (< v > = 16.7 m/s,
   D=1.36-1.89 nm). Because precise physiological conditions (310 K and
   {[}NaCl] = 134 mM) are employed throughout, the present study
   establishes a landmark for the development of next generation in vivo
   drug delivery technologies based on carbon nanotubes as encapsulation
   agents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Contact resistance to the metallic oxide electrodes, SrRuO3 (SRO) and
   La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO), is an important parameter that affects the
   ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) device performance. We have
   systematically studied the contact resistance between metallic oxide
   electrodes (SRO, LSMO) and contact metal overlayers (Ti, Pt) after
   exposure to various processing environments. Specific contact
   resistivity (rho(c)) for Ti and Pt contact metals and the sheet
   resistance (R-sh) of the metallic oxides are measured after exposure to
   different reactive ion plasma process steps. Sheet resistance
   degradation was observed for both SRO and LSMO films after exposure to
   plasma treatment. Severe contact resistance degradation was observed for
   Ti contacts as compared to Pt after reactive ion etching on LSMO films.
   The effect of oxygen (O-2) plasma on LSMO was observed to be most severe
   with non-ohmic behavior with Ti contacts, which can affect the
   functionality of FTJ devices. Finally, the thermal stability of contacts
   was investigated, Pt contacts to SRO show low resistance ohmic behavior
   even after annealing at 900 degrees C, making it a suitable contact for
   FTJ devices. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Non-invasive measurement using cardiovascular magnetic resonance of
   changes in pulmonary artery stiffness with exercise}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Exercise stress tests are commonly used in clinical settings
   to monitor the functional state of the heart and vasculature. Large
   artery stiffness is one measure of arterial function that can be
   quantified noninvasively during exercise stress. Changes in proximal
   pulmonary artery stiffness are especially relevant to the progression of
   pulmonary hypertension (PH), since pulmonary artery (PA) stiffness is
   the best current predictor of mortality from right ventricular failure.
   Methods: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) was used to investigate
   the effect of exercise stress on PA pulse wave velocity (PWV) and
   relative area change (RAC), which are both non-invasive measures of PA
   stiffness, in healthy subjects. All 21 subjects (average age 26 +/- 4
   years; 13 female and 8 male) used a custom-made MR-compatible stepping
   device to exercise (two stages of mild-to-moderate exercise of 3-4 min
   duration each) in a supine position within the confines of the scanner.
   To measure the cross-sectional area and blood flow velocity in the main
   PA (MPA), two-dimensional phase-contrast (2D-PC) CMR images were
   acquired. To measure the reproducibility of metrics, CMR images were
   analyzed by two independent observers. Inter-observer agreements were
   calculated using the intraclass correlation and Bland-Altman analysis.
   Results: From rest to the highest level of exercise, cardiac output
   increased from 5.9 +/- 1.4 L/min to 8.2 +/- 1.9 L/min (p < 0.05), MPA
   PWV increased from 1.6 +/- 0.5 m/s to 3.6 +/- 1.4 m/s (p < 0.05), and
   MPA RAC decreased from 0.34 +/- 0.11 to 0.24 +/- 0.1 (p < 0.05). While
   PWV also increased from the first to second exercise stage (from 2.7 +/-
   1.0 m/s to 3.6 +/- 1.4 m/s, p < 0.05), there was no significant change
   in RAC between the two exercise stages. We found good inter-observer
   agreement for quantification of MPA flow, RAC and PWV.
   Conclusion: These results demonstrate that metrics of MPA stiffness
   increase in response to acute moderate exercise in healthy subjects and
   that CMR exercise stress offers great potential in clinical practice to
   noninvasively assess vascular function.}},

Abstract = {{We report metallic cobalt pyrite (CoS2) nanowires (NWs) prepared
   directly on current collecting electrodes, e.g., carbon cloth or
   graphite disc, for high-performance supercapacitors. These CoS2 NWs have
   a variety of advantages for supercapacitor applications. Because the
   metallic CoS2 NWs are synthesized directly on the current collector, the
   good electrical connection enables efficient charge transfer between the
   active CoS2 materials and the current collector. In addition, the open
   spaces between the sea urchin structure NWs lead to a large accessible
   surface area and afford rapid mass transport. Moreover, the robust CoS2
   NW structure results in high stability of the active materials during
   long-term operation. Electrochemical characterization reveals that the
   CoS2 NWs enable large specific capacitance (828.2 F g(-1) at a scan rate
   of 0.01 V s(-1)) and excellent long term cycling stability (0-2.5\%
   capacity loss after 4250 cycles at 5 A g(-1)) for pseudocapacitors. This
   example of metallic CoS2 NWs for supercapacitor applications expands the
   opportunities for transition metal sulfide-based nanostructures in
   emerging energy storage applications.}},

   the Higgs boson decays to b (b) over bar, is presented. The analysis
   searches for top quark pair events in which one top quark decays to W b,
   with the W boson decaying leptonically, and the other top quark decays
   to Hq. The search is based on pp collisions at root s = 8TeV recorded in
   2012 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider and uses
   an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb(-1). Data are analysed in the
   lepton-plus-jets final state, characterised by an isolated electron or
   muon and at least four jets. The search exploits the high multiplicity
   of b quark jets characteristic of signal events, and employs a
   likelihood discriminant that uses the kinematic differences between the
   signal and the background, which is dominated by t (t) over bar -> WbWb
   decays. No significant excess of events above the background expectation
   is found, and observed (expected) 95\% CL upper limits of 0.56\%
   (0.42\%) and 0.61\% (0.64\%) are derived for the t -> Hc and t -> Hu
   branching ratios respectively. The combination of this search with other
   ATLAS searches in the H -> gamma gamma and H -> WW{*}, tau tau decay
   modes significantly improves the sensitivity, yielding observed
   (expected) 95\% CL upper limits on the t -> Hc and t -> Hu branching
   ratios of 0.46\% (0.25\%) and 0.45\% (0.29\%) respectively. The
   corresponding combined observed (expected) upper limits on the vertical
   bar lambda(tcH)vertical bar and vertical bar lambda(tuH)vertical bar
   couplings are 0.13 (0.10) and 0.13 (0.10) respectively. These are the
   most restrictive direct bounds on t q H interactions measured so far.}},

Title = {{Search for high-mass diboson resonances with boson-tagged jets in

Abstract = {{A search is performed for narrow resonances decaying into WW, WZ, or ZZ
   boson pairs using 20.3 fb(-1) of proton-proton collision data at a
   centre-of-mass energy of root s = TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector
   at the Large Hadron Collider. Diboson resonances with masses in the
   range from 1.3 to 3.0 TeV are sought after using the invariant mass
   distribution of dijets where both jets are tagged as a boson jet,
   compatible with a highly boosted W or Z boson decaying to quarks, using
   jet mass and substructure properties. The largest deviation from a
   smoothly falling background in the observed dijet invariant mass
   distribution occurs around 2 TeV in the WZ channel, with a global
   significance of 2.5 standard deviations. Exclusion limits at the 95\%
   confidence level are set on the production cross section times branching
   ratio for the WZ final state of a new heavy gauge boson, W', and for the
   WW and ZZ final states of Kaluza-Klein excitations of the graviton in a
   bulk Randall-Sundrum model, as a function of the resonance mass. W'
   bosons with couplings predicted by the extended gauge model in the mass
   range from 1.3 to 1.5 TeV are excluded at 95\% confidence level.}},

Abstract = {{Microscale droplets of thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs) suspended in
   aqueous media (e.g., LC-in-water emulsions) respond sensitively to the
   presence of contaminating amphiphiles and, thus, provide promising
   platforms for the development of new classes of droplet-based
   environmental sensors. Here, we report polymer-based approaches to the
   immobilization of LC droplets on surfaces; these approaches introduce
   several new properties and droplet behaviors and thus also expand the
   potential utility of LC droplet-based sensors. Our approach exploits the
   properties of microscale droplets of LCs contained within polymer-based
   microcapsule cages (so-called ``caged{''} LCs). We demonstrate that
   caged LCs functionalized with primary amine groups can be immobilized on
   model surfaces through both weak/reversible ionic interactions and
   stronger reactive/covalent interactions. We demonstrate using polarized
   light microscopy that caged LCs that are covalently immobilized on
   surfaces can undergo rapid and diagnostic changes in shape, rotational
   mobility, and optical appearance upon the addition of amphiphiles to
   surrounding aqueous media, including many useful changes in these
   features that cannot be attained using freely suspended or
   surface-adsorbed LC droplets. Our results reveal these
   amphiphile-triggered orientational transitions to be reversible and that
   arrays of immobilized caged LCs can be used (and reused) to detect both
   increases and decreases in the concentrations of model contaminants.
   Finally, we report changes in the shapes and optical appearances of LC

Abstract = {{The band alignment between copper interconnects and their low-k
   interlayer dielectrics is critical to understanding the fundamental
   mechanisms involved in electrical leakage in low-k/Cu interconnects. In
   this work, vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) photoemission spectroscopy is
   utilized to determine the potential of the Schottky barrier present at
   low-k a-SiOC:H/Cu interfaces. By examining the photoemission spectra
   before and after VUV exposure of a low-k a-SiOC:H (k = 3.3) thin film
   fabricated by plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition on a polished Cu
   substrate, it was found that photons with energies of 4.9 eV or greater
   can deplete accumulated charge in a-SiOC:H films, while VUV photons with
   energies of 4.7 eV or less, did not have this effect. These critical
   values were identified to relate the electric potential of the interface
   barrier between the a-SiOC:H and the Cu layers. Using this method, the
   Schottky barrier at the low-k a-SiOC:H (k = 3.3)/Cu interface was
   determined to be 4.8 +/- 0.1 eV. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{High-grade serous ovarian cancer cell lines exhibit heterogeneous
   responses to growth factor stimulation}},
Journal = {{CANCER CELL INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: The factors driving the onset and progression of ovarian
   cancer are not well understood. Recent reports have identified cell
   lines that are representative of the genomic pattern of high-grade
   serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), in which greater than 90 \% of tumors
   have a mutation in TP53. However, many of these representative cell
   lines have not been widely used so it is unclear if these cell lines
   capture the variability that is characteristic of the disease.
   Methods: We investigated six TP53-mutant HGSOC cell lines (Caov3, Caov4,
   OV90, OVCA432, OVCAR3, and OVCAR4) for migration, MMP2 expression,
   proliferation, and VEGF secretion, behaviors that play critical roles in
   tumor progression. In addition to comparing baseline variation between
   the cell lines, we determined how these behaviors changed in response to
   four growth factors implicated in ovarian cancer progression: HB-EGF,
   NRG1 beta, IGF1, and HGF.
   Results: Baseline levels of each behavior varied across the cell lines
   and this variation was comparable to that seen in tumors. All four
   growth factors impacted cell proliferation or VEGF secretion, and
   HB-EGF, NRG1 beta, and HGF impacted wound closure or MMP2 expression in
   at least two cell lines. Growth factor-induced responses demonstrated
   substantial heterogeneity, with cell lines sensitive to all four growth
   factors, a subset of the growth factors, or none of the growth factors,
   depending on the response of interest. Principal component analysis
   demonstrated that the data clustered together based on cell line rather
   than growth factor identity, suggesting that response is dependent on
   intrinsic qualities of the tumor cell rather than the growth factor.
   Conclusions: Significant variation was seen among the cell lines,
   consistent with the heterogeneity of HGSOC.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, two different rapid solidification techniques; vacuum
   plasma spraying and vacuum copper boat induction melting, were performed
   to synthesize Ti0.72Zr0.28Mn1.6V0.4 hydrogen storage alloy. The
   structure and electrochemical properties of the produced samples were
   comparatively investigated. The chemical and phase compositions of the
   samples were characterized by XRD and SEM analysis. The electrochemical
   hydrogen storage characteristics including the cyclic stability, the
   maximum discharge capacity, the high rate dischargeability, and the
   electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured. Results indicated
   that both samples consisted of a hexagonal C14 Laves phase matrix and a
   body centered cubic (BCC) structure of V-based solid solution phase. The
   electrochemical results showed that in the alloy prepared by induction
   melting, the maximum discharge capacity was higher, while the cyclic
   stability of the vacuum plasma sprayed sample was much better. These
   results were attributed to the quantity and distribution of the presence
   phases and the anti-corrosion performance of the alloys. Moreover, the
   results from the electrochemical kinetic experiments showed that the
   vacuum plasma sprayed sample had superior kinetic parameters, including
   the hydrogen diffusion rate and charge-transfer resistance, than that
   for the vacuum induction melted sample. Thus, vacuum plasma spraying
   could be an efficient production method for preparation of hydrogen
   storage alloys with improved properties which could be used for Ni-MH
   secondary batteries as negative electrodes. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Here, we demonstrate the flexibility of peptide-functionalized
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels for modeling tumor progression.
   The PEG hydrogels were formed using thiol-ene chemistry to incorporate a
   matrix metalloproteinase-degradable peptide crosslinker (KKCGGPQG down
   arrow IWGQGCKK) permissive to proteolytic remodeling and the adhesive
   CRGDS peptide ligand. Tumor cell function was investigated by culturing
   WM239A melanoma cells on PEG hydrogel surfaces or encapsulating cells
   within the hydrogels, and either as monocultures or indirect
   (non-contact) cocultures with primary human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs).
   WM239A cluster size and proliferation rate depended on the shear elastic
   modulus for cells cultured on PEG hydrogels, while growth was inhibited
   by coculture with hDFs regardless of hydrogel stiffness. Cluster size
   was also suppressed by hDFs for WM239A cells encapsulated in PEG
   hydrogels, which is consistent with cells seeded on top of hydrogels.
   Notably, encapsulated WM239A clusters and single cells adopted invasive
   phenotypes in the hDF coculture model, which included single cell and
   collective migration modes that resembled invasion from human melanoma
   patient-derived xenograft tumors encapsulated in equivalent PEG
   hydrogels. Our combined results demonstrate that peptide-functionalized
   PEG hydrogels provide a useful platform for investigating aspects of
   tumor progression in 2D and 3D microenvironments, including single cell
   migration, cluster growth and invasion.}},

Abstract = {{Hsung et al. have reported a series of torquoselective
   electrocyclizations of chiral 1-azahexa-1E,3Z,5E-trienes that yield
   functionalized dihydropyridines. To understand the origins of the
   torquoselectivities of these azaelectrocydizations, we modeled these
   electrocyclic ring closures using the M06-2X density functional. A new
   stereochemical model that rationalizes the observed 1,2 stereoinduction
   emerges from these computations. This model is an improvement and
   generalization of the ``insidealkoxy{''} model used to rationalize
   stereoselectivities of the 1,3-dipolar cydoaddition of chiral allyl
   ethers and emphasizes a stabilizing hyperconjugative effect, which we
   have termed a transition state gauche effect. This stereoelectronic
   effect controls the conformational preferences at the electrocyclization
   transition states, and only in one of the allowed disrotatory
   electrocyclization transition states is the ideal stereoelectronic
   arrangement achieved without the introduction of a steric clash.
   Computational experiments confirm the role of this effect as a

Abstract = {{Nose's pioneering 1984 work inspired a variety of time-reversible
   deterministic thermostats. Though several groups have developed
   successful doubly-thermostated models, single-thermostat models have
   failed to generate Gibbs' canonical distribution for the one-dimensional
   harmonic oscillator. A 2001 doubly-thermostated model, claimed to be
   ergodic, has a singly-thermostated version. Though neither of these
   models is ergodic this work has suggested a successful route toward
   singly-therrnostated ergodicity. We illustrate both ergodicity and its
   lack for these models using phase-space cross sections and Lyapunov
   instability as diagnostic tools. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Role of Organic Coatings in Regulating N2O5 Reactive Uptake to Sea Spray
   Aerosol}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{48}},
Pages = {{11683-11692}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Previous laboratory measurements and field observations have suggested
   that the reactive uptake of N2O5 to sea spray aerosol particles is a
   complex function of particle chemical composition and phase, where
   surface active organics can suppress the reactive uptake by up to a
   factor of 60. To date, there are no direct studies of the reactive
   uptake of N2O5 to nascent sea spray aerosol that permit assessment of
   the role that organic molecules present in sea spray aerosol (SSA) may
   play in suppressing or enhancing N2O5 uptake kinetics. In this study,
   SSA was generated from ambient seawater and artificial seawater matrices
   using a Marine Aerosol Reference Tank (MART), capable of producing
   nascent SSA representative of ambient conditions. The reactive uptake
   coefficient of N2O5 (gamma(N2O5)) on nascent SSA was determined using an
   entrained aerosol flow reactor coupled to a chemical ionization mass
   spectrometer for measurement of surface area dependent heterogeneous
   loss rates. Population averaged measurements of gamma(N2O5) for SSA
   generated from salt water sequentially doped with representative organic
   molecular mimics, or from ambient seawater, do not deviate statistically
   from that observed for sodium chloride (gamma(N2O5)(Nacl) = 0.01-0.03)
   for relative humidity (RH) ranging between 50 and 65\%. The results are
   consistent with measurements made under clean marine conditions at the
   Scripps Institution of Oceanography Pier and those conducted on nascent
   SSA generated in the marine aerosol reference tank. The results
   presented here suggest that organic films present on nascent SSA (at RH
   greater than 50\%) likely do not significantly limit N2O5 reactive
   uptake.}},

Abstract = {{A novel peroxidase-like artificial enzyme, named caseoperoxidase, was
   biomimetically designed using a nano artificial amino acid apo-protein
   hydrophobic pocket. This four-component nano artificial enzyme
   containing heme-imidazole--casein-SDS exhibited high activity growth and
   k(cat) performance toward the native horseradish peroxidase demonstrated
   by the steady state kinetics using UV-vis spectrophotometry. The
   hydrophobicity and secondary structure of the caseoperoxidase were
   studied by ANS fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Camel
   -casein (C-casein) was selected as an appropriate apo-protein for the
   heme active site because of its innate flexibility and exalted
   hydrophobicity. This selection was confirmed by homology modeling
   method. Heme docking into the newly obtained C-casein structure
   indicated one heme was mainly incorporated with C-casein. The presence
   of a main electrostatic site for the active site in the C-casein was
   also confirmed by experimental methods through Wyman binding potential
   and isothermal titration calorimetry. The existence of C-casein protein
   in this biocatalyst lowered the suicide inactivation and provided a
   suitable protective role for the heme active-site. Additional
   experiments confirmed the retention of caseoperoxidase structure and
   function as an artificial enzyme.}},

Abstract = {{Marker-less 2D video tracking was studied as a practical means to
   measure upper limb kinematics for ergonomics evaluations. Hand activity
   level (HAL) can be estimated from speed and duty cycle. Accuracy was
   measured using a cross-correlation template-matching algorithm for
   tracking a region of interest on the upper extremities. Ten participants
   performed a paced load transfer task while varying HAL (2, 4, and 5) and
   load (2.2 N, 8.9 N and 17.8 N). Speed and acceleration measured from 2D
   video were compared against ground truth measurements using 3D infrared
   motion capture. The median absolute difference between 2D video and 3D
   motion capture was 86.5mm/s for speed, and 591mm/s(2) for acceleration,
   and less than 93mm/s for speed and 656mm/s(2) for acceleration when
   camera pan and tilt were within 30 degrees. Single-camera 2D video had
   sufficient accuracy (<100mm/s) for evaluating HAL.Practitioner Summary:
   This study demonstrated that 2D video tracking had sufficient accuracy
   to measure HAL for ascertaining the American Conference of Government

Abstract = {{Viral load (VL) measurements are critical to the proper management of
   HIV in developing countries. However, access to VL assays is limited by
   the high cost and complexity of existing assays. While there is a need
   for low cost VL assays, performance must not be compromised. Thus, new
   assays must be validated on metrics of limit of detection (LOD),
   accuracy, and dynamic range. Patient plasma samples from the Joint
   Clinical Research Centre in Uganda were de-identified and measured using
   both an existing VL assay (Abbott RealTime HIV-1) and our assay, which
   combines low cost reagents with a simplified method of RNA isolation
   termed Exclusion-Based Sample Preparation (ESP). 71 patient samples with
   VLs ranging from < 40 to > 3,000,000 copies/mL were used to compare the
   two methods. We demonstrated equivalent LOD (similar to 50 copies/mL)
   and high accuracy (average difference between methods of 0.08 log, R-2 =
   0.97). Using expenditures from this trial, we estimate that the cost of
   the reagents and consumables for this assay to be approximately \$5 USD.
   As cost is a significant barrier to implementation of VL testing, we
   anticipate that our assay will enhance access to this critical
   monitoring test in developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{High-density (0.82 g mL(-1)) jet-fuel range cycloalkanes were
   synthesized in high overall yields (similar to 80\%) by the aldol
   condensation of cyclopentanone and butanal followed by
   hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). Among the investigated solid-base catalysts,
   magnesium aluminum hydrotalcite (MgAl-HT) exhibited the highest activity
   for the solvent-free aldol condensation of cyclopentanone and butanal.
   The excellent performance of MgAl-HT was rationalized by the synergism
   between strong base and weak acid sites on the surface of this material.
   The aldol condensation products were further hydrodeoxygenated to
   butylcyclopentane and 1,3-dibutylcyclopentane over the Ni/SiO2, Pd/SiO2,
   and bimetallic Ni Pd/SiO2 catalysts. Compared to the Ni/SiO2 and Pd/SiO2
   catalysts, the bimetallic Ni-Pd/SiO2 catalyst exhibited higher activity
   for the solvent-free HDO reaction. Over the 4\%Ni-1\%Pd/SiO2 catalyst,
   high carbon yield (88.0\%) of butylcyclopentane and
   1,3-dibutylcyclopentane was achieved at 503 K. According to the
   characterization results, the excellent performance of Ni Pd/SiO2
   catalyst can be explained by the formation of Ni-Pd alloy.}},

Abstract = {{A battery manufacturing system typically includes a serial production
   line with multiple inspection stations and repair processes. In such
   systems, productivity and quality are tightly coupled. Variations in
   battery quality may add up along the line so that the upstream quality
   may impact the downstream operations. The repair process after each
   inspection can also affect downstream quality behavior and may further
   impose an effect on the throughput of conforming batteries. In this
   article, an analytical model of such an integrated productivity and
   quality system is introduced. Analytical methods based on an overlapping
   decomposition approach are developed to estimate the production rate of
   conforming batteries. The convergence of the method is analytically
   proved and the accuracy of the estimation is numerically justified. In
   addition, bottleneck identification methods based on the probabilities
   of blockage, starvation, and quality statistics are investigated.
   Indicators are proposed to identify the downtime and quality bottlenecks
   that remove the need to calculate throughput and quality performance and
   their sensitivities. These methods provide a quantitative tool for
   modeling, analysis, and improvement of productivity and quality in
   battery manufacturing systems and can be applied to other manufacturing
   systems ameanable to investigation using integrated productivity and
   quality models.}},

Abstract = {{On 27 May 2012, atmospheric conditions gave rise to two convective
   systems that generated a series of waves in the meteotsunami band on
   Lake Erie. The resulting waves swept three swimmers a 0.5 mi offshore,
   inundated a marina, and may have led to a capsized boat along the
   southern shoreline. Analysis of radial velocities from a nearby radar
   tower in combination with coastal meteorological observation indicates
   that the convective systems produced a series of outflow bands that were
   the likely atmospheric cause of the meteotsunami. In order to explain
   the processes that led to meteotsunami generation, we model the
   hydrodynamic response to three meteorological forcing scenarios: (i) the
   reconstructed atmospheric disturbance from radar analysis, (ii)
   simulated conditions from a high-resolution weather model, and (iii)
   interpolated meteorological conditions from the NOAA Great Lakes Coastal
   Forecasting System. The results reveal that the convective systems
   generated a series of waves incident to the southern shore of the lake
   that reflected toward the northern shoreline and reflected again to the
   southern shore, resulting in spatial wave focusing and edge wave
   formation that combined to impact recreational users near Cleveland, OH.
   This study illustrates the effects of meteotsunami development in an
   enclosed basin, including wave reflection, focusing, and edge wave
   formation as well as temporal lags between the causative atmospheric
   conditions and arrival of dangerous wave conditions. As a result, the
   ability to detect these extreme storms and predict the hydrodynamic
   response is crucial to reducing risk and building resilient coastal
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of meteotsunamis in Lake Michigan is quantified at 10
   locations from up to 20 years of historical water level records.
   Meteotsunami height data are fit with Pareto Type 1 and Generalized
   Pareto Distributions to estimate exceedance probabilities. The annual
   meteotsunami return level exceeds 0.25 m at all but two stations, with
   the largest annual return level of 0.62 m at Calumet Harbor. Analysis of
   radar imagery indicates that Lake Michigan meteotsunamis are associated
   primarily with convective storm structures, with a considerable
   contribution from frontal storms as well. Meteotsunami association with
   convective storm structures is more prevalent in southern Lake Michigan
   while frontal storm structures have a greater association with
   meteotsunamis in northern Lake Michigan. Water depths in southern Lake
   Michigan are conducive to Proudman resonance with convective storms
   while the northern Lake Michigan is too deep to meet Proudman resonance
   criteria, suggesting Greenspan edge wave resonance as the likely
   generation mechanism. Interestingly, meteotsunami events occur primarily
   in the late spring and early summer, approximately 1 month before the
   peak convective storm season but after the peak cyclone season. Overall,
   this statistical analysis provides valuable insight into the spatial and
   temporal trends in meteotsunami occurrence in Lake Michigan needed to
   estimate the risk posed by these dangerous coastal hazards.}},

Title = {{A Simple Index for Predicting the Susceptibility to Solidification
   Cracking}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The present study proposed to use the maximum vertical bar
   dT/d(f(S))(1/2)vertical bar of an alloy as a simple index for its
   susceptibility to solidification cracking. The index was based on a
   recent criterion for cracking that considered the phase diagram,
   solidification shrinkage, strain rate, cooling rate, and liquid feeding.
   However, other factors may also affect the susceptibility, e.g., the
   dihedral angle and secondary phases. Curves of T vs. (f(S))(1/2) of Al
   alloys were plotted to find the maximum vertical bar
   dT/d(f(S))(1/2)vertical bar using commercial thermodynamic software
   package Pandat and database PanAluminum based on the Scheil
   solidification model of no solid-state diffusion. Several critical
   predictions were made based on the index, including the crack
   susceptibility reduction by Al filler metals, the relative crack
   susceptibility of wrought Al alloys 2014, 2024, 2219, 6061, and 7075,
   and the most crack susceptible compositions of binary Al-Si, Al-Cu, and
   Al-Mg alloys. These predictions were verified by reported crack
   susceptibility tests and published filler metal guides. Although the
   predicted crack susceptibility of Al-Mg alloys was too high, it was not
   caused by the index but by the Scheil model because it doesn't consider
   diffusion. It was explained that, because of the very high (17.5 wt-\%)
   Mg solubility in solid Al, significant Mg diffusion from the
   interdendritic liquid into Al-rich dendrites can occur and reduce the
   maximum vertical bar dT/d(f(S))(1/2)vertical bar significantly,
   consistent with the good weldability of Al-Mg alloys.}},

Abstract = {{The loss of Arctic sea ice has emerged as a leading signal of global
   warming. This, together with acknowledged impacts on other components of
   the Earth system, has led to the term the new Arctic. Global coupled
   climate models predict that ice loss will continue through the
   twenty-first century, with implications for governance, economics,
   security, and global weather. A wide range in model projections reflects
   the complex, highly coupled interactions between the polar atmosphere,
   ocean, and cryosphere, including teleconnections to lower latitudes.
   This paper summarizes our present understanding of how heat reaches the
   ice base from the original sourcesinflows of Atlantic and Pacific Water,
   river discharge, and summer sensible heat and shortwave radiative fluxes
   at the ocean/ice surfaceand speculates on how such processes may change
   in the new Arctic. The complexity of the coupled Arctic system, and the
   logistic and technological challenges of working in the Arctic Ocean,
   require a coordinated interdisciplinary and international program that
   will not only improve understanding of this critical component of global
   climate but will also provide opportunities to develop human resources
   with the skills required to tackle related problems in complex climate
   systems. We propose a research strategy with components that include 1)
   improved mapping of the upper- and middepth Arctic Ocean, 2) enhanced
   quantification of important process, 3) expanded long-term monitoring at
   key heat-flux locations, and 4) development of numerical capabilities
   that focus on parameterization of heat-flux mechanisms and their
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The complex interactions between water vapor fields and deep atmospheric
   convection remain one of the outstanding problems in tropical
   meteorology. The lack of high spatial-temporal resolution, all-weather
   observations in the tropics has hampered progress. Numerical models have
   difficulties, for example, in representing the shallow-to-deep
   convective transition and the diurnal cycle of precipitation. Global
   Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) meteorology, which provides
   all-weather, high-frequency (5 min), precipitable water vapor estimates,
   can help. The Amazon Dense GNSS Meteorological Network experiment, the
   first of its kind in the tropics, was created with the aim of examining
   water vapor and deep convection relationships at the mesoscale. This
   innovative, Brazilian-led international experiment consisted of two
   mesoscale (100 km x 100 km) networks: 1) a 1-yr (April 2011-April 2012)
   campaign (20 GNSS meteorological sites) in and around Manaus and 2) a
   6-week (June 2011) intensive campaign (15 GNSS meteorological sites) in
   and around Belem, the latter in collaboration with the Cloud Processes
   of the Main Precipitation Systems in Brazil: A Contribution to
   Cloud-Resolving Modeling and to the Global Precipitation Measurement
   (CHUVA) Project in Brazil. Results presented here from both networks
   focus on the diurnal cycle of precipitable water vapor associated with
   sea-breeze convection in Belem and seasonal and topographic influences
   in and around Manaus. Ultimately, these unique observations may serve to
   initialize, constrain, or validate precipitable water vapor in
   high-resolution models. These experiments also demonstrate that GNSS
   meteorology can expand into logistically difficult regions such as the
   Amazon. Other GNSS meteorology networks presently being constructed in
   the tropics are summarized.}},

Abstract = {{In carnations, senescence initially occurs by inrolling and wilting of
   petals due to reduced turgidity; this is associated with autocatalytic
   ethylene synthesis in petals. However, whether petal abscission occurs
   during flower senescence or is induced by petal wilting is unknown.
   Here, we investigated this process by determining differences in
   cellular morphology at the abscission zone and measuring petal turgidity
   and breakstrength during development in carnations. DcACS1 and DcACO1
   played roles in autocatalytic ethylene production in carnations, and
   changes in these genes correlated with changes in ethylene biosynthesis.
   DcACS1 and DcACO1 transcripts were upregulated by treatment with
   ethylene and downregulated by treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene
   (1-MCP). Longitudinal sections of flowers at the initial fully opened
   stage showed anatomically distinct cell layers in the petal-receptacle
   boundaries, similar to the abscission zone in Arabidopsis, suggesting
   that petal abscission could occur during flower senescence in Dianthus
   caryophyllus. Petal breakstrength was relatively low in turgid petals,
   but increased with loss of turgidity. Moreover, 1-MCP effectively
   delayed the loss of petal turgidity, and differences in petal
   breakstrength were unclear after senescence was initiated in wild-type
   and ethylene-treated flowers. Thus, although petal breakstrength
   decreased following ethylene treatment, petals did not abscise, even
   after complete wilting of the flowers.}},
