Abstract = {{A general approach is examined to predict the operation of receiving
   antennas and arrays where a matrix formulation is used to characterize
   the antenna system under study. Developed concepts are also extended to
   coupling ratio predictions and array calibrations. The proposed
   methodology is validated by comparing calculated predictions to
   measurements and simulations of a practical antenna system, defined by a
   single 2.5 GHz conductor backed patch antenna operating above a ground
   plane platform. Investigations are also extended to a two and four
   element patch array. The developed procedures are also applicable to
   other antenna system configurations, complex scattering environments,
   and practical compensation techniques for array processing.}},

Abstract = {{This summary article focuses on the design and performance of a compact
   antenna unit for polarization reconfigurability. A four-element array of
   aperture coupled slots is employed, and each slot is fed by two
   microstrip lines defining an eight-port antenna unit. The slot array is
   also topped by a dielectric resonator antenna to hybridize radiation and
   improve gain and bandwidth while also reducing cross-polarization
   levels. The eight-port antenna is low-profile, compact (160 mm by 160 mm
   by 22 mm), and offers good radiation performance with a bandwidth of
   more than 35\%. In addition, the planar feeding circuit for element
   excitation is covered by a back plate enclosure with integration on the
   underside of the antenna ground plane which allows for the possibilty of
   different polarization states. Measurements and simulations are in
   agreement and the compact antenna may be useful for satellite navigation
   systems, diplexing units, and other phased arrays for wireless
   communications, including polarization diversity, direction finding, and
   other beam steering applications.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the current paper is to gain an understanding of the
   effects of inlet swirling flow on the flow field through short annular
   transition diffusers and nozzles. These devices are representative of
   the primary driving nozzles for certain exhaust ejector systems. It is
   known that strongly swirling flow can degrade ejector performance due to
   core separation. It is believed that minor changes in driving nozzle
   shape can improve ejector performance significantly.
   Two configurations of a diffuser/nozzle were tested experimentally and
   numerically under different swirl strengths. The two configurations were
   mounted on an annular flow wind tunnel. Two shapes of the annulus'
   centre body end; square and elliptical, were used. Based on the
   hydraulic inlet diameter, average velocity and temperature in the
   annulus of the wind tunnel, the measurements were carried out at Mach
   range of 0.21 to 0.26 with Reynolds number of 2.3 to 2.7x10(5).
   Ansys14 was used for the CFD simulations. The measured velocity profiles
   in the annulus were used as input flow conditions in the CFD
   investigation. The RNG k-epsilon turbulence model was used in the CFD
   simulations. The measured velocity profiles at the device exit, and
   measured surface pressures on the annulus, duct and nozzle walls were
   compared with the CFD predictions. The measured back pressure
   coefficient and total pressure loss through the diffuser systems were
   compared with the CFD predictions. A reasonable agreement between the
   experimental data and numerical predictions was observed.
   It was found computationally that the size of the central recirculation
   zone behind the annulus centre body has negative effects on the diffuser
   performance under different swirl numbers. The square shape of the
   annulus' centre body end Increased the back pressure and total pressure
   loss coefficients over the elliptical shape. However, the flow
   uniformity at the duct and nozzle exits improved with the square shape
   over the elliptical end. These differences may have a significant effect
   on ejector pumping.}},

Abstract = {{Short annular diffuser systems consisting of a conical expansion section
   with negative wall angles and a solid (full outer diameter) diffusing
   section were tested experimentally at several inlet swirl angles of 0-40
   degrees. Tests analyzed were completed over a range of inlet Reynolds
   number of Re-t = 0.9-2.2 x 10(5) and considered fully turbulent.
   Performance back pressure coefficient, outlet velocity uniformity, and
   total pressure loss were appreciably depreciated for inlet swirl number
   larger than 0.7 and the average 10 degrees curved vane swirler
   out-performed its straight vaned equivalent. Three centre bodies with
   length half that of the diffuser and different curvatures were
   manufactured. Similar performance was achieved but each centre body
   provided marginal improvements to a particular objective. Most notably,
   the centre body that gave an initial flow expansion angle of 14 degrees
   resulted in 1-4\% lower back pressure than the other two whose expansion
   angles were 12 degrees and 16 degrees.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed flow turbines can offer improvements over typical radial turbines
   used in automotive turbochargers, with regards to transient performance
   and low velocity ratio efficiency. Turbine rotor mass dominates the
   rotating inertia of the turbocharger, and any reductions of mass in the
   outer radii of the wheel, including the rotor back-disk, can
   significantly reduce this inertia and improve the acceleration of the
   assembly. Off-design, low velocity ratio conditions are typified by
   highly tangential flow at the rotor inlet and a non-zero inlet blade
   angle is preferred for such operating conditions. This is achievable in
   a Mixed Flow Turbine without increasing bending stresses within the
   rotor blade, which is beneficial in high speed and high inlet
   temperature turbine design. A range of mixed flow turbine rotors was
   designed with varying cone angle and inlet blade angle and each was
   assessed at a number of operating points. These rotors were based on an
   existing radial flow turbine, and both the hub and shroud contours and
   exducer geometry were maintained. The inertia of each rotor was also
   considered. The results indicated that there was a trade-off between
   efficiency and inertia for the rotors and certain designs may be
   beneficial for the transient performance of downsized, turbocharged
   engines.}},

   significant increase in static pressure at the inlet of the S-bend
   section, and reduces the driving pressure for the passive effusion
   cooling air. This effect then leads to reduced effusion mass flow,

Abstract = {{A good driving cycle is needed for accurate evaluation of a vehicle's
   performance in terms of emission and fuel consumption. Driving cycles
   obtained for certain cities or countries are not usually applicable to
   other cities or countries. Therefore, considerable research has been
   conducted on developing driving cycles for certain cities and regions.
   In this paper, a driving cycle for a taxi in Amman city, the capital of
   Jordan, is developed. Significant differences are noted when comparing
   the Amman driving cycle with other driving cycles. A model of a gasoline
   powered vehicle is used to conduct a performance comparison in terms of
   fuel economy and emissions utilizing the developed Amman driving cycle
   and six other worldwide driving cycles. The developed Amman driving
   cycle is very useful in obtaining accurate estimation of fuel economy
   and emissions for vehicles running on Amman roads and will be used in
   future work to study the performance of hybrid fuel cell/ battery
   vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Power management systems are one of the most important components in
   modern hybrid vehicles. They are needed to optimize the operation of the
   hybrid system components. In this paper, a model for a fuel cell/battery
   vehicle is developed using PSAT and then tested with four power
   management control strategies utilizing the driving cycle of Amman city,
   the capital of Jordan. The main components of the hybrid vehicle are a
   PEM fuel cell, battery, and a brushless de motor. PEM fuel cells are
   popular due to their good start up, high power density, and low
   operating temperature. The role of the battery in a hybrid system is to
   boost the system power during start-up and transient events in addition
   to storing the energy recovered from the braking process. The developed
   hybrid vehicle model is designed and configured so that it matches the
   power, acceleration, and maximum speed of a midsized vehicle powered by
   an internal combustion engine. The proposed control strategies are the
   thermostat strategy, fuel cell optimized strategy, load following
   strategy and fuzzy logic strategy. All four control strategies are
   implemented in simulation utilizing PSAT. The simulation results
   indicate that the best performance in terms of fuel economy is achieved
   by the load following control strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Smart Cities are a challenging application for Wireless Sensor Networks
   (WSNs). The network has to deal with large deployment areas, multiple
   user requests with diverse requirements on information attributes such
   as latency and reliability, and these operations need to be mostly
   unattended. Elements of cognition when used in the network nodes of such
   demanding applications of WSNs enable them to handle the heterogeneous
   traffic flows and simultaneously cater to multiple end-user requests. In
   this work, we present Cognitive Information-Centric sensor networks
   (CICSN), a paradigm of WSNs in which sensory information is identified
   using attribute-value pairs, and elements of cognition are used to
   deliver data to the sink with user-desired quality of information.
   Latency and reliability are identified as attributes that impact the
   quality of information (QoI) perceived by the end user. With a use-case
   analysis, we show how the CICSN is able to provide user-desired QoI on
   the delivered data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a comparative study that investigated
   the use of image-based and signal-based sensors for fault detection and
   fault isolation of visually-cued faults on an automated assembly
   machine. The machine assembles 8 mm circular parts, from a bulk-supply,
   onto continuously moving carriers at a rate of over 100 assemblies per
   minute. Common faults on the machine include part jams and ejected parts
   that occur at different locations on the machine. Two sensor systems are
   installed on the machine for detecting and isolating these faults: an
   image-based system consisting of a single camera and a signal-based
   sensor system consisting of multiple greyscale sensors and limit
   switches. The requirements and performance of both systems are compared
   for detecting six faults on the assembly machine. It is found that both
   methods are able to effectively detect the faults but they differ
   greatly in terms of cost, ease of implementation, detection time and
   fault isolation capability. The conventional signal-based sensors are
   low in cost, simple to implement and require little computing power, but
   the installation is intrusive to the machine and readings from multiple
   sensors are required for faster fault detection and isolation. The more
   sophisticated image-based system requires an expensive, high-resolution,
   high-speed camera and significantly more processing power to detect the
   same faults; however, the system is not intrusive to the machine, fault
   isolation becomes a simpler problem with video data, and the single
   camera is able to detect multiple faults in its field of view.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a Petri net model of Epidermal Growth Factor
   Receptor (EGFR) signaling to the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk (Ras-MAPK) pathway. The
   EGFR-Ras-MAPK pathway has been strongly implicated in the development
   and progression of cancer. This has prompted the development of drugs
   targeting oncogenic proteins within this signaling pathway. However, the
   efficacy of these and other anti-cancer drugs has been hampered by the
   emergence of drug resistance. This has fuelled initiatives in developing
   combination therapies to concurrently target more than one oncogenic
   protein at a time. A central challenge of these multi-target therapy
   initiatives lie in identifying sets of targets which upon inhibition,
   provide improved therapeutic benefit over inhibiting the same targets
   alone. Physiochemical models based on ordinary differential equations
   (ODE) have been commonly employed to identify candidate drug target(s).
   However, the amount of knowledge required to dynamically model large
   signaling networks is currently lacking. This shortcoming has impeded
   attempts to use ODE-based models for identifying drug combinations. In
   this paper, we have implemented a Petri-net model of EGFR-Ras-MAPK
   signaling. An analytical method has been employed to identify nodes
   within the model from which a signal is irrecoverable once lost. Such
   nodes, called siphons, represent candidate drug target(s) for
   combination therapy. The potential utility of this method is highlighted
   by the identification of siphons composed of oncogenic nodes currently
   targeted by drugs in the clinic. Importantly, the method relies solely
   on structural information and constitutes a potentially valuable tool
   that could be scaled up to identify `targetable' combinations in larger
   biochemical signaling networks.}},

Abstract = {{Developers tend to reuse source code by copy/paste. This form of reuse
   introduces code clones to software systems. Cloning in games can happen
   in different levels of granularity. The extreme case is known as Game
   Clone where the complete project is being cloned, e.g., by making a new
   independent branch which the original game's source code constitutes the
   seed for the new branch. Although it has been more than two decades
   since research on code clones started, various characteristics of
   cloning in open source games has not been studied. Therefore, there is
   no specific evidence on status of cloning e.g., dominant clone type in
   games. In this paper, we present an empirical study on code cloning in
   open source games by applying a state of the art clone detector, NiCad,
   and a clone visualization and analysis tool, VisCad. We identify both
   exact and near-miss clones from more than twenty open source C, Java and
   Python-based games, such as Jake2, Duo, Hexen2, jChess and OpenRPG from
   five different categories. Furthermore, we analyze a set of metrics for
   code clones in several different dimensions, including language,
   category, clone density and clone location to answer six essential
   research questions about the current status of cloning in open source
   games. Our research illustrates that cloning happens not only at
   inter-project level but also intra-project, specifically in First Person
   Shooter games developed using C (Type-1 50\% clones). Such observation
   concretely shows the necessity of adopting clone management systems for
   game development.}},

Abstract = {{Decentralized competitive markets are essential for a meaningful growth
   of distributed generation. Currently most jurisdictions use administered
   prices at the retail level. Through the example of electricity trade at
   an electric vehicle charging facility, this paper presents a trade
   mechanism that can help create decentralized markets. The mechanism is
   based on random matching and subsequent bargaining between the
   electricity sources and the electric vehicles. The entity organizing the
   market sets designated trade parameters. The ensuing interaction between
   the electricity sources and the vehicles, where each is trying to
   maximise its own benefit, is modeled as a non-cooperative game of
   incomplete information. Equilibrium analysis and examples are used to
   demonstrate the merits of this mechanism. In comparison to the market
   clearing price based approaches, this model provides market governance
   capabilities that can help tune a market to local requirements. The
   distribution companies may find the model useful as it will allow
   gradual introduction of localised markets and thereby enable phasing in
   of the investments required for upgrade of distribution infrastructure
   to service the electric vehicle charging needs.}},

Abstract = {{Electroosmotic flow can be employed in many microfluidic systems.
   Especially, highly porous materials are suitable since they generate
   significant flow rates and pressures.
   In the current research, we employ electroosmosis experiments using a
   relatively simple and cost-effective set-up including different sets of
   sintered packed beds of borosilicate micro spheres having a wider range
   of porosities. Various experiments are performed with varying applied
   electric field, and packed bed porosity. The flow rates are measured by
   tracking the air/liquid interface in a capillary which is connected to
   the packed bed. A mathematical model of the setup reveals the influence
   of the capillary flow on the flow rate of the electroosmotic flow.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of green concrete has been progressively introduced in
   concrete technology. At the same time, new generations of
   superplasticisers have become widely available and self-compacting
   concrete is being increasingly implemented. The aim of this research is
   to study the impact that different sustainable materials have on both
   fresh and hardened properties of Self-Compacting Fibre Reinforced
   Concrete (SCFRC) in order to implement their use in a precast concrete
   company. Different combinations of cement, mineral additions (active and
   inert), polypropylene fibres, superplasticisers, and aggregates have
   been considered. Fresh state performance has been assessed by means of:
   slump flow test, V-funnel, and J-ring. Concrete compressive strength
   values at different ages have been retained as representative of the
   material's performance in its hardened state. All these properties have
   been correlated with SCFRC proportioning parameters. The importance of
   interactions between mineral additions and between these and
   superplasticiser is emphasised, as well as the different consequences of
   using powders as cement replacement or as mineral additions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the structural behaviour of a vaulted pre-stressed
   slabs cast with selfcompacting concrete (SCC) and tested in flexure. The
   concrete mix grade C50 were used to cast experimental prestressed 0.2m
   deep vaulted slabs with 3m and 5m overall length and 1.2m width. The
   concrete mixes were prepared with cement CEMI, 21\% fly ash
   substitution, and a low water-to-binder ratio of 0.32, which is typical
   of structural precast concrete construction. The targeted 28-day
   compressive strength was 50 MPa. The SCC mixes were developed to achieve
   the necessary bond strengths for prestress transfer at early age while
   balancing the requirements for adequate workability and durability.
   Additionally the profile of the slab has been optimised to gain maximum
   structural efficiency for minimum concrete volume whilst maintaining
   good demoulding time. For each span, three prestressed vaulted slabs
   were tested in four point flexural test to determine the load carrying
   capacity, mode of failure, crack pattern, and load deflection response.
   The predicted transfer stress and ultimate flexural load values have
   been compared to the experimental results taking into account measured
   material properties, friction losses and elastic shortening.}},

Abstract = {{Portable navigation has become increasingly prevalent in daily
   activities. The need for accurate user positioning information,
   including a person's location and velocity, when using a portable device
   (such as a cell phone, tablet, or even a smart watch) is growing in
   various fields. Knowing the user's mode of motion or conveyance allows
   appropriate algorithms or constraints, related to each mode, to be used
   to estimate a more accurate position and velocity. The modes covered in
   this paper are walking, running, cycling, and land-based vessels
   (including vehicles, truck, buses, and trains which include light rail
   trains and subways). The work discussed in this paper involves the use
   of sensors - with and without Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
   signal availability in portable devices to help recognize the mode of
   motion for an arbitrary user, an arbitrary use case - whether the device
   is held in the hand, in the pocket, or at the ear, etc. - and an
   arbitrary orientation of the device.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for a reliable and accurate navigation system that can
   replace Global Positioning System (GPS) in GPS-denied environment has
   become increasingly imperative. For indoor environment where GPS is
   almost unavailable or unreliable, the utilization of other sensors such
   as inertial sensors becomes necessary. However, inertial sensors alone
   cannot sustain reliable long-term accuracy due to errors accumulation
   without external periodic corrections. Thus this paper proposes the
   utilization of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) as an alternative
   system to provide periodic corrections. In this paper, a tightly-coupled
   integrated navigation system that integrates LiDAR, a single-axis
   gyroscope and wheel encoder is introduced. Straight lines detection and
   extraction algorithm is utilized to estimate the changes in orientation
   and range from LiDAR to the extracted line. LiDAR-estimated orientation
   change and range change to the extracted line feature between two
   consecutive LiDAR scans are first filtered out through a high rate
   extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to remove the effect of short-term noise
   associated with LiDAR scans. Then the smoothed orientation and range
   changes are fused by a low rate EKF with those predicted by gyroscope
   and wheel encoder. The proposed system is verified through real
   experiment on a wirelessly controlled Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV).
   Experimental results indicate that navigation accuracy has been improved
   to sub-meter and gyroscope bias is precisely estimated.}},

Abstract = {{Some existing applications on smartphones and tablets use the
   accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers to provide basic indoor
   positioning solution starting from a known position for short time
   periods. However, this can be achieved only if the portable device is
   kept in a fixed orientation, which is unrealistic and inconvenient for
   the user. In unconstrained portable navigation, the mobile device
   orientation can be freely changed with respect to the human body without
   any constraints.
   In this paper, a novel method is proposed to estimate or enhance the
   heading misalignment angle between one or more smart device(s) and/or
   wearable appcessories and the moving platform (person or vehicle). An
   accurate estimation for heading misalignment angle enables users to
   change their devices' orientation freely with respect to their bodies
   without any constraint. Different test scenarios are conducted to assess
   the performance of the proposed technique including different use cases.
   The results clearly demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed technique
   in enabling real-time, continuous and reliable consumer localization
   indoors and outdoors with mobile device.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a systematic approach adopting sparse least-squares SVMs
   (LS-SVMs) is proposed to automatically detect fire using vision-based
   systems with fast speed and good performance. Within this framework, the
   features are first extracted from input images using wavelet analysis.
   The LS-SVM is then trained on the obtained dataset with global support
   vectors (GSVs) selected by a fast subset selection method, in the end of
   which the classifier parameters can be directly calculated rather than
   updated during the training process, leading to a significant saving of
   computing time. This sparse classifier only depends on the GSVs rather
   than all the patterns, which helps to reduce the complexity of the
   classifier and improve the generalization performance. Detection results
   on real fire images show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
   proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The conditioning temperature is one of the important parameters of the
   hoop standard granulator production system. It can be influenced by
   temperature system with nonlinear, time-varying and hysteresis
   characteristics and feed quantity. This paper creates a control
   algorithm which combines disturbance observer and fuzzy PID to control
   the temperature modulation. In this way, feed quantity of the hoop
   standard granulator is also seen as a part of the interference. By
   constructing disturbance observer, this paper predicts the disturbance
   on temperature system and variations of parameters, so as to suppress
   the effect of interference on the system. Meanwhile this paper
   introduces fuzzy PID for adaptive PID tuning parameters to achieve
   optimal parameters. Finally, the numerical simulation on temperature
   system has strong adaptability and robustness.}},

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming more popular and have gained better
   customer acceptance in the past few years due to the improved
   performances, such as high acceleration rate and long driving distance
   from a single charging. Recent research also shows some promising
   benefits from integrating EVs with power grid. One of these is to use EV
   batteries as distributed energy storage. As a result, the excessive
   electricity generated from renewable resources can be stored in EVs and
   release to the power grid when needed. However, compared to traditional
   Nickel-cadmium and lead-acid batteries, Li-ion battery only can be
   operated in a narrow window, and needs to be properly monitored, managed
   and protected. This issue becomes severe when it is deployed for large
   applications, such as EVs and centralised electricity storage, where a
   large number of Li-Ion cells are interconnected to provide sufficient
   voltage and current. The solution mainly relies on a robust and
   efficient battery management system (BMS). This paper presents a brief
   review on the features of BMS, followed by a practical guide on
   selecting a commercial BMS from the market and designing a custom BMS
   for better control of functionalities. A Lithimate Pro BMS from Elithion
   is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of BMS in managing and
   protecting Li-Ion cells during the charge and discharge phases.}},

Abstract = {{Mankind is facing the twin challenges of sustainable energy supply and
   climate change due to the greenhouse gases emissions. Reducing the
   energy consumption has been given a significant role in addressing these
   problems. Although modern control technologies have been successfully
   applied in many engineering systems, PID
   (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control and its variants are still
   the most common control techniques due to their simple control design
   principle, especially in the power electronics control field. However,
   little has been done so far to explore how the system performance and
   control energy are related to each other through the control parameter
   settings. This paper takes the voltage droop (P) control design in
   voltage source converters (VSCs) system as the research background to
   investigate the parameter optimization of droop controllers. The
   simulation results reveal that there exists a better trade-off between
   the system performance and control energy consumption through a proper
   choice of the controller parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, renewable energy resources have drawn a lot of
   attention worldwide in developing a more sustainable society. Among
   various forms of renewable energies, wind power has been recognized as
   one of the most promising ones in many countries and regions including
   Northern Ireland and Ireland according to the National Renewable Energy
   Action Plans (NREAPs). However, due to the variability nature of wind
   power, the wind generation forecasting hours even days ahead proves to
   be imperative to enhance the flexibility of the operation and control of
   real-time power systems. In this paper, a variant Gaussian Process
   employing only nearby measured wind power data is proposed to make short
   term prediction of the overall wind power production for the whole
   island of Ireland. Multi Gaussian Process submodels are developed, and
   the model capability in reflecting the variability and uncertainty in
   the wind generation system is enhanced. In such method, local data could
   be utilized more efficiently and computation complexity is reduced at
   the same time. The forecasting results have been verified in comparison
   with standard Gaussian Process and persistence model, and improvements
   can be observed in terms of the model complexity and prediction
   accuracy. Moreover, a recently proposed teaching-learning based
   optimization algorithm (TLBO) is applied to build the Gaussian model,
   and simulations show its faster convergence speed and better global
   searching capability.}},

Abstract = {{Wind power is projected to play an important role in the current and
   future power systems. To integrate offshore wind farms to the existing
   onshore grid, voltage source converters (VSCs) based high voltage direct
   current (HVDC) transmission have drawn considerable interests from
   researchers and industries. As the most important variable in a DC
   system, DC voltage indicates the power balance between different
   terminals thus must be maintained in a safe range. To distribute
   transmitted wind power among distinct onshore AC grids, different
   operation modes need to be considered. This paper proposes to
   interoperate the backstepping DC voltage control method between various
   operation modes. DC cable dynamics are included in the DC voltage
   controller design to eliminate the effect of DC transmission line.
   Simulation is carried out in Matlab/Simulink to verify the backstepping
   enhanced DC voltage control method. It is shown that the transient
   stability can be improved with the backstepping method.}},

Abstract = {{A design of on-board V2G charger was designed to meet the requirements
   of the V2G application. Firstly, the functions of on-board V2G charger
   were analyzed. Then a two-stage structure including a bidirectional

   Traditional charging mode and V2G mode were been discussed for the
   proposed charging system. The Dual Active Bridge topology was selected
   as the DC-DC converter. Moreover, the soft-switching operation over a
   wide output voltage range was analyzed. In the end, a 3.3 kW on-board
   V2G charger experimental platform was built. The experimental results
   demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed design and control methods.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major issues in innovative automotive engines is to reduce
   the energy consumption and pollutant emissions, at the same time, to
   guarantee a high level of performance indices. To this aim, common rail
   diesel engines can satisfy strict regulations by enhancing the
   model-based control of the injection process to increase the combustion
   efficiency. This paper presents a more accurate model for the
   electro-injector in common rail diesel engines. The model takes into
   account the mechanical deformation of relevant parts of the
   electro-injector and the non-linearity of the fuel flow. Model
   parameters are then optimized by an evolutionary strategy. Simulation
   shows that the optimized model can be helpful in predicting the real
   trend of the injected fuel flow rate when assisted with the experimental
   data, and in controlling the injection.}},

Abstract = {{Bioresorbable polymers such as PLA have an important role to play in the
   development of temporary implantable medical devices with significant
   benefits over traditional therapies. However, development of new devices
   is hindered by high manufacturing costs associated with difficulties in
   processing the material. A major problem is the lack of insight on
   material degradation during processing. In this work, a method of
   quantifying degradation of PLA using IR spectroscopy coupled with
   computational chemistry and chemometric modeling is examined. It is
   shown that the method can predict the quantity of degradation products

   potential to adapt the method to developing an on-line sensor for
   monitoring PLA degradation in real-time during processing.}},

Abstract = {{Natural convective heat transfer from a vertical isothermal cylinder
   mounted on a flat adiabatic base has been numerically studied. The
   cylinder has an exposed top surface. The cylinder is relatively very
   short, i.e., has a height that is equal to or less than the cylinder
   diameter. Both the cases where the cylinder is pointing upward and where
   it is pointing downward have been considered. The governing equations
   have been numerically solved using the commercial CFD solver ANSYS
   FLUENT(C). Results have only been obtained for Prandtl number = 0.74.
   The mean heat transfer rates have been expressed in terms of a Nusselt
   number, consideration being given both to the heat transfer rate from
   the entire cylinder surface and to the heat transfer rates from the side
   and top surfaces of the Cylinder. The effect of the dimensionless
   cylinder height to-diameter ratio on the Nusselt number variation has
   been studied in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Heat pumps are commonly used for residential space-heating and cooling.
   The combination of solar thermal and heat pump systems as a single
   solar-assisted heat pump (SAHP) system can significantly reduce
   residential energy consumption in Canada. As a part of Team Ontario's
   efforts to develop a high performance house for the 2013 DOE Solar
   Decathlon Competition, an integrated mechanical system (IMS) consisting
   of a SAHP was investigated. The system is designed to provide domestic
   hot water, space-heating, space-cooling and dehumidification. The system
   included a cold and a hot thermal storage tank and a heat pump to move
   energy from the low temperature reservoir, to the hot. The solar thermal
   collectors supplies heat to the cold storage and operate at a higher
   efficiency due to the heat pump reducing the temperature of the
   collector working fluid. The combination of the heat pump and solar
   thermal collectors allows more heat to be harvested at a lower
   temperature, and then boosted to a suitable temperature for domestic use
   via the heat pump. The IMS and the building's energy loads were modeled
   using the TRNSYS simulation software. A parametric study was conducted
   to optimize the control, sizing and configuration of the system. This
   paper provides an overview of the model and summarizes the results of
   the study. The simulation results suggested that the investigated system
   can achieve a free energy ratio of about 0.583 for a high performance
   house designed for the Ottawa climate.}},

Abstract = {{Being natural and renewable, the wind is a valuable energy resource.
   Standalone off-grid wind systems cannot simply extract the maximum power
   at all times due to energy storage limitations. As a result of the
   limited energy storage, wasted surplus wind power is directed to an
   energy `dump' known as a `dummy load' and the power is dissipated as
   heat. Therefore, the challenge for standalone wind systems is to
   efficiently extract the maximum power from the wind when necessary, and
   reduce the energy extraction-as dictated by the energy storage
   mechanism-to minimize surplus of energy. By regulating the power output
   as necessary, the amount of wasted energy and heat dissipation
   requirements of the energy dump mechanism will be reduced.
   This paper proposes a power management supervisory controller that
   autonomously switches between an adaptive MPPT mode and a power limit
   search (PLS) mode to regulate the wind energy extraction. MPPT is used
   when the wind speeds result in maximum power levels that are lower than
   the desired power level. The memory based adaptive MPPT uses the
   internally captured atmospheric information to detect wind speed change
   and extract an equivalent of the turbine's tip speed ratio (TSR)
   parameter. The PLS is used whenever the power level exceeds the desired
   power and the MPPT is activated when the wind speed has decreased and no
   surplus power is detected. The functionality of the power management
   controller has been verified through simulation. The controller was able
   to successfully regulated the output power and exhibited smooth
   transitions between the MPPT and PLS.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a multi-input isolated resonant converter topology
   that is able to maintain ZVS for a wide range of load conditions for
   hybrid renewable energy systems. Each of the input stage of the proposed
   converter consists of an asymmetrical pulse-width modulation (PWM)
   controlled half-bridge resonant converter. An output filter is then
   shared among the input resonant converter modules; with the output
   inductor operates in continuous conduction mode (CCM) to provide almost
   constant current to the load. The APWM controlled switch pair in each of
   the input stage is controlled independently, so that the proposed
   converter is capable to support individual or simultaneous operations of
   the input sources. The operating principles of the proposed circuit and
   its key theoretical waveforms will be explained in this paper. To
   validate the functionality of the proposed circuit, results will be
   provided on a 70 kHz, 1kW system.}},

   promising than the 48V DC distribution. This paper presents a
   quantitative comparison and evaluation for both the 48V DC and 380V DC
   distribution systems in terms of overall efficiency, system reliability,
   and overall cost. The 380V DC system has higher system efficiency and
   cost more, while the 48V DC system has higher system reliability. Based
   on this study, a new DC system architecture, which combines the

   Established medial axis based meshing algorithms are highly effective

   favourable decompositions, particularly when there are geometry
   concavities. This new approach uses both the topological and geometric
   information in the medial axis to establish a valid and effective
   arrangement of mesh singularities for any 2-D surface. It deals with
   concavities effectively and finds solutions that are most appropriate to
   the geometric shapes. Methods for directly constructing the
   corresponding decompositions are also put forward. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{One of the main purposes of building a battery model is for monitoring
   and control during battery charging/discharging as well as for
   estimating key factors of batteries such as the state of charge for
   electric vehicles. However, the model based on the electrochemical
   reactions within the batteries is highly complex and difficult to
   compute using conventional approaches. Radial basis function (RBF)
   neural networks have been widely used to model complex systems for
   estimation and control purpose, while the optimization of both the
   linear and non-linear parameters in the RBF model remains a key issue. A
   recently proposed meta-heuristic algorithm named Teaching-Learning-Based
   Optimization (TLBO) is free of presetting algorithm parameters and
   performs well in non-linear optimization. In this paper, a novel
   self-learning TLBO based RBF model is proposed for modelling electric
   vehicle batteries using RBF neural networks. The modelling approach has
   been applied to two battery testing data sets and compared with some
   other RBF based battery models, the training and validation results
   confirm the efficacy of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{In vision-aided INS/GNSS integrated navigation systems, several errors
   contribute to significant drifts in the absence of GNSS and during
   severe GNSS interruptions. These errors includes cameras distortion,
   camera calibration, camera misalignments, and feature
   extraction/tracking errors. In addition, inertial sensors biases,
   drifts, non-orthogonality, non-normality and misalignment also
   significantly affect the dead-reckoning navigation accuracy in the
   absence of GNSS. Due to the complex nonlinearity inherent in these
   errors, this paper introduces a double-filter mechanism enhanced by
   nonlinear error modeling for multi-sensor vision-aided integrated
   navigation systems for land vehicles. The proposed system integrates
   GNSS, vision, INS, and odometry. The proposed methodology tries to
   reduce the effects of nonlinear errors that propagate through different
   components of the integrated navigation system. The proposed methodology
   can work in real-time due to the utilization of a fast orthogonal search
   (FOS) approach as the nonlinear modeling technique. The paper verifies
   the operational performance of the proposed system using a physical
   experimental setup and real-road experimental data. Initial results
   shows remarkable positional and heading accuracy improvements if FOS
   training is properly performed.}},

Abstract = {{The main challenge facing portable navigation is the ability to obtain
   accurate positioning results in urban canyons or indoors where Global
   Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are weak or unavailable.
   Self-contained motion sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes,
   are hence used; however, their accuracies are not sufficient. One of the
   methods used to improve positioning performance is to recognize the
   motion mode of the user carrying the portable device. The illustrated
   work presents a motion mode recognition module implemented within a
   portable navigation device recognizing a broad range of motion modes.
   The motion mode recognition is robust to the device usage, device
   orientation, user's motion characteristics, and GNSS signal
   availability. The motion modes recognized by the module include
   stationary, walking, running, cycling, land-based vessel (including car,
   train, or bus, whether sitting or standing), walking up/down stairs,
   going up/down in an elevator, standing in an escalator, walking on an
   escalator, standing on a moving walkway, and walking on a moving
   walkway. The recognition module has been implemented and tested in
   real-time on smartphones, tablets, smart glasses, and smartwatches of
   various brands and types.}},

   signal is demonstrated using a 2-tap finite impulse response (FIR)

   reflector (DBR) laser. The taps of the FIR filter are set to {[}1, -1]
   enabling the generation of a bipolar drive signal with a full width at

   the FIR filter with the DBR laser allows for a compact DPSK transmitter.
   The quality of the DPSK signal is assessed using both noncoherent
   detection and coherent detection with digital signal processing.
   Transmission over a passive link consisting of 102 km of single mode
   fiber (SMF) is achieved using coherent detection and electronic
   dispersion post-compensation, with a received optical power (ROP) of
   -44.6 dBm at a bit error ratio (BER) of 3.8 x 10(-3) and a 50 dB loss

Abstract = {{Motivated by power-limited uplink access, this paper proposes a receiver
   optimization for the uplink of a spatial multiple access scenario based
   on the concept of minimum probability of error (MPE) beamforming.
   Although MPE beamforming is shown to be more effective than the
   classical beamforming methods, it results in a non-convex and a highly
   nonlinear optimization problem. To resolve this problem, a set of
   modulated-based constraints is added to the MPE beamforming technique.
   It is shown that the solution to the constrained problem is equivalent
   to the original one. Moreover, it is proved that the constrained problem
   does not suffer from the existence of local minima and also has a unique
   global minimum. Finally the constrained problem is transformed into a
   convex optimization problem which can be solved using the existing
   convex programming algorithms.}},

   Average detection delay and false alarm probability have been previously
   used for system design and performance assessment. In this paper, we
   introduce an additional constraint: the average number of communications
   between local sensors and the fusion center. This metric is able to
   reflect both the cost of establishing communication links as well as
   overall energy consumption over time. The proposed algorithm minimizes
   detection delay with constraints on both false alarm probability and
   average number of communications. The optimal choice of thresholds in
   the algorithm are determined by a combination of sequential detection
   analysis and constrained optimization. Performance is investigated for
   different scenarios through both analysis and simulation, where the
   effects of approximations used are evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{We consider forensic outlier detection instead of traditional outlier
   detection to enforce spectrum security in a Cognitive Radio Network
   (CRN). We investigate a CRN where a group of sensors report their local
   binary decisions to a Fusion Center (IV), which makes a global decision
   on the availability of the spectrum. To ensure the truthfulness of the
   sensors, we examine the reported decisions in order to determine whether
   a specific sensor is an outlier. We propose several optimal detectors
   (for known parameters) and suboptimal detectors (for the practical cases
   where the parameters are unknown) to detect three types of outlier
   sensors: 1) selfish sensor, which reports the spectrum to be occupied
   when locally detects its vacancy, 2) malicious sensor, which reports the
   spectrum to be vacant when locally detects its occupancy, 3)
   malfunctioning sensor, whose reports are not accurate enough (i.e., its
   performance is close to random guessing). We evaluate the proposed
   detectors by simulations. Our simulation results reveal that the
   proposed detectors significantly outperform n the Grubb's test. Since
   the unknown or untrustworthy parameters are accurately estimated by the
   FC, the proposed suboptimal detectors do not require the knowledge of
   the spectrum statistics and are insensitive to the parameters reported
   by the suspected user. These detectors can be used by government
   agencies for forensic testing in policy control and abuser
   identification in CRNs. Index Terms Cognitive radio, forensic cognitive
   detection, outlier detection, spectrum security, policy enforcement.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a method of hyperspectral unmixing for the linear
   regression model is introduced. The proposed algorithm employs an
   adaptive lasso problem using the alternating direction method of
   multipliers (ADMM) for unmixing process. Indeed, we formulate a weighted
   l(1) norm problem under the reasonable given error to reconstruct the
   fractional abundances and to avoid inconsistent endmember selection in a
   sparse semi-supervised hyperspectral imaging process. We show that this
   problem can be efficiently solved by appropriate selection of functions
   and parameters appearing in the ADMM approach. First, we enforce both
   non-negativity and full additivity constraints of the abundance
   fractions in the objective function. Then, we apply the ADMM algorithm
   to solve the acquired optimization problem. Our simulations show that
   the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods in terms
   of mean square error and reconstruction signal-to-noise-ratio with
   reasonably reduced computational costs.}},

Abstract = {{Fountain codes were introduced to provide higher reliability, lower
   complexities, and more scalability for networks such as the Internet.
   Luby-Transform (LT) codes, which are the first realization of Fountain
   codes, achieve the capacity of the binary erasure channel (BEC)
   asymptotically and universally. For finite lengths, the search is
   continued to find codes closer to the capacity limits at even lower
   encoding and decoding complexities. Most previous work on single-layer
   Fountain coding targets the design via the right degree distribution.
   The left degree distribution of an LT code is left as Poisson to protect
   the universality. For finite lengths, this is no longer an issue; thus,
   we focus on the design of better codes for the BEC at practical lengths.
   Our left degree shaping provides codes outperforming LT and all other
   competing schemes in the literature. At a bit error rate of 10(-7) and
   packet length k = 256, our scheme provides a realized rate of 0.6 which
   is 23.5\% higher than Sorensen et al.'s scheme {[}1].}},

Abstract = {{Packet transmission over two-hop lossy link is increasingly important in
   communication networks. In this paper, we present a systematic network
   coding scheme for packet-level transmissions over two-hop lossy links.
   In the scheme, a source node sends out uncoded packets in their original
   order first, followed by a potentially unlimited number of coded packets
   using random linear network coding. The intermediate node forwards a
   packet if it receives an uncoded packet, and sends a coded packet from
   previously buffered packets using random linear network coding if it
   does not receive a packet or the received packet is coded. We show that,
   compared to the scheme in which random linear network coding is used all
   the time at the source and intermediate nodes, the proposed method
   requires much less computation in encoding and decoding and also
   achieves a higher end-to-end rate. The benefit is appreciable when the
   number of source packets is not large and the finite field in which
   network coding is performed is small. To analytically assess the
   performance, we employ a Markov chain based technique to calculate the
   expected completion time of the proposed scheme given the number of
   source packets, link erasure rates and finite field size.}},

Abstract = {{The utilization of the German `Passivhaus Standard' has grown rapidly in
   recent years. Stimulated by the shift towards energy efficient design
   and rising fuel costs, the concept is perceived as a potential means of
   meeting future zero carbon targets through an established, reliable
   methodology. The standards ability to ensure adequate indoor air quality
   in a UK climate however remains fundamentally under-researched. This
   paper investigates the potential implications of the Passivhaus standard
   on indoor air quality. A case study is presented, which consisted of
   indoor air quality measurements, occupant diary, building survey and
   occupant interviews in a Passivhaus social housing project in the UK.
   The findings provide much needed insights into indoor air quality in
   homes designed to this standard; which can be disseminated to aid the
   development of effective sustainable building design that is appropriate
   to localized climatic conditions and sensitive to the health of building
   occupants. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Abstract = {{Smart vehicles are considered major providers of ubiquitous information
   services. In this paper, we propose a solution for expedited and
   cost-effective access to vehicular public sensing services. The proposed
   caching-assisted data delivery (CADD) scheme applies caching on the
   delivery path of the collected data. Cached information can be used for
   later interests without having to request similar data from vehicles.
   CADD relies on the deployment of a ``light-weight{''} road caching spot
   (RCS) at intersections, and on vehicles for communication to/from RCSs.
   CADD involves a novel caching mechanism that utilizes real-time
   information for selecting the caching RCSs while considering popularity
   in cache replacement. A data chunk to be replaced may be forwarded to
   another less-loaded RCS. CADD considers vehicles' headings to direct
   communication towards the destination, which reduces access delay.
   Performance evaluation of CADD shows significant improvements in the
   access cost and delay compared to a scheme that does not deploy RCSs.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous computing technologies, such as multicore CPUs, GPUs and
   FPGAs can provide significant performance improvements. However,
   developing applications for these technologies often results in coupling
   applications to specific devices, typically through the use of
   proprietary tools.
   This paper presents SHEPARD, a compile time and run-time framework that
   decouples application development from the target platform and enables
   run-time allocation of tasks to heterogeneous computing devices. Through
   the use of special annotated functions, called managed tasks, SHEPARD
   approximates a task's performance on available devices, and coupled with
   the approximation of current device demand, decides which device can
   satisfy the task with the lowest overall execution time. Experiments
   using a task parallel application, based on an in-memory database,
   demonstrate the opportunity for automatic run-time task allocation to
   achieve speed-up over a static allocation to a single specific device.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the joint source-channel coding (JSCC) problem where the
   real valued outputs of two correlated memoryless Gaussian sources are
   scalar quantized, bit assigned, and transmitted, without applying any
   error correcting code, over a multiple access channel (MAC) which
   consists of two orthogonal point-to-point time-correlated Rayleigh
   fading sub-channels with soft-decision demodulation. At the receiver
   side, a joint sequence maximum a posteriori (MAP) detector is used to
   exploit the correlation between the two sources as well as the
   redundancy left in the quantizer's indices, the channel's soft-decision
   outputs, and noise memory. The MAC's sub-channels are modeled via
   non-binary Markov noise discrete channels recently shown to effectively
   represent point-to-point fading channels. For the simple case of
   quantizing the sources with two levels, we establish a necessary and
   sufficient condition under which the joint sequence MAP decoder can be
   reduced to a simple instantaneous symbol-by-symbol decoder. Then, using
   numerical results obtained by system simulation, it is observed that
   when the sources are highly correlated and soft-decision quantization is
   used, JSCC can profit from a high correlation in the channel noise
   process and provide significant signal-to-distortion ratio improvements
   of up to 6.3 dB over a fully interleaved channel.}},

Abstract = {{A wireless energy harvesting protocol is proposed for a
   decode-and-forward relay-assisted secondary user (SU) network in a
   cognitive spectrum sharing paradigm. An expression for the outage
   probability of the relay-assisted cognitive network is derived subject
   to the following power constraints: 1) the maximum power that the source
   and the relay in the SU network can transmit from the harvested energy,
   2) the peak interference power from the source and the relay in the SU
   network at the primary user (PU) network, and 3) the interference power
   of the PU network at the relay-assisted SU network. The results show
   that as the energy harvesting conversion efficiency improves, the
   relay-assisted network with the proposed wireless energy harvesting
   protocol can operate with outage probabilities below 20\% for some
   practical applications.}},

   variable frequency and delay control, and a low-impedance ground in the
   off-state; and a transmit beamformer with a computer interface to
   monitor and control the system. Experimental results demonstrate the
   system to have a 3dB beamwidth of 2mm at 60mm depth (f/1.4) and 4mm at

Abstract = {{The injection stretch blow moulding (ISBM) has been widely applied in
   polyethylene terephthalate bottles production process. The modelling of
   the blowing conditions is important for the control of the process. In
   this paper, a nonparametric modelling method namely Gaussian Process is
   employed and applied to estimate the section weights during the process.
   A key issue in Gaussian Process modelling is to iteratively compute the
   covariance matrix inversion which is often extremely time-consuming as
   the optimization of the Gaussian process requires to call the marginal
   likelihood function and its gradient function. The matrix decomposition
   methods like Cholesky and QR decomposition have shown to be able to
   significantly reduce the computation complexity in solving linear
   problems, and they are also used in Gaussian process modelling in
   computing the product of a matrix inversion with a column vector in this
   paper. The algorithm complexities are analysed and compared, and it is
   shown that the proposed method is particularly useful as the matrix size
   increases. The proposed method is then used to model the section weights
   in polymer stretch blow moulding, and the results confirm the efficiency
   of the proposed method in significantly reducing the computational
   effort.}},

Pages = {{441-453}},
Abstract = {{An ice formation model, based on the solution of the heat conduction
   equation across blue ice, white ice and snow cover, is integrated into
   the Dynamic Reservoir Simulation Model (DYRESM) to allow for
   one-dimensional (vertical) winter simulation of lake dynamics during
   periods of ice cover. This is an extension of a previous three-layer
   snow and ice model to include two-way coupling between the ice and the
   water column. The process-based ice formation is suitable for
   application to mid-latitude regions and includes: snowmelt due to rain;
   formation of white ice; and variability in snow density, snow
   conductivity, and ice and snow albedo. The model was validated against
   published observations from Harmon Lake, British Columbia, and new
   observations from Eagle Lake, Ontario. The ice thickness and water
   column temperature profile beneath the ice were predicted with Root Mean
   Square Deviations (RMSD) of 1 cm and 0.38 degrees C, respectively,
   during the winter of 1990-91in Harmon Lake. In Eagle Lake the 2011-12
   year-round water column temperature profile was predicted with an RMSD
   of 1.8 degrees C. Improved prediction of under-ice lake temperature,
   relative to published results from simpler models, demonstrates the need
   for models that accurately capture ice-formation processes, including
   ice to water column coupling, formation of both blue and white ice
   layers, and process-based ice and snow parameters (density, conductivity
   and albedo).}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that the stability of haptic simulation
   systems is largely affected by the type of signals sampled and the
   discretization method used for implementing the virtual environment. In
   this paper, we analytically derive and experimentally evaluate the
   uncoupled stability of haptic simulation systems, that is when these
   systems are not being held by any operator, for various conditions.
   These stability conditions are expected to be the most stringent ones,
   as operators' grasp tend to stabilize the coupled system. Our evaluation
   includes cases in which position, velocity or both signals are sampled,
   the backward difference or Tustin methods are used to implement a
   linear-time-invariant damper-spring environment. Our results show that
   sampling the velocity signal will significantly increase the range of
   environment dynamics that can be stably implemented, particularly when
   the backward difference method is applied as the discretization method.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the uncertainties of
   an electromagnetic (EM) tracking system and to improve both the trueness
   and the precision of the EM tracker. METHODS: For evaluating errors, we
   introduce an optical (OP) tracking system and consider its measurement
   as ``ground truth{''}. In the experiment, static data sets and dynamic
   profiles are collected in both relatively less-metallic environments.
   Static data sets are for error modeling, and dynamic ones are for
   testing. To improve the trueness and precision of the EM tracker,
   tracker calibration based on polynomial fitting and smooth filters, such
   as the Kalman filter, the moving average filter and the local regression
   filter, are deployed. RESULTS: From the experimental data analysis, as
   the distance between the transmitter and the sensor of the EM tracking
   system increases, the trueness and precision tend to decrease. The
   system's trueness and jitter errors can be modeled as the 3rd order
   polynomial error equations. After minimizing the positional error and
   applying smoothing filters, the mean value of error reduction is 36.9\%.
   CONCLUSION: Our method can effectively reduce both positional systematic
   error and jitter error caused by EM field distortion. The method is
   successfully applied to calibrate an EM tracked surgical cautery tool.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA)
   approach applied to islanding detection study based on wide area PMU
   data. The increasing probability of uncontrolled islanding operation,
   according to many power system operators, is one of the biggest concerns
   with a large penetration of distributed renewable generation. The
   traditional islanding detection methods, such as RoCoF and vector shift,
   are however extremely sensitive and may result in many unwanted trips.
   The proposed probabilistic PCA aims to improve islanding detection
   accuracy and reduce the risk of unwanted tripping based on PMU
   measurements, while addressing a practical issue on missing data. The
   reliability and accuracy of the proposed probabilistic PCA approach are
   demonstrated using real data recorded in the UK power system by the
   OpenPMU project. The results show that the proposed methods can detect
   islanding accurately, without being falsely triggered by generation
   trips, even in the presence of missing values.}},

Abstract = {{Space-time block codes (STBCs) based single user multiplexing techniques
   are already part of the LTE standard. However, the rapid increase in
   demand for high speed and reliable communications is propelling us
   towards the next generation cellular networks. Multi-user MIMO based
   techniques are a promising candidate to meet this demand. In this paper,
   an STBC is designed for a multiuser MIMO system containing two users,
   transmitting independently. The transmission matrix is designed with the
   criterion of maximizing coding gain for the two users. Further, the
   proposed STBC enables independent decoding of symbols of both the users.
   A pair-wise maximum likelihood (ML) decoder for the proposed STBC is
   also derived. The performance of the proposed STBC is compared with the
   existing work and it is shown through simulations that the proposed code
   design performs significantly better than the existing STBC. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The difference between total suction of a Geosynthetic Clay Liner (GCL),
   at the as-manufactured moisture content, and that of the foundation soil
   (at field condition), on which the GCL sits, controls GCL hydration and
   determines its equilibrium moisture content. The variation in their
   suction properties with temperatures can be expected to be a key factor
   influencing GCL hydration as well as the equilibrium moisture content
   when lining systems are exposed to thermal cycles. The effect of cyclic
   heating and cooling on the variation of total suction of a foundation
   clayey soil was examined for various initial moisture contents. Changes
   in total suction were observed during both heating and cooling. At least
   two mechanisms were found to influence the response during both heating
   and cooling cycles. These mechanisms are temperature dependence of total
   suction and thermally induced moisture loss. The effects of these
   mechanisms are somewhat compensating during heating but are additive
   during cooling. This explains the significant increase in total suction
   observed during the cooling cycles.}},

Abstract = {{The Vapour Equilibrium Technique (VET) has gained popularity as a
   reliable method for controlling relative humidity as well as vapour
   suction in various porous media. In this study, super-saturated salt
   solutions were used to control Relative Humidity (RH) and to infer the
   water retention curve for a needle punched geosynthetic clay liner with
   respect to time under free swell and 20 kPa applied stress. Results
   showed that GCL sample RH plays a key role in moisture
   absorption/desorption behaviour and equilibration time when RH is in
   equilibrium with suction. Water absorption isotherms for the bentonite
   component of GCL agreed well with literature data. It was also observed
   that the effect of applied stress on water retention was more pronounced
   at high relative humidity and corresponding low suction. The results
   presented in this paper can help improve the understanding the water
   retention behaviour of GCLs in field applications such as waste

Abstract = {{In recent years, a number of extremum seeking algorithms have been
   proposed. While each approach aims to estimate the gradient of a
   performance metric in realtime and steer inputs to values that optimize
   the metric, the way in which each method accomplishes this goal can have
   practical implications that depend on the application.
   In this paper, we compare the performance of traditional
   perturbation-based extremum seeking to time-varying extremum seeking in
   the context of optimizing the energy efficiency of a vapor compression
   system. In order to benchmark these algorithms, we simulate their
   performance using a moving-boundary model of a vapor compression machine
   that has been tuned and calibrated to data gathered from a multi-split
   style room air conditioner operating in cooling mode. We show that while
   perturbation-based extremum seeking appears simplest to tune, some
   challenging minima are not obtained. Also, we find that time-varying
   extremum seeking converges faster and more reliably than the other
   method tested.}},

Abstract = {{The parametric identification of models with uncertain time-varying
   parameters, especially for nonlinear systems, remains an open field of
   research. The desirable performance of the system depends, to some
   extent, on the accuracy of parameter estimation. In this research, the
   concept of invariant manifold is used to find an implicit mapping from
   known variables of the system to the unknown variables (the unknown
   time-varying parameters). This mapping provides a parameter estimation
   update law, which has been shown to converge to the unknown parameter
   values. This method is easy to implement with only one tuning parameter.
   The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated with a
   simulation example.}},

Abstract = {{An adaptive secondary-side digital control is proposed for the series
   resonant converter to solve the loss of ZVS under certain input and load
   conditions, making it a good candidate for MHz 48V voltage regulators
   (VRs). By means of varying AC equivalent resistance, the output voltage
   regulation is achieved by controlling the duty cycle of the synchronous
   MOSFET. An additional control variable has added complexity to circuit
   analysis, modeling and controller design, since the state variables such
   as the inductor current and capacitor voltage are AC domain. A
   sine-cosine transformation is applied to these AC resonant state
   variables, correspondingly, the resonant circuit can be decomposed into
   two subcircuits under sine and cosine axes at each harmonics frequency
   of interest. The transformed state space model can be used for the large
   signal and small signal analysis for the series resonant converter with
   the secondary-side control. A power circuit is designed based on the
   large signal analysis and a feedback controller is designed based on the
   derived small signal model. Simulation and experimental results verify
   the validation of the design.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear inductors have wide applications in DC/DC converters. The
   multi-hole multi-permeability nonlinear inductors have been proved to
   have gradually changing widerange inductance curve while requiring no
   extra DC bias, which makes them suitable in various high efficiency
   DC/DC converters. This paper focuses on the design of such a multi-hole
   multi-permeability inductor. In the conventional design, complicated
   simulation needs to be executed when the coupling matrix among all the
   holes are taken into consideration. A dedicated model for calculating
   the inductance value is proposed in this paper to reduce the complexity.
   In the proposed model, the inductance simulation is simplified to
   calculating inductance of three basic units which are included in a
   nine-hole inductor. By simulating the nine-hole inductor, inductance of
   any rectangle shape multi-permeability nonlinear inductor with any
   number of evenly distributed holes on it can be calculated. Based on the
   proposed model, design guideline of the nonlinear inductor is also
   summarized. A sixteen-hole, two-permeability prototype is presented to
   demonstrate the design process according to the new model. The complete
   simulation and the test results are also provided to verify the model.
   The proposed model correlate with the simulation results very well.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional AC-DC driver circuits for Light-Emitting Diode (LED) lamps
   require large output capacitance across the LED load to minimize the low
   frequency current ripple. This large capacitance is usually achieved by
   using an electrolytic capacitor, which has a lifetime that is at least
   two times less than that of a LED device. To match the potential
   lifetime of the LEDs, a new isolated single switch AC-DC high power
   factor LED driver without any electrolytic capacitors is proposed in
   this paper. In the proposed circuit, the energy storage capacitor is
   moved to the rectifier side, with a three-winding transformer used to
   provide isolation; power factor correction as well as to store and
   provide the required energy to the output. As a result, the energy
   storage capacitance is significantly reduced, which allows film
   capacitor to replace the unreliable electrolytic capacitors. The
   circuit's operating principles and its characteristics are described in
   this paper. Simulation and experimental results confirm that a power
   factor of 0.96 is achieved on a 120V(rms), 12W prototype.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new technique for enhancement of energy extraction
   capabilities in wind energy conversion systems with low cut-in speed.
   The dc-link voltage is maintained by the grid-side converter in wind
   energy systems equipped with back-to-back three-phase inverters. This
   voltage is required to be higher than a certain value to ensure proper
   operation of the grid-side converter. On the other hand, at low
   generator voltages, switching times for the generator-side converter
   cannot be realized due to practical limitations. Accordingly, the system
   cannot harvest energy at low cut-in speeds. A power electronics system
   consisting of an isolated SEPIC converter along with an upper-hand
   control scheme has been introduced and employed to alleviate the
   aforementioned power extraction issue. The proposed solution, allows for
   excellent power extraction even at low cut-in speeds by maintaining an
   appropriate dc-link voltage at various operation conditions. Therefore
   increasing the overall renewable generation capability in wind-energy
   systems. The proposed solution can be incorporated in existing wind
   energy conversion systems with back-to-back three-phase inverters with
   slight hardware and software modifications. The integrated isolated
   SEPIC converter handles a fraction of the rated power, therefore leads
   to reduced cost and size compared to existing systems with integrated
   full-rated boost converters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel machine parameter independent control
   algorithm that enables wind turbines to quickly and effectively extract
   maximum power from the wind turbine under changing atmospheric
   conditions. The energy captured by a wind turbine varies due to
   variations in wind velocity, air density (influenced by temperature and
   humidity), turbine aerodynamics, and generator dynamics. Without power
   electronics and power extraction control techniques, wind systems have
   low power extraction efficiency. Given that the power from the wind
   turbine is dependent on generator rotor speed, the proposed algorithm
   indirectly uses the tip speed ratio (TSR) to assist in the maximum power
   point search (MPPS). The slope (or indirect TSR) assisted MPPS provides
   historic system state information and preempts misguided control
   decisions due to deceptive power readings caused by atmospheric changes.

Abstract = {{The ability of distributed generation sources to enhance the power
   quality of micro-grids is an important issue for the emerging power
   grid. This paper proposes a decentralized approach for power quality
   improvements in smart micro-grids. In this scheme, a modified
   reduced-order digital adaptive notch filter has been introduced and
   employed to extract the harmonic content of power system variables such
   as current or voltage. A universal digital power processor has been
   developed accordingly to intensify the power quality enhancement
   capabilities of distributed generation systems. The proposed technique
   allows for compensation of either particular unwanted frequency
   components or a wide range in the spectral content of the injected
   current. Current harmonics of non-linear local loads have been therefore
   compensated by the distributed generation source and a quality electric
   power is injected to the grid. Simulation results verify the accuracy
   and validity of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure, which
   requires efficacious percutaneous cement delivery via a cannulated
   needle to restore the strength and stiffness in osteoporotic vertebral
   bodies. Cement viscosity is understood to influence the injectability,
   cohesion and cement retention within the vertebral body. Altering the
   liquid to powder ratio modifies the viscosity of bone cement; however,
   the cement viscosity-response association between cement fill and
   augmentation of strength and stiffness is unknown. The aim of this study
   was to determine the relationship between viscosity, cement fill and the
   potential augmentation of strength and stiffness in an open pore foam
   structure that was representative of osteoporotic cancellous bone using
   an in vitro prophylactic vertebroplasty model. The results showed a
   strong linear correlation between compressive strength and stiffness
   augmentation with percentage cement fill, the extent of which was
   strongly dependent on the cement viscosity. Significant forces were
   required to ensure maximum delivery of the high viscosity cement using a
   proprietary screw-driven cement delivery technology. These forces could
   potentially exceed the normal human physical limit. Similar trends were
   observed when comparing the results from this study and previously
   reported cadaveric and animal based in vitro models.}},

Abstract = {{Copy and paste activities create clone groups in software systems. The
   evolution of a clone group across the history of a software system is
   termed as clone genealogy. During the evolution of a clone group,
   developers may change the location of the code fragments in the clone
   group. The type of the clone group may also change (e.g., from Type-1 to
   Type-2). These two phenomena have been referred to as clone migration
   and clone mutation respectively. Previous studies have found that clone
   migration occur frequently in software systems, and suggested that clone
   migration can induce faults in a software system. In this paper, we
   examine how clone migration phenomena affect the risk for faults in
   clone segments, clone groups, and clone genealogies from three
   long-lived software systems JBOSS, APACHE-ANT, and ARGOUML. Results show
   that: (1) migrated clone segments, clone groups, and clone genealogies
   are not equally fault-prone; (2) when a clone mutation occurs during a
   clone migration, the risk for faults in the migrated clone is increased;
   (3) migrating a clone that was not changed for a longer period of time
   is risky.}},

   cellular networks where the base stations (BSs) are equipped with
   hundreds of antennas, N, and communicate with tens of mobile stations

   paper, we consider the uplink of a single-cell massive MIMO system
   operating in sparse channels with limited scattering. This case is of
   particular importance in most propagation scenarios, where the prevalent
   Rayleigh fading assumption becomes idealistic. We derive analytical
   approximations for the achievable rates of maximum-ratio combining (MRC)
   and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers. Furthermore, we study the asymptotic
   behavior of the achievable rates for both MRC and ZF receivers, when N
   and K go to infinity under the condition that N/K -> c >= 1. Our results
   indicate that the achievable rate of MRC receivers reaches an asymptotic
   saturation limit, whereas the achievable rate of ZF receivers grows
   logarithmically with the number of MSs.}},

Abstract = {{Two-way relaying networks (TWRNs) allow for more bandwidth efficient use
   of the available spectrum since they allow for simultaneous information
   exchange between two users with the assistance of an intermediate relay
   node. However, due to superposition of signals at the relay node, the
   received signal at the user terminals is affected by multiple
   impairments, i.e., channel gains, timing offsets, and carrier frequency
   offsets, that need to be jointly estimated and compensated. This paper
   presents a training-based system model for amplify-and-forward (AF)
   TWRNs in the presence of multiple impairments and proposes maximum
   likelihood and differential evolution based algorithms for joint
   estimation of these impairments. The Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for
   the joint estimation of multiple impairments are derived. A minimum
   mean-square error based receiver is then proposed to compensate the
   effect of multiple impairments and decode each user's signal. Simulation
   results show that the performance of the proposed estimators is very
   close to the derived CRLBs at moderate-to-high signal-to-noise-ratios.
   It is also shown that the bit-error rate performance of the overall AF
   TWRN is close to a TWRN that is based on assumption of perfect knowledge
   of the synchronization parameters.}},

   particular, a tight lower bound and an asymptotic approximation for the

   that the channel is unknown at the transmitter and perfectly known at
   the receiver. Moreover, the effects of different system parameters,
   namely, transmit power, spectral efficiency (SE), and number of transmit
   and receive antennas, on the EE are analytically investigated. An
   important observation is that, in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime
   and with the other system parameters fixed, the optimal transmit power
   that maximizes the EE increases as the Ricean-K factor increases. On the
   contrary, the optimal SE and the optimal number of transmit antennas

Abstract = {{Rate adaptation which adjusts the transmission rate based on channel
   quality, plays a key role in the performance of 802.11 networks and is
   critical for achieving high throughput. Traditional statistics-based
   methods for rate adaptation are unsuited for mobility scenarios because
   of the delay involved in statistics gathering. Methods based on channel
   state information (CSI) perform better but still fall short of optimal
   performance in high mobility. In this paper, we consider adaptive
   modulation based on Slepian channel prediction as a basis for rate
   adaptation in high mobility scenarios. Our proposed method utilizes
   lowcomplexity projection on a subspace spanned by discrete prolate
   spheroidal (DPS) sequences. These sequences are simultaneously
   bandlimited and highly energy concentrated, and they can be used to
   obtain a minimum energy bandlimited extension of a finite sequence.
   Using the predicted channel coefficients, we select the modulation
   scheme resulting in the highest expected throughput. Unlike Wiener
   prediction, the proposed method does not require detailed knowledge of
   the channel correlation, but only of the Doppler bandwidth. Our
   numerical results show that adaptive modulation based on the
   low-complexity Slepian prediction is substantially better than using
   outdated CSI and performs very close to Wiener prediction.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of detecting an abrupt change in a sequence of independent
   and identically distributed (IID) random variables is addressed.
   Sequentially received samples are IID both before and after a single
   unknown change time. Unlike previous approaches to change detection that
   assume a known probability density function (PDF) for the observations
   at the start, the problem formulated here is to detect a change between
   two given PDFs in either direction, meaning that at any given time the
   number of hypotheses to be tracked is always twice the number of samples
   received. A Bayesian multiple hypothesis approach is proposed and shown
   to have the following properties: (i) unlike previous tests that operate
   with a threshold, the minimum-cost hypothesis is tracked through time,
   including that of no change. (ii) under an exponential delay cost
   function and suitable parameter choices, the proposed procedure's
   probability of detecting a change in the incorrect direction
   asymptotically vanishes with time, (iii) the method is recursive with
   constant computation per unit time, and (iv) error probabilities may be
   directly traded off with average delay. Performance results using
   simulation confirm the derived properties and also reveal that the
   additional average delay after a transient period corresponding to when
   the starting state is uncertain, compared to that of the optimal
   one-sided test, CUSUM, is modest.}},

Abstract = {{The age hardening response of a quasi-binary Al-Mg2Si alloy was studied
   using activation distance analysis of precise strain rate sensitivity
   experiments at 78 and 300K. The alloy of
   Al-0.7Mg-0.33Si-0.024Fe-0.006Ti(at.\%) has a stochiometrically balanced
   composition of Mg2Si. The alloy was solutionized at 550 degrees C and
   ice water quenched before ageing in one of two ways: single-step or
   multi-step ageing. For single-step ageing: specimens were naturally aged
   for 70 days at room temperature (RT); pre-aged for 16 hours at 70
   degrees C; or artificially aged for 30 min or 10 hours at 175 degrees C.
   For multi-step ageing: specimens were pre-aged at 70 degrees C for 16
   hours after natural ageing for 70 days at RT; artificially aged for 30
   min or 10 hours at 175 degrees C after pre-aging at 70 degrees C for 16

   aging for 70 days at RT. The activation analysis reveals rate
   controlling obstacle dimensions ranging from 0.3 to 10 nm depending upon

   The static recovery of dislocation density was fit to the models of Nes
   {[}Acta Metall. Mater. 43 (1995) 2189-2207], suggesting that recovery is
   controlled by the migration of jogged screw dislocations assuming no
   lateral drift during annealing. The model fit of isothermal annealing at
   175 degrees C and 205 degrees C yields activation energies of 0.99 and
   1.7 eV/at., respectively. The change in energies can be correlated to an
   observed change in lattice strain with recovery.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is intended as a contribution towards the development of
   better predictors of the geometric characteristics of alternate bars.
   The specific objective of the paper is to introduce a new equation for
   alternate bar length. It is assumed that the bars are formed under a
   steady and uniform flow; the bed is flat at the beginning of the
   experiment; the stage of interest is that where bars have grown to their
   fully developed state. The present equation is derived on the basis of
   dimensional considerations and all the data available to the authors;
   bars produced under different regimes of the turbulent flow are treated
   separately. Accordingly, the equation takes different forms depending on
   the flow regime. It is shown that the present equation produces better
   estimates of bar length than previous equations for rough turbulent
   flows as well as flows in the transitional regime of turbulent flow,
   with a marked improvement for the case of the transitional regime.}},

Abstract = {{As the designers of modern automotive turbochargers strive to increase
   map width and lower the mass flow rate at which compressor surge occurs,
   the recirculating flows at the impeller inlet are becoming a much more
   relevant aerodynamic feature. Compressors with relatively large map
   widths tend to have very large recirculating regions at the inlet when
   operating close to surge; these regions greatly affect the expected
   performance of the compressor.
   This study analyses the inlet recirculation region numerically using
   several modern automotive turbocharger centrifugal compressors. Using 3D
   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and a single passage model, the point
   at which the recirculating flow begins to develop and the rate at which
   it grows are investigated. All numerical modelling has been validated
   using measurements taken from hot gas stand tests for all compressor
   stages. The paper improves upon an existing correlation between the rate
   of development of the recirculating region and the compressor stage,
   which is supported by results from the numerical analysis.}},

   blades, which include flow acceleration and deceleration. Two issues are
   addressed: (1) accurately predicting roughness effects, and (2)
   evaluating the performance of Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)
   simulations on moderately accelerating flows. For the present turbine
   surfaces, it is found that roughness correlations based on roughness
   surface slope better predict the roughness effects than both the
   correlations based on the moments of roughness height statistics and the
   IEC standard approach. It is shown that RANS simulations reproduce the
   flow evolution over rough-wall accelerating turbulent boundary layers,
   although, on a smooth wall, they fail to capture strong non-equilibrium
   flow behaviours. Finally, a hydraulic turbine simulation is performed to
   show the significant roughness impact on the total losses.}},

   winds from a local meteorological station. Wave simulations in the
   Kingston Basin were better represented using the GLCFS boundary forcing
   into a model domain of the Kingston Basin; whereas, a model domain that
   covered all of Lake Ontario yielded a better representation of flows
   with reasonable wave results. For five storm events that were simulated,
   approximately 80\% of the wave energy outside the Kingston Basin entered
   the basin after crossing the Duck-Galloo Ridge. Flows throughout the
   basin showed a complex circulation pattern that is defined by both the
   forcing and the topographical features including islands, shoals and
   deep channels. The complex circulation within the basin is composed of
   several wind-driven gyres which are magnified during storm events. The
   impact of waves on the circulation patterns at the basin scale is
   negligible, since shoals are typically too deep (e.g. 20 m) relative to
   the wavelength and period (e.g. 7-10 s) to generate large-scale
   wave-driven flows. In general, the modeling system was successful in
   reproducing the waves and currents in eastern Lake Ontario and can be
   used for future engineering-type studies such as offshore wind farm
   impact assessment. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes

Abstract = {{End-users often have to enter the same information to various services
   (e.g., websites and mobile applications) repetitively. To save end-users
   from typing redundant information, it becomes more convenient for an
   end-user if the previous inputs of the end-user can be pre-filled to
   applications based on end-user's contexts. The existing pre-filling
   approaches have poor accuracy of pre-filling information, and only
   provide limited support of reusing user inputs within one application
   and propagating the inputs across different applications. The existing
   approaches do not distinguish parameters, however different user input
   parameters can have very varied natures. Some parameters should be
   pre-filled and some should not. In this paper, we propose an ontology
   model to express the common parameters and the relations among them and
   an approach using the ontology model to address the shortcomings of the
   existing pre-filling techniques. The basis of our approach is to
   categorize the input parameters based on their characteristics. We
   propose categories for user inputs parameters to explore the types of
   parameters suitable for pre-filling. Our empirical study shows that the
   proposed categories successfully cover all the parameters in a
   representative corpus. The proposed approach achieves an average
   precision of 75\% and an average recall of 45\% on the category
   identification for parameters. Compared with a baseline approach, our
   approach can improve the existing pre-filling approach, i.e., 19\%
   improvement on precision on average.}},

Abstract = {{The number of mobile applications has increased drastically in the past
   few years. Some applications are superior to the others in terms of
   user-perceived quality. User-perceived quality can be defined as the
   user's opinion of a product. For mobile applications, it can be
   quantified by the number of downloads and ratings. Earlier studies
   suggested that user interface (UI) barriers (i.e., input or output
   challenges) can affect the user-perceived quality of mobile
   applications. In this paper, we explore the relation between UI
   complexity and user-perceived quality in Android applications.
   Furthermore, we strive to provide guidelines for the proper amount of UI
   complexity that helps an application achieve high user-perceived quality
   through an empirical study on 1,292 mobile applications in 8 different
   categories.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a promising solution to the problem of the bad
   environmental impacts and the high operating cost of the Internal
   Combustion Engine (ICE) gasoline powered vehicles. In Toronto, the
   capital of Ontario, the traffic jam is becoming a regular flavor of
   every day's commute that make the driving pattern featured with low
   speed and a lot of stops and goes. This driving pattern increases the
   pollution problem that already exists due to the large number of
   vehicles in Toronto streets and reduces the lifetime of the engine and
   the brakes leading to a more running cost. This study investigates the
   performance of a hybrid Fuel Cell (FC)/battery vehicle configuration,
   which is considered as one of the most promising clean vehicles in
   comparison with the traditional ICE vehicles. In this study, a model of
   an ICE mid-size vehicle was developed and validated against experimental
   acceleration tests. The ICE vehicle model was modified by replacing the
   ICE power-train with a FC and battery power-train while keeping the
   other vehicle parameters the same. A comparison between ICE and hybrid
   FC/battery vehicle configurations was conducted using a representative
   alignment load cycle in Toronto. It was found that the hybrid FC/battery
   configuration is much better than the ICE version in terms of emission,
   fuel economy, efficiency and speed tracking error due to the faster
   response of the control system.}},

Abstract = {{The flows in the human upper airway and human heart during open heart
   surgery are considered. Beginning with idealized models of the human
   upper airway, current methods to extract realistic airway geometries
   using a novel implementation of optical coherent tomography modality are
   introduced. Complementary direct numerical simulations are considered
   that will assist in pre-surgery planning for obstructive sleep apnea.
   Cardiac air bubbles often arise during open heart surgery. These bubbles
   are potential emboli that can cause neurological impairment and even
   death. An experimental programme is outlined that uses acoustic sound to
   instil bubble surface oscillations that result in bubble breakup. A
   novel algorithm is introduced that enables a surgical team to obtain
   real-time in-vivo bubble data to aid cardiac de-airation procedures.}},

Abstract = {{We present a fully-distributed self-healing algorithm DEX that maintains
   a constant degree expander network in a dynamic setting. To the best of
   our knowledge, our algorithm provides the first efficient distributed
   construction of expanders - whose expansion properties hold
   deterministically - that works even under an all-powerful adaptive
   adversary that controls the dynamic changes to the network (the
   adversary has unlimited computational power and knowledge of the entire
   network state, can decide which nodes join and leave and at what time,
   and knows the past random choices made by the algorithm). Previous
   distributed expander constructions typically provide only probabilistic
   guarantees on the network expansion which rapidly degrade in a dynamic
   setting; in particular, the expansion properties can degrade even more
   rapidly under adversarial insertions and deletions.
   Our algorithm provides efficient maintenance and incurs a low overhead
   per insertion/deletion by an adaptive adversary: only O(logn) rounds and
   O(logn) messages are needed with high probability (n is the number of
   nodes currently in the network). The algorithm requires only a constant
   number of topology changes. Moreover, our algorithm allows for an
   efficient implementation and maintenance of a distributed hash table
   (DHT) on top of DEX with only a constant additional overhead.
   Our results are a step towards implementing efficient selfhealing
   networks that have guaranteed properties (constant bounded degree and
   expansion) despite dynamic changes.}},

Abstract = {{Increased wireless network intelligence and interference awareness
   enabled by cognitive radio can lead to improved spectrum utilization and
   network performance. Using a cognitive radio platform developed by
   Communication Research Centre Canada (CRC), in this work we propose and
   implement a novel Dynamic Channel Selection (DCS) algorithm for a
   network of sectorized WiFi cells. The proposed algorithm leverages the
   ability of underlying cognitive radio platform to continuously monitor
   and identify Win interference sources and relieves the network operator
   of having to manually configure and update the channels across the
   network.
   The algorithm's performance is evaluated using field experiments in both
   rural and urban environments which demonstrate significant improvement
   in terms of spectrum efficiency as well as robustness to variations in
   the interference. The main contributions of this work include the
   proposed DCS algorithm as well as offering a prime example of cognitive
   radio's potential in practical deployments. In addition, an overview of
   the CORAL platform summarizing its major components and capabilities is

Abstract = {{The proton transport property of Nafion nanothin films (4-300 nm) has
   been investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using
   interdigitated array (IDA) of gold electrodes on SiO2 substrate. The
   proton conductivity has been investigated as a function of film
   drying/heating protocol, relative humidity, temperature and film
   thickness. It is found that the film treatment protocol makes a
   difference in film transport property. Ultimately, the proton
   conductivity and capacitance of the Nafion nanothin film is
   thickness-dependent, where the former decreased and the latter increased
   exponentially with decreasing film thickness. Moreover, the activation
   energy increased exponentially with decreasing film thickness. The
   proton conductivity of the thin films of Nafion is significantly lower
   than that of the membrane counterpart regardless of the thickness, which
   is consistent with the high activation energy found in the thin films.
   These differences are likely related to the polymer confinement and
   morphological differences between the thin films and the freestanding
   membrane. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS. All rights reserved.}},

   (amphibolite, gneiss and marble) has been studied based on around 60
   compressive uniaxial and triaxial strength tests. The results have been
   interpreted to obtain peak and residual strength, and post-peak
   parameters. Particular attention has been given to the study of
   dilation. The dilation angle of these intact rocks has been fitted to
   recently developed models for plastic shear strain and
   confinement-stress-dependent dilation. Even if the dilative response of
   these rocks has shown to follow similar trends to those observed in
   other hard rocks, in the case of foliated ones the peak dilation angle
   attain is not as high as that of more homogeneous (granite, marble).
   This is attributed to the fact that the final fracturing of the samples
   partially follows already existing weakness planes, which show less
   dilation than newly developed shear bands.}},

Abstract = {{In order to determine relevant post-yield parameters for behaviour
   modelling applications, accurate estimates of irrecoverable strains from
   laboratory tests are required. In this study, samples of Blanco Mera
   granite were tested using a large number of loading-unloading cycles
   prior to the attainment of peak strength to allow for the determination
   of irrecoverable strains. Two different strain-measurement setups were
   tested for comparison. The irrecoverable strain points in
   volumetric-axial strain space were corrected to account for non-zero
   stresses in the ``unloaded{''} states, and also to remove the unwanted
   effects of crack closure. These strain loci were then compared to those
   calculated by subtracting elastic strains calculated using both a
   constant and a variable Poisson's ratio. The plastic strain curves were
   found to be slightly different, with the curve calculated based on a
   constant Poisson's ratio predicting the greatest volumetric strains and
   the most conservative (largest) dilation angle values. The corrected
   cycle data appears to agree very closely with the curve calculated based
   on a variable Poisson's ratio, and roughly fits a previously proposed
   dilatancy model. Since continuum models cannot handle the large
   Poisson's ratio values observed following the onset of unstable
   cracking, however, it is recommended that a dilation model calculated
   based on the constant Poisson's ratio be used for numerical modelling
   applications. Finite difference modelling was performed to evaluate the
   sensitivity of excavation displacement predictions to the interpretation
   of the laboratory test plastic volumetric strain curves. The higher
   dilatancy models produced more conservative displacement estimates, and
   these were closer to those predicted using a model with lower dilatancy
   but a variable Poisson's ratio. In general, the models were found to be
   relatively insensitive to the initial dilation angle in cases where the
   transition from the initial dilation angle to the consistent decay phase
   occurred at small plastic strains (<2 mstrain).}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a nonparametric approach to multiscale segmentation of
   images using a hierarchical matrix analysis framework called diffusion
   wavelets. This approach benefits from the advantages of both graph
   theory and wavelet transform. Till now a broad range of multiscale
   transforms like wavelets (and other x-lets) have been introduced for
   image segmentation task. The graph theoretic formulation of grouping is
   also well-known to deal with this problem. The combination of multiscale
   transforms and graph based partitioning results in a scale-spectral
   method exploring through different scales of the image, over a great
   deal of spectral methods in graph partitioning. The method constructs
   multiscale basis functions and a series of dilation and
   orthogonalizations build a hierarchy, automatically. At each level, a
   set of basis functions is built by applying dyadic powers of a diffusion
   operator on the bases at the lower level. Two approaches are proposed
   for multiscale segmentation of images using diffusion wavelets. The
   first method is based on extended bases functions at each level and
   designing a competition between the bases value for partitioning. The
   second approach is defining a new distance for each level and clustering
   based on such distances.}},

Abstract = {{Microarray technology has become a power tool in the field of
   bioinformatics. It is used to measure gene expression levels and similar
   to any other image capturing processes is prone to noise. There are
   different kinds of noise, during preparation, hybridization and scanning
   in microarray images which usually are modeled by Gaussian noise. Since
   introduction of wavelets in 1970s, many more forms and extensions of
   this transform have been developed and used, such as stationary wavelet
   transform (SWT), complex wavelet transform (CWT), curvelet transform
   (CURV) and contourlet transform (CNT). By developing of more sparse
   transforms, it is important to have a perspective of how efficient the
   transforms are in different applications, such as microarray image
   analysis. In this paper, we compare the efficiency of common sparse
   transforms including ordinary discrete wavelet transform (DWT), SWT,
   CWT, CURV, CNT, Contourlet-SD decomposition, steerable pyramid (STP) and
   shearlet transform (SHR) for microarray image denoising. Therefore after
   converting microarray image into x-let transform, BayesShrink method,
   soft and hard thresholding are used to perform denoising of these
   images. Both local and general thresholds are calculated for each
   subband in order to evaluate the effect of incorporating intrascale
   dependency on top of sparsity property in statistical modeling of
   x-let's coefficients. Our simulation results show that CWT and SHR
   outperforms the others when using global thresholding and SWT is the
   preferred transform when using local thresholding. Although STP and SHR
   have better performance for some criteria like structural similarity
   (SSIM) index, but CWT is faster.}},

Abstract = {{The broad topic of efficiency is investigated within the context of the
   general manufacturing sector, which includes anything from computing and
   electronics to food and textile products, and consumes enormous amounts
   of energy in order to generate the goods and services we use today. This
   is unsurprising as it stands to reason that in order to operate the
   necessary equipment and facilities to produce these products a
   significant amount of energy and resources must be expended. However,
   most manufacturing facilities are not operated at a highly efficient
   rate, in terms of both waste heat and materials. As a result, a number
   of opportunities exist to develop a more efficient, sustainable general
   manufacturing sector.
   This topic has been well researched in the past in terms of the losses
   encountered during various general manufacturing process streams,
   however, less literature exists which attempts to outline an appropriate
   efficiency loss mitigation strategy for companies to implement. In fact,
   the Trottier Energy Futures Project, which is, in collaboration with the
   David Suzuki Foundation, creating an energy roadmap for Canada, has
   devoted one of its eleven key challenges for creating a more
   sustainable, low-carbon future for Canada to general manufacturing
   efficiency improvement. This paper will discuss appropriate efficiency
   loss mitigation strategies for companies. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper offers a contribution to contemporary studies of spatial
   planning. In particular, it problematises the relationship between
   neoliberal competitiveness and spatial planning. Neoliberal
   competitiveness is a hegemonic discourse in public policy as it
   (allegedly) provides the `path to economic nirvana'. However,
   commentators have critiqued its theoretical underpinnings and labelled
   it a `dangerous obsession' for policy makers. Another set of literatures
   argues that spatial planning can be understood as a form of `neoliberal
   spatial governance' and read in a `postpolitical' framework that
   `privileges competitiveness'. Synthesising these debates this paper
   critically analyses the application and operationalisation of neoliberal
   competitiveness in Northern Ireland and Belfast. In focusing on this
   unique case study-a deeply divided society with a turbulent history-the
   paper takes the debate forward in arguing that rather than offering the
   `path to economic nirvana' neoliberal competitiveness is a
   `postpolitical strategy' and represents a `dangerous obsession' for
   spatial planning.}},

Abstract = {{Population based heuristic optimization techniques, though powerful, are
   often limited by the memory size of hardware context when implemented on
   micro-controllers, embedded systems and commercial robots platforms etc.
   On the other hand, the teaching-learning based optimization algorithm
   (TLBO) is a recently proposed algorithm of high performance on both
   constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. In this paper, a
   new compact teaching-learning based optimization algorithm (cTLBO) is
   proposed to combine the strength of the original TLBO and reduce the
   memory requirement through a compact structure that utilizes an adaptive
   statistic description to replace the process of a population of
   solutions. Numerical results on test benchmark functions show that the
   new algorithm does not sacrifice the efficiency within the limited
   hardware resources.}},

Abstract = {{The background to and outcomes of the Environmental Monitoring Programme
   (EMP) required by statutory regulators for the deployment of the SeaGen
   tidal turbine in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, an area with many
   conservation designations, are described. The EMP, which was set within
   the context of an adaptive management approach, considered possible
   effects of the device on local populations of seals and harbour
   porpoises, representative seabirds and benthic communities. The studies
   on seals were carried out on both local and regional scales. The
   ecological studies were complemented by detailed field and hydrodynamic
   modelling investigations together with a programme of mitigation
   measures designed to reduce collisions between seals and turbine rotors.
   In general only minor statistically significant changes in abundance,
   distribution and animal behaviour patterns were recorded, principally
   associated with small distributional shifts close to the turbine
   structure and with the likelihood that these changes were ecologically
   of little significance. The seal-rotor collision mitigation studies
   provided a base for the establishment of acceptable collision risk
   strategies. The EMP highlighted observational, methodological and
   statistical challenges in assessing the environmental consequences of
   marine energy devices. A brief review of related studies in Strangford
   Lough is included.}},

Title = {{Design of Multijunction Photovoltaic Cells Optimized for Varied
   Atmospheric Conditions}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHOTOENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Band gap engineering provides an opportunity to not only provide higher
   overall conversion efficiencies of the reference AM1.5 spectra but also
   customize PV device design for specific geographic locations and
   microenvironments based on atmospheric conditions characteristic to that
   particular location. Indium gallium nitride and other PV materials offer
   the opportunity for limited bandgap engineering to match spectra. The
   effects of atmospheric conditions such as aerosols, cloud cover, water
   vapor, and air mass have been shown to cause variations in spectral
   radiance that alters PV system performance due to both overrating and
   underrating. Designing PV devices optimized for spectral radiance of a
   particular region can result in improved PV system performance. This
   paper presents a new method for designing geographically optimized PV
   cells with using a numerical model for bandgap optimization. The
   geographic microclimate spectrally resolved solar flux for twelve
   representative atmospheric conditions for the incident radiation angle
   (zenith angle) of 48.1 degrees and fixed array angle of 40 degrees is
   used to iteratively optimize the band gap for tandem, triple, and
   quad-layer of InGaN-based multijunction cells. The results of this
   method are illustrated for the case study of solar farms in the New York
   region and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{New porous macromolecular frameworks (PMFs) have been designed and
   prepared by the condensation of dialdehydes with aminoacrylonitriles.
   Two porous materials were prepared by reacting
   3,3'-benzene-1,4-diylbis(3-aminoprop-2-enenitrile) with
   benzene-1,4-dicarbaldehyde and biphenyl-4,4'-dicarbaldehyde to give
   PMF-NOTT-1 and PMF-NOTT-2, respectively. Adsorption and desorption
   studies of N-2 (77 K) and CO2 (273-303 K and 20 bar) were used to
   characterize the porosity of these materials. CO2 adsorption
   measurements indicate that these PMFs have similar porosity with
   Dubinin-Radushkevich micropore volumes of 0.142 and 0.144 cm(3) g(-1)
   and CO2 surface excess uptakes of 28.4 and 28.9 wt\% at 20 bar, 273 K
   for PMF-NOTT-1 and PMF-NOTT-2, respectively. The isosteric heats of
   adsorption for CO2 at zero surface coverage were 31.9 kJ mol(-1) (for
   PMF-NOTT-1) and 33.1 kJ mol(-1) (for PMF-NOTT-2). However, N2 adsorption
   studies at 77 K indicated that PMF-NOTT-2 shows activated diffusion
   effects due to the presence of some narrow ultramicroporosity. The
   conjugated systems of these frameworks can be reversibly switched by
   varying proton concentration in solution and these materials thus
   demonstrate halochromic properties. PMF-NOTT-1, constructed from shorter
   building blocks than PMF-NOTT-2, exhibits higher catalytic activity and
   selectivity in Knoevenagel condensation reactions of malononitrile with
   benzaldehydes. The advantages of using PMFs as catalysts or adsorbents
   are their excellent thermal and chemical stabilities and they can be
   recovered and regenerated for re-use.}},

   x(3) has the most significant linear and quadratic effects on the EE of
   KO and a bilinear effect with x(1), whereas x(2) did not have any
   significant effect. The optimal conditions for a 92\% of EE were: 1.75:1
   for RCW, 3.8 for pH and 3 for SP. The microcapsules, formed by complex

Abstract = {{Biaxial stretching of melt mixed high density polyethylene
   (HDPE)/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanocomposites was conducted
   in the melt state at different stretching ratios (SRs). The addition of
   MWCNTs leads to significant strain hardening in the HDPE, greatly
   improving the stability and thus processability of the stretching
   process. Scanning electron microscopy shows that the MWCNTs in the
   polymer matrix are gradually disentangled and randomly oriented in the
   stretching plane with increasing SRs. All the stretched samples exhibit
   an increase in crystallinity (about 10\%) due to strain induced
   crystallization and a broadened distribution of crystallite size
   according to the XRD and DSC results. The mechanical properties of the
   composites improve with increasing SRs, while they drop off after a SR
   of 2.5 for the neat HDPE which is likely to be due to the relaxation of
   polymer chains prior to solidification. The presence of the MWCNTs
   appears to inhibit this relaxation thus helping to maintain the
   orientation and mechanical properties at high SRs. The modulus, yield
   strength and breaking strength of stretched composites with 8 wt\%
   MWCNTs increase by approximately 54\%, 85\% and 193\% respectively
   compared with the neat HDPE at a SR of 3. The electrical percolation
   threshold for the unstretched material occurs at 1.9 wt\% MWCNTs. As SR
   increases, the values of critical concentration increase from 1.9 wt\%
   to 4.9 wt\% implying the destruction of conductive networks due to an
   increased inter-particle distance. A loading of 6 wt\% MWCNTs is
   sufficient to ensure that the sheet conductivity is robust to changes in
   the SR. Decreased values of critical exponent from 1.9 to 1.1 and
   morphological investigation reveal a transformation of the system
   structure from three dimensional to two dimensional as SR increases.}},

Abstract = {{To better manage infrastructure assets as they reach the end of their
   service lives, quantitative data is required to better assess structural
   behavior and allow for more informed decision making. Distributed fiber
   optic strain sensors are one sensing technology that could provide
   comprehensive data for use in structural assessments as these systems
   potentially allow for strain to be measured with the same accuracy and
   gage lengths as conventional strain sensors. However, as with many
   sensor technologies, temperature can play an important role in terms of
   both the structure's and sensor's performance. To investigate this issue
   a fiber optic distributed strain sensor system was installed on a
   section of a two span reinforced concrete bridge on the TransCanada
   Highway. Strain data was acquired several times a day as well as over
   the course of several months to explore the effects of changing
   temperature on the data. The results show that the strain measurements
   are affected by the bridge behavior as a whole. The strain measurements
   due to temperature are compared to strain measurements that were taken
   during a load test on the bridge. The results show that even a small
   change in temperature can produce crack width and strain changes similar
   to those due to a fully loaded transport truck. Future directions for
   research in this area are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{A modeling framework for the numerical reconstruction of the
   microstructure of infiltrated electrodes is presented in this study. A
   particle-based sedimentation algorithm is used to generate the backbone,
   while a novel packing algorithm is used to randomly infiltrate
   nanoparticles on the surface of backbone particles. The effective
   properties, such as the connected triple-phase boundary length, the
   effective conductivity, the effective diffusivity, are evaluated on the
   reconstructed electrodes by using geometric analysis, finite volume and
   random-walk methods, and reported in dimensionless form to provide
   generality to the results. A parametric study on the effect of the main
   model and operating parameters is performed. Simulations show that the
   critical loading (i.e., the percolation threshold) increases as the
   backbone porosity decreases and the nanoparticle diameter increases.
   Large triple-phase boundary length, specific surface area and good
   effective conductivity can be reached by infiltration, without
   detrimental effects on the effective transport properties in gas phase.
   Simulations reveal a significant sensitivity to the size and contact
   angle of infiltrated particles, suggesting that the preparation process
   of infiltrated electrodes should be properly tailored in order to obtain
   the optimized structures predicted by the model. (C) The Author(s) 2014.

   exposed to a shear rate of 300 s(-1) for 2 hours at 37 degrees C on
   ELP1- and ELP4-coated polyethylene terephthalate (Mylar T) surfaces in a
   cone and plate device. Scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry
   were used to measure leukocyte activation and platelet-leukocyte
   aggregation in response to the ELP1 and ELP4 coatings on the surface and
   in the bulk, respectively. Surface analysis showed little leukocyte
   activity on the surface of uncoated positive controls. Both the tissue
   factor (TF) expression (indicative of leukocyte activation) and CD61
   expression (indicative of platelet-leukocyte aggregates), in the bulk
   were decreased by 40\% and 20\%, respectively, with the ELP coating of
   Mylar T, while a two- to three-fold increase in CD11b upregulation
   (indicative of leukocyte activation) for ELP1 and ELP4 was determined.
   Two of three bulk markers indicated that ELP-coated Mylar T decreased

   third, CD11b, indicated an increase in leukocyte response to the ELP

Abstract = {{Energy performance and indoor environment including human thermal
   comfort and indoor air quality of the passive school buildings should be
   particularly paid more attentions due to the school buildings adopted
   novel heat recovery ventilation facility and air heating system. Heat
   recovery efficiency of the heat recovery facility and energy
   conservation ratio of the air conditioning unit were analytically
   modeled, taking the ventilation network into account. Following that,
   classroom displacement ventilation and its thermal stratification have
   been investigated. Representative human thermal comfort parameters,
   percentage dissatisfied, and temperature difference between ankle and
   head have been analyzed and evaluated after steady air flow and thermal
   dispersion in one typical winter day of Munich was numerically simulated
   by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology. Indoor air
   quality indicated by the CO2 concentration was also investigated in
   terms of different levels of mechanical ventilation flow rate. Numerical
   results indicate that the promotion of mechanical ventilation rate can
   simultaneously enhance the dilution of indoor air pollutants and the
   non-uniformity of indoor pollutant distributions. Displacement
   ventilated pollutant stratifications, demonstrated by the spatial mean
   CO2 concentration and their normalized standard deviations, could
   provide generally satisfactory indoor air quality in the occupant
   regions. Subsequent energy performance analysis illuminates that
   classroom energy demands for ventilation and heating could be decreased
   with the promotion of heat recovery efficiency of the ventilation
   facility, and the energy conservation ratio of the air heating unit
   could be enhanced with the decreasing temperature difference between the
   supplying air and fresh air when the heat recovery efficiency of the
   ventilation facility is a constant. Detailed correlations of heat
   recovery ventilation and heating energy conservation have been
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the removal of arsenite, As(III), and arsenate, As(V),
   from aqueous solutions onto thermally processed dolomite (charred
   dolomite) via microcolumn was evaluated. The effects of mass of
   adsorbent (0.5-2 g), initial arsenic concentration (50-2000 ppb) and
   particle size (<0.355-2 mm) on the adsorption capacity of charred
   dolomite in a microcolumn were investigated. It was found that the
   adsorption of As(V) and As(III) onto charred dolomite exhibited a
   characteristic `S' shape. The adsorption capacity increased as the
   initial arsenic concentration increased. A slow decrease in the column
   adsorption capacity was noted as the particle size increased from >0.335
   to 0.710-2.00 mm. For the binary system, the experimental data show that

Abstract = {{The variance of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD; dioxin) and
   polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF; furan) data obtained from single-
   and simultaneous multiple train methods was compared. Single train
   triplicate data were used from 4 stack tests obtained from a long dry
   kiln cement plant and 18 stack tests from a municipal solid waste (MSW)
   incinerator. Data from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
   (ASME) report Reference Method Accuracy and Precision (ReMAP) (Lanier
   and Hendrix, 2001) were used for the simultaneous multiple samples,
   which accounted for 27 data points. Nineteen data points were acquired
   from an ASME research facility, 5 from a MSW incinerator unrelated to
   the single train MSW incinerator, and 3 from a lightweight aggregate
   kiln (LWAK). The ReMAP procedure was used to determine the relationship
   between the standard deviation and the concentration of the single train
   and simultaneous multiple train data. Results indicated that there was
   benefit from the use of simultaneous multiple train sampling for
   concentrations above 129 pg toxic equivalency (TEQ)/m3. There was no
   indication of benefit from the use of simultaneous multiple train
   sampling at concentrations below 129 pg TEQ/m3.
   Implications: Precision of stack sampling data can be the difference
   between meeting and failing compliance limits. Generally, three
   dioxin/furan samples are acquired when stack sampling to meet compliance
   regulations. A reliable estimation of the data's true concentration is
   not possible with this small amount of data. Increasing the precision
   decreases the chance that the acquired concentration deviates greatly
   from the true concentration. Facilities that use the appropriate stack
   sampling method will benefit by either improved data precision or
   minimal stack sampling expenses. The observations made suggest that
   facilities that are expected to have dioxin/furan concentrations above
   129 pg TEQ/m3 would increase the precision of samples by using
   simultaneous multiple train sampling.}},

Abstract = {{A combination of decentralized Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC)
   and Feedback Linearization (FL) is implemented on a team of quadrotor
   aircraft in order to accomplish dynamic encirclement around a stationary
   target in real-time. Dynamic encirclement is defined as the situation in
   which a target is isolated and surrounded by an Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle
   (UAV) team in order to maintain awareness and containment of it. In this
   paper, the problem of maintaining a desired radius of encirclement,
   individual angular velocities and angular separation between team
   members is considered. The nonlinear plant, representing each vehicle's
   autonomous behaviour, is obtained through system identification and then
   linearized using an FL technique. Due to complex flight variables and
   multi-vehicle cooperation, LMPC is the most suited controller for
   solving the problem of dynamic encirclement on real-world platforms. The
   contribution of this paper lay in the application of decentralized LMPC
   and FL to the problem of encirclement using an autonomous team of
   Qball-X4 quadrotors in real-time.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate navigation systems are of great importance in intelligent
   transportation systems and modern connected vehicles technology.
   Commonly, Global Positioning System (GPS) is integrated with inertial
   navigation systems (INS) and other sensors to provide robust navigation
   solution. Currently, the dominant systems integration approach for
   multi-sensor integrated navigation is Kalman Filter (KF) or Particle
   Filter (PF). However, KF and PF enhance accuracy only when GPS updates
   are frequent and accurate enough. During GPS long outages, these
   integration approaches fail to sustain reliable performance. For these
   reasons, this work introduces a new systems integration approach that
   based on a nonlinear systems identification technique called Fast
   Orthogonal Search (FOS). FOS is a general purpose nonlinear systems
   modelling method that can model complex nonlinearities. In this work,
   FOS is proposed to enhance integrated navigation systems performance
   during long GPS outages. The proposed integration approach is applied on
   a low-cost 3D land-vehicle multi-sensors navigation system consists of
   GPS receiver, two horizontal low-cost MEMS-grade accelerometers, single
   vertical MEMS gyroscope, and the vehicle odometer. The validation of the
   proposed methodology is verified over real road data and results are be
   compared to a reference high-end navigation system. Results show
   improved performance with FOS during GPS outages.}},

Journal = {{CATALYSIS SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{TAP pulse responses are normally analysed using moments, which are
   integrals of the full TAP pulse response. However, in some cases the
   entire pulse response may not be recorded due to technical reasons,

   incomplete pulse responses. The current work discloses the development
   of a function which mathematically expands the tail of a TAP pulse
   response, so that the TAP data analysis can be accurately conducted.
   This newly developed analysis method has been applied to the oxidative
   dehydrogenation of ethane over Co-Cr-Sn-WOx/alpha-Al2O3 and
   Co-Cr-Sn-WOx/alpha-Al2O3 catalysts as a case study.}},

   provide the answer to the long-standing question regarding the validity
   of thermodynamic scaling of ionic liquids over a wide temperature range,

Abstract = {{A novel approach is proposed for real-time retrieval of images from a
   large database of overlapping images of an indoor environment. The
   procedure extracts visual features from images using selected computer
   vision techniques, and processes the extracted features to create a
   reduced list of features annotated with the frame numbers they appear
   in. This method is named landmark indexing. Unlike some state-of-the-art
   approaches, the proposed method does not need to consider large image
   adjacency graphs because the overlap of the images in the map
   sufficiently increases information gain, and mapping of similar features
   to the same landmark reduces the search space to improve search
   efficiency. Empirical evidence from experiments on real datasets shows
   better performance and accuracy than other approaches. Experiments are
   further performed by integrating the image retrieval technique into a 3D
   real-time navigation system. This system is tested in several indoor
   environments and all experiments show highly accurate localization
   results.}},

Title = {{Assessment of a zoomed global model for the North Sea by comparison with
   a conventional nested regional model}},
Journal = {{TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Abstract = {{Assessment of marine downscaling of global model simulations to the
   regional scale is a prerequisite for understanding ocean feedback to the
   atmosphere in regional climate downscaling. Major difficulties arise
   from the coarse grid resolution of global models, which cannot provide
   sufficiently accurate boundary values for the regional model. In this
   study, we first setup a stretched global model (MPIOM) to focus on the
   North Sea by shifting poles. Second, a regional model (HAMSOM) was
   performed with higher resolution, while the open boundary values were
   provided by the stretched global model. In general, the sea surface
   temperatures (SSTs) in the two experiments are similar. Major SST
   differences are found in coastal regions (root mean square difference of
   SST is reaching up to 2 degrees C). The higher sea surface salinity in
   coastal regions in the global model indicates the general limitation of
   this global model and its configuration (surface layer thickness is 16
   m). By comparison, the advantage of the absence of open lateral
   boundaries in the global model can be demonstrated, in particular for
   the transition region between the North Sea and Baltic Sea. On long
   timescales, the North Atlantic Current (NAC) inflow through the northern
   boundary correlates well between both model simulations (R similar to
   0.9). After downscaling with HAMSOM, the NAC inflow through the northern
   boundary decreases by similar to 10\%, but the circulation in the
   Skagerrak is stronger in HAMSOM. The circulation patterns of both models
   are similar in the northern North Sea. The comparison suggests that the
   stretched global model system is a suitable tool for long-term free
   climate model simulations, and the only limitations occur in coastal
   regions. Regarding the regional studies focusing on the coastal zone,
   nested regional model can be a helpful alternative.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable effort has been devoted in recent years to developing an
   accurate and computationally-viable theoretical treatment of the THz
   response of semiconductor nanostructures that are excited by ultrashort
   optical pulses. Although most approaches, such as the semiconductor
   Bloch equations, employ an electron-hole basis, we have developed an
   excitonic approach that has significant advantages in many situations.
   Our approach includes the exchange interaction between excitons, the
   effects of the Pauli exclusion principle for the excitons (which are
   composite Bosons), and the dipole-dipole interactions between excitons.
   In this paper we review our excitonic formalism and apply it to examine
   the THz absorption of optically-excited CdSe nanorods and 2D GaAs
   quantum wells.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep quality and duration are increasingly recognised as being
   important prognostic parameters in the assessment of an individual's
   health. However, reliable non-invasive long-term monitoring of sleep in
   a non-clinical setting remains a challenging problem. This paper
   describes the validation of a novel under mattress pressure sensing
   sleep monitoring modality that can be seamlessly integrated into
   existing home environments and provides a pervasive and distributed
   solution for monitoring longterm changes in sleep patterns and sleep
   disorders in adults. 410 minutes of concomitant Under Mattress Bed
   Sensor (UMBS) and strain gauge data were analysed from eight healthy
   adults lying passively. In this analysis, customised respirations rate
   detection algorithms yielded a mean difference of -0.12 breaths per five
   minutes and a mean percentage error (MPE) of 0.16\% when the sensor was
   placed beneath the mattress. 1,491 minutes of UMBS and video data were
   recorded simultaneously from four participants in order to assess the
   movement detection efficacy of customised UMBS algorithms. These
   algorithms yielded accuracies, sensitivities and specificities of over
   90\% when compared to a video-based movement detection gold standard. A
   reduced data set (267 minutes) of wrist actigraphy, the gold standard
   ambulatory sleep monitor, was recorded. The UMBS was shown to outperform
   the movement detection ability of wrist actigraphy and has the added
   advantage of not requiring active subject participation.}},

Abstract = {{Norwegian eclogite-facies shear zones in the Lofoten islands served as
   major pathways for short-lived pulses of both Ar-40-rich and Ar-40-poor

   leading to old Ar-40/Ar-39 ages, particularly in trioctahedral micas.
   Ar-40 concentration in the fluids appears to decrease during the
   amphibolite-facies retrogression and Ca-rich amphiboles yield
   Ar-40/Ar-39 ages of c. 415 Ma (Scandian event). Late-and post-Caledonian
   Ar-40/Ar-39 muscovite and K-feldspar ages and Rb/Sr biotite ages
   coincide with multiple extensional events, fluid infiltration and
   thermal activity during the final exhumation of the crustal rocks,

   Pangaea and seafloor spreading between Europe and North America.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we report the thermal conductivity of several commercial
   and non-commercial Li-ion secondary battery electrode materials with and
   without electrolyte solvents. We also measure the Tafel potential, the
   ohmic resistance, reaction entropy and external temperature of a
   commercial pouch cell secondary Li-ion battery. Finally we combined all
   the experimentally obtained data in a thermal model and discuss the
   corresponding internal temperature effects.
   The thermal conductivity of dry electrode material was found to range
   from 0.07 to 0.41 W K-1 m(-1) while the electrode material soaked in
   electrolyte solvent ranged from 0.36 to 1.10 W K-1 m(-1). For all the
   different materials it was found that adding the electrolyte solvent
   increased the thermal conductivity by at least a factor of three. For
   one of the anode materials it was found that heat treatment at 3000 K
   increased the thermal conductivity by a factor of almost five.
   Measuring the electric heat sources of an air cooled commercial pouch
   cell battery at up to +/- 2C and the thermal conductivity of the
   electrode components made it possible to estimate internal temperature
   profiles. Combining the heat sources with tabulated convective heat
   transfer coefficients of air allowed us to calculate the ambient
   temperature profiles. At 12C charging rate (corresponding to 5 minutes
   complete charging) the internal temperature differences was estimated to
   be in the range of 4-20K, depending on the electrode thermal
   conductivity. The external temperature drop in air flowing at the
   battery surface was estimated to nearly 40K. Evaluating thermal
   management of batteries in the light of our measurement led to the
   conclusion that external cooling is more challenging than internal,
   though neither should be neglected.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical swivel seat adaptations are a key aftermarket disability
   modification to any small- to medium-sized passenger vehicle. However,
   the crashworthiness of these devices is currently unregulated and the
   existing 20g dynamic sled testing approach is prohibitively expensive
   for prototype assessment purposes. In this paper, an alternative
   quasi-static test method for swivel seat assessment is presented, and
   two different approaches (free-body diagram and multibody modelling)
   validated through published experimental data are developed to determine
   the appropriate loading conditions to apply in the quasi-static
   testing.Results show the two theoretical approaches can give similar
   results for estimating the quasi-static loading conditions, and this
   depends on the seatbelt configuration. Application of the approach to
   quasi-static testing of both conventional seats and those with
   integrated seat belts showed the approach to be successful and easy to
   apply. It is proposed that this method be used by swivel seat designers
   to assess new prototypes prior to final validation via the traditional
   20g sled test.}},

Title = {{The effects of global climate change on the cycling and processes of
   persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the North Sea}},
Journal = {{OCEAN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{397-409}},
Abstract = {{The fate and cycling of two selected legacy persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs), PCB 153 and gamma-HCH, in the North Sea in the 21st
   century have been modelled with combined hydrodynamic and fate and
   transport ocean models (HAMSOM and FANTOM, respectively). To investigate
   the impact of climate variability on POPs in the North Sea in the 21st
   century, future scenario model runs for three 10-year periods to the
   year 2100 using plausible levels of both in situ concentrations and
   atmospheric, river and open boundary inputs are performed. This slice
   mode under a moderate scenario (A1B) is sufficient to provide a basis
   for further analysis. For the HAMSOM and atmospheric forcing, results of
   the IPCC A1B (SRES) 21st century scenario are utilized, where surface
   forcing is provided by the REMO downscaling of the ECHAM5 global
   atmospheric model, and open boundary conditions are provided by the
   MPIOM global ocean model.
   Dry gas deposition and volatilization of gamma-HCH increase in the
   future relative to the present by up to 20\% (in the spring and summer
   months for deposition and in summer for volatilization). In the water
   column, total mass of gamma-HCH and PCB 153 remain fairly steady in all
   three runs. In sediment, gamma-HCH increases in the future runs,
   relative to the present, while PCB 153 in sediment decreases
   exponentially in all three runs, but even faster in the future, due to
   the increased number of storms, increased duration of gale wind
   conditions and increased water and air temperatures, all of which are
   the result of climate change. Annual net sinks exceed sources at the
   ends of all periods.
   Overall, the model results indicate that the climate change scenarios
   considered here generally have a negligible influence on the simulated
   fate and transport of the two POPs in the North Sea, although the
   increased number and magnitude of storms in the 21st century will result
   in POP resuspension and ensuing revolatilization events. Trends in
   emissions from primary and secondary sources will remain the key driver
   of levels of these contaminants over time.}},

Abstract = {{Private water supplies, which are the primary source of drinking water
   for rural communities in developed countries, are at risk of becoming
   fecally contaminated. It is important to identify the source of
   contamination in order to better understand and address this human
   health risk. Microbial source tracking methods using human, bovine and
   general Bacteroidales markers were performed on 716 well water samples
   from southeastern Ontario, which had previously tested positive for
   Escherichia coli. The results were then geospatially analyzed in order
   to elucidate contamination patterns. Markers for human feces were found
   in nearly half (49\%) of all samples tested, and a statistically
   significant spatial cluster was observed. A quarter of the samples
   tested positive for only general Bacteroidales markers (25.7\%) and
   relatively few bovine specific marker positives (12.6\%) were found.
   These findings are fundamental to the understanding of pathogen dynamics
   and risk in the context of drinking well water and will inform future
   research regarding host-specific pathogens in private well water
   samples.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{In the exploration of highly efficient direct ethanol fuel cells
   (DEFCs), how to promote the CO2 selectivity is a key issue which remains
   to be solved. Some advances have been made, for example, using
   bimetallic electrocatalysts, Rh has been found to be an efficient
   additive to platinum to obtain high CO2 selectivity experimentally. In
   this work, the mechanism of ethanol electrooxidation is investigated
   using the first principles method. It is found that CH3CHOH{*} is the
   key intermediate during ethanol electrooxidation and the activity of
   beta-dehydrogenation is the rate determining factor that affects the
   completeness of ethanol oxidation. In addition, a series of transition
   metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os and Ir) are alloyed on the top layer of Pt(111)
   in order to analyze their effects. The elementary steps, alpha-,
   beta-C-H bond and C-C bond dissociations, are calculated on these
   bimetallic M/Pt(111) surfaces and the formation potential of OH{*} from
   water dissociation is also calculated. We find that the active metals
   increase the activity of beta-dehydrogenation but lower the OH{*}
   formation potential resulting in the active site being blocked. By
   considering both beta-dehydrogenation and OH{*} formation, Ru, Os and Ir
   are identified to be unsuitable for the promotion of CO2 selectivity and
   only Rh is able to increase the selectivity of CO2 in DEFCs.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructure evolution during in situ electron irradiation at room
   temperature within the transmission electron microscope has been studied
   on commercial purity magnesium. Magnesium foils of purity 99.8\% were
   examined for comparative studies of defect structure formed by 200 keV
   electrons and 1 MeV krypton ions. Transmission electron microscopy has
   been used to quantify the type and nature of the microstructural changes
   taking place during irradiation. Hexagonal- shaped faulted c-component
   dislocation loops with Burgers vector of 1/6/< 20 (2) over bar(3) over
   bar > are formed by electron irradiation. Formation of inner un- faulted
   loops also takes place inside the faulted loops. Analysis shows that all
   the faulted c- component dislocation loops are interstitial in nature
   and growth rate of these loops is proportional to the irradiation time.
   Dislocation loops with Burgers vector 1/3 < 11 (2) over bar0 > also form
   but most of these loops shrink and disappear during subsequent electron
   irradiation. In some of the foils, only the pre- existing dislocations
   in the microstructure were observed to transform into vacancy type 1/3 <
   11 (2) over bar0 > loops and helical configurations and no other
   irradiation damage appeared. Ion irradiation for a dose up to 0.1 dpa
   produced dislocation loops with Burgers vector of 1/3 < 11 (2) over bar0
   > and these loops were mixed vacancy and interstitial in character.}},

Title = {{Nitroxide-mediated microemulsion polymerization of n-butyl acrylate:
   decoupling of target molecular weight and particle size}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3804-3816}},
Abstract = {{The independent control of particle size and molecular weight is a
   highly desirable yet challenging objective to achieve in SG1-mediated
   living radical emulsion polymerizations. For example, to preserve
   colloidal stability, reduction in particle size typically necessitates
   making higher molecular weight chains, severely constricting the
   usefulness of the process. The strong inverse correlation between target
   molecular weight and particle size has been successfully decoupled to a
   significant extent in nitroxide-mediated microemulsion polymerization of
   n-butyl acrylate using a two-stage differential monomer addition
   technique. These microemulsion polymerizations were carried out at 120
   degrees C using SG1-based alkoxyamine BlocBuilder (R) MA and the anionic
   surfactant Dowfax (TM) 8390 at low surfactant-to-monomer ratios (0.2 : 1
   to 0.5 : 1 w/w) and a solids content of 20 wt\%. The nanolatexes were
   colloidally stable and the polymerizations showed living and controlled
   behaviour. The mean particle diameters obtained ranged from 20-100 nm,
   although the focus was on particles in the 20-50 nm range, for target
   molecular weights from 20 000-80 000 g mol(-1). These results show that
   changing the surfactant-tomonomer ratio, the BlocBuilder (R)
   MA-to-buffer ratio, the initial monomer content in the seed stage, and
   surfactant feed rates can allow both molecular weight and particle size
   to be targeted independently in nitroxide-mediated microemulsion
   polymerization.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{2-10}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Electromagnetic cavity modes in photonic and plasmonic resonators offer
   rich and attractive regimes for tailoring the properties of light-matter
   interactions, yet there is a disturbing lack of a precise definition for
   what constitutes a cavity mode, and as a result their mathematical
   properties remain largely unspecified. The lack of a definition is
   evidenced in part by the diverse nomenclature at use, ``resonance{''},
   ``leaky mode{''}, and ``quasimode{''}, to name but a few, suggesting
   that the dissipative nature of cavity modes somehow makes them different
   from other modes, but an explicit distinction is rarely made. This
   Perspective aims to introduce the reader to some of the subtleties and
   working definitions that can be rigorously applied when describing the
   modal properties of leaky optical cavities and plasmonic nanoresonators.
   We describe some recent developments in the field, including calculation
   methods for quasinormal modes of both photonic and plasmonic resonators
   and the concept of a generalized effective mode volume, and we
   illustrate the theory with several representative cavity structures from
   the fields of photonic crystals and nanoplasmonics.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{9422-9431}},
Abstract = {{Standard microporous materials are typically crystalline solids that
   exhibit a regular array of cavities of uniform size and shape. Packing
   and directional bonding between molecular building blocks give rise to
   interstitial pores that confer size and shape-specific sorption
   properties to the material. In the liquid state interstitial cavities
   are transient. However, permanent and intrinsic ``pores'' can
   potentially be built into the structure of the molecules that constitute
   the liquid. With the aid of computer simulations we have designed,
   synthesised and characterised a series of liquids composed of hollow
   cage-like molecules, which are functionalised with hydrocarbon chains to
   make them liquid at accessible temperatures. Experiments and simulations
   demonstrate that chain length and size of terminal chain substituents
   can be used to tune, within certain margins, the permanence of
   intramolecular cavities in such neat liquids. Simulations identify a
   candidate ``porous liquid'' in which 30\% of the cages remain empty in
   the liquid state. Absorbed methane molecules selectively occupy these
   empty cavities.}},

Title = {{The origin of high activity but low CO2 selectivity on binary PtSn in
   the direct ethanol fuel cell}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{9432-9440}},
Abstract = {{The most active binary PtSn catalyst for direct ethanol fuel cell
   applications has been studied at 20 1 degrees C and 60 1 degrees C,
   using variable temperature electrochemical in situ FTIR. In comparison
   with Pt, binary PtSn inhibits ethanol dissociation to CO(a), but
   promotes partial oxidation to acetaldehyde and acetic acid. Increasing
   the temperature from 20 1 degrees C to 60 1 degrees C facilitates both
   ethanol dissociation to CO(a) and then further oxidation to CO2, leading
   to an increased selectivity towards CO2; however, acetaldehyde and
   acetic acid are still the main products. Potential-dependent phase
   diagrams for surface oxidants of OH(a) formation on Pt(111), Pt(211) and
   Sn modified Pt(111) and Pt(211) surfaces have been determined using
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is shown that Sn
   promotes the formation of OH(a) with a lower onset potential on the
   Pt(111) surface, whereas an increase in the onset potential is found
   upon modification of the (211) surface. In addition, Sn inhibits the
   Pt(211) step edge with respect to ethanol C-C bond breaking compared
   with that found on the pure Pt, which reduces the formation of CO(a). Sn
   was also found to facilitate ethanol dehydrogenation and partial
   oxidation to acetaldehyde and acetic acid which, combined with the more
   facile OH(a) formation on the Pt(111) surface, gives us a clear
   understanding of the experimentally determined results. This combined
   electrochemical in situ FTIR and DFT study provides, for the first time,
   an insight into the long-term puzzling features of the high activity but
   low CO2 production found on binary PtSn ethanol fuel cell catalysts.}},

Pages = {{19916-19924}},
Abstract = {{Accessing chirally pure cis-diols from arenes using micro-organisms
   over-expressing toluene dioxygenase (TDO) is now well established, but
   the conversions remain low for the more toxic and volatile substrates.
   For such arenes, improved production has already been achieved in the
   presence of hydrophobic non-toxic ionic liquids (ILs) acting in the form
   of a reservoir for the arene substrate. Yet, the costs associated with
   such ILs require extensive process development to render them viable.
   Herein, we show that optimization of the hydrophobic IL's cationic
   moiety and of the IL's concentration are key to enhanced conversion
   yielding between a 2-5 fold yield increase in the conversion of four
   haloarenes (Ph-X; X = F, Cl, Br, I). Additionally, we report that
   hydrophilic imidazolium-based ILs offer opportunities to achieve
   similarly high yielding biotransformations, with further improved
   reaction rates (<6 h), and this at very low ILs' concentrations (0.0015
   V-IL/V-aq). We also demonstrate that the increased biotransformations
   are due to these ILs being inhibitors of cellular respiration processes
   and thus favoring the shunting of NADH and O-2 towards the overexpressed
   biocatalytic process.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Three thiourea bridged 2,2'-bipyridine ligands bearing either a single
   thiourea group (L1), or two units separated by either a para (L2) or
   meta-substituted (L3) aromatic spacer, along with the corresponding
   bis(fac-tricarbonylrhenium(I)) complexes are reported. The three ligands
   all show the anticipated binding to acetate. However H-1 NMR titrations
   reveal an unusual cooperative binding to, and selectivity for, two
   dihydrogenphosphate ions. The rhenium(I) complexes similarly demonstrate
   unusual sigmoidal titration curves, and in the case of
   \{Re(CO)(3)Br\}(2)(mu-L1) a surprisingly strong interaction to two
   anions. These were further exemplified in the emissive behaviour leading
   to the conclusion that there is an unusual interaction with
   dihydrogenphosphate, giving an initial increase in the emission,
   followed by a decrease and a blue shift in wavelength possibly as a
   result of partial deprotonation. It appears that dihydrogenphosphate
   binds cooperatively, with the addition of a second anion enhancing the
   interaction of the first, probably by proton transfer; this could
   explain the remarkable selectivity for phosphate seen with many reported
   anion receptors.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{58-70}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper concerns a new modeling approach to multicomponent NAPL
   dissolution and transport, based on analytic solutions and Laguerre
   series. This approach allows virtually any of the numerous existing 1-D
   analytic transport solutions in the literature to be coupled with
   arbitrary boundary conditions stemming from nonlinear NAPL dissolution,
   as dictated by Raoult's Law. A computer implementation of this approach
   to coupled dissolution and transport in parallel fractureswhich no other
   screening tool known to the authors coversis presented. This is verified
   against an existing analytic transport solution that assumes a constant
   boundary condition. Subsequently, the model is demonstrated via a study
   of separation of PAH and phenolic plumes generated by dissolution of
   creosote, using the new computer implementation. The PAH and phenolic
   constituents of creosote strongly differ in both their dissolution and
   their transport behavior, and this is shown to necessitate the use of a
   tool that can account for both processes, such as the one developed
   here. We also find the possibility of PAH and phenolic plumes becoming
   entirely disjoint.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1632-1649}},
Abstract = {{We report a three-phase slug flow and a parallel-slug flow as two major
   flow patterns found under the nitrogen-decane-water flow through a glass
   microfluidic chip which features a long microchannel with a hydraulic
   diameter of 98 mu m connected to a cross-flow mixer. The three-phase
   slug flow pattern is characterized by a flow of decane droplets
   containing single elongated nitrogen bubbles, which are separated by
   water slugs. This flow pattern was observed at a superficial velocity of
   decane (in the range of about 0.6 to 10 mm s(-1)) typically lower than
   that of water for a given superficial gas velocity in the range of 30 to
   91 mm s(-1). The parallel-slug flow pattern is characterized by a
   continuous water flow in one part of the channel cross section and a
   parallel flow of decane with dispersed nitrogen bubbles in the adjacent
   part of the channel cross section, which was observed at a superficial
   velocity of decane (in the range of about 2.5 to 40 mm s(-1)) typically
   higher than that of water for each given superficial gas velocity. The
   three-phase slug flow can be seen as a superimposition of both
   decane-water and nitrogen-decane slug flows observed in the chip when
   the flow of the third phase (viz. nitrogen or water, respectively) was
   set at zero. The parallel-slug flow can be seen as a superimposition of
   the decane-water parallel flow and the nitrogen-decane slug flow
   observed in the chip under the corresponding two-phase flow conditions.
   In case of small capillary numbers (Ca << 0.1) and Weber numbers (We <<
   1), the developed two-phase pressure drop model under a slug flow has
   been extended to obtain a threephase slug flow model in which the
   `nitrogen-in-decane' droplet is assumed as a pseudo-homogeneous droplet
   with an effective viscosity. The parallel flow and slug flow pressure
   drop models have been combined to obtain a parallel-slug flow model. The
   obtained models describe the experimental pressure drop with standard
   deviations of 8\% and 12\% for the three-phase slug flow and
   parallel-slug flow, respectively. An example is given to illustrate the
   model uses in designing bifurcated microchannels that split the
   three-phase slug flow for high-throughput processing.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave heating reduces the preparation time and improves the
   adsorption quality of activated carbon. In this study, activated carbon
   was prepared by impregnation of palm kernel fiber with phosphoric acid
   followed by microwave activation. Three different types of activated
   carbon were prepared, having high surface areas of 872 m(2) g(-1), 1256
   m(2) g(-1), and 952 m(2) g(-1) and pore volumes of 0.598 cc g(-1), 1.010
   cc g(-1), and 0.778 cc g(-1), respectively. The combined effects of the
   different process parameters, such as the initial adsorbate
   concentration, pH, and temperature, on adsorption efficiency were
   explored with the help of Box-Behnken design for response surface
   methodology (RSM). The adsorption rate could be expressed by a
   polynomial equation as the function of the independent variables. The
   hexavalent chromium adsorption rate was found to be 19.1 mg g(-1) at the
   optimized conditions of the process parameters, i.e., initial
   concentration of 60 mg L-1, pH of 3, and operating temperature of 50
   degrees C. Adsorption of Cr(VI) by the prepared activated carbon was
   spontaneous and followed second-order kinetics. The adsorption mechanism
   can be described by the Freundlich Isotherm model. The prepared
   activated carbon has demonstrated comparable performance to other
   available activated carbons for the adsorption of Cr(VI).}},

   impacts of cracks and root growth}},
Journal = {{GEOTECHNIQUE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{95-107}},
Abstract = {{Desiccation crack formation is a key process that needs to be understood
   in assessment of landfill cap performance under anticipated future
   climate change scenarios. The objectives of this study were to examine:
   (a) desiccation cracks and impacts that roots may have on their
   formation and resealing, and (b) their impacts on hydraulic conductivity
   under anticipated climate change precipitation scenarios. Visual
   observations, image analysis of thin sections and hydraulic conductivity
   tests were carried out on cores collected from two large-scale
   laboratory trial landfill cap models (similar to 80 X 80 X 90 cm) during
   a year of four simulated seasonal precipitation events. Extensive root
   growth in the topsoil increased percolation of water into the
   subsurface, and after droughts, roots grew deep into low-permeability
   layers through major cracks which impeded their resealing. At the end of
   1 year, larger cracks had lost resealing ability and one single, large,
   vertical crack made the climate change precipitation model cap
   inefficient. Even though the normal precipitation model had developed
   desiccation cracks, its integrity was preserved better than the climate
   change precipitation model.}},

Title = {{One-pot two-step mechanochemical synthesis: ligand and complex
   preparation without isolating intermediates}},
Journal = {{GREEN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1374-1382}},
Abstract = {{Although the use of ball milling to induce reactions between solids
   (mechanochemical synthesis) can provide lower-waste routes to chemical
   products by avoiding solvent during the reaction, there are further
   potential advantages in using one-pot multistep syntheses to avoid the
   use of bulk solvents for the purification of intermediates. We report
   here two-step syntheses involving formation of salen-type ligands from
   diamines and hydroxyaldehydes followed directly by reactions with metal
   salts to provide the corresponding metal complexes. Five salen-type
   ligands 2,2'-{[}1,2-ethanediylbis{[}(E)-nitrilomethylidyne]] bisphenol,
   ` salenH2', 1;
   2,2'-{[}(+/-)-1,2-cyclohexanediylbis-{[}(E)-nitrilomethylidyne]]
   bis-phenol, 2; 2,2'-{[}1,2-phenylenebis(
   nitrilomethylidyne)]-bis-phenol, ` salphenH2' 3; 2-{[}{[}(2-aminophenyl)
   imino] methyl]-phenol, 4;
   2,2'-{[}(+/-)-1,2-cyclohexanediylbis{[}(E)-nitrilomethylidyne]]-bis{[}4,
   6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)]-phenol, ` Jacobsen ligand', 5) were found to
   form readily in a shaker-type ball mill at 0.5 to 3 g scale from their
   corresponding diamine and aldehyde precursors. Although in some cases
   both starting materials were liquids, ball milling was still necessary
   to drive those reactions to completion because precipitation of the
   product and or intermediates rapidly gave in thick pastes which could
   not be stirred conventionally. The only ligand which required the
   addition of solvent was the Jacobsen ligand 5 which required 1.75 mol
   equivalents of methanol to go to completion. Ligands 1-5 were thus
   obtained directly in 30-60 minutes in their hydrated forms, due to the
   presence of water by-product, as free-flowing yellow powders which could
   be dried by heating to give analytically pure products. The one-armed
   salphen ligand 4 could also be obtained selectively by changing the
   reaction stoichiometry to 1 : 1. SalenH(2) 1 was explored for the onepot
   two-step synthesis of metal complexes. In particular, after in situ
   formation of the ligand by ball milling, metal salts (ZnO, Ni(OAc)2
   center dot 4H(2)O or Cu(OAc)(2)center dot H2O) were added directly to
   the jar and milling continued for a further 30 minutes. Small amounts of
   methanol (0.4-1.1 mol equivalents) were needed for these reactions to
   run to completion. The corresponding metal complexes {[}M(salen)] (M =
   Zn, 6; Ni, 7; or Cu, 8) were thus obtained quantitatively after 30
   minutes in hydrated form, and could be heated briefly to give
   analytically pure dehydrated products. The all-at-once ` tandem'
   synthesis of {[}Zn(salen)] 6 was also explored by milling ZnO, ethylene
   diamine and salicylaldehyde together in the appropriate mole ratio for
   60 minutes. This approach also gave the target complex selectively with
   no solvent needing to be added. Overall, these syntheses were found to
   be highly efficient in terms of time and the in avoidance of bulk
   solvent both during the reaction and for the isolation of intermediates.
   The work demonstrates the applicability of mechanochemical synthesis to
   one-pot multi-step strategies.}},

   via an EC type mechanism, where p-BrC6H4NO2 is first reduced by one
   electron, quasi-reversibly, to yield the corresponding radical anion.
   The radical anions then react with the Zn electrode to form arylzinc
   products. Introduction of carbon dioxide into the system led to reaction
   with the arylzinc species, fingerprinting the formation of the latter.
   This method thus demonstrates a proof-of-concept of the formation of

Title = {{Transformation of Ferulic Acid to Vanillin Using a Fed-Batch

Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRESS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Amycolatopsis sp. ATCC 39116 (formerly Streptomyces setonii) has shown
   promising results in converting ferulic acid
   (trans-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid; substrate), which can be
   derived from natural plant wastes, to vanillin
   (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde). After exploring the influence of
   adding vanillin at different times during the growth cycle on cell
   growth and transformation performance of this strain and demonstrating
   the inhibitory effect of vanillin, a solid-liquid two-phase partitioning
   bioreactor (TPPB) system was used as an in situ product removal
   technique to enhance transformation productivity by this strain. The
   thermoplastic polymer Hytrel((R)) G4078W was found to have superior
   partitioning capacity for vanillin with a partition coefficient of 12
   and a low affinity for the substrate. A 3-L working volume solid-liquid
   fed-batch TPPB mode, using 300 g Hytrel G4078W as the sequestering
   phase, produced a final vanillin concentration of 19.5 g/L. The overall
   productivity of this reactor system was 450 mg/L. h, among the highest
   reported in literature. Vanillin was easily and quantitatively recovered
   from the polymers mostly by single stage extraction into methanol or
   other organic solvents used in food industry, simultaneously
   regenerating polymer beads for reuse. A polymer-liquid two phase
   bioreactor was again confirmed to easily outperform single phase systems
   that feature inhibitory or easily further degraded substrates/products.
   This enhancement strategy might reasonably be expected in the production
   of other flavor and fragrance compounds obtained by biotransformations.

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: In this paper, Dr. Joan Stevenson's work on assessment of the
   effects of lifting, supporting and transporting loads is reviewed. A
   defining attribute of this work is the use of objective, biomechanical
   measures as the basis from which a fuller understanding of all factors
   affecting worker performance can be obtained, and how such performance
   should be measured and evaluated.
   METHODS: The central objectives and conclusions of Dr. Stevenson's
   research programs spanning the years from 1985 through 2012 are
   summarized and discussed in terms of an overall research trajectory.
   CONCLUSIONS: The guiding principle of Dr. Stevenson's work is to reduce
   the potential harm to which workers are exposed through the development
   of bona fide occupational standards, a better understanding of risk
   factors leading to low back pain, and the establishment of an enhanced
   objective design process for functional load-bearing clothing and

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: In Western Africa, women continue performing heavy physical
   work that includes carrying loads on their heads during pregnancy. Women
   may adapt to pregnancy related body changes by modifying their postures
   to perform such tasks.
   OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this biomechanical task analysis study were
   to 1) determine sagittal plane postures of the trunk and upper
   extremities at specific events during the task of lifting and lowering a
   load to be carried on the head, 2) compare postures of pregnant and
   non-pregnant participants, 3) evaluate risk for musculo-skeletal
   disorders (MSD) with the rapid entire body assessment (REBA) criteria.
   PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six pregnant (26 +/- 5 years, 159 +/- 9 cm, 63 +/-
   15 kg, 25 +/- 9 weeks of pregnancy) and 25 paired non-pregnant retail
   merchants were recruited in Porto-Novo (Benin).
   METHODS: Participants were recorded on video in a laboratory setting
   while they lifted a tray (20\% body weight) from a stool to their head
   and then put it back down. Trunk inclination and knee, shoulder and
   elbow flexion angles were determined using Dartfish (TM) software.
   RESULTS: The trunk was bent by more than 80. at pick-up and set-down and
   knees were moderately flexed, significantly less (<11 degrees) for
   pregnant women, possibly because it was harder to lift the trunk, or for
   stability. For all postures analysed, the majority of trials were
   classified as ``high{''} risk or ``very high risk{''} for MSD.
   CONCLUSIONS: Future research should investigate prevalence of MSDs in
   this population to confirm the results of this study.}},

Abstract = {{Marine clay deposits in coastal, post-submarine areas of Scandinavia and

   Recently, considerable efforts by a number of researchers have been made
   to investigate areas of sensitive clay using a range of geophysical
   techniques. Although the majority of this work has focussed on
   measurements of electrical resistivity, other electromagnetic and
   seismic geophysical techniques have also received attention in the
   literature. The purpose of this paper is to review recent research
   concerning the effectiveness of a number of geophysical techniques for
   investigating sensitive clays. In addition to discussing a number of
   case studies, this review will also consider recent work showing the
   correlation of geophysical measurements, and in particular electrical
   resistivity, with a range of relevant engineering properties.}},

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the variable selection problem for a
   nonlinear non-parametric system. Two approaches are proposed, one
   top-down approach and one bottom-up approach. The top-down algorithm
   selects a variable by detecting if the corresponding partial derivative
   is zero or not at the point of interest. The algorithm is shown to have
   not only the parameter but also the set convergence. This is critical
   because the variable selection problem is binary, a variable is either
   selected or not selected. The bottom-up approach is based on the
   forward/backward stepwise selection which is designed to work if the
   data length is limited. Both approaches determine the most important
   variables locally and allow the unknown non-parametric nonlinear system
   to have different local dimensions at different points of interest.
   Further, two potential applications along with numerical simulations are
   provided to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithms. (C)

Title = {{Application of halohydrocarbons for the re-dispersion of gold particles}},
Journal = {{CATALYSIS SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{729-737}},
Abstract = {{Methods to control the dispersion of gold in supported heterogeneous
   catalysts are very valuable due to the strong nanoparticle size
   dependence on their activity and selectivity towards many reactions.
   Additionally, the ability to disperse large, inactive gold nanoparticles
   to smaller nanoparticles provides an opportunity to reactivate,
   stabilise and increase the lifetime of gold catalysts making them more
   practical for industrial applications. Previously it has been
   demonstrated that the use of gas phase iodomethane (J. Am. Chem. Soc.,
   2009, 131, 6973; Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., 2011, 50, 8912) was able to
   re-disperse gold from >20 nm particles to dimers and trimers. In the
   current work, we show that this technique can be applied using less
   hazardous halohydrocarbons treatments, both in the gas phase and the
   liquid phase. The ability of these individual halohydrocarbons to
   re-disperse gold as well as the extent to which leaching occurs is
   assessed.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The semantics of modal logics for reasoning about belief or knowledge is
   often described in terms of accessibility relations, which is too
   expressive to account for mere epistemic states of an agent. This paper
   proposes a simple logic whose atoms express epistemic attitudes about
   formulae expressed in another basic propositional language, and that
   allows for conjunctions, disjunctions and negations of belief or
   knowledge statements. It allows an agent to reason about what is known
   about the beliefs held by another agent. This simple epistemic logic
   borrows its syntax and axioms from the modal logic KD. It uses only a
   fragment of the S5 language, which makes it a two-tiered propositional
   logic rather than as an extension thereof. Its semantics is given in
   terms of epistemic states understood as subsets of mutually exclusive
   propositional interpretations. Our approach offers a logical grounding
   to uncertainty theories like possibility theory and belief functions. In
   fact, we define the most basic logic for possibility theory as shown by
   a completeness proof that does not rely on accessibility relations. (C)

Title = {{Numerical simulations of sink-flow boundary layers over rough surfaces}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Turbulent sink flows over smooth or rough walls with sand-grain
   roughness are studied using large-eddy and direct numerical simulations.
   Mild and strong levels of acceleration are applied, yielding a wide
   range of Reynolds number (Re-theta = 372 - 2748) and cases close to the
   reverse-transitional state. Flow acceleration and roughness are shown to
   exert opposite effects on boundary-layer integral parameters, on the
   Reynolds stresses, budgets of turbulent kinetic energy, and properties
   of turbulent structures in the vicinity of the rough surface; statistics
   exhibit similarity when plotted using inner scaling for cases with the
   same roughness Reynolds number, k(+). Acceleration leads to a decrease
   of k(+), while roughness increases it. For cases with higher k(+), the
   low-speed streaks become destabilized, and turbulent structures near the
   wall are distributed more uniformly in the wall-parallel plane; they are
   less extended in the streamwise direction, but more densely packed.
   Higher k(+) also causes decorrelation of the outer-layer hairpin packets
   with the near-wall structures, probably due to the direct impact of
   random roughness elements on the hairpin legs. Wall-similarity applies
   for the fully turbulent cases, in which the outer-layer turbulent
   statistics are affected by acceleration only. It is shown that being in
   the hydraulically smooth regime is a necessary condition for
   reverse-transition, supporting the idea that relaminarization starts
   from the inner region, where roughness effects dominate. (C) 2014 AIP

   surface of the PVCs hydrophilic. The antimicrobial activity of both ILs
   is related to the presence and concentration of both cationic and
   anionic component of the ILs leached from the PVC and inversely
   proportional to the extent of PVC gelation. Blends of the PVCs with IL1
   displayed antibacterial activity against almost all Gram-positive

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{We present an extensive literature compilation of age, metallicity, and
   chemical abundance pattern information for the 41 Galactic globular
   clusters (GGCs) studied by Schiavon et al. Our compilation constitutes a
   notable improvement over previous similar work, particularly in terms of
   chemical abundances. Its primary purpose is to enable detailed
   evaluations of and refinements to stellar population synthesis models
   designed to recover the above information for unresolved stellar systems
   based on their integrated spectra. However, since the Schiavon sample
   spans a wide range of the known GGC parameter space, our compilation may
   also benefit investigations related to a variety of astrophysical
   endeavors, such as the early formation of the Milky Way, the chemical
   evolution of GGCs, and stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. For
   instance, we confirm with our compiled data that the GGC system has a
   bimodal metallicity distribution and is uniformly enhanced in the a
   elements. When paired with the ages of our clusters, we find evidence
   that supports a scenario whereby the Milky Way obtained its globular
   clusters through two channels: in situ formation and accretion of
   satellite galaxies. The distributions of C, N, O, and Na abundances and
   the dispersions thereof per cluster corroborate the known fact that all
   GGCs studied so far with respect to multiple stellar populations have
   been found to harbor them. Finally, using data on individual stars, we
   verify that stellar atmospheres become progressively polluted by
   CN(O)-processed material after they leave the main sequence. We also
   uncover evidence which suggests that the a elements Mg and Ca may
   originate from more than one nucleosynthetic production site. We
   estimate that our compilation incorporates all relevant analyses from
   the literature up to mid-2012. As an aid to investigators in the fields
   named above, we provide detailed electronic tables of the data upon

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{4176-4185}},
Abstract = {{The activation of oxygen molecules is an important issue in the
   gold-catalyzed partial oxidation of alcohols in aqueous solution. The
   complexity of the solution arising from a large number of solvent
   molecules makes it difficult to study the reaction in the system. In
   this work, O-2 activation on an Au catalyst is investigated using an
   effective approach to estimate the reaction barriers in the presence of
   solvent. Our calculations show that O-2 can be activated, undergoing
   OOH{*} in the presence of water molecules. The OOH{*} can readily be
   formed on Au(211) via four possible pathways with almost equivalent free
   energy barriers at the aqueous-solid interface: the direct or indirect
   activation of O-2 by surface hydrogen or the hydrolysis of O-2 following
   a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism or an Eley-Rideal mechanism. Among
   them, the Eley-Rideal mechanism may be slightly more favorable due to
   the restriction of the low coverage of surface H on Au(211) in the other
   mechanisms. The results shed light on the importance of water molecules
   on the activation of oxygen in gold-catalyzed systems. Solvent is found
   to facilitate the oxygen activation process mainly by offering extra
   electrons and stabilizing the transition states. A correlation between
   the energy barrier and the negative charge of the reaction center is
   found. The activation barrier is substantially reduced by the aqueous
   environment, in which the first solvation shell plays the most important
   role in the barrier reduction. Our approach may be useful for estimating
   the reaction barriers in aqueous systems.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years concerns over litigation and the trend towards close
   monitoring of academic activity has seen the effective hijacking of
   research ethics by university managers and bureaucrats. This can
   effectively curtail cutting edge research as perceived safe' research
   strategies are encouraged. However, ethics is about more than research
   governance. Ultimately, it seeks to avoid harm and to increase benefits
   to society. Rural development debate is fairly quiet on the question of
   ethics, leaving guidance to professional bodies. This study draws on
   empirical research that examined the lives of migrant communities in
   Northern Ireland. This context of increasingly diverse rural development
   actors provides a backdrop for the way in which the researcher navigates
   through ethical issues as they unfold in the field. The analysis seeks
   to relocate ethics from being an annoying bureaucratic requirement to
   one where it is inherent to rigorous and professional research and
   practice. It reveals how attention to professional ethics can contribute
   to effective, situated and reflexive practice, thus transforming ethics
   to become an asset to professional researchers.}},

Pages = {{F83-F93}},
Abstract = {{An effective property model for infiltrated electrodes is reported that
   predicts the dependence of effective electronic conductivity and active
   TPB length on experimentally controllable and measurable parameters. The
   model uses results from percolation theory and geometric arguments to
   compute the properties of Ni-infiltrated anodes of solid oxide fuel
   cells. While the predicted electronic conductivity is comparable to that
   for a typical composite Ni anode, the predicted effective TPB length is
   approximately two orders of magnitude higher for a Ni infiltrated anode
   with a Ni volume fraction of less than 10\%. The predictions of the
   developed model are compared and validated against three independent
   experimental datasets. Parametric studies using this model suggest that
   decreasing the particle sizes of the infiltrated film and the substrate,
   as well as the substrate porosity will increase the active TPB length.
   While decreasing substrate particle size also increases the effective
   electronic conductivity of the electrode, decreasing substrate porosity
   has the opposite effect. Finally, a methodology is presented to
   quantitatively relate an experimentally observed degradation in
   effective electronic conductivity of infiltrated electrodes to a
   reduction in active TPB length as a function of time. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the local PDF of natural signals in sparse
   domains. The statistical properties of natural signals are characterized
   more accurately in the sparse domains because the sparse domain
   coefficients have heavy-tailed distribution and have reduced correlation
   with adjacent coefficients. Our experiments on 3D data in 3D discrete
   complex wavelet transform domain show that a conditionally (given
   locally estimated variance and shape) independent Bessel K-form
   distribution (BKFD) locally fits the sparse domain's coefficients of
   natural signals, accurately. To justify this observation, we also
   investigate the PDF of the locally estimated variance and suggest a
   Gamma PDF for the locally estimated variance. Because commonly used
   sparse transformations are orthonormal, the PDF of the sparse domain
   coefficients must converge to Gaussian distribution by virtue of central
   limit theorem assuming that natural signals are locally wide sense
   stationary for small window sizes. Interestingly, we observe that the
   PDF of the normalized data (on the locally estimated variance) exhibit a
   Gaussian PDF, which confirms that the BKFD is an appropriate fit.

Abstract = {{Polymer extrusion, in which a polymer is melted and conveyed to a mould
   or die, forms the basis of most polymer processing techniques. Extruders
   frequently run at non-optimised conditions and can account for 15-20\%
   of overall process energy losses. In times of increasing energy
   efficiency such losses are a major concern for the industry. Product
   quality, which depends on the homogeneity and stability of the melt flow
   which in turn depends on melt temperature and screw speed, is also an
   issue of concern of processors. Gear pumps can be used to improve the
   stability of the production line, but the cost is usually high. Likewise
   it is possible to introduce energy meters but they also add to the
   capital cost of the machine. Advanced control incorporating soft sensing
   capabilities offers opportunities to this industry to improve both
   quality and energy efficiency. Due to strong correlations between the
   critical variables, such as the melt temperature and melt pressure,
   traditional decentralized PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control
   is incapable of handling such processes if stricter product
   specifications are imposed or the material is changed from one batch to
   another. In this paper, new real-time energy monitoring methods have
   been introduced without the need to install power meters or develop
   data-driven models. The effects of process settings on energy efficiency
   and melt quality are then studied based on developed monitoring methods.
   Process variables include barrel heating temperature, water cooling
   temperature, and screw speed. Finally, a fuzzy logic controller is
   developed for a single screw extruder to achieve high melt quality. The
   resultant performance of the developed controller has shown it to be a
   satisfactory alternative to the expensive gear pump. Energy efficiency
   of the extruder can further be achieved by optimising the temperature
   settings. Experimental results from open-loop control and fuzzy control
   on a Killion 25 mm single screw extruder are presented to confirm the
   efficacy of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Pages = {{531-539}},
Abstract = {{The surface modification of a mechanochemically prepared Ag/Al2O3
   catalyst compared with catalysts prepared by standard wet impregnated
   methods has been probed using two-dimensional T-1-T-2 NMR correlations,
   H2O temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and DRIFTS. The catalysts
   were examined for the selective catalytic reduction of NOx using
   n-octane in the presence and absence of H-2. Higher activities were
   observed for the ball milled catalysts irrespective of whether H-2 was
   added. This higher activity is thought to be related to the increased
   affinity of the catalyst surface towards the hydrocarbon relative to
   water, following mechanochemical preparation, resulting in higher
   concentrations of the hydrocarbon and lower concentrations of water at
   the surface. DRIFTS experiments demonstrated that surface isocyanate was
   formed significantly quicker and had a higher surface concentration in
   the case of the ball milled catalyst which has been correlated with the
   stronger interaction of the n-octane with the surface. This increased
   interaction may also be the cause of the reduced activation barrier
   measured for this catalyst compared with the wet impregnated system. The
   decreased interaction of water with the surface on ball milling is
   thought to reduce the effect of site blocking whilst still providing a
   sufficiently high surface concentration of water to enable effective
   hydrolysis of the isocyanate to form ammonia and, thereafter, N-2.}},

Pages = {{847-886}},
Abstract = {{Ionic liquids with chlorometallate anions may not have been the first
   ionic liquids, however, it was their development that lead to the
   recognition that ionic liquids are a distinct, and useful, class of
   (functional) materials. While much of the phenomenal interest and
   attention over the past two decades has focussed on `air and water
   stable' ionic liquids, research and application of chlorometallate
   systems has continued unabated albeit largely out of the main spotlight.
   The defining characteristic of chlorometallates is the presence of
   complex anionic equilibria, which depend both on the type and on the
   concentration of metal present, and leads directly to their
   characteristic and individual properties. Here, we review the
   experimental techniques that can be applied to study and characterise
   the anion speciation in these ionic liquids and, using recent examples,
   illustrate how their applications base is evolving beyond traditional
   applications in Lewis acidic catalysis and electrochemistry through to
   uses as soft and component materials, in the ionothermal synthesis of
   semiconductors, gas storage systems and key components in the
   development of biomass processing.}},

Abstract = {{In finite difference time domain simulation of room acoustics, source
   functions are subject to various constraints. These depend on the way
   sources are injected into the grid and on the chosen parameters of the
   numerical scheme being used. This paper addresses the issue of selecting
   and designing sources for finite difference simulation, by first
   reviewing associated aims and constraints, and evaluating existing
   source models against these criteria. The process of exciting a model is
   generalized by introducing a system of three cascaded filters,
   respectively, characterizing the driving pulse, the source mechanics,
   and the injection of the resulting source function into the grid. It is
   shown that hard, soft, and transparent sources can be seen as special
   cases within this unified approach. Starting from the mechanics of a
   small pulsating sphere, a parametric source model is formulated by
   specifying suitable filters. This physically constrained source model is
   numerically consistent, does not scatter incoming waves, and is free
   from zero-and low-frequency artifacts. Simulation results are employed
   for comparison with existing source formulations in terms of meeting the
   spectral and temporal requirements on the outward propagating wave. (C)

Title = {{Therapeutic targeting of Neul sialidase with oseltamivir phosphate
   (Tamiflu (R)) disables cancer cell survival in human pancreatic cancer
   with acquired chemoresistance}},
Journal = {{ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{117-134}},
Abstract = {{Background: Resistance to drug therapy, along with high rates of
   metastasis, contributes to the low survival rate in patients diagnosed
   with pancreatic cancer. An alternate treatment for human pancreatic
   cancer involving targeting of Neu1 sialidase with oseltamivir phosphate
   (Tamiflu (R)) was investigated in human pancreatic cancer (PANC1) cells
   with acquired resistance to cisplatin and gemcitabine. Its efficacy in
   overcoming the intrinsic resistance of the cell to chemotherapeutics and
   metastasis was evaluated.
   Methods: Microscopic imaging, immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry,
   and WST-1 cell viability assays were used to evaluate cell survival,
   morphologic changes, and expression levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin,
   and VE-cadherin before and after treatment with oseltamivir phosphate in
   PANC1 cells with established resistance to cisplatin, gemcitabine, or a
   combination of the two agents, and in archived paraffin-embedded PANC1
   tumors grown in RAGxC gamma double mutant mice.
   Results: Oseltamivir phosphate overcame the chemoresistance of PANC1 to
   cisplatin and gemcitabine alone or in combination in a dose-dependent
   manner, and disabled the cancer cell survival mechanism(s). Oseltamivir
   phosphate also reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
   characteristic of the phenotypic E-cadherin to N-cadherin changes
   associated with resistance to drug therapy. Low-dose oseltamivir
   phosphate alone or in combination with gemcitabine in heterotopic
   xenografts of PANC1 tumors growing in RAGxC gamma double mutant mice did
   not prevent metastatic spread to the liver and lung.
   Conclusion: Therapeutic targeting of Neu1 sialidase with oseltamivir
   phosphate at the growth factor receptor level disables the intrinsic
   signaling platform for cancer cell survival in human pancreatic cancer
   with acquired chemoresistance. These findings provide evidence for
   oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) as a potential therapeutic agent for
   pancreatic cancer resistant to drug therapy.}},

Title = {{A three-dimensional numerical model for linking community-wide vapour
   risks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{156}},
Pages = {{38-51}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A three-dimensional (3D) numerical model that couples contaminant
   transport in the saturated zone to vapour transport in the vadose zone
   and vapour intrusion into buildings was developed. Coupling these
   processes allows the simulation of vapour intrusion, arising from
   volatilization at the water table, associated with temporally and
   spatially variable groundwater plumes. In particular, the model was
   designed to permit, for the first time, 3D simulations of risk at
   receptors located in the wider community (i.e., kilometre scale)
   surrounding a contaminated site. The model can account for heterogeneous
   distributions of permeability, fraction organic carbon, sorption and
   biodegradation in the vadose and saturated zones. The model formulation,
   based upon integration of a number of widely accepted models, is
   presented along with verification and benchmarking tests. In addition, a
   number of exploratory simulations of benzene and naphthalene transport
   in a 1000 m long domain (aquifer cross-section: 500 m x 14 m) are
   presented, which employed conservative assumptions consistent with the
   development of regulatory guidance. Under these conservative conditions,
   these simulations demonstrated, for example, that whether houses in the
   community were predicted to be impacted by groundwater and indoor air
   concentrations exceeding regulatory standards strongly depended on their
   distance downgradient from the source and lateral distance from the
   plume centreline. In addition, this study reveals that the degree of
   reduction in source concentration (i.e., remediation) required to
   achieve compliance with standards is less if the risk receptor is in the
   wider community than at the site boundary. However, these example
   scenarios suggest that, even considering community receptors, sources
   with initially high concentrations still required substantial
   remediation (i.e., >99\% reductions in source concentration). Overall,
   this work provides insights and a new tool for considering the
   relationships between contaminated site source zones and community-wide
   risk assessment that allows for development of policies and technical
   approaches for contaminated site management. It is anticipated that this
   coupled model not only will allow significant convenience, for example
   in running suites of Monte Carlo simulations for complex scenarios, but
   will also allow the investigation of vapour intrusion under conditions
   where soil gas concentrations may change over the same timescale as an
   evolving plume. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Geology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of the Vazante Northern Extension
   zinc silicate deposit, Minas Gerais, Brazil}},
Journal = {{ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{234-257}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The Vazante Northern Extension orebodies (850 kt at 16\% Zn) are the
   continuation of the structurally controlled, hypogene, non-sulfide zinc
   orebodies of the Vazante deposit (18 Mt at 19\% Zn), Minas Gerais,
   Brazil. The Vazante orebodies are hosted in the dolomitized carbonate
   rocks of the Serra do Poco Verde Formation that were deposited in an
   intertidal to supratidal environment. The Serra do Poco Verde Formation
   is part of the Neoproterozoic Vazante Group, which is located in the
   Brasilia Fold Belt along the western margin of the Sao Francisco Craton.
   The Northern Extension orebodies occur within major
   tectonic-hydrothermal breccias controlled by a NE-trending fault zone.
   The faults and the breccias are interpreted to be formed during the
   so-called D-2 deformation event, which is related to the Late
   Proterozoic Brasiliano Orogeny. The faults were reactivated during their
   evolution and are cut by later transcurrent faulting.
   Four types of tectonic-hydrothermal breccia occur in the North Extension
   zone. Type 1 breccia is distal from the willemite ore and is comprised
   of weakly brecciated dolostone with Fe-carbonate alteration, whereas
   type 2 breccia exhibits strong Fe-bearing carbonate alteration (dolomite
   with 1.5 to 3.3 wt.\% FeO and 03 to 1.25 wt.\% ZnO) of the clasts,
   Fe-carbonate veinlets, a more intense brecciation of the clasts, and has
   overprinted the type 1 breccia. Type 3 breccia is composed mainly of
   hematite that replaced previously altered dolomite clasts and filled the
   breccia matrix. Type 4 breccia, which is typically proximal to type 3
   breccia, is the willemite ore breccia which contains three generations
   of hypogene willemite as well as hematite, franklinite and minor amounts
   of quartz and ferroan (similar to 1.99 wt.\% FeO) and zincian (similar
   to 2.65 wt.\% ZnO) dolomite. Type 4 breccia commonly occurs in lenses
   surrounded by the type 3 hematite breccia, and willemite partially
   replaces hematite and altered carbonate clasts and fills breccia matrix
   and veinlets. In the southern part of the deposit, late sulfide-rich
   veinlets with galena, sphalerite, native silver, covellite, and
   stromeyerite cut the hypogene zinc silicate mineralization.
   Lithogeochemical analysis and mass-balance of the hydrothermal breccia
   were used to evaluate metals added during the hydrothermal period. The
   data show that the ore-related elements have been added to the system
   since the formation of the earliest breccia (Type 1 breccia). However,
   the type 3 breccia contains the highest average concentrations for As,
   Ba, Be, Bi, Fe, Ge, In, Mo, Ni, Sb, U, V, and W. Type 4 breccia is also
   enriched in the same elements and contains the highest average
   concentrations of Ag, Cu, Hg, Pb, S, Se, SiO2, and Zn. The evidence that
   the ore-related elements were added to the system during the formation
   of types 1 and 2 breccias, suggests that the metalliferous fluids were
   interacting with the host rocks, but were not able to effectively
   precipitate the ore-related elements. Important changes in the
   hydrothermal system would have increased its fugacity and pH allowing
   for formation, respectively, of type 3 hematite-rich breccia and type 4
   willemite ore breccia, which are enriched in the other ore-related
   elements (e.g. As, Ba, Be, Bi, Cu, Fe, Ge, Hg, In, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, U, V,
   and W). These observations are consistent with a formation model
   proposed for the Vazante orebodies involving early interaction of
   metalliferous brines with the host rocks, followed by mixing of the
   metalliferous fluids with more oxidizing fluids, most likely meteoric
   water, leading to the precipitation of abundant hematite and willemite.
   Late, more reduced fluids formed the Pb, Cu and Ag-rich sulfide veinlets
   that cut the willemite mineralization. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Low-flow occurrence and magnitude have been documented for Canada using
   the National Ecological Framework. The low flow database is composed of
   the 7-day low flow with 2-year return period (7Q(2)) values for 453
   natural flow hydrometric stations with record lengths of at least 30
   years; drainage areas ranged from 10 to 30 000 km(2). Occurrence zones
   corresponding to predominant season for annual low flows are associated
   with ecozones. The ecozone scale was found to be suitable for regional
   analysis for several ecozones. For some ecozones there were insufficient
   data for regional analysis and for others finer resolution is required.
   Regional regression equations were developed for estimating 7Q(2) in
   terms of area for ecozones containing at least 20 stations. The results
   of this work will help practitioners to identify the season of low flow
   occurrence and the appropriate method of analysis, and provide a means
   of estimating 7Q(2) for ungauged sites for some ecozones.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Turbocompounding is the process of recovering a proportion of an
   engine's fuel energy that would otherwise be lost in the exhaust process
   and adding it to the output power. This was first seen in the 1930s and
   is carried out by coupling an exhaust gas turbine to the crankshaft of a
   reciprocating engine. It has since been recognised that coupling the
   power turbine to an electrical generator instead of the crankshaft has
   the potential to reduce the fuel consumption further with the added
   flexibility of being able to decide how this recovered energy is used.
   The electricity generated can be used in automotive applications to
   assist the crankshaft using a flywheel motor generator or to power
   ancillaries that would otherwise have run off the crankshaft. In the
   case of stationary power plants, it can assist the electrical power
   output. Decoupling the power turbine from the crankshaft and coupling it
   to a generator allows the power electronics to control the turbine speed
   independently in order to optimise the specific fuel consumption for
   different engine operating conditions. This method of energy recapture
   is termed turbogenerating'. This paper gives a brief history of
   turbocompounding and its thermodynamic merits. It then moves on to give
   an account of the validation of a turbogenerated engine model. The model
   is then used to investigate what needs to be done to an engine when a
   turbogenerator is installed. The engine being modelled is used for
   stationary power generation and is fuelled by an induced biogas with a
   small portion of palm oil being injected into the cylinder to initiate
   combustion by compression ignition. From these investigations, optimum
   settings were found that result in a 10.90\% improvement in overall
   efficiency. These savings relate to the same engine without a
   turbogenerator installed operating with fixed fuelling.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between migration and age has long been established,
   and most recently, there have been calls for the inclusion of a life
   course perspective to migration research. In this paper, we explore
   Northern Ireland's internal migration patterns, and in particular, we
   test for the importance of urban to rural migration at different stages
   of the life course. Data from the Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study
   are used for the first time to analyse urban-rural migration patterns.
   The resulting modelling demonstrates unique aspects of urban to rural
   migration within Northern Ireland, which up until now have gone largely
   unreported. Results from logistic regression modelling suggest that
   there is an age selectivity to urban-rural mobility but not necessarily
   at the life course stages predicted from a review of the life course
   migration literature. Individuals in younger age groups (at the
   household and family formation stages of the life course) are most
   likely to make an urban to rural move in Northern Ireland, with a
   decline in the likelihood of this move type with age. Possible
   explanations are offered linked to Northern Ireland's settlement
   hierarchy, rural planning policy, and family farming traditions. The
   findings challenge researchers to pay due attention to how migration
   processes may play out differently in varying geographical, social, and
   planning contexts and emphasise the importance of structural factors to
   explain migration patterns. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a technical feasibility study of the production of

   recovery, as it converts the waste into a value-added product.
   Fertiliser granules were successfully produced from various compositions
   of limestone and tea waste. The effect of tea waste concentration on
   granule strength was analysed; the granule strength was in the range 0.2
   to 1.8 MPa depending on powder composition; increasing the tea waste
   mass fraction resulted in a reduction in granule strength. Varying the
   tea waste to limestone ratio also influenced the compressibility of the
   granules; the granules compressibility increased with increasing tea
   waste mass fraction. It was further found that increasing the mass
   fraction of tea waste in the binary mixture of powder reduced the
   granule median size of the batch. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{235}},
Pages = {{167-175}},

Abstract = {{Substrate toxicity can impose operability challenges in the biological
   treatment of xenobiotic compounds. These can arise from transients in
   the feed to conventional continuous processes, as well as in more
   challenging systems, sequencing batch reactors (SBRs), whose operation
   is always inherently dynamic. Via the use of the classic Haldane model
   for microbial toxicity, and unsteady-state material balance equations
   for SBR operation, we have analysed the behaviour of an SBR reactor
   operating over multiple cycles and have shown that both high performance
   and low performance can be obtained depending on the feed substrate
   concentration and the selected SBR exchange ratio. That is, both the
   intrinsic microbial kinetics as well as the selection of process
   operating conditions can lead either to high performance (high removal
   efficiency) or low performance (low removal efficiency) operation. Using
   this approach, we have also discussed the performance for the SBR
   treatment of 2 ``real{''} substrates possessing widely different kinetic
   parameters, showing the impact of these parameters, as well as process
   operating conditions, on the operability of SBR biotreatment systems
   handling xenobiotic compounds. This could be of significant value to
   practitioners wishing to select high performance operating regimes for
   the treatment of a specific xenobiotic compound. To our knowledge, this
   is the first systematic study of the impact of substrate toxicity on SBR
   operability, and is also a first step in modeling the impact of
   substrate detoxification, via the use of discontinuous Two-Phase
   Partitioning Bioreactors, on the dynamic performance of xenobiotic
   biotreatment processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Message Passing Interface (MPI) message queues have been shown to
   grow proportionately to the job size for many applications. With such a
   behaviour and knowing that message queues are used very frequently,
   ensuring fast queue operations at large scales is of paramount
   importance in the current and the upcoming exascale computing eras.
   Scalability, however, is two-fold. With the growing processor core
   density per node, and the expected smaller memory density per core at
   larger scales, a queue mechanism that is blind on memory requirements
   poses another scalability issue even if it solves the speed of operation
   problem. In this work we propose a multidimensional queue management
   mechanism whose operation time and memory overhead grow sub-linearly
   with the job size. We show why a novel approach is justified in spite of
   the existence of well-known and fast data structures such as binary
   search trees. We compare our proposal with a linked list-based approach
   which is not scalable in terms of speed of operation, and with an
   array-based method which is not scalable in terms of memory consumption.
   Our proposed multidimensional approach yields queue operation time
   speedups that translate to up to 4-fold execution time improvement over
   the linked list design for the applications studied in this work. It
   also shows a consistent lower memory footprint compared to the
   array-based design. Finally, compared to the linked list-based queue,
   our proposed design yields cache miss rate improvements which are on
   average on par with the array-based design. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this study, a robust wavelet-based fingerprint image watermarking
   scheme using an efficient just perceptual weighting (JPW) model has been
   proposed. The JPW model exploits three human visual system
   characteristics, namely: spatial frequency sensitivity, local brightness
   masking and texture masking, to compute a weight for each wavelet
   coefficient, which is then used to control the amplitude of the inserted
   watermark. The idea is motivated by the fact that fingerprint images
   perceptually differ from natural images and a JPW model adapted to such
   images would further enhance the robustness of the watermarking scheme.
   Experimental results show that the proposed model significantly improves
   the performance of the conventional watermarking technique in terms of
   robustness while maintaining the same imperceptibility of the watermark.
   Finally, the proposed technique has shown a clear superiority over a
   number of related state-of-the-art masking techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes a closed-loop control scheme based on joint-angle
   feedback for cable-driven parallel manipulators (CDPMs), which is able
   to overcome various difficulties resulting from the flexible nature of
   the driven cables to achieve higher control accuracy. By introducing a
   unique structure design that accommodates built-in encoders in passive
   joints, the seven degrees of freedom (7-DOF) CDPM can obtain joint angle
   values without external sensing devices, and it is used for feedback
   control together with a proper closed-loop control algorithm. The
   control algorithm has been derived from the time differential of the
   kinematic formulation, which relates the joint angular velocities to the
   time derivative of cable lengths. In addition, the Lyapunov stability
   theory and Monte Carlo method have been used to mathematically verify
   the self-feedback control law that has tolerance for parameter errors.
   With the aid of co-simulation technique, the self-feedback closed-loop

Abstract = {{Urban areas are pivotal to global adaptation and mitigation efforts. But
   how do cities actually perform in terms of climate change response? This
   study sheds light on the state of urban climate change adaptation and
   mitigation planning across Europe. Europe is an excellent test case
   given its advanced environmental policies and high urbanization. We
   performed a detailed analysis of 200 large and medium-sized cities
   across 11 European countries and analysed the cities' climate change
   adaptation and mitigation plans. We investigate the regional
   distribution of plans, adaptation and mitigation foci and the extent to
   which planned greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions contribute to national and
   international climate objectives. To our knowledge, it is the first
   study of its kind as it does not rely on self-assessment (questionnaires
   or social surveys). Our results show that 35 \% of European cities
   studied have no dedicated mitigation plan and 72 \% have no adaptation
   plan. No city has an adaptation plan without a mitigation plan. One
   quarter of the cities have both an adaptation and a mitigation plan and
   set quantitative GHG reduction targets, but those vary extensively in
   scope and ambition. Furthermore, we show that if the planned actions
   within cities are nationally representative the 11 countries
   investigated would achieve a 37 \% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050,
   translating into a 27 \% reduction in GHG emissions for the EU as a
   whole. However, the actions would often be insufficient to reach
   national targets and fall short of the 80 \% reduction in GHG emissions
   recommended to avoid global mean temperature rising by 2 A degrees C
   above pre-industrial levels.}},

Abstract = {{A combined numerical and experimental investigation has been carried out
   to study the flow behaviour in a spacer-filled channel, representative
   of those used in spiral-wound membrane modules. Direct numerical
   simulation and particle image velocimetry were used to investigate the
   fluid flow characteristics inside a 2 x 2 cell at Reynolds numbers that
   range between 100 and 1000. It was found that the flow in this geometry
   moves parallel to and also rotates between the spacer filaments and that
   the rate of rotation increases with Reynolds number. The flow
   mechanisms, transition process and onset of turbulence in a
   spacer-filled channel are investigated including the use of the velocity
   spectra at different Reynolds numbers. It is found that the flow is
   steady for Re < 200 and oscillatory at Re similar to 250 and
   increasingly unsteady with further increases in Re before the onset of
   turbulent flow at Re similar to 1000.}},

Abstract = {{Optically active S-alkyl-N, N'-bis((S)-1-phenylethyl) thiouronium salts,
   abbreviated as (S)-{[}Cnpetu] Y (where Y is an anion; n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,
   8, 10, 12 or 16), have been prepared and studied by a broad spectrum of
   analyses. This consists of density, viscosity, and conductivity
   determination, followed by a discussion of relevant correlations.
   Unusual trends depending on the S-alkyl chain length were documented for
   (S)-{[}Cnpetu]{[} NTf2] series (where {[}NTf2] = bis\{(trifluoromethyl)
   sulfonyl\} amide), including the viscosity decreasing with increasing
   chain length, and the conductivity showing a maximum between the S-butyl
   and the S-hexyl derivative. In addition, a hindered rotamerism of the
   thiouronium cation in dmso-d(6) solution was recognised by H-1 and C-13
   NMR techniques. Thorough analysis of NMR spectra confirmed that the main
   contribution comes from rotation about the partial double C-S bond. For
   the first time, a neat thiouronium ionic liquid system has been
   subjected to quantitative analysis of hindered rotamerism by dynamic NMR
   coalescence studies, with estimated activation energy for rotation of
   63.9 +/- 0.4 kJ mol(-1). Finally, the application of (S)-{[}C(n)petu] Y
   salts as chiral discriminating agents for carboxylates by 1H NMR
   spectroscopy was further investigated, demonstrating the influence of
   the S-alkyl chain length on chiral recognition; (S)-{[}C(2)petu]{[}NTf2]
   ionic liquid with the mandelate anion gave the best results.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDSolid-liquid two-phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs) use
   polymers as the sequestering phase to reduce the concentration of
   substrates to sub-inhibitory levels and enhance biodegradation
   performance. Polymer selection for TPPBs is challenging due to the
   almost infinite variety of target substrates to be degraded, and the
   variability and complexity of polymer composition and structure.
   RESULTSThree different polymer selection criteria, based on either
   solubility parameters or activity coefficients, were assessed via
   experimental partitioning coefficients (PCs) for phenol and butyl
   acetate, two substantially different target contaminant molecules, and
   the relative ability of the three methods to predict effective polymers
   was assessed. The best method was also applied to predict which waste
   polymers would be effective for sequestering these molecules, and TPPB
   degradation tests were conducted to confirm the effectiveness of a
   single identified polymer and selected waste polymers.
   CONCLUSIONAn effective polymer selection criterion was identified and
   the identified polymer showed a high capacity to absorb both phenol and
   butyl acetate. Both substrates were successfully degraded in
   solid-liquid TPPBs using the selected polymer and using mixtures of
   waste polymers. (c) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry}},

   large-diameter grey cast iron water mains. Uncertainty in the model
   inputs is accounted for using Monte Carlo simulation. The model is used

   on relaxed value iteration method, upper and lower bounds of optimality

   allows us to design distributed MPC controller independently for each
   subsystem. An augmented polytopic uncertainty description is invoked to
   handle the input delays. At each time interval, each sub-controller
   solves a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem to obtain
   local control input. An iterative online algorithm for constrained
   distributed MPC is introduced to coordinate the distributed MPC
   controllers. A numerical example is simulated to demonstrate the

Abstract = {{A digital one-cycle control strategy combined with the Quasi
   Proportional Resonant (QPR) controller is applied to the three-phase
   grid-connected inverter with LCL filter in this paper. The control
   system contains dual loops with inner loop of capacitive current and
   outer loop of net current. Instead of conventional SPWM modulation
   method, one-cycle control for the inner loop has functions of control
   and modulation, and then the bipolar control algorithm of one-cycle
   controller with capacitor current is derived to improve
   anti-interference performance of the system and to shorten the tuning
   process, the QPR controller in stationary reference frame is adopted to
   the outer-loop, which elides complicated coordinates transformation.
   Considering the high-order feature of the system, the parameters of
   controllers are designed by using the high-order poles assignment.
   Finally, a 3kW three-phase grid-connected inverter simulation is
   performed and the results verify feasibility of the scheme.}},

Abstract = {{To mitigate the higher noise figure (NF) of CMOS-based subharmonic
   mixers (SHMs) relative to their diode-based counterparts, this paper
   proposes the use of a low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) ahead
   of the mixing core. The LNTA has a noise-cancelling topology that
   enables the mixer to have a high conversion gain and low NF over the RF
   input band of 4.5 GHz to 8.5 GHz. A chip was fabricated on a standard
   130 nm CMOS process to validate the concept and measurement results
   reveal that the mixer can yield a conversion gain of 14.5 +/- 1.5 dB and
   a double-sideband noise figure of 9.25 +/- 1.25 dB over the RF band. The
   mixer's IP1dB is -10.8 dBm and its IIP3 is -3.7 dBm while its OP1dB is
   +6.5 dBm and its OIP3 is +13.8 dBm. The circuit core occupies an area of
   0.49 mm(2) on the silicon die.}},

   uncertainties. DC-DC converters are widely used to provide regulated DC
   voltages. Due to changes in the output load demand and also the input

   uncertainties. In this paper, an adaptive controller based on
   sensitivity method is applied to a boost converter. In addition, a
   variable adaptive gain corresponding to the output voltage error is
   proposed to improve the control system performance. Simulation results
   show that both proposed controllers demonstrate acceptable regulation in

Abstract = {{Power capping is an essential function for efficient power budgeting and
   cost management on modern server systems. Contemporary server processors
   operate under power caps by using dynamic voltage and frequency scaling
   (DVFS). However, these processors are often deployed in non-uniform
   memory access (NUMA) architectures, where thread allocation between
   cores may significantly affect performance and power consumption. This
   paper proposes a method which maximizes performance under power caps on
   NUMA systems by dynamically optimizing two knobs: DVFS and thread
   allocation. The method selects the optimal combination of the two knobs
   with models based on artificial neural network (ANN) that captures the
   non-linear effect of thread allocation on performance. We implement the
   proposed method as a runtime system and evaluate it with twelve
   multithreaded benchmarks on a real AMD Opteron based NUMA system. The
   evaluation results show that our method outperforms a naive technique
   optimizing only DVFS by up to 67.1\%, under a power cap.}},

Abstract = {{Furnace exit gas temperature (FEGT) is the key parameter in the furnace
   ash fouling monitoring system. Since the standard least squares support
   vector machine (LSSVM) is not suitable for online identification and
   control of FEGT, a novel CM-LSSVM-PLS method is proposed to predict FEGT
   in this paper. In the process of CM-LSSVM-PLS method, c-means cluster
   (CM) algorithm is used to partition the training data into several
   different subsets by considering the characteristics of operational
   data. Submodels are subsequently developed in the individual subsets
   based on LSSVM method. Partial least squares algorithm (PLS) is employed
   as the combination strategy. The online updating algorithm is then
   applied to the CM-LSSVM-PLS model. The proposed online model is verified
   through operation data of a 300MW generating unit. The simulation
   results show that the proposed online updating model is effective for
   online FEGT forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the control of large-scale processes with
   both input and state couplings. A distributed model predictive control
   (MPC) strategy for tracking based on the reference trajectories is
   presented. The proposed distributed MPC strategy requires decomposing a
   large-scale system into several smaller ones and solving convex
   optimization problems independently. Distributed MPC tracking strategies
   for unconstrained and constrained processes are presented, respectively.
   An iterative algorithm is presented to coordinate the distributed MPC
   controllers. The proposed algorithm is applied to a four-tank process to
   demonstrate the effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric films with a thickness much less than a wavelength pose a
   challenge in transmission-mode terahertz time-domain spectroscopy
   (THz-TDS). A small signal change induced by such films is likely to be
   obscured by system uncertainties. In this abstract, several possible
   thin-film measurement procedures are carefully considered. It is found
   that an alternating sample and reference measurement approach is most
   sensitive for thin-film sensing. Importantly, a closed-form equation is
   developed to determine a lower bound of sample thickness as a function
   of the refractive index and system uncertainties. An experimental
   validation shows that typical THz-TDS can detect polymer films with a
   thickness of a few microns. The given criterion can be used to evaluate
   the system performance with respect to thin-film sensing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a pilot project that uses cloud-based documents to
   provide bi-directional feedback on open-ended contextualized activities.
   The course setting is a first year engineering design and professional
   practice course of approximately 700 students, taught in three sections,
   at Queen's University, a medium-sized research-intensive institution in
   Canada. Students were assigned to groups, and assigned shared
   directories in Google Drive. In most lectures students were assigned an
   activity requiring a response that was completed in a document in Google
   Drive, e.g. open-ended design problems, brainstorming, evaluation of
   information sources, etc. The course instructor, and a teaching
   assistant (TA) who attended each class, were able to view samples of
   students work and select some to anonymously discuss with the class.
   Thorough well-thought responses were highlighted, and misconceptions or
   misdirection was addressed. In this way students received some feedback
   on common issues in constructed response tasks immediately, rather than
   waiting for submission and grading of assignments. Student response to
   this approach was mixed, with about half the class feeling that the
   approach helped them learn, and that feedback was useful. About a third
   were neutral to the idea, and the rest felt it was not useful. There was
   no correlation between students' use of Google Docs and their grades on
   the two major reports. The instructor felt that this is a useful
   approach that helped many students, and would be improved in the future
   by using classrooms designed for team activities, improving the quality
   of tasks assigned in class, and assigning completion grades for in-class
   activities.}},

Abstract = {{The maximum likelihood estimate approach is adopted in this paper for
   finding the unknown radiation source location and strength. The problem
   is nonlinear and has to rely on iterative numerical algorithms. Since
   the problem has possibly multiple local maxima, the initial estimate in
   those iterative algorithms plays a critical role in guaranteeing the
   global optimum. This paper proposes a way to generate such an initial
   estimate which is easy to calculate. Besides some insights that
   justifies the proposed approach, it is shown that the proposed initial
   estimate actually converges to the true but unknown maximum likelihood
   estimate asymptotically thus ensuring that the initial estimate is
   indeed in a neighborhood of the maximum likelihood estimate and
   consequently the convergence to the global optimum by local iterative
   numerical algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of representing a sufficiently smooth
   control affine system as a structured potential-driven system and to
   exploit the obtained representation to study L-2-stability and
   stabilization. The representation problem has been studied extensively
   in recent years for particular classes of potential-driven systems,
   however exploiting these structures, for example generalized Hamiltonian
   systems, to study input-output stability was not fully investigated in
   the literature. The present note proposes a geometric decomposition
   technique, based on the Hodge decomposition theorem, to re-express a
   given vector field into a potential-driven form. Using the proposed
   decomposition technique, finite gain stability conditions are developed,
   in the form of Hamilton-Jacobi inequalities, based on the convexity of a
   computed potential.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider the computation of indistinguishable state
   pairs of nondeterministic finite automata where some transitions of the
   automata are observable whereas other transitions are not observable.
   Two states are indistinguishable if they are reached from the initial
   state of their corresponding automaton by sequences of transitions that
   are observationally identical. We review a known algorithm for computing
   indistinguishable state pairs of automata. We demonstrate for a specific
   parameterized example that this algorithm is in Theta (vertical bar X
   vertical bar(4).vertical bar Sigma vertical bar) where X is the state
   set and Sigma the event set of the input automaton. We define a product
   on nondeterministic finite automata which can be used for computing
   indistinguishable state pairs of automata. When the input automaton is
   deterministic (respectively, nondeterministic) with respect to its
   observable transitions, computation of indistinguishable state pairs by
   use of the product is in O(vertical bar X vertical bar(2).vertical bar
   Sigma vertical bar) + vertical bar X vertical bar(3)) (resp., O(vertical

Abstract = {{Molecular communication is set to play an important role in the design
   of complex biological and chemical systems. An important class of
   molecular communication systems is based on the timing channel, where
   information is encoded in the delay of the transmitted molecule-a
   synchronous approach. At present, a widely used modeling assumption is
   the perfect synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver.
   Unfortunately, this assumption is unlikely to hold in most practical
   molecular systems. To remedy this, we introduce a clock into the
   model-leading to the molecular timing channel with synchronization
   error. To quantify the behavior of this new system, we derive upper and
   lower bounds on the variance-constrained capacity, which we view as the
   step between the mean-delay and the peak-delay constrained capacity. By
   numerically evaluating our bounds, we obtain a key practical insight:
   the drift velocity of the clock links does not need to be significantly
   larger than the drift velocity of the information link, in order to
   achieve the variance-constrained capacity with perfect synchronization.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the impact of multiple eavesdroppers on cooperative
   single carrier systems with multiple relays and multiple destinations is
   examined. To achieve the secrecy diversity gains in the form of
   opportunistic selection, a two-stage scheme is proposed for joint relay
   and destination selection, in which, after the selection of the relay
   with the minimum effective maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to a
   cluster of eavesdroppers, the destination that has the maximum SNR from
   the chosen relay is selected. In order to accurately assess the secrecy
   performance, the exact and asymptotic expressions are obtained in
   closed-form for the ergodic secrecy rate in frequency selective fading.
   Based on the asymptotic analysis, key design parameters such as
   multiplexing gain, and power cost are characterized, from which new
   insights are drawn. Moreover, it is concluded that capacity ceiling
   occurs when the average received power at the eavesdropper is
   proportional to the counterpart at the destination.}},

   (IQI) in two-way amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying systems. In
   particular, the effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
   is derived for each source node, considering four different linear
   detection schemes, namely, uncompensated (Uncomp) scheme,
   maximal-ratio-combining (MRC), zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean-square

   closed-form OP expressions, an adaptive detection mode switching scheme
   is designed for minimizing the OP of both sources. An important
   observation is that, regardless of the channel conditions and transmit
   powers, the ZF-based scheme should always be selected if the target SINR
   is larger than 3 (4.77 dB), while the MRC-based scheme should be avoided
   if the target SINR is larger than 0.38 (4.20 dB).}},

Abstract = {{Novel mobility-aware resource allocation schemes have recently been
   introduced for efficient transmission of stored videos. The essence of
   such mechanisms is to lookahead at the future rates users will
   experience, and then strategically buffer content into user devices when
   they are at peak radio conditions. For example, a user approaching poor
   coverage will be preallocated additional video segments to ensure smooth
   streaming. Advances in mobility prediction and real-time radio
   environment map updates are driving forces for such Predictive Video
   Streaming (PVS) mechanisms. Although previous efforts have demonstrated
   the large potential gains of PVS, ideal channel predictions were
   assumed. This paper addresses the problem of channel uncertainty in PVS,
   and proposes a robust resource allocation framework that 1) models
   channel uncertainty, 2) solves the PVS problem with a tunable level of
   quality of service guarantees, and 3) learns the degree of uncertainty,
   and adapts the channel model accordingly. Numerical results demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed approach for PVS under channel
   variability.}},

   are used for the simultaneous data transmission from m single-antenna

Abstract = {{Radio-frequency (RF) impairments, that exist intimately in wireless
   communications systems, can severely degrade the performance of
   traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Although
   compensation schemes can cancel out part of these RF impairments, there
   still remains a certain amount of impairments. These residual
   impairments have fundamental impact on the MIMO system performance.
   However, most of the previous works have neglected this factor. In this
   paper, a training-based MIMO system with residual transmit RF
   impairments (RTRI) is considered. In particular, we derive a new channel
   estimator for the proposed model, and find that RTRI can create an
   irreducible estimation error floor. Moreover, we show that, in the
   presence of RTRI, the optimal training sequence length can be larger
   than the number of transmit antennas, especially in the low and high
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. An increase in the proposed
   approximated achievable rate is also observed by adopting the optimal
   training sequence length. When the training and data symbol powers are
   required to be equal, we demonstrate that, at high SNRs, systems with
   RTRI demand more training, whereas at low SNRs, such demands are nearly
   the same for all practical levels of RTRI.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a multipair relay channel, where multiple sources
   communicate with multiple destinations with the help of a full-duplex
   (FD) relay station (RS). All sources and destinations have a single
   antenna, while the RS is equipped with massive arrays. We assume that
   the RS estimates the channels by using training sequences transmitted
   from sources and destinations. Then, it uses maximum-ratio
   combining/maximum-ratio transmission (MRC/MRT) to process the signals.
   To significantly reduce the loop interference (LI) effect, we propose
   two massive MIMO processing techniques: i) using a massive receive
   antenna array; or ii) using a massive transmit antenna array together
   with very low transmit power at the RS. We derive an exact achievable
   rate in closed-form and evaluate the system spectral efficiency. We show
   that, by doubling the number of antennas at the RS, the transmit power
   of each source and of the RS can be reduced by 1.5 dB if the pilot power
   is equal to the signal power and by 3 dB if the pilot power is kept
   fixed, while maintaining a given quality-of-service. Furthermore, we
   compare FD and half-duplex (HD) modes and show that FD improves
   significantly the performance when the LI level is low.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the performance of dual-hop two-way amplify-and-forward
   (AF) relaying in the presence of in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance
   (IQI) at the relay node. In particular, the effective
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at both sources is
   derived. These SINRs are used to design an instantaneous power
   allocation scheme, which maximizes the minimum SINR of the two sources
   under a total transmit power constraint. The solution to this
   optimization problem is analytically determined and used to evaluate the
   outage probability (OP) of the considered two-way AF relaying system.
   Both analytical and numerical results show that IQI can create
   fundamental performance limits on two-way relaying, which cannot be
   avoided by simply improving the channel conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Radio-frequency (RF) impairments in the transceiver hardware of
   communication systems (e.g., phase noise (PN), high power amplifier
   (HPA) nonlinearities, or in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) imbalance) can
   severely degrade the performance of traditional multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Although calibration algorithms can
   partially compensate these impairments, the remaining distortion still
   has substantial impact. Despite this, most prior works have not analyzed
   this type of distortion. In this paper, we investigate the impact of
   residual transceiver hardware impairments on the MIMO system
   performance. In particular, we consider a transceiver impairment model,
   which has been experimentally validated, and derive analytical ergodic
   capacity expressions for both exact and high signal-to-noise ratios
   (SNRs). We demonstrate that the capacity saturates in the high-SNR
   regime, thereby creating a finite capacity ceiling. We also present a
   linear approximation for the ergodic capacity in the low-SNR regime, and
   show that impairments have only a second-order impact on the capacity.
   Furthermore, we analyze the effect of transceiver impairments on
   large-scale MIMO systems; interestingly, we prove that if one increases
   the number of antennas at one side only, the capacity behaves similar to
   the finite-dimensional case. On the contrary, if the number of antennas
   on both sides increases with a fixed ratio, the capacity ceiling
   vanishes; thus, impairments cause only a bounded offset in the capacity
   compared to the ideal transceiver hardware case.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, new applications of code clone detection and search have
   emerged that rely upon clones detected across thousands of software
   systems. Big data clone detection and search algorithms have been
   proposed as an embedded part of these new applications. However, there
   exists no previous benchmark data for evaluating the recall and
   precision of these emerging techniques. In this paper, we present a big
   data clone detection benchmark that consists of known true and false
   positive clones in a big data inter-project Java repository. The
   benchmark was built by mining and then manually checking clones of ten
   common functionalities. The benchmark contains six million true positive
   clones of different clone types: Type-1, Type-2, Type-3 and Type-4,
   including various strengths of Type-3 similarity (strong, moderate,
   weak). These clones were found by three judges over 216 hours of manual
   validation efforts. We show how the benchmark can be used to measure the
   recall and precision of clone detection techniques.}},

   under the two-phase and three-phase scenarios followed by their upper

Abstract = {{The collaborative Spectrum Sensing (SS) to detect random signals
   contaminated by additive Gaussian noise is studied. A novel soft
   decision rule based on the L-p-norm of square root of the Secondary
   Users (SUs) energies is proposed. The proposed scheme considers the
   bandwidth limitation for sharing sensing information between the SUs.
   Whereas the existing literature on Lp-norm detectors have assumed
   independent observations of the SUs, they would be highly correlated
   when Primary User (PU) is active. Therefore, we consider the correlated
   observations of the distributed SUs for the both cases of equal and
   unequal received Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). We derive the optimal
   Lp-norm vector parameter based on minimization of the overall error
   probability while meeting the spectral efficiency and sensing
   performance requirements. To this end, we use modified deflection
   coefficient metric to simplify optimization problem. Furthermore, in
   order to evaluate the performance of the proposed detector, the closed
   form expressions for detection and false alarm probabilities are
   computed analytically. The provided closed-form analytical results in
   addition to simulation results show that the proposed detector
   outperforms significantly the traditional energy combining detector.}},

Abstract = {{Novel transmission mechanisms are imperatively needed to cope with the
   exponential growth of mobile traffic and its associated power
   consumption. To address such challenges, we present lookahead video
   delivery schemes that jointly improve the streaming experience and
   reduce BS power consumption. This is accomplished by exploiting
   knowledge of future wireless rates users are anticipated to face. Such
   an approach is useful for delivering stored videos that can be
   strategically buffered in advance at the users' devices. For instance, a
   user leaving the cell center may have content prebuffered efficiently
   before poor channel conditions prevail. This will save energy as
   transmission will not be needed during poor conditions. In this paper,
   we first formulate Lookahead Resource Allocation (LRA) as a multi-cell
   optimization problem that leverages predictions of user mobility rates.
   Then, we present centralized and distributed algorithms that closely
   follow the benchmark results of the optimal solution. Numerical results
   demonstrate that significant improvements in video streaming and BS
   power consumption are achievable by the LRA strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Working code examples are useful resources for pragmatic reuse in
   software development. A working code example provides a solution to a
   specific programming problem. Earlier studies have shown that existing
   code search engines are not successful in finding working code examples.
   They fail in ranking high quality code examples at the top of the result
   set. To address this shortcoming, a variety of pattern-based solutions
   are proposed in the literature. However, these solutions cannot be
   integrated seamlessly in Internet-scale source code engines due to their
   high time complexity or query language restrictions. In this paper, we
   propose an approach for spotting working code examples which can be
   adopted by Internet-scale source code search engines. The time
   complexity of our approach is as low as the complexity of existing code
   search engines on the Internet and considerably lower than the
   pattern-based approaches supporting free-form queries. We study the
   performance of our approach using a representative corpus of 25,000 open
   source Java projects. Our findings support the feasibility of our
   approach for Internet-scale code search. We also found that our approach
   outperforms Ohloh Code search engine, previously known as Koders, in
   spotting working code examples.}},

Abstract = {{The NGVS-IR project (Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey-Infrared) is a
   contiguous, near-infrared imaging survey of the Virgo cluster of
   galaxies. It complements the optical wide-field survey of Virgo (NGVS).
   In its current state, NGVS-IR consists of K-s-band imaging of 4 deg(2)
   centered on M87 and J- and K-s-band imaging of similar to 16 deg(2)
   covering the region between M49 and M87. We present observations of the
   central 4 deg(2) centered on Virgo's core region. The data were acquired
   with WIRCam on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, and the total
   integration time was 41 hr distributed over 34 contiguous tiles. A
   survey-specific strategy was designed to account for extended galaxies
   while still measuring accurate sky brightness within the survey area.
   The average 5s limiting magnitude is K-s = 24.4 AB mag, and the 50\%
   completeness limit is K-s = 23.75 AB mag for point-source detections,
   when using only images with better than 0.'' 7 seeing (median seeing
   0.'' 54). Star clusters are marginally resolved in these image stacks,
   and Virgo galaxies with mu(Ks) similar or equal to 24.4 AB mag
   arcsec(-2) are detected. Combining the K-s data with optical and
   ultraviolet data, we build the uiK(s) color-color diagram, which allows
   a very clean color-based selection of globular clusters in Virgo. This
   diagnostic plot will provide reliable globular cluster candidates for
   spectroscopic follow-up campaigns, needed to continue the exploration of
   Virgo's photometric and kinematic substructures, and will help the
   design of future searches for globular clusters in extragalactic
   systems. We show that the new uiK(s) diagram displays significantly
   clearer substructure in the distribution of stars, globular clusters,
   and galaxies than the gzK(s) diagram-the NGVS + NGVS-IR equivalent of
   the BzK diagram that is widely used in cosmological surveys. Equipped
   with this powerful new tool, future NGVS-IR investigations based on the
   uiK(s) diagram will address the mapping and analysis of extended
   structures and compact stellar systems in and around Virgo galaxies.}},

Abstract = {{Chloride-induced corrosion of steel in reinforced concrete structures is
   one of the main problems affecting their durability and it has been
   studied for decades, but most of them have focused on concrete without
   cracking or not subjected to any structural load. In fact, concrete
   structures are subjected to various types of loads, which lead to
   cracking when the tensile stress in concrete exceeds its tensile
   strength. Cracking could increase transport properties of concrete and
   accelerate the ingress of harmful substances (Cl-, O-2, H2O, CO2). This
   could initiate and accelerate different types of deterioration processes
   in concrete, including corrosion of steel reinforcement. The expansive
   products generated by the deterioration processes themselves can
   initiate cracking. The success of concrete patch repairs can also
   influence microcracking at the interface as well as the patch repair
   itself. Therefore, monitoring the development of microcracking in
   reinforced concrete members is extremely useful to assess the defects
   and deterioration in concrete structures. In this paper, concrete beams
   made using 4 different mixes were subjected to three levels of sustained
   lateral loading (0\%, 50\% and 100\% of the load that can induce a crack
   with width of 0.1 mm on the tension surface of beams -F-0.1) and weekly
   cycles of wetting (1 day)/drying (6 days) with chloride solution. The
   development of microcracking on the surface of concrete was monitored
   using the Autoclam Permeability System at every two weeks for 60 weeks.
   The ultrasonic pulse velocity of the concrete was also measured along
   the beam by using the indirect method during the test period. The
   results indicated that the Autoclam Permeability System was able to
   detect the development of microcracks caused by both sustained loading
   and chloride induced corrosion of steel in concrete. However, this was
   not the case with the ultrasonic method used in the work (indirect
   method applied along the beam); it was sensitive to microcracking caused
   by sustained loading but not due to corrosion.}},

Abstract = {{The Early Jurassic Upper Are and Tilje formations are an important
   mature hydrocarbon reservoir in the Smorbukk field, offshore Mid-Norway.
   The Tilje Fm. was deposited in a tide-influenced deltaic setting during
   an early syn-rift tectonic stage within a NE-SW oriented half-graben
   sub-basin. The deltaic deposits rest erosively (SB2) over the Upper Are
   shoreface units and are arranged vertically in two major sequences that
   show a diverse range of heterolithic facies preserving tide,
   combined-flow and wave-generated structures. The first sequence,
   consisting of the lower-middle Tilje (reservoir zones T1 to T3.1), is
   composed of stacked, coarsening-upward and sanding-upward distributary
   mouth bars, delta-front and prodeltaic deposits. This interval shows a
   complex vertical alternation of more proximal tidal-influenced and
   medial wave/storm-influenced successions that locally record seasonal
   variations in river discharge. The lower-middle Tilje facies
   distribution suggests overall N-NW to SE progradation of `lobe-shaped'
   deltas, oblique to the regional structural grain. The second sequence
   (reservoir zones T3.2 to T6; middle-upper Tilje) rests erosively (SB3)
   over the delta-front deposits of the underlying sequence. The sandy
   lower part of the upper sequence is capped by a regional flooding
   surface that marks the transition from the Tilje Fm to the marine Ror
   Fm. The middle-upper Tilje is composed of proximal tidal-fluvial
   distributary-channel and point-bar successions with abundant fluid-mud
   deposits. The top of the Tilje is mainly composed of medial-distal
   channelised heterolithic mouth bars and mixed tide-wave delta-front
   deposits. The propagation of blind normal faults within the study area
   and the generation of isolated syn-depositional shallow hanging-wall
   depocentres exerted a subtle control on the sediment-entry points, the
   thickness of sedimentary successions and the direction of delta
   progradation. Two main tectonic pulses are recognised, both of which are
   responsible, in whole or in part, for the two main sequence boundaries
   recognised in the succession. The first caused an abrupt change from
   wave-dominated to tide-dominated sedimentation, whereas the second is

Abstract = {{A new step-up DC/DC resonant converter is proposed in this paper for
   medium voltage DC grid in offshore wind energy system. The proposed
   converter combines two modular Asymmetrical Pulse-Width Modulated (APWM)
   resonant circuits with four strings of switch pairs. These switches are
   arranged with two pairs of two switches connected to an APWM LCL
   resonant circuit. There are several features in the proposed converter:
   (1) the multi-string arrangement of the switches allows a voltage stress
   of only a quarter of the input voltage across each power transistor; (2)
   the two modular APWM LCL resonant circuits are able to achieve high
   voltage gain so that large turns ratio high frequency transformer is
   eliminated; (3) soft switching turn-on and off are achieved in all the
   switches to enhance the overall circuit efficiency. The regulation of
   the output voltage is performed by controlling the duty cycle of the
   inner switch pair in the two resonant circuit modules. Results confirmed
   that an efficiency of at least 93.1\% is achieved on a 20kHz,
   3.3kV(rms)/40kV system for a wide range of load conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Power electronics plays an important role in the control and conversion
   of modern electric power systems. In particular, to integrate various
   renewable energies using DC transmissions and to provide more flexible
   power control in AC systems, significant efforts have been made in the
   modulation and control of power electronics devices. Pulse width
   modulation (PWM) is a well developed technology in the conversion
   between AC and DC power sources, especially for the purpose of harmonics
   reduction and energy optimization. As a fundamental decoupled control
   method, vector control with PI controllers has been widely used in power
   systems. However, significant power loss occurs during the operation of
   these devices, and the loss is often dissipated in the form of heat,
   leading to significant maintenance effort. Though much work has been
   done to improve the power electronics design, little has focused so far
   on the investigation of the controller design to reduce the controller
   energy consumption (leading to power loss in power electronics) while
   maintaining acceptable system performance. This paper aims to bridge the
   gap and investigates their correlations. It is shown a more thoughtful
   controller design can achieve better balance between energy consumption
   in power electronics control and system performance, which potentially
   leads to significant energy saving for integration of renewable power
   sources.}},

Abstract = {{In the production process of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles,
   the initial temperature of preforms plays a central role on the final
   thickness, intensity and other structural properties of the bottles.
   Also, the difference between inside and outside temperature profiles
   could make a significant impact on the final product quality. The
   preforms are preheated by infrared heating oven system which is often an
   open loop system and relies heavily on trial and error approach to
   adjust the lamp power settings. In this paper, a radial basis function
   (RBF) neural network model, optimized by a two-stage selection (TSS)
   algorithm combined with particle swarm optimization (PSO), is developed
   to model the nonlinear relations between the lamp power settings and the
   output temperature profile of PET bottles. Then an improved PSO method
   for lamp setting adjustment using the above model is presented.
   Simulation results based on experimental data confirm the effectiveness
   of the modelling and optimization method.}},

Abstract = {{Switching between the formation flight tactic and the dynamic

Abstract = {{As one of key technologies in photovoltaic converter control, Maximum

   and the power loss can over as much as 70\% due to the multiple maxima

   Tracking (RMPPT) strategy under Partially Shaded Conditions (PSCs) is
   introduced to deal with this kind of problems. An optimization problem,
   based on a predictive model which will change adaptively with

Abstract = {{The introduction of the Tesla in 2008 has demonstrated to the public of
   the potential of electric vehicles in terms of reducing fuel consumption
   and green-house gas from the transport sector. It has brought electric
   vehicles back into the spotlight worldwide at a moment when fossil fuel
   prices were reaching unexpected high due to increased demand and strong
   economic growth. The energy storage capabilities from of fleets of
   electric vehicles as well as the potentially random discharging and
   charging offers challenges to the grid in terms of operation and
   control. Optimal scheduling strategies are key to integrating large
   numbers of electric vehicles and the smart grid. In this paper,
   state-of-the-art optimization methods are reviewed on scheduling
   strategies for the grid integration with electric vehicles. The paper
   starts with a concise introduction to analytical charging strategies,
   followed by a review of a number of classical numerical optimization
   methods, including linear programming, non-linear programming, dynamic
   programming as well as some other means such as queuing theory. Meta
   heuristic techniques are then discussed to deal with the complex,
   high-dimensional and multi objective scheduling problem associated with
   stochastic charging and discharging of electric vehicles. Finally,
   future research directions are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the input-output properties of a class of control
   affine systems where the drift dynamics is generated by a metriplectic
   structure. Those systems, related to generalized (or dissipative)
   Hamiltonian systems, are generated by a conserved component and a
   dissipative component and appear, for example, in non-equilibrium
   thermodynamics. In non equilibrium thermodynamics, the two potentials
   generating the dynamics are interpreted as generalized energy and
   generalized entropy, respectively. In this note, passivity and passive
   feedback stabilization of this class of systems are studied, with the
   output function taken as the gradient of the conserved component of the
   dynamics, and the proposed storage function is computed using the
   dissipative (metric) component of the dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Among various technologies to tackle the twin challenges of sustainable
   energy supply and climate change, energy saving through advanced control
   plays a crucial role in decarbonizing the whole energy system. Modern
   control technologies, such as optimal control and model predictive
   control do provide a framework to simultaneously regulate the system
   performance and limit control energy. However, few have been done so far
   to exploit the full potential of controller design in reducing the
   energy consumption while maintaining desirable system performance. This
   paper investigates the correlations between control energy consumption
   and system performance using two popular control approaches widely used
   in the industry, namely the PI control and subspace model predictive
   control. Our investigation shows that the controller design is a
   delicate synthesis procedure in achieving better trade-off between
   system performance and energy saving, and proper choice of values for
   the control parameters may potentially save a significant amount of
   energy.}},

Abstract = {{High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) lines allow large quantities of power
   to be transferred between two points in an electrical power system. A
   Multi-Terminal HVDC (MTDC) grid consists of a meshed network of HVDC
   lines, and this allows energy reserves to be shared between a number of
   AC areas in an efficient manner. Secondary Frequency Control (SFC)
   algorithms return the frequencies in areas connected by AC or DC lines
   to their original setpoints after Primary Frequency Controllers have
   been called following a contingency. Where multiple TSOs are responsible
   for different parts of a MTDC grid it may not be possible to implement
   SFC from a centralised location. Thus, in this paper a simple gain based
   distributed Model Predictive Control strategy is proposed for Secondary
   Frequency Control of MTDC grids which allows TSOs to cooperatively
   perform SFC without the need for centralised coordination.}},

Abstract = {{Bioresorbable polymers increasingly are the materials of choice for
   implantable orthopaedic fixation devices. Controlled degradation of
   these polymers is vital for preservation of mechanical properties during
   tissue repair and controlled release of incorporated agents such as
   osteoconductive or antimicrobial additives. The work outlined in this
   paper investigates the use of low energy electron beam irradiation to
   surface modify polyhydroxyacid samples incorporating beta tricalcium
   phosphate (beta-TCP). This work uniquely demonstrates that surface
   modification of bioresorbable polymers through electron beam irradiation
   allows for the early release of incorporated agents such as bioactive
   additives. Samples were e-beam irradiated at an energy of 125 key and
   doses of either 150 kGy or 500 kGy. Irradiated and non-irradiated
   samples were degraded in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), to simulate
   bioresorption, followed by characterisation. The results show that low
   energy e-beam irradiation enhances surface hydrolytic degradation in
   comparison to bulk and furthermore allows for earlier release of
   incorporated calcium via dissolution into the surrounding medium. (C)

Abstract = {{We characterize the bulge, disk, and halo subcomponents in the Andromeda
   galaxy (M31) over the radial range 0.4 kpc < R-proj < 225 kpc. The
   cospatial nature of these subcomponents renders them difficult to
   disentangle using surface brightness (SB) information alone, especially
   interior to 20 kpc. Our new decomposidon technique combines information
   from the luminosity function (LF) of over 1.5 million bright (20 <
   M-F814w < 22) stars from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury
   (PHAT) survey, radial velocities of over 5000 red giant branch stars in
   the same magnitude range from the Spectroscopic and Photometric
   Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo (SPLASH) survey, and integrated
   I-band SB profiles from various sources. We use an affine-invariant
   Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to fit an appropriate toy model to
   these three data sets. The bulge, disk, and halo SB profiles are modeled
   as a S6rsic, exponential, and cored power-law, respectively, and the LFs
   are modeled as broken power-laws. We find that the number of stars with
   a disk-like LF is 5\% larger than the number in the dynamically cold
   component, suggesting that some stars born in the disk have been
   dynamically heated to the point that they are kinematically
   indistinguishable from halo members. This is the first kinematical
   evidence for a ``kicked-up disk{''} population in the stellar halo of
   M31. The fraction of kicked-up disk stars is consistent with that found
   in simulations. See Dorman et al. (2013) for more information.}},

   testing our understanding of structure formation in the Universe. In
   this spirit, we present a dynamical study of Virgo galaxies as part of
   the Spectroscopic and H-band Imaging of Virgo (SHIVir) survey. Ha
   rotation curves (RC) for our gas-rich galaxies were modeled with a
   multi-parameter fit function from which various velocity measurements
   were inferred. Our study takes advantage of archival and our own new
   data as we aim to compile the largest Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) for a
   cluster to date. Extended velocity dispersion profiles (VDP) are
   integrated over varying aperture sizes to extract representative
   velocity dispersions (VDs) for gas-poor galaxies. Considering the lack
   of a common standard for the measurement of a fiducial galaxy VD in the
   literature, we rectify this situation by determining the radius at which
   the measured VD yields the tightest Fundamental Plane (FP). We found
   that radius to be at least 1 Re, which exceeds the extent of most
   dispersion profiles in other works.}},

   acetone forming a carbanion intermediate by hydroxyl ions, which then
   reacted with the carbonyl group of furfural to form a water soluble C-8
   monomer (4-(furan-2-yl)-4-hydroxybutan-2-one). This C-8 monomer readily
   dehydrated to form selectively alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone
   (4-(2-furyl)-3-buten-2-one), which in turn, reacted with furfural
   forming a C-13 dimer (1,4-pentadien-3-one,1,5-di-2-furanyl). Compared
   with conventional sodium hydroxide catalyst, activated dolomite was less
   selective towards lumped C-8 monomers and C-13 dimers owing to carbon
   losses and deactivation, particularly at high temperatures. Activated
   dolomite was more selective to C-13 dimer owing to higher adsorption
   enthalpy of C-8 monomer compared with acetone competitor. Activated
   dolomite is therefore a promising catalyst to produce C-13 dimers which
   can be transformed upon hydrogenation and deep hydrodeoxygenation in
   high-quality diesel fuels. The first-order kinetic model with respect to
   furfural and acetone fitted well with actual experimental results with
   an average normalised standard deviation of 6.2\%. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A new approach for extracting stress intensity factors (SIFs) by the
   element-free Galerkin (EFG) class of methods through a modified crack
   closure integral (MCCI) scheme is proposed Its primary feature is that
   it allows accurate calculation of mode I and mode II SIFs with a
   relatively simple and straightforward analysis even when a coarser nodal
   density is employed. The details of the adoption of the MCCI technique
   in the EFG method are described. Its performance is demonstrated through
   a number of case studies including mixed-mode and thermal problems in
   linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). The results are compared with
   published theoretical solutions and those based on the displacement
   method, stress method, crack closure integral in conjunction with local
   smoothing (CCI-LS) technique, as well as the M-integral method. its
   advantages are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Critically evaluated rate coefficients in radical polymerization-7.
   Secondary-radical propagation rate coefficients for methyl acrylate in
   the bulk}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{204-212}},
Abstract = {{Propagation rate coefficient (k(p)) data for radical polymerization of
   methyl acrylate (MA) in the bulk are critically evaluated and a
   benchmark dataset is put forward by a task-group of the IUPAC
   Subcommittee on Modeling of Polymerization Kinetics and Processes. This
   dataset comprises previously published results from three laboratories
   as well as new data from a fourth laboratory. Not only do all these
   values of k(p) fulfill the recommended consistency checks for
   reliability, they are also all in excellent agreement with each other.
   Data have been obtained employing the technique of pulsed-laser
   polymerization (PLP) coupled with molar-mass determination by
   size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), where PLP has been carried out at
   pulse-repetition rates of up to 500 Hz, enabling reliable k(p) to be
   obtained through to 60 degrees C. The best-fit - and therefore
   recommended - Arrhenius parameters are activation energy E-A - 17.3 kJ
   mol(-1) and pre-exponential (frequency) factor A - 1.41 x 10(7) L
   mol(-1) s(-1). These hold for secondary-radical propagation of MA, and
   may be used to calculate effective propagation rate coefficients for MA
   in situations where there is a significant population of mid-chain
   radicals resulting from backbiting, as will be the case at technically
   relevant temperatures. The benchmark dataset reveals that k(p) values
   for MA obtained using PLP in conjunction with MALDI-ToF mass
   spectrometry are accurate. They also confirm, through comparison with
   previously obtained benchmark k(p) values for n-butyl acrylate, methyl
   methacrylate and n-butyl methacrylate, that there seems to be identical
   family-type behavior in n-alkyl acrylates as in n-alkyl methacrylates.
   Specifically, k(p) for the n-butyl member of each family is about 20\%
   higher than for the corresponding methyl member, an effect that appears
   to be entropic in origin. Furthermore, each family is characterized by
   an approximately constant E-A, where the value is 5 kJ mol(-1) lower for
   acrylates.}},

Pages = {{40-61}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Using neutral hydrogen (HI) rotation curves of 79 galaxies, culled from
   the literature, as well as measured from HI data, we present a method
   for classifying disk galaxies by their kinematics. In order to
   investigate fundamental kinematic properties we concentrate on
   non-interacting spiral galaxies. We employ a simple parameterized form
   for the rotation curve in order to derive the three parameters: the
   maximum rotational velocity, the turnover radius and a measure of the
   slope of the rotation curve beyond the turnover radius. Our approach
   uses the statistical Hierarchical Clustering method to guide our
   division of the resultant 3D distribution of galaxies into five classes.
   Comparing the kinematic classes in this preliminary classification
   scheme to a number of galaxy properties, we find that our class
   containing galaxies with the largest rotational velocities has a mean
   morphological type of Sb/Sbc while the other classes tend to later
   types. Other trends also generally agree with those described by
   previous researchers. In particular we confirm correlations between
   increasing maximum rotational velocity and the following observed
   properties: increasing brightness in B-band, increasing size of the
   optical disk (D-25) and increasing star formation rate (as derived using
   radio continuum data). Our analysis also suggests that lower velocities
   are associated with a higher ratio of the HI mass over the dynamical
   mass. Additionally, three galaxies exhibit a drop in rotational velocity
   amplitude of greater than or similar to 20\% after the turnover radius.
   However recent investigations suggest that they have interacted with
   minor companions which is a common cause for declining rotation curves.

Title = {{Comparative study on transport properties for LiFAP and LiPF6 in

Abstract = {{We present in this work a comparative study on density and transport
   properties, such as the conductivity (sigma), viscosity (eta) and
   self-diffusion coefficients (D), for electrolytes based on the lithium
   hexafluorophosphate, LiPF6; or on the lithium
   tris(pentafluoroethane)-trifluorophosphate, LiFAP dissolved in a binary
   mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethylcarbonate (DMC) (50:50
   wt\%). For each electrolyte, the temperature dependence on transport
   properties over a temperature range from 10 to 80 degrees C and 20 to 70
   degrees C for viscosity and conductivity, respectively, exhibits a
   non-Arrhenius behavior. However, this dependence is correctly correlated
   by using the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) type fitting equation. In each
   case, the best-fit parameters, such as the pseudo activation energy and
   ideal glass transition temperature were then extracted. The
   self-diffusion coefficients (D) of the Li+ cation and PF6- or FAP(-)
   anions species, in each studied electrolyte, were then independently
   determined by observing Li-3, F-19 and P-31 nuclei with the
   pulsed-gradient spin-echo (PGSE) NMR technique over the same temperature
   range from 20 to 80 degrees C. Results show that even if the diffusion
   of the lithium cation is quite similar in both electrolytes, the anions
   diffusion differs notably. In the case of the LiPF6-based electrolyte,
   for example at T approximate to 75 degrees C (high temperature), the
   self-diffusion coefficients of Li+ cations in solution (D
   (Li+)approximate to 5 x 10(-19) m(2) s(-1)) is 1.6 times smaller than
   that of PF6- anions (D (PF6-) = 8.5 x 10(-19) m(2) s(-1)), whereas in
   the case of the LiFAP-based electrolyte, FAP(-) anions diffuse at same
   rate as the Li+ cations (D (FAP(-)) = 5 x 10(-1) m(2) s(-1)). Based on
   these experimental results, the transport mobility of ions were then
   investigated through Stokes-Einstein and Nernst-Einstein equations to
   determine the transport number of lithium t(Li)(+), effective radius of
   solvated Li+ and of PF6- and FAP(-) anions, and the degree of
   dissociation of these lithium salts in the selected EC/DMC (50:50 wt\%)
   mixture over a the temperature range from 20 to 80 degrees C. This study
   demonstrates the conflicting nature of the requirements and the
   advantage of the well-balanced properties as ionic mobility and
   dissociation constant of the selected electrolytes. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, low loading platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) have been
   highly dispersed on reduced graphene oxide-supported WC nanocrystallites
   (Pt-WC/RGO) via program-controlled reduction-carburization technique and
   microwave-assisted method. The scanning electron microscopy and
   transmission electron microscopy results show that WC nanocrystallites
   are homogeneously decorated on RGO, and Pt NPs with a size of ca. 3 nm
   are dispersed on both RGO and WC. The prepared Pt-WC/RGO is used as an
   electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Compared with the
   Pt/RGO, commercial carbon-supported Pt (Pt/C) and PtRu alloy (PtRu/C)
   electrocatalysts, the Pt-WC/RGO composites demonstrate higher
   electrochemical active surface area and excellent electrocatalytic
   activity toward the methanol oxidation, such as better tolerance toward
   CO, higher peak current density, lower onset potential and long-term
   stability, which could be attributed to the characterized RGO support,
   highly dispersed Pt NPs and WC nanocrystallites and the valid
   synergistic effect resulted from the increased interface between WC and
   Pt. The present work proves that Pt-WC/RGO composites could be a
   promising alternative catalyst for direct methanol fuel cells where WC
   plays the important role as a functional additive in preparing Pt-based
   catalysts because of its CO tolerance and lower price. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   copper mediates the Ullmann-type nucleophilic aromatic substitution
   (SNAr) of 4-chloropyridine with potassium phenolate. Process conditions
   such as temperature, reactant concentrations, catalyst concentration,
   and amounts of solubilizing additive were varied to obtain the kinetic
   data. Both reactant and product concentration were found to have a
   significant effect on the reaction rate. An increased concentration of
   18-crown-6 ether, used as an alkali metal solubilizing agent for
   potassium phenolate, proved to be effective only for low conversions,
   whereas an inhibited phenolate complexation at high product
   concentrations was observed. An apparent activation energy of 55
   kJ.mol(-1) was observed for a Cu-0 catalyst in the liquid-phase coupling
   reaction in a temperature range of 100-150 degrees C. It was
   demonstrated that a Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model is
   mechanistically most likely to be obeyed for this type of surface
   reaction. A maximum adsorption enthalpy on Cu was found for the product,

Abstract = {{An algorithm is proposed for simultaneous estimation of model
   parameters, process disturbance intensities, and measurement noise
   variances for nonlinear dynamic systems that are described by stochastic
   differential equations. The proposed fully-Laplace approximation
   expectation maximization (FLAEM) algorithm uses an iterative approach
   wherein, in the first step, the model parameters are estimated using the
   approximate maximum likelihood estimation objective function developed
   by Varziri et al.,(1) assuming that disturbance intensities and noise
   variances are known. In the second step, process disturbance intensities
   and measurement noise variance estimates are updated using expressions
   that rely on the fully-Laplace approximation in the expectation
   maximization algorithm. The proposed FLAEM method is illustrated using a
   nonlinear two-state continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) example. The
   effectiveness of the FLAEM algorithm is compared with a
   maximum-likelihood based method proposed by Kristensen et al.(2) For the
   CSTR example studied, FLAEM provides more accurate parameter estimates
   and is more robust to poorly known initial guesses of parameters and to
   smaller data sets.}},

Abstract = {{We characterize the bulge, disk, and halo subcomponents in the Andromeda
   galaxy (M31) over the radial range 4 kpc < R-proj < 225 kpc. The
   cospatial nature of these subcomponents renders them difficult to
   disentangle using surface brightness (SB) information alone, especially
   interior to similar to 20 kpc. Our new decomposition technique combines
   information from the luminosity function (LF) of over 1.5 million bright
   (20 < m(814W) < 22) stars from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda
   Treasury survey, radial velocities of over 5000 red giant branch stars
   in the same magnitude range from the Spectroscopic and Photometric
   Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo survey, and integrated I-band SB
   profiles from various sources. We use an affine-invariant Markov chain
   Monte Carlo algorithm to fit an appropriate toy model to these three
   data sets. The bulge, disk, and halo SB profiles are modeled as a
   Sersic, exponential, and cored power law, respectively, and the LFs are
   modeled as broken power laws. We present probability distributions for
   each of 32 parameters describing the SB profiles and LFs of the three
   subcomponents. We find that the number of stars with a disk-like LF is
   5.2\% +/- 2.1\% larger than the number with disk-like (dynamically cold)
   kinematics, suggesting that some stars born in the disk have been
   dynamically heated to the point that they are kinematically
   indistinguishable from halo members. This is the first kinematical
   evidence for a ``kicked-up disk{''} halo population in M31. The fraction
   of kicked-up disk stars is consistent with that found in simulations. We
   also find evidence for a radially varying disk LF, consistent with a
   negative metallicity gradient in the stellar disk.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the environmentally induced cracking behavior of the NiTi
   weldment with and without post-weld heat-treatment (PWHT) in Hanks'
   solution at 37.5 degrees C at OCP was studied by tensile and cyclic
   slow-strain-rate tests (SSRT), and compared with those tested in oil (an
   inert environment). Our previous results in the tensile and cyclic SSRT
   showed that the weldment without PWHT showed high susceptibility to the
   hydrogen cracking, as evidenced by the degradation of tensile and
   super-elastic properties when testing in Hanks' solution. The weldment
   after PWHT was much less susceptible to hydrogen attack in Hanks'
   solution as no obvious degradation in the tensile and super-elastic
   properties was observed, and only a very small amount of micro-cracks
   were found in the fracture surface. The susceptibility to hydrogen
   cracking of the NiTi weldment could be alleviated by applying PWHT at
   the optimized temperature of 350 degrees C after laser welding. (C) 2013

Title = {{The stratigraphic relationship between the Shuram carbon isotope

Abstract = {{A mechanistic understanding of relationships between global glaciation,
   a putative second rise in atmospheric oxygen, the Shuram carbon isotope
   excursion, and the appearance of Ediacaran-type fossil impressions and
   bioturbation is dependent on the construction of accurate geological
   records through regional stratigraphic correlations. Here we integrate
   chemo-, litho-, and sequence-stratigraphy of fossiliferous Ediacaran
   strata in northwestern Canada. These data demonstrate that the FAD of
   Ediacara-type fossil impressions in northwestern Canada occur within a
   lowstand systems tract and above a major sequence boundary in the
   informally named June beds, not in the early Ediacaran Sheepbed
   Formation from which they were previously reported. This distinction is
   substantiated by delta C-13(carb) chemostratigraphy of the Sheepbed
   carbonate, which overlies the Sheepbed Formation, and the Gametrail
   Formation, which overlies the June beds. The Sheepbed carbonate hosts
   heavy delta C-13(carb) values whereas the Gametrail Formation contains a
   large delta C-13(carb) excursion, which we correlate with the globally
   recognized Shuram excursion. Stratigraphically above the Gametrail
   excursion, the first bilaterian burrows are present in the basal
   Blueflower Formation. Together, these data allow us to construct an age
   model for Ediacaran strata in northwestern Canada and conclude that a
   purported shift in Fe speciation in the Sheepbed Formation significantly
   predates the shift recorded above the ca. 582 Ma Gaskiers glaciation in
   Newfoundland and the first appearance of Ediacaran biota.
   The Gametrail excursion shares many characteristics with Shuram negative
   delta C-13(carb) excursion: 1) delta C-13(carb) and delta O-18(carb)
   covary; 2) delta C-13(carb) and delta C-13(org) do not covary; 3) the
   excursion is developed during a transgressive systems tract and recovers
   in an highstand systems tract; and 4) values in some sections are well
   below mantle delta C-13 input values but are variable between sections.
   We relate regional lateral variability in the magnitude and character of
   this excursion to condensation and diachronous deposition during the
   transgression and local authigenic carbonate production. In light of
   these observations, we explore a variety of models for the genesis of
   the Shuram excursion and suggest that the location and amount of
   authigenic carbonate production played a role in the excursion. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The system trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium ({[}P-66614]Cl)/mercury
   chloride (HgCl2) has been investigated by varying the stoichiometric
   ratios from 4:1 to 1:2 (25, 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 mol \% HgCl2). All
   investigated compositions turn out to give rise to ionic liquids (ILs)
   at room temperature. The prepared ionic liquids offer the possibility to
   study the structurally and compositionally versatile chloromercurates in
   a liquid state at low temperatures in the absence of solvents.
   {[}P-66614](2){[}HgCl4] is a simple IL with one discrete type of anion,
   while {[}P-66614]\{HgCl3\} (with \{\} indicating a polynuclear
   arrangement) is an ionic liquid with a variety of polyanionic species,
   with {[}Hg2Cl6](2-) apparently being the predominant building block.
   {[}P-66614](2){[}Hg3Cl8] and {[}P-66614]{[}Hg2Cl5] appear to be ILs at
   ambient conditions but lose HgCl2 when heated in a vacuum. For the
   liquids with the compositions 4:1 and 4:3, more than two discrete ions
   can be evidenced, namely, {[}P-66614](+), {[}HgCl4](2-), and Cl- and
   {[}P-66614](+), {[}HgCl4](2-), and the polynuclear \{HgCl3\}(-),
   respectively. The different stoichiometric compositions were
   characterized by Hg-199 NMR, Raman- and UV-vis spectroscopy, and cyclic
   voltammetry, among other techniques, and their densities and viscosities
   were determined. The {[}P-66614]Cl/HgCl2 system shows similarities to
   the well-known chloroaluminate ILs (e.g., decrease in viscosity with
   increasing metal content after addition of more than 0.5 mol of
   HgCl2/mol {[}P-66614]Cl, increasing density with increasing metal
   content, and the likely formation of polynuclear/polymeric/polyanionic
   species) but offer the advantage that they are air and water stable.}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater outfalls provide a natural laboratory for the study of
   nutrient dynamics in coastal seas, however if properly designed and
   operated their impact can be difficult to detect. A model was developed
   and applied to investigate the effect of variation in hydrodynamic
   conditions on the transport and dilution of a treated wastewater plume
   in Belfast Lough, Northern Ireland. To validate these predictions we
   measured the physiochemical properties of the waters surrounding the
   outfall with a specific focus on inherent plume tracers likely to be
   relevant to the study of macroalgae (salinity, nitrogen and phosphorus).
   The model performed well and our data show high dilution of the plume,
   even under neap-tide conditions. This provides a spatially and
   temporally defined predictive framework for future studies investigating
   the compliance of Northern Ireland's coastal waters with European Water
   Framework Directive objectives and for feasibility studies investigating

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{180-188}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Spacer-filled channels are employed in membrane modules in many
   industrial applications where feed-flow spacers (employed to separate
   membrane sheets and create flow channels) tend to enhance mass transport
   characteristics (and possibly) mitigate fouling and concentration
   polarization phenomena. In this work direct numerical simulation was
   performed for the flow in spacer-filled channels to obtain a better
   understanding of fluid flow phenomena in these assemblies. Reynolds
   numbers of 300, 500 and 800 were considered. The effect of spacer
   location was also studied for three different configurations: spacer at
   the centre of the channel, off-centre, and attached to the wall.
   Instantaneous velocity fields and flow structures, such as boundary
   layer separation on the walls and on the cylinder, eddies on the walls,
   recirculation regions and vortex shedding were investigated. A Fourier
   analysis was carried out on the time series velocity data. Using this
   analysis the Strouhal number was calculated and the development of the
   flow towards a broader turbulent state at higher Reynolds number was
   captured. Other statistical characteristics such as time-averaged
   velocities and wall shear rates are obtained and discussed. The average
   pressure loss was calculated for the channels and found to be highest
   for spacer at the centre of the channel and lowest for spacer attached
   to the wall. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   The coordinated-distributed control scheme proposed in this work
   benefits from using local model predictive controllers that can be

   The ``price-driven{''} method is used to coordinate the local
   controllers. Newton's method, along with a sensitivity analysis
   technique, is used to update the price in the price-driven method.
   Convergence of the performance obtained with the CDMPC controllers to
   the plantwide optimal performance is shown. Simulation examples,
   including a forced-circulation evaporator process, are used to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed coordinated-distributed

Abstract = {{Scour around bridge foundations is one of the leading causes of bridge
   failure. Up until recently, the monitoring of this phenomenon was
   primarily based around using underwater instrumentation to monitor the
   progression of scour holes as they develop around foundation systems.
   Vibration based damage detection techniques have been used to detect
   damage in bridge beams. The application of these vibration based methods
   to the detection of scour has come to the fore in research in recent
   years. This paper examines the effect that scour has on the frequency
   response of a driven pile foundation system, similar to those used to
   support road and rail bridges. The effect of scour on the vibration
   characteristics of the pile is examined using laboratory and field
   testing. It is clear that there is a very clear reduction in the natural
   frequency of the pile as the severity of scour increases. It is shown
   that by combining state-of-the-art geotechnical techniques with
   relatively simple finite element modelling approaches, it is possible to
   accurately predict the natural frequency of the pile for a given scour
   depth. Therefore, the paper proposes a method that would allow the
   estimation of scour depth for a given observed pile frequency. (C) 2013

Title = {{Analyzing Kernel Matrices for the Identification of Differentially
   Expressed Genes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{One of the most important applications of microarray data is the class
   prediction of biological samples. For this purpose, statistical tests
   have often been applied to identify the differentially expressed genes
   (DEGs), followed by the employment of the state-of-the-art learning
   machines including the Support Vector Machines (SVM) in particular. The
   SVM is a typical sample-based classifier whose performance comes down to
   how discriminant samples are. However, DEGs identified by statistical
   tests are not guaranteed to result in a training dataset composed of
   discriminant samples. To tackle this problem, a novel gene ranking
   method namely the Kernel Matrix Gene Selection (KMGS) is proposed. The
   rationale of the method, which roots in the fundamental ideas of the SVM
   algorithm, is described. The notion of `'the separability of a sample''
   which is estimated by performing t-like statistics on each column of the
   kernel matrix, is first introduced. The separability of a classification
   problem is then measured, from which the significance of a specific gene
   is deduced. Also described is a method of Kernel Matrix Sequential
   Forward Selection (KMSFS) which shares the KMGS method's essential ideas
   but proceeds in a greedy manner. On three public microarray datasets,
   our proposed algorithms achieved noticeably competitive performance in
   terms of the B.632+ error rate.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Volume = {{103}},

Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{The long-term luminance decay of sandwich polymer light-emitting
   electrochemical cells has been investigated. The cells have been
   operated multiple times over a period of four months, all under a
   constant current density of 167 mA/cm(2). In-between the
   constant-current runs, the cells were stored at room temperature for up
   to two months. We identify several factors that affect the luminance and
   its decay. The peak luminance reached during the virgin runs decreases
   if the cells are stored after the deposition of the top electrode.
   During operation, the luminance also decreases after reaching a peak
   value. However, extended storage at room temperature leads to the
   recovery of the peak luminance. The luminance recovery can be attributed
   to the relaxation of doping which reverses the effect of luminescence
   quenching. A long term, irreversible luminance decay is also observed
   and attributed to the formation of non-emitting, non-conductive black
   spots which leads to the loss of emitting area and an increased
   effective current density. The results illustrate the importance both On
   and Off states in characterizing the stability of polymer LECs. (C) 2013

Title = {{Analysis of Dependence Tracking Algorithms for Task Dataflow Execution}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Processor architectures has taken a turn toward many-core processors,
   which integrate multiple processing cores on a single chip to increase
   overall performance, and there are no signs that this trend will stop in
   the near future. Many-core processors are harder to program than
   multicore and single-core processors due to the need for writing
   parallel or concurrent programs with high degrees of parallelism.
   Moreover, many-cores have to operate in a mode of strong scaling because
   of memory bandwidth constraints. In strong scaling, increasingly
   finer-grain parallelism must be extracted in order to keep all
   processing cores busy.
   Task dataflow programming models have a high potential to simplify
   parallel programming because they alleviate the programmer from
   identifying precisely all intertask dependences when writing programs.
   Instead, the task dataflow runtime system detects and enforces intertask
   dependences during execution based on the description of memory accessed
   by each task. The runtime constructs a task dataflow graph that captures
   all tasks and their dependences. Tasks are scheduled to execute in
   parallel, taking into account dependences specified in the task graph.
   Several papers report important overheads for task dataflow systems,
   which severely limits the scalability
   and usability of such systems. In this article, we study efficient
   schemes to manage task graphs and analyze their scalability. We assume a
   programming model that supports input, output, and in/out annotations on
   task arguments, as well as commutative in/out and reductions. We analyze
   the structure of task graphs and identify versions and generations as
   key concepts for efficient management of task graphs. Then, we present
   three schemes to manage task graphs building on graph representations,
   hypergraphs, and lists. We also consider a fourth edgeless scheme that
   synchronizes tasks using integers. Analysis using microbenchmarks shows
   that the graph representation is not always scalable and that the
   edgeless scheme introduces least overhead in nearly all situations.}},

Abstract = {{P hosphorous slag (PHS), ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) and
   fly ash (FA) were used as replacements of Portland cement to modify the
   microstructure of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). A new manufacturing
   method named ``W3T4{''} was proposed to improve the performances of
   interfacial transition zone (ITZ) between recycled aggregate and mortar.
   The mechanical properties and the durability of RAC were tested, which
   show that this new manufacturing method improves the properties of RAC,
   and the GGBS with finest size makes a great contribution to the
   performance of RAC due to its better filling effect and much earlier
   pozzolanic reaction. Combined with GGBS, the effects of PHS on the
   retardation of setting time can be alleviated and the synergistic effect
   helps to make a more compact RAC. For the RAC with 25\% of the recycled
   aggregate (RA) replacement and 10\% PHS + 10\% GGBS additives, the
   compressive strength increases by 25.4\%, but the permeability decreases
   by 64.3\% with respect to the reference concrete made with nature
   aggregates. The micro-mechanisms of these improvements were investigated
   by the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The SEM images show that the
   new manufacturing method, adding superfine pozzolanic powders and
   super-plasticizer benefits, makes a much denser ITZ in RAC.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes and analyzes cognitive multihop decode-and-forward
   networks in the presence of interference due to channel estimation
   errors. To reduce interference on the primary network, a simple yet
   effective back-off control power method is applied for secondary
   multihop networks. For a given threshold of interference probability at
   the primary network, we derive the maximum back-off control power
   coefficient, which provides the best performance for secondary multihop
   networks. Moreover, it is shown that the number of hops for secondary
   network is upper-bounded under the fixed settings of the primary
   network. For secondary multihop networks, new exact and asymptotic
   expressions for outage probability (OP), bit error rate (BER) and
   ergodic capacity over Rayleigh fading channels are derived. Based on the
   asymptotic OP and BEP, a pivotal conclusion is reached that the
   secondary multihop network offers the same diversity order as compared
   with the network without back off. Finally, we verify the performance
   analysis through various numerical examples which confirm the
   correctness of our analysis for many channel and system settings and
   provide new insight into the design and optimization of cognitive

Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{Barchan dunes are bed forms found in many sedimentary environments with
   a limited supply of sediment, and may occur in isolation or in more
   complex dune fields. Barchans have a crescentic planform morphology with
   horns elongated in the downflow direction. To study flow over barchan
   dunes, we performed large eddy simulations in a channel with different
   interdune spacings at a flow Reynolds number, Re similar or equal to
   26,000 (based on the free stream velocity and channel height). The
   largest interdune spacing (2.38, where is the wavelength of the barchan
   dune) presents similar characteristics to a solitary dune in isolation,
   indicating that, at this distance, the sheltering effect of the upstream
   dune is rather weak. Barchan dunes induce two counterrotating streamwise
   vortices, one along each of the horns, which direct high-momentum fluid
   toward the symmetry plane and low-momentum fluid near the bed away from
   the centerline. The flow close to the centerline plane separates at the
   crest, but away from the centerline plane, and along the horns, flow
   separation occurs intermittently. The flow in the separation bubble is
   directed toward the horns and leaves the dune at its tips. The internal
   boundary layer developing on the bed downstream of the reattachment
   region develops similarly for various interdune spacings; the
   development slows down 14.5 dune heights downstream. The turbulent
   kinetic energy budgets show the importance of pressure transport and
   mean flow advection in transferring energy from the overlying wake layer
   to the internal boundary layer over the stoss side. For closely spaced
   dunes, the bed shear stress is 30\% larger than at the largest spacing,
   and instantaneous coherent high- and low-speed streaks are shorter but
   stronger. Coherent eddies in the separated shear layer are generated
   more frequently for smaller interdune spacing, where they move farther
   away from the bed, toward the free surface, and remain located between
   the horns.}},

   DOUBLE-LOBED RADIO SOURCE}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{146}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This third paper in the Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies an EVLA
   Survey (CHANG-ES) series shows the first results from our regular data
   taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The edge-on galaxy, UGC
   10288, has been observed in the B, C, and D configurations at L band
   (1.5 GHz) and in the C and D configurations at C band (6 GHz) in all
   polarization products. We show the first spatially resolved images of
   this galaxy in these bands, the first polarization images, and the first
   composed image at an intermediate frequency (4.1 GHz) which has been
   formed from a combination of all data sets. A surprising new result is
   the presence of a strong, polarized, double-lobed extragalactic radio
   source (CHANG-ES A) almost immediately behind the galaxy and
   perpendicular to its disk. The core of CHANG-ES A has an optical
   counterpart (SDSS J161423.28-001211.8) at a photometric redshift of
   z(phot) = 0.39; the southern radio lobe is behind the disk of UGC 10288
   and the northern lobe is behind the halo region. This background
   ``probe{''} has allowed us to do a preliminary Faraday rotation analysis
   of the foreground galaxy, putting limits on the regular magnetic field
   and electron density in the halo of UGC 10288 in regions in which there
   is no direct detection of a radio continuum halo. We have revised the
   flux densities of the two sources individually as well as the star
   formation rate (SFR) for UGC 10288. The SFR is low (0.4-0.5 M-circle dot
   yr(-1)) and the galaxy has a high thermal fraction (44\% at 6 GHz), as
   estimated using both the thermal and non-thermal SFR calibrations of
   Murphy et al. UGC 10288 would have fallen well below the CHANG-ES flux
   density cutoff, had it been considered without the brighter contribution
   of the background source. UGC 10288 shows discrete high-latitude radio
   continuum features, but it does not have a global radio continuum halo
   (exponential scale heights are typically approximate to 1 kpc averaged
   over regions with and without extensions). One prominent feature appears
   to form a large arc to the north of the galaxy on its east side,
   extending to 3.5 kpc above the plane. The total minimum magnetic field
   strength at a sample position in the arc is similar to 10 mu G. Thus,
   this galaxy still appears to be able to form substantial high latitude,
   localized features in spite of its relatively low SFR.}},

Title = {{A Hybrid Learning Method for Constructing Compact Rule-Based Fuzzy
   Models}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS}},

Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The Takagi-Sugeno-Kang-type rule-based fuzzy model has found many
   applications in different fields; a major challenge is, however, to
   build a compact model with optimized model parameters which leads to
   satisfactory model performance. To produce a compact model, most
   existing approaches mainly focus on selecting an appropriate number of
   fuzzy rules. In contrast, this paper considers not only the selection of
   fuzzy rules but also the structure of each rule premise and consequent,
   leading to the development of a novel compact rule-based fuzzy model.
   Here, each fuzzy rule is associated with two sets of input attributes,
   in which the first is used for constructing the rule premise and the
   other is employed in the rule consequent. A new hybrid learning method
   combining the modified harmony search method with a fast recursive
   algorithm is hereby proposed to determine the structure and the
   parameters for the rule premises and consequents. This is a hard
   mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem, and the proposed hybrid
   method solves the problem by employing an embedded framework, leading to
   a significantly reduced number of model parameters and a small number of
   fuzzy rules with each being as simple as possible. Results from three
   examples are presented to demonstrate the compactness (in terms of the
   number of model parameters and the number of rules) and the performance
   of the fuzzy models obtained by the proposed hybrid learning method, in
   comparison with other techniques from the literature.}},

   poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-D,L-lactide) (5446DLLACL) and
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-trimethylene carbonate) (7030TMCCL). The
   scaffolds were assessed for injectability, two-phase interconnectivity,
   fatigue resistance, and long-term static culture behavior. The 7030TMCCL
   scaffolds demonstrated decreased moduli of 17\% after 1 X 10(6) cycles
   at 30\% strain and 5\% after 56 days in culture, compared to the
   5446DLLACL scaffolds, which exhibited decreases of 58 and 68\%,

Abstract = {{Ice-directional indicators were compiled from detailed field mapping at
   the Izok Lake volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit, in the Point Lake
   region of western Nunavut and eastern Northwest Territories.
   Cross-cutting erosional relationships and depositional landforms

   It is this new glacial history interpretation that is used to explain
   the gahnite indicator mineral dispersal train down-ice of the Izok Lake
   deposit as being the net effect of all ice-flow phases. Its fan-shaped
   morphology is a function of the duration and intensity of two dominant
   glacial trajectories. Field-based mapping of all glacial-flow indicators
   are essential, and must be properly interpreted, to detect palimpsest
   dispersal trains. The resultant dispersal fan serves as a model for
   future exploration in the glaciated terrain of the north-central part of

Abstract = {{This study validated the feasibility of inertial sensors in estimating
   lower limb joint kinematics during stair ambulation in healthy older
   adults and stroke survivors. Three dimensional motion data were
   collected using an inertial sensor-based system from 9 persons with
   stroke and 9 healthy older adults as they ascended and descended a
   staircase at a self-selected pace. The measured joint angles were
   compared with a laboratory-based motion capture system by computing
   differences in range of motion (RoM), grand mean error, standard
   deviation, and coefficients of multiple correlations. For stroke
   survivors, differences in RoM measurements between these two systems
   were determined to be 3.3 +/- 8.1 degrees, while the highest
   correlations were found in the estimation of sagittal plane joint angles
   after offset correction. Results suggest that the inertial sensor system
   is suitable for estimating major joint angles in healthy older adults as
   well as the RoM for stroke survivors. New calibration procedures are
   necessary for applying the technology to a stroke population.}},

Abstract = {{Downie Slide has been interpreted as a massive, composite rockslide, and
   a number of landslide zones have been defined based on the
   interpretation of morphological features and a detailed assessment of
   spatially discriminated slope behaviour. Key factors controlling the
   mechanics of massive slow-moving landslides can be interpreted through
   the observation and detailed study of the slope behaviour and physical
   characteristics. Once identified, key components influencing slope
   deformation can be tested using three-dimensional numerical models. Two
   series of numerical simulations have been developed to test how
   explicitly defined internal shear zones, and the interaction between
   landslide morphological regions, influence global landslide behaviour.
   Results from these numerical simulations, when compared to field
   monitoring data, indicate that internal shear zones have little
   influence on Downie Slide deformation, while the interaction between
   morphological zones plays a larger role in slope kinematics.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of a viscous liquid injectable delivery system composed of
   poly(5-ethylene ketal epsilon-caprolactone-co-D,L-lactide) (PEKCDLLA) to
   release bioactive vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
   hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) using an osmotic pressure release
   mechanism for the purpose of treating critical limb ischernia was
   investigated. VEGF and HGF were lyophilized separately with trehalose
   and bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incorporated into the polymer by
   simple mixing. VEGF and HGF were released by convective flow through
   superhydrated regions formed within the polymer as a result of the
   osmotic activity generated upon dissolution of the particles, along with
   the contributions of polymer degradation at later time points. A
   sustained release of highly bioactive VEGF and HGF for over 40 days with
   minimal burst was achieved under conditions of multidirectional
   delivery. The solubility of the growth factors in the concentrated
   trehalose solution formed upon dissolution of the particle within the
   polymer was determined to be a key parameter governing the rate and
   extent of growth factor release. This formulation approach, of using a
   low viscosity polymer delivery vehicle, is potentially useful for
   localized delivery of acid and temperature sensitive proteins, such as
   VEGF and HGF. This system may also serve as a platform for controlled
   and predictable delivery patterns for other therapeutic proteins in
   other clinical settings.}},

Title = {{Predator cue studies reveal strong trait-mediated effects in communities

Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{Nonconsumptive or trait-mediated effects of predators on their prey
   often outweigh density-mediated interactions where predators consume
   prey. For instance, predator presence can alter prey behaviour,
   physiology, morphology and/or development. Despite a burgeoning
   literature, our ability to identify general patterns in prey behavioural
   responses may be influenced by the inconsistent methodologies of
   predator cue experiments used to assess trait-mediated effects. We
   therefore conducted a meta-analysis to highlight variables (e. g. water
   type, predator husbandry, exposure time) that may influence invertebrate
   prey's behavioural responses to fish predator cues. This revealed that
   changes in prey activity and refuge use were remarkably consistent
   overall, despite wide differences in experimental methodologies. Our
   meta-analysis shows that invertebrates altered their behaviour to
   predator cues of both fish that were fed the focal invertebrate and
   those that were fed other prey types, which suggests that invertebrates
   were not responding to specific diet information in the fish cues.
   Invertebrates also altered their behaviour regardless of predator cue
   addition regimes and fish satiation levels. Cue intensity and exposure
   time did not have significant effects on invertebrate behaviour. We also
   highlight that potentially confounding factors, such as parasitism, were
   rarely recorded in sufficient detail to assess the magnitude of their
   effects. By examining the likelihood of detecting trait-mediated effects
   under large variations in experimental design, our study demonstrates
   that trait-mediated effects are likely to have pervasive and powerful
   influences in nature. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published on behalf of The

Abstract = {{In this investigation, the seismic torsional response of a multi-storey
   concentrically braced frame (CBF) plan irregular structure is evaluated
   numerically and experimentally through a series of hybrid tests. CBF
   structures have become popular in seismic design because they are one of
   the most efficient types of steel structures to resist earthquake
   loading. However, their response under plan irregular conditions has
   received little focus mostly in part due to their complex behaviour
   under seismic loading conditions. The majority of research on the
   seismic response of plan irregular structures is based purely on
   numerical investigations. This paper provides much needed experimental
   investigation of the seismic response of a CBF plan irregular structure
   with the aim of characterising the response of this class of structure.
   The effectiveness of the Eurocode 8 torsional effects provision as a
   method of designing for low levels of mass eccentricity is evaluated.
   Results indicate that some of the observations made by purely numerical
   models are valid in that; torsionally stiff structures perform well and
   the stiff side of the structure is subjected to a greater ductility
   demand compared to the flexible side of the structure. The Eurocode 8
   torsional effects provision is shown to be adequate in terms of
   ductility and interstorey drift however the structure performs poorly in
   terms of floor rotation. Importantly, stiffness eccentricity occurs when
   the provision is applied to the structure when no mass eccentricity
   exists and results in a significant increase in floor rotations.}},

   synthesis of new 1,2-aminoalcohol enantiomers as potential chiral
   ligands and synthetic scaffolds for library generation. These apparently
   simple substitution reactions proved to be more complex than initially
   anticipated and were found to involve a combination of different
   reaction mechanisms. Allylic trans-1,2-azidohydrins were prepared by
   Lewis acid-catalysed ring-opening of cyclic vinyl epoxides with sodium
   azide via an S(N)2 mechanism. On heating, these trans-1,2-azidohydrins
   isomerized to the corresponding trans-1,4-azidohydrins via a suprafacial
   allyl azide {[}3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement mechanism. Conversion of a
   1,2-azidohydrin to a 1,2-azidoacetate moved the equilibrium position in
   favour of the 1,4-substitution product. Allylic trans-1,2-bromoacetates
   reacted with sodium azide at room temperature to give C-2 and C-4
   substituted products. A clean inversion of configuration at C-2 was
   found, as expected, from a concerted S(N)2-pathway. However,
   substitution at C-4 was not stereoselective and resulted in mixtures of
   1,4-cis and 1,4-trans products. This observation can be rationalized in
   terms of competitive S(N)2 and S(N)2 reactions allied to a
   {[}3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. cis-1,2-Azidohydrins and
   cis-1,2-azidoacetates were much more prone to rearrange than the
   corresponding trans-isomers. Reaction of the softer tosamide nucleophile
   with trans-1,2-bromoacetates resulted, predominantly, in C-4
   substitution via a syn-S(N)2 mechanism. One application of the reaction
   of secondary amines with allylic cyclohexene epoxides, to give
   trans-1,2-aminoalcohols, is in the synthesis of the anticholinergic drug
   vesamicol, via an S(N)2 mechanism. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{A small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) study of nanovoids in 99.988 and
   99.995at.\% aluminium is presented. Absolute intensity calibration using
   a glassy carbon standard is used to extract the weak SAXS signature from
   nanovoids introduced by thermal quenching. SAXS analysis methods,
   including Guinier, Porod and Indirect Transform, are used to obtain
   values for the void-size, number distribution and volume fraction, as
   well as measures of the void-metal matrix interface structure in
   quenched aluminium samples. The SAXS analysis has identified a residual
   impurity effect on void formation and has been used to characterize
   trends in nanovoid size, number distribution and interface structure as
   a function of ageing time at elevated temperatures (artificial ageing).
   The work presented here, including identification of experimental tools
   that can be readily improved, demonstrates that SAXS studies are capable
   of providing precise characterization of nanovoid structure in
   aluminium. This level of information will be useful in developing
   phenomenological models of void nucleation and growth capable of linking
   atomic scale phenomena to macroscopic material properties.}},

Abstract = {{Cells are known to respond differently when grown on materials of
   varying stiffness. However, the mechanism by which a cell senses
   substrate stiffness is unknown. Lower crosslink density elastomers
   formed from acrylated star-poly(D,L lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone)
   have previously been shown to support higher smooth muscle cell
   proliferation in in vitro culture. This difference in growth was
   hypothesized to be due to differences in protein adsorption that
   resulted from differences in polymer chain mobility at the surface.
   Therefore, layer mass and viscoelastic properties were measured for HSA,
   IgG, fibronectin, vitronectin, and serum supplemented media adsorbed to
   elastomers of two crosslink densities. Significantly more fibronectin
   adsorbed to the lower crosslink density surface while significantly more
   IgG adsorbed to the higher crosslink density surface. Furthermore,
   differences in fibronectin and IgG layer shear moduli were observed,
   suggesting that there was a difference in the conformation of the
   adsorbed protein. ATR-FTIR analysis showed that the lower crosslink
   density elastomer absorbed more surface water. The increased amount of
   water may cause greater entropic gains upon protein adsorption to the
   lower crosslink density surface, which increases total protein
   adsorption from serum and may cause differences in protein conformation
   and thus cell behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, a facile method was developed for preparing high concentration
   of monodispersed gold nanoparticles (NPs) at room temperature from
   gold(III) chloride by using different media based on
   N,N-dimethylformamide or water solutions containing a protic ionic
   liquid (PIL), namely, the octylammonium formate or the
   bis(2-ethyl-hexyl)ammonium formate, based on which both PILs were used
   as redox-active structuring media. The formation of gold NPs in these
   systems was then characterized using UV-visible spectroscopy,
   transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering. From
   these investigations, it appears that the structure and aggregation
   pathway of PILs in selected solvents affect strongly the formation,
   growth, the shape, and the size of gold NPs. In fact, by using this
   approach, the shape-/ size-controlled gold NPs (branched and spherical)
   can be generated under mild condition. This approach suggests also a
   wealth of potential for these designer nanomaterials within the
   biomedical, materials, and catalysis communities by using designer and
   safer media based on PILs.}},

Abstract = {{The China Low Activation Martensitic (CLAM) steel has been developed as
   a candidate structural material for future fusion reactors. It is
   essential to investigate the evolution of microstructure and changes of
   mechanical properties of CLAM steel during thermal exposure. In this
   study, the long-term thermal aging of the CLAM steel has been carried
   out in air at 600 degrees C and 650 degrees C for 1100 h, 3000 h and
   5000 h. The microstructural evolution with aging time was studied,
   including characteristics of the growth of M23C6 carbides and the
   formation of Laves-phase precipitates as well as the evolved subgrains.
   The microstructural evolution leads to the changes of mechanical
   properties of the CLAM steel. The Ductile-Brittle Transition Temperature
   (DBTT) increases significantly during the thermal aging, which is
   related to the formation of Laves-phase in the steel matrix. The
   possible mechanism of stabilizing microstructure during the thermal
   exposure has been analyzed based on the interaction between M23C6
   carbides and subgrain boundaries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{111-119}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The hybrid test method is a relatively recently developed dynamic
   testing technique that uses numerical modelling combined with
   simultaneous physical testing. The concept of substructuring allows the
   critical or highly nonlinear part of the structure that is difficult to
   numerically model with accuracy to be physically tested whilst the
   remainder of the structure, that has a more predictable response, is
   numerically modelled. In this paper, a substructured soft-real time
   hybrid test is evaluated as an accurate means of performing seismic
   tests of complex structures. The structure analysed is a three-storey,
   two-by-one bay concentrically braced frame (CBF) steel structure
   subjected to seismic excitation. A ground storey braced frame
   substructure whose response is critical to the overall response of the
   structure is tested, whilst the remainder of the structure is
   numerically modelled. OpenSees is used for numerical modelling and
   OpenFresco is used for the communication between the test equipment and
   numerical model. A novel approach using OpenFresco to define the complex
   numerical substructure of an X-braced frame within a hybrid test is also
   presented. The results of the hybrid tests are compared to purely
   numerical models using OpenSees and a simulated test using a combination
   of OpenSees and OpenFresco. The comparative results indicate that the
   test method provides an accurate and cost effective procedure for
   performing full scale seismic tests of complex structural systems. (C)

Abstract = {{Principal component analysis is a powerful tool in biomechanics for
   reducing complex multivariate datasets to a subset of important
   parameters. However, interpreting the biomechanical meaning of these
   parameters can be a subjective process. Biomechanical interpretations
   that are based on visual inspection of extreme 5th and 95th percentile
   waveforms may be confounded when extreme waveforms express more than one
   biomechanical feature. This study compares interpretation of principal
   components using representative extremes with a recently developed
   method, called single component reconstruction, which provides an
   uncontaminated visualization of each individual biomechanical feature.
   Example datasets from knee joint moments, lateral gastrocnemius EMG, and
   lumbar spine kinematics are used to demonstrate that the representative
   extremes method and single component reconstruction can yield equivalent
   interpretations of principal components. However, single component
   reconstruction interpretation cannot be contaminated by other
   components, which may enhance the use and understanding of principal
   component analysis within the biomechanics community. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Focus ion beam preparation of transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   samples has become increasingly popular due to the relative ease of
   extraction of TEM foils from specific locations within a larger sample.
   However the sputtering damage induced by Ga ion bombardment in focus ion
   beam means that traditional electropolishing may be a preferable method.
   First, we describe a special electropolishing method for the preparation
   of irregular TEM samples from ex-service nuclear reactor components,
   spring-shaped spacers. This method has also been used to prepare samples
   from a nonirradiated component for a TEM in situ heavy ion irradiation
   study. Because the specimen size is small (0.7 x 0.7 x 3 mm), a sandwich
   installation is adopted to obtain high quality polishing. Second, we
   describe some modifications to a conventional TEM cross-section sample
   preparation method that employs Ni electroplating. There are limitations
   to this method when preparing cross-section samples from either (1)
   metals which are difficult to activate for electroplating, or (2) a
   heavy ion irradiated foil with a very shallow damage layer close to the
   surface, which may be affected by the electroplating process. As a
   consequence, a novel technique for preparing cross-section samples was
   developed and is described.}},

   coaxial air jet, created by an innovative nozzle design for an air
   propane torch, used for the thermal deposition of polymers. This design
   includes staggering the origins of the central and annular jets and
   creating an annular air jet with an inward radial velocity component.
   The experimental work used a Pitot tube to measure axial velocity on the
   jet centerline and in the fully developed flow. The static gauge
   pressure in the near field was also measured and found to be positive,
   an unexpected result. The numerical work used Gambit and Fluent. An
   extensive grid sensitivity study was conducted and it was found that
   results from a relatively coarse mesh were substantially the same as
   results from a mesh with almost 11 times the number of control volumes.
   A thorough evaluation of all of the RANS models in Fluent 6.3.26 found
   that the flow fields they calculated showed at most partial agreement
   with the experimental results. The greatest difference between numerical
   and experimental results was the incorrect prediction by all RANS models
   of a recirculation zone in the near field on the jet axis. Experimental

Abstract = {{Autonomous science augments the capabilities of planetary rovers by
   shifting the identification and selection of science targets from remote
   operators to the rover itself. This shift frees the rover from wasteful
   idle time and allows for more selective data collection. This paper
   presents an approach to autonomous science that is comprised of three
   components: a Bayesian network that uses image data to identify
   features; an evaluation algorithm that selects the best features; and, a
   path-planning algorithm that guides the rover to the most scientifically
   valuable features. Within this framework, the effectiveness of pairing a
   larger prime rover with a smaller scout rover to improve autonomous
   science is investigated. Laboratory-based experiments were used to
   validate the effectiveness of the Bayesian network for feature
   identification and the scoring algorithm that has been developed for
   feature evaluation. Simulations were used to compare the traditional use
   of a solo prime rover to that of also employing a scout. The results
   presented here indicate that the inclusion of a scout rover can allow
   the prime rover to avoid pitfalls or routes with low scientific value.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach for introducing aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNTs) in a carbon-fibre composite pre-impregnated (prepreg) laminate,

   Carbon nanotube (CNT) `forests' were grown on a silicon substrate with a
   thermal oxide layer, using a chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process.
   The forests were then transferred to a pre-cured laminate interface,
   using a combination of pressure and heat, while maintaining
   through-thickness CNT alignment. Standard Mode I and four-point bend
   end-notched flexure Mode II tests were undertaken on a set of specimens
   and compared with pristine specimens. Mode I fracture toughness for
   T700/M21 laminates was improved by an average of 31\% while for
   T700/SE84LV specimens, an improvement of 61\% was observed. Only
   T700/M21 specimens were tested in Mode II which yielded an average
   fracture toughness improvement of 161\%. Scanning Electron Microscopy
   (SEM) showed good wetting of the CNT forest as well as evidence of
   penetration of the forest into the adjacent plies. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Ni/K-MgO-ZrO2 catalysts for dry reforming of methane, with a range of
   Mg/Zr ratios and each containing about 10 wt\% Ni, were prepared via Ni
   nitrate impregnation on MgO-ZrO2 supports synthesized by
   co-precipitation using K2CO3. It was found that a proportion of the
   potassium of the precipitant remained in the samples and improved the
   stability of the catalysts in the reaction. It was also shown that
   reduction of the catalysts at 1,023 K without calcination in air is
   necessary for stable and high activity; calcination in air at 1,073 K
   gives a deterioration of the catalytic properties, leading to rapid
   deactivation during the reaction. The order of the CH4 conversions of
   the reduced catalysts after 14 h on stream was as follows: Ni/K-Mg5Zr2
   similar to Ni/K-Mg a parts per thousand yen Ni/K-Mg2Zr5 a parts per
   thousand << Ni/K-Zr. A catalyst with 0.95 wt\% K on MgO-ZrO2 with a
   Mg:Zr mole ratio of 5:2 showed the best resistance to deactivation.
   Experiments in a microbalance system showed that there was only
   negligible coke deposition on the surface of this sample. This behaviour
   was attributed to the presence of Ni nanoparticles with a diameter of
   less than 10 nm located on a MgO/NiO solid solution shell doped by K
   ions; this in turn covers a core of tetragonal ZrO2 and/or a MgO/ZrO2
   solid solution. This conclusion was supported by EDS/TEM, XPS, XRD and
   H-2 chemisorption measurements.}},

Title = {{Tracking the cellulolytic activity of Clostridium thermocellum biofilms}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Microbial cellulose conversion by Clostridium thermocellum
   27405 occurs predominantly through the activity of substrate-adherent
   bacteria organized in thin, primarily single cell-layered biofilms. The
   importance of cellulosic surface exposure to microbial hydrolysis has
   received little attention despite its implied impact on conversion
   kinetics.
   Results: We showed the spatial heterogeneity of fiber distribution in
   pure cellulosic sheets, which made direct measurements of biofilm
   colonization and surface penetration impossible. Therefore, we utilized
   on-line measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) production in
   continuous-flow reactors, in conjunction with confocal imaging, to
   observe patterns of biofilm invasion and to indirectly estimate
   microbial accessibility to the substrate's surface and the resulting
   limitations on conversion kinetics. A strong positive correlation was
   found between cellulose consumption and CO2 production (R-2 = 0.996) and
   between surface area and maximum biofilm activity (R-2 = 0.981). We
   observed an initial biofilm development rate (0.46 h(-1), 0.34 h(-1) and
   0.33 h(-1)) on Whatman sheets (\#1, \#598 and \#3, respectively) that
   stabilized when the accessible surface was maximally colonized. The
   results suggest that cellulose conversion kinetics is initially subject
   to a microbial limitation period where the substrate is in excess,
   followed by a substrate limitation period where cellular mass, in the
   form of biofilms, is not limiting. Accessible surface area acts as an
   important determinant of the respective lengths of these two distinct
   periods. At end-point fermentation, all sheets were digested
   predominantly under substrate accessibility limitations (e. g., up to
   81\% of total CO2 production for Whatman \#1). Integration of CO2
   production rates over time showed Whatman \#3 underwent the fastest
   conversion efficiency under microbial limitation, suggestive of best
   biofilm penetration, while Whatman \#1 exhibited the least recalcitrance
   and the faster degradation during the substrate limitation period.
   Conclusion: The results showed that the specific biofilm development
   rate of cellulolytic bacteria such as C. thermocellum has a notable
   effect on overall reactor kinetics during the period of microbial
   limitation, when ca. 20\% of cellulose conversion occurs. The study
   further demonstrated the utility of on-line CO2 measurements as a method
   to assess biofilm development and substrate digestibility pertaining to
   microbial solubilization of cellulose, which is relevant when
   considering feedstock pre-treatment options.}},

Title = {{Identification of the IGF1/PI3K/NF kappa B/ERK gene signalling networks
   associated with chemotherapy resistance and treatment response in
   high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy remains a major
   impediment in the treatment of serous epithelial ovarian cancer. The
   objective of this study was to use gene expression profiling to
   delineate major deregulated pathways and biomarkers associated with the
   development of intrinsic chemotherapy resistance upon exposure to
   standard first-line therapy for ovarian cancer.
   Methods: The study cohort comprised 28 patients divided into two groups
   based on their varying sensitivity to first-line chemotherapy using
   progression free survival (PFS) as a surrogate of response. All 28
   patients had advanced stage, high-grade serous ovarian cancer, and were
   treated with standard platinum-based chemotherapy. Twelve patient
   tumours demonstrating relative resistance to platinum chemotherapy
   corresponding to shorter PFS (< eight months) were compared to sixteen
   tumours from platinum-sensitive patients (PFS > eighteen months). Whole
   transcriptome profiling was performed using an Affymetrix
   high-resolution microarray platform to permit global comparisons of gene
   expression profiles between tumours from the resistant group and the
   sensitive group.
   Results: Microarray data analysis revealed a set of 204 discriminating
   genes possessing expression levels which could influence differential
   chemotherapy response between the two groups. Robust statistical testing
   was then performed which eliminated a dependence on the normalization
   algorithm employed, producing a restricted list of differentially
   regulated genes, and which found IGF1 to be the most strongly
   differentially expressed gene. Pathway analysis, based on the list of
   204 genes, revealed enrichment in genes primarily involved in the
   IGF1/PI3K/NF kappa B/ERK gene signalling networks.
   Conclusions: This study has identified pathway specific prognostic
   biomarkers possibly underlying a differential chemotherapy response in
   patients undergoing standard platinum-based treatment of serous
   epithelial ovarian cancer. In addition, our results provide a pathway
   context for further experimental validations, and the findings are a
   significant step towards future therapeutic interventions.}},

Abstract = {{The present study has provided a comparison between a conventional ex
   situ method for the treatment of contaminated soil, a soil slurry
   bioreactor, with a novel technology in which a contaminant is rapidly
   and effectively removed from the soil by means of absorptive polymer
   beads, which are then added to a two-phase partitioning bioreactor
   (TPPB) for biodegradation of the target molecule. 4-nitrophenol (4NP)
   was selected as a model contaminant, being representative of a large
   class of xenobiotics, and the DuPont thermoplastic Hytrel (TM) 8206 was
   utilized for its extraction from soil over ranges of soil contamination
   level, soil moisture content, and polymer:soil ratios. Since the
   polymers were able to rapidly (up to 77\% and 85\% in 4 and 24 h
   respectively) and selectively remove the contaminant, the soil retained
   its nutrient and microflora content, which is in contrast to soil
   washing which can remove these valuable soil resources. After 4h of
   reaction time, the TPPB system demonstrated removal efficiency four
   times higher (77\% vs 20\%) than the slurry system, with expected
   concomitant savings in time and energy. A volumetric removal rate of 75
   mg4NP h(-1) L-1 was obtained in the TPPB, significantly greater than the
   value of 1.7 obtained in the slurry bioreactor. The polymers were
   readily regenerated for subsequent reuse, demonstrating the versatility
   of the polymer-based soil treatment technology. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Arsenic (As) contamination of communal tubewells in Prey Veng, Cambodia,
   has been observed since 2000. Many of these wells exceed the WHO As in
   drinking water standard of 10 mu g/L by a factor of 100. The aim of this
   study was to assess how cooking water source impacts dietary As intake
   in a rural community in Prey Veng. This aim was fulfilled by (1) using
   geostatistical analysis techniques to examine the extent of As
   contaminated groundwater in Prey Veng and identify a suitable study
   site, (2) conducting an on-site study in two villages to measure As
   content in cooked rice prepared with water collected from tubewells and
   locally harvested rainwater, and (3) determining the dietary intake of
   As from consuming this rice. Geostatistical analysis indicated that high
   risk tubewells (>50 mu g As/L) are concentrated along the Mekong River's
   east bank. Participants using high risk tubewells are consuming up to 24
   times more inorganic As daily than recommended by the previous FAO/WHO
   provisional tolerable daily intake value (2.1 mu g/kgBW/day). However,
   As content in rice cooked in rainwater was significantly reduced,
   therefore, it is considered to be a safer and more sustainable option
   for this region. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{The Long and the Short of It: No Dietary Specialisation between Male and
   Female Western Sandpipers Despite Strong Bill Size Dimorphism}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Many bird species show spatial or habitat segregation of the sexes
   during the non-breeding season. One potential ecological explanation is
   that differences in bill morphology favour foraging niche specialisation
   and segregation. Western sandpipers Calidris mauri have pronounced bill
   size dimorphism, with female bills averaging 15\% longer than those of
   males. The sexes differ in foraging behaviour and exhibit partial
   latitudinal segregation during the non-breeding season, with males
   predominant in the north and females in the south. Niche specialisation
   at a local scale might account for this broad geographic pattern, and we
   investigated whether longer-billed females and shorter-billed males
   occupy different foraging niches at 16 sites across the non-breeding
   range. We used stable-nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope analysis of whole
   blood to test for dietary specialisation according to bill length and
   sex. Stable-nitrogen isotope ratios increase with trophic level. We
   predicted that delta N-15 values would increase with bill length and
   would be higher for females, which use a greater proportion of foraging
   behaviour that targets higher-trophic level prey. We used stable-carbon
   (delta C-13) isotope analysis to test for habitat segregation according
   to bill length and sex. Stable-carbon isotope ratios vary between
   marine-and freshwater-influenced habitats. We predicted that delta C-13
   values would differ between males and females if the sexes segregate
   between habitat types. Using a model selection approach, we found little
   support for a relationship between delta N-15 and either bill length or
   sex. There was some indication, however, that more marine delta C-13
   values occur with shorter bill lengths. Our findings provide little
   evidence that male and female western sandpipers exhibit dietary
   specialisation as a function of their bill size, but indicate that the
   sexes may segregate in different habitats according to bill length at
   some non-breeding sites. Potential ecological factors underlying habitat
   segregation between sexes include differences in preferred habitat type
   and predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the strong effect of the local field enhancement on the
   nonlinear terahertz response of a hybrid photoexcited silicon/double
   concentric ring metamaterial structure. The ring resonators enhance the
   local terahertz electric field by more than a factor of ten, pushing the
   terahertz-semiconductor interaction into the high-field regime even for
   moderate-strength incident terahertz pulses. In this regime, terahertz
   field-induced intervalley scattering in the photoexcited silicon
   substrate dynamically alters the substrate conductivity, which in turn
   strongly modifies the pulse transmission. The spatial distribution of
   the local field enhancement within the resonator structure results in a
   modified bandwidth, amplitude, and central frequency of the transmission
   resonance occurring on a subcycle time scale. These results demonstrate
   an enhancement of the nonlinear terahertz response of silicon-based
   metamaterials that must be accounted for in the design of terahertz
   nonlinear devices.}},

Abstract = {{Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) targeting shikonin, a potent
   antioxidant and wound healing agent, have been prepared using
   methacrylic acid (MAA) and 2-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DEAEMA) as
   functional monomers. An investigation of solution association between
   shikonin and both acidic and basic functional monomers by UV vis
   titrations, suggested stronger affinity towards the basic functionality.
   Strong inhibition of the co-polymerisation reaction of such basic
   monomers was observed, but was overcome by reduction of the amount of
   template used during polymer synthesis. Polymer morphology was severely
   impacted by the template's radical scavenging behaviour as demonstrated
   by solid state NMR spectroscopy measurements. HPLC evaluation of the
   final materials in polar conditions revealed limited imprinting effects
   and selectivity, with the MAA polymers exhibiting marginally better
   performance. During application of the polymers as MI-SPE sorbents in
   non-polar solvents it was found that the DEAEMA based polymer was more
   selective towards shikonin compared to the MAA counterpart, while
   shikonin recoveries of up to 72\% were achieved from hexane solutions of
   a commercial sample of shikonin, hexane extract of Alkanna tinctoria
   roots and a commercial pharmaceutical ointment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The temperature dependencies of ultrasonic velocity and attenuation were
   measured in composites of inorganic nanoparticles with two types of
   polymers, poly(urea) elastomer with inorganic Mo6S4I6 nanowires and
   poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) with Mo6S3I6 nanowires. Below room
   temperature large ultrasonic relaxation attenuation maxima and velocity
   dispersion were observed. It was found that the attenuation peak in the
   elastomer shifted to higher temperature after doping with nanoparticles
   and this behavior was related to the shift of glass transition
   temperature. The ultrasonic attenuation data was fitted to a relaxation
   equation with a single temperature dependent relaxation time. The
   thermal activation energy of the relaxation process, which was
   calculated from ultrasonic data, was found to increase in the poly(urea)
   elastomer doped with MoSI nanowires. The low temperature ultrasonic
   velocity increased in the poly(urea) with nanowires added and is
   determined by the increase in elastic modulus. Similar ultrasonic
   behavior was obtained for PCL composites with inorganic MoSI nanowires.
   In this case, the increase in elastic modulus was smaller in comparison
   to the composites of poly (urea) and nanowires. Therefore, reinforcement
   of PCL was less pronounced. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{544-554}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes an experimental investigation of the behaviour of
   corroded reinforced concrete beams. These have been stored in a chloride
   environment for a period of 26 years under service loading so as to be
   representative of real structural and environmental conditions. The
   configuration and the widths of the cracks in the two seriously corroded
   short-span beams were depicted carefully, and then the beams were tested
   until failure by a three-point loading system. Another two beams of the
   same age but without corrosion were also tested as control specimens. A
   short span arrangement was chosen to investigate any effect of a
   reduction in the area and bond strength of the reinforcement on shear
   capacity. The relationship of load and deflection was recorded so as to
   better understand the mechanical behaviour of the corroded beams,
   together with the slip of the tensile bars. The corrosion maps and the
   loss of area of the tensile bars were also described after having
   extracted the corroded bars from the concrete beams. Tensile tests of
   the main longitudinal bars were also carried out. The residual
   mechanical behaviour of the beams is discussed in terms of the
   experimental results and the cracking maps. The results show that the
   corrosion of the reinforcement in the beams induced by chloride has a
   very important effect on the mechanical behaviour of the short-span
   beams, as loss of cross-sectional area and bond strength have a very
   significant effect on the bending capacity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Osmotic pressure driven protein release from viscous liquid, hydrophobic

Abstract = {{In this study, the potential of low molecular weight, viscous liquid
   polymers based on 5-ethylene ketal epsilon-caprolactone for localized
   delivery of proteins via an osmotic pressure release mechanism was
   investigated. Furthermore, the osmotic release mechanism from viscous
   liquid polymers was elucidated. 5-Ethylene ketal epsilon-caprolactone
   was homopolymerized or copolymerized with D,L-lactide (DLLA) by
   ring-opening polymerization. Polymer hydrophobicity was adjusted by
   choice of initiator; hydrophobic polymers were prepared by initiating
   with octan-1-ol, while more hydrophilic polymers were prepared by
   initiating with 350 g/mol methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Particles
   consisting of bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein drug were
   co-lyophilized with trehalose at 50:50 and 10:90 (w/w) ratios and were
   mixed into the polymers at 1\% and/or 5\% (w/w) particle loading. The
   release and mechanism of release of BSA from the polymers were assessed
   in vitro. BSA was released in a sustained manner, with a near zero-order
   release profile and with minimal burst effect for 5-80 days depending on
   the polymer's hydrophilicity; the release was faster from the PEG
   initiated polymers than from the octan-1-ol initiated polymers.
   Increasing the particle loading from 1\% to 5\% (w/w) resulted in a more
   noticeable burst effect, but did not significantly increase the mass
   fraction release rate. This release behavior was determined to proceed
   as follows. Release from the polymer was triggered by the water activity
   gradient between the surrounding aqueous medium and the saturated
   solution, which forms when water is absorbed from the surrounding medium
   to dissolve a given particle. The generated pressure initiates swelling

Abstract = {{Research to date has provided limited insight into the complexity of
   water-borne pathogen transmission. Private well water supplies have been
   identified as a significant pathway in infectious disease transmission
   in both the industrialised and the developing world. Using over 90,000
   private well water submission records representing approximately 30,000
   unique well locations in south-eastern Ontario, Canada, a spatial
   analysis was performed in order to delineate clusters with elevated risk
   of E. coli contamination using 5 years of data (2008-2012). Analyses
   were performed for all years independently and subsequently compared to
   each other. Numerous statistically significant clusters were identified
   and both geographic stability and variation over time were examined.
   Through the identification of spatial and temporal patterns, this study
   provides the basis for future investigations into the underlying causes
   of bacterial groundwater contamination, while identifying geographic
   regions that merit particular attention to public health interventions
   and improvement of water quality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an experimental study of 2300 L pressure vessels
   exposed to remote fire heating by a natural gas fuelled wall fire
   simulator. The tanks were filled to 15\% capacity with commercial liquid
   propane. The flame intensity and distance were varied to study the
   effect of different heating levels on the tank and its lading.
   The fire simulator is first characterized with tests including fire
   thermocouples, radiative flux meters and thermal imaging. With the
   appropriate positioning of a target tank it is possible to get very
   realistic fire heat fluxes at the tank surface.
   Three tests were conducted with the 2300 L tanks filled to 15\% capacity
   with propane. The tanks were positioned at three different distances
   from the wall fire resulting in measured average peak heat flux at the
   tank surfaces ranging between 24 and 43 kW m(-2). The data shows rapid
   rise in vapour space wall temperatures, significant temperature
   stratification in the vapour space, and moderate rate of pressure rise.
   These results provide excellent data for the validation of computer
   models used to predict the response of pressure vessels exposed to
   moderate heating from a remote fire. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a statistical model for the thermal behaviour of the
   line model based on lab tests and field measurements. This model is
   based on Partial Least Squares (PLS) multi regression and is used for
   the Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) in a wind intensive area. DLR provides
   extra capacity to the line, over the traditional seasonal static rating,
   which makes it possible to defer the need for reinforcement the existing
   network or building new lines. The proposed PLS model has a number of
   appealing features; the model is linear, so it is straightforward to use
   for predicting the line rating for future periods using the available
   weather forecast. Unlike the available physical models, the proposed
   model does not require any physical parameters of the line, which avoids
   the inaccuracies resulting from the errors and/or variations in these
   parameters. The developed model is compared with physical model, the
   Cigre model, and has shown very good accuracy in predicting the
   conductor temperature as well as in determining the line rating for
   future time periods. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Current routine food allergen quantification methods, which are based on
   immunochemistry, offer high sensitivity but can suffer from issues of
   specificity and significant variability of results. MS approaches have
   been developed, but currently lack metrological traceability. A
   feasibility study on the application of metrologically traceable
   MS-based reference procedures was undertaken. A proof of concept
   involving proteolytic digestion and isotope dilution MS for
   quantification of protein allergens in a food matrix was undertaken
   using lysozyme in wine as a model system. A concentration of lysozyme in
   wine of 0.95 +/- 0.03 mu g/g was calculated based on the concentrations
   of two peptides, confirming that this type of analysis is viable at
   allergenically meaningful concentrations. The challenges associated with
   this promising method were explored; these included peptide stability,
   chemical modification, enzymatic digestion, and sample cleanup. The
   method is suitable for the production of allergen in food certified
   reference materials, which together with the achieved understanding of
   the effects of sample preparation and of the matrix on the final
   results, will assist in addressing the bias of the techniques routinely
   used and improve measurement confidence. Confirmation of the feasibility
   of MS methods for absolute quantification of an allergenic protein in a
   food matrix with results traceable to the International System of Units
   is a step towards meaningful comparison of results for allergen proteins
   among laboratories. This approach will also underpin risk assessment and
   risk management of allergens in the food industry, and regulatory
   compliance of the use of thresholds or action levels when adopted.}},

Abstract = {{The urgent need for alternative renewable energies to supplement
   petroleum-based fuels and the reduction of landfill sites for disposal
   of solid wastes makes it increasingly attractive to produce inexpensive
   biofuels from the organic fraction of the municipal solid waste.
   Therefore, municipal waste in the form of newspaper was investigated as
   a potential feedstock for fermentable sugars production. Hydrolysis of
   newspaper by dilute phosphoric acid was carried out in autoclave Parr
   reactor, where reactor temperature and acid concentration were examined.
   Xylose concentration reached a maximum value of 14g/100g dry mass
   corresponding to a yield of 94\% at the best identified conditions of
   2.5wt\% H3PO4, 135 degrees C, 120min reaction time, and at 2.5wt\%
   H3PO4, 150 degrees C, and 60min reaction time. For glucose, an average
   yield of 26\% was obtained at 2.5wt\% H3PO4, 200 degrees C, and 30min.
   Furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) formation was clearly
   affected by reaction temperature, where the higher the temperature the
   higher the formation rate. The maximum furfural formed was an average of
   3g/100g dry mass, corresponding to a yield of 28\%. The kinetic study of
   the acid hydrolysis was also carried out using the Saeman and the
   two-fraction models. It was found for both models that the kinetic
   constants (K) depend on the acid concentration and temperature. The
   degradation of HMF to levulinic acid is faster than the degradation of
   furfural to formic acid. Also, the degradation rate is higher than the
   formation rate for both inhibitors when degradation is observed.}},

Abstract = {{Work on lnconel (R)(1) X-750 spacers removed from CANDU (R)(2) reactors
   has shown that they become embrittled and there is development of many
   small cavities within the metal matrix and along grain boundaries. In
   order to emulate the neutron irradiation induced microstructural
   changes, heavy ion irradiations (1 MeV Kr2+ ions) were performed while
   observing the damage evolution using an intermediate voltage electron
   microscope (IVEM) operating at 200 kV. The irradiations were carried out
   at various temperatures 60-400 degrees C. The principal strengthening
   phase, gamma'. was disordered at low doses (similar to 0.06 dpa) during
   the irradiation. M23C6 carbides were found to be stable up to 5.4 dpa.
   Lattice defects consisted mostly of stacking fault tetrahedras (SFTs),
   1/2 < 1 1 0 > perfect loops and small 1/3 < 1 1 1 > faulted Frank loops.
   The ratio of SFT number density to loop number density for each
   irradiation condition was found to be neither temperature nor dose
   dependent. Under the operation of the ion beam the SET production was
   very rapid, with no evidence for further growth once formed, indicating
   that they probably formed as a result of cascade collapse in a single
   cascade. The number density of the defects was found to saturate at low
   dose (similar to 0.68 dpa). No cavities were observed regardless of the
   irradiation temperature between 60 degrees C and 400 degrees C for doses
   up to 5.4 dpa. In contrast, cavities have been observed after neutron
   irradiation in the same material at similar doses and temperatures
   indicating that helium, produce during neutron irradiation, may be
   essential for the nucleation and growth of cavities. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this work a combination of synchrotron X-ray diffraction,
   transmission electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry
   have been used to characterise the Zr20Nb-H phase diagram and hydrides
   in beta-Zr. A single hydride phase, termed gamma' was found to be
   present in beta-Zr over a wide range of H concentrations up to 1559
   wppm. gamma'-hydride had an orthorhombic crystal structure with the
   composition ZrH0.4 +/- 0.2, and was found to be stable during heating to
   450 degrees C; it can therefore be considered the equilibrium hydride in
   beta-Zr. Accompanying hydride nucleation is a volumetric strain of
   10.4\% that is accommodated elastically and plastically by the beta-Zr.
   The body-centre cubic to orthorhombic martensitic transformation is
   analogous to the Au-Cd system where the basal plane in the hydride is
   constructed from the (0 1 1)(beta) to give the Bain correspondence.
   There are strong similarities between the Zr20Nb-H and Nb-H phase
   diagrams with the former having a lower solubility for H at room
   temperature, similar to 130 wppm and similar to 290 wppm respectively.
   The room temperature solubility difference between body-centre cubic Nb
   and beta-Zr can be attributed to their electron configurations and the
   reduction in energy associated with the metallic Zr/Nb-H bonding. (C)

Abstract = {{Two similar code segments, or clones, form a clone pair within a
   software system. The changes to the clones over time create a clone
   evolution history. In this work, we study late propagation, a specific
   pattern of clone evolution. In late propagation, one clone in a clone
   pair is modified, causing the clone pair to diverge. The code segments
   are then reconciled in a later commit. Existing work has established
   late propagation as a clone evolution pattern and suggested that the
   pattern is related to a high number of faults. In this study, we examine
   the characteristics of late propagation in three long-lived software
   systems using the Simian ( Simon Harris, Victoria, Australia,
   http://www.harukizaemon.com/simian), CCFinder, and NiCad (Software
   Technology Laboratory, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada) clone
   detection tools. We define eight types of late propagation and compare
   them to other forms of clone evolution. Our results not only verify that
   late propagation is more harmful to software systems but also establish
   that some specific types of late propagations are more harmful than
   others. Specifically, two types are most risky: (1) when a clone
   experiences diverging changes and then a reconciling change without any
   modification to the other clone in a clone pair; and (2) when two clones
   undergo a diverging modification followed by a reconciling change that
   modifies both the clones in a clone pair. We also observe that the
   reconciliation in the former case is more prone to faults than in the
   latter case. We determine that the size of the clones experiencing late
   propagation has an effect on the fault proneness of specific types of
   late propagation genealogies. Lastly, we cannot report a correlation
   between the delay of the propagation of changes and its faults, as the
   fault proneness of each delay period is system dependent. Copyright (c)

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{The design optimization of a cold-formed steel portal frame building is
   considered in this paper. The proposed genetic algorithm (GA) optimizer
   considers both topology (i.e., frame spacing and pitch) and
   cross-sectional sizes of the main structural members as the decision
   variables. Previous GAs in the literature were characterized by poor
   convergence, including slow progress, that usually results in excessive
   computation times and/or frequent failure to achieve an optimal or
   near-optimal solution. This is the main issue addressed in this paper.
   In an effort to improve the performance of the conventional GA, a
   niching strategy is presented that is shown to be an effective means of
   enhancing the dissimilarity of the solutions in each generation of the
   GA. Thus, population diversity is maintained and premature convergence
   is reduced significantly. Through benchmark examples, it is shown that
   the efficient GA proposed generates optimal solutions more consistently.
   A parametric study was carried out, and the results included. They show
   significant variation in the optimal topology in terms of pitch and
   frame spacing for a range of typical column heights. They also show that
   the optimized design achieved large savings based on the cost of the
   main structural elements; the inclusion of knee braces at the eaves
   yield further savings in cost, that are significant.}},

Title = {{Investigation of moisture condition and Autoclam sensitivity on air
   permeability measurements for both normal concrete and high}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{306-314}},

Abstract = {{While on site measurement of air permeability provides a useful approach
   for assessing the likely long term durability of concrete structures, no
   existing test method is capable of effectively determining the relative
   permeability of high performance concrete (HPC). Lack of instrument
   sensitivity and the influence of concrete moisture are proposed as two
   key reasons for this phenomenon. With limited systematic research
   carried out in this area to date, the aim if this study was to
   investigate the influence of instrument sensitivity and moisture
   condition on air permeability measurements for both normal concrete and
   HPC.
   To achieve a range of moisture conditions, samples were dried initially
   for between one and 5 weeks and then sealed in polythene sheeting and
   stored in an oven at 50 degrees C to internally distribute moisture
   evenly. Moisture distribution was determined throughout using relative
   humidity probe and electrical resistance measurements. Concrete air
   permeability was subsequently measured using standardised air
   permeability (Autoclani) and water penetration (BS EN: 12390-8) tests to
   assess differences between the HPCs tested in this study.
   It was found that for both normal and high performance concrete, the
   influence of moisture on Autoclam air permeability results could be
   eliminated by pre-drying (50 +/- 1 degrees C, RH 35\%) specimens for 3
   weeks. While drying for 5 weeks alone was found not to result in uniform
   internal moisture distributions, this state was achieved by exposing
   specimens to a further 3 weeks of sealed pre-conditioning at 50 +/- 1
   degrees C. While the Autoclam test was not able to accurately identify
   relative HPC quality due to low sensitivity at associated performance
   levels, an effective preconditioning procedure to obtain reliable air
   permeability of HPC concretes was identified. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Polar code is a low-complexity and capacity-achieving code with

   requiring the Hamming weight distribution. Currently, there are no
   low-complexity algorithms for the polar code's spectra. In this paper,
   we propose a recursive probabilistic weight distribution (PWD)

Abstract = {{The spectral characteristic of a Fano resonance is a distinct and unique
   asymmetric line shape. It arises from the destructive interference
   between a bright continuum mode and a discrete dark mode. Metamaterials
   and plasmonics have facilitated the observation of Fano resonances in
   the realm of classical electrodynamics and have spurred intense interest
   to study and to exploit their peculiarities due their low loss and very
   sharp resonant features. Here, we survey the excitation of Fano
   resonance at terahertz frequencies by using asymmetric metamaterial
   structures. In particular, we discuss the high Q of Fano resonances,
   their sensitivity to the asymmetry parameter and potential applications.
   We believe that the manipulation of terahertz radiation by exploiting
   Fano resonances in terahertz metamaterials could usher in
   next-generation terahertz photonic devices for delay, storage,
   filtering, sensing, and nonlinear applications.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Moisture is a well-documented, and crucial, control on the nature of
   stone decay. The term `time of wetness' has frequently been adopted to
   describe how long a stone block is wet, with a view to understanding the
   impact of this on decay processes. Although this term has proved
   conceptually useful, it has been used in different ways, by different
   groups to mean very different things. For example, the time of wetness
   for a stone block surface (the traditional understanding) may be very
   different from that of a block interior, controlled by the different
   dynamics of wetting and drying in those zones. Thus, surface wetting
   will occur regularly (sometimes swiftly followed by drying, depending on
   the time of year), with block interior wetting requiring the
   accumulation of surface moisture to penetrate to depth (more likely in
   autumn and winter months), and drying out much more slowly. This
   relatively new but important perspective, framed in the context of
   climate change, is crucial to understanding the length of time stone may
   remain damp at depth following a period of prolonged precipitation. The
   nature and speed of drying is also relevant in quantifying time of
   wetness of both surfaces and the interior of building stones. These
   ideas related to time of wetness have implications for decay processes,
   specifically how a prolonged time of deep wetness may re-focus the
   emphasis of salt weathering in natural building stones toward chemical
   action. Literature on chemical change is discussed, suggesting that
   chemical change occurring during periods of prolonged wetness is likely
   to be significant in itself, with implications for weakening the stone
   (in terms of, for example, cement dissolution or grain boundary
   weakening) and exacerbating physical damage from salt crystallization
   when blocks finally dry out.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores the possible application of a biodegradable plant
   based surfactant, obtained from Sapindus mukorossi, for washing low
   levels of arsenic (As) from an iron (Fe) rich soil. Natural association
   of As(V) with Fe(III) makes the process difficult. Soapnut solution was
   compared to anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in down-flow
   and a newly introduced suction mode for soil column washing. It was
   observed that soapnut attained up to 86\% efficiency with respect to SDS
   in removing As. Full factorial design of experiment revealed a very good
   fit of data. The suction mode generated up to 83 kPa pressure inside
   column whilst down-flow mode generated a much higher pressure of 214
   kPa, thus making the suction mode more efficient. Micellar
   solubilisation was found to be responsible for As desorption from the
   soil and it followed 1st order kinetics. Desorption rate coefficient of
   suction mode was found to be in the range of 0.005 to 0.01, much higher
   than down-flow mode values. Analysis of the FT-IR data suggested that
   the soapnut solution did not interact chemically with As, offering an
   option for reusing the surfactant. Soapnut can be considered as a soil
   washing agent for removing As even from soil with high Fe content.}},

   were physically characterised by nitrogen sorption and evaluated by
   means of HPLC and frontal chromatography against a range of template
   analogues. While some degree of selectivity for the template was
   achieved for all tested polymers, the ones based on the tri-functional
   cross-linking monomer trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate exhibited the
   longest retention for all corticosteroids, especially in the
   precipitated format, which suggested broader group selectivity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the stabilization of nonlinear control affine
   systems that satisfy Jurdjevic-Quinn conditions. We first obtain a
   differential one-form associated to the system by taking the interior
   product of a non vanishing two-form with respect to the drift vector
   field. We then construct a homotopy operator on a star-shaped region
   centered at a desired equilibrium point that decomposes the system into
   an exact part and an anti-exact one. Integrating the exact one-form, we
   obtain a locally-defined dissipative potential that is used to generate
   the damping feedback controller. Applying the same decomposition
   approach on the entire control affine system under damping feedback, we
   compute a control Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system. Under
   Jurdjevic-Quinn conditions, it is shown that the obtained damping
   feedback is locally stabilizing the system to the desired equilibrium
   point provided that it is the maximal invariant set for the controlled
   dynamics. The technique is also applied to construct damping feedback
   controllers for the stabilization of periodic orbits. Examples are
   presented to illustrate the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The River Bush must reach a standard of good ecological potential (GEP)
   by 2015 due to the requirements of the water framework directive. The
   role of sediments within a water body is extremely important to all
   aspects of a river's regime. The aim of this research is to investigate
   the effects of Altnahinch Dam on sediment distribution in the River Bush
   (a heavily modified water body) with comparison made against the Glendun
   River (an unmodified water body). Samples collected from the rivers were
   analysed by physical (pebble count, sieve analysis) and statistical
   methods (ANOVA, GRADISTAT). An increase in fine sediments upstream of
   the dam provides evidence that the dam is impacting sediment
   distribution. Downstream effects are not shown to be significant. The
   output of this study also implies similar impacts at other drinking
   water storage impoundments. This research recommends that a sediment
   management plan be put in place for Altnahinch Dam and that further
   studies be carried-out concentrating on fine sediment distribution
   upstream of the dam.}},

Abstract = {{We report a simple and facile methodology for constructing Pt (6.3 mm x
   50 mu m) and Cu (6.3 mm x 30 mu m) annular microband electrodes for use
   in room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) and propose their use for
   amperometric gas sensing. The suitability of microband electrodes for
   use in electrochemical analysis was examined in experiments on two
   systems. The first system studied to validate the electrochemical
   responses of the annular microband electrode was decamethylferrocene
   (DmFc), as a stable internal reference probe commonly used in ionic
   liquids, in {[}Pmim]{[}NTf2], where the diffusion coefficients of DmFc
   and DmFc(+) and the standard electron rate constant for the DmFc/DmFc(+)
   couple were determined through fitting chronoamperometric and cyclic
   voltammetric responses with relevant simulations. These values are
   independently compared with those collected from a commercially
   available Pt microdisc electrode with excellent agreement. The second
   system focuses on O-2 reduction in {[}Pmim]{[}NTf2], which is used as a
   model for gas sensing. The diffusion coefficients of O-2 and O-2(-) and
   the electron transfer rate constant were again obtained using
   chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry, along with simulations.
   Results determined from the microbands are again consistent to those
   evaluated from the Pt microdisc electrode when compared these results
   from home-made microband and commercially available microdisc
   electrodes. These observations indicate that the fabricated annular
   microband electrodes are suitable for quantitative measurements. Further
   the successful use of the Cu electrodes in the O-2 system suggests a
   cheap disposable sensor for gas detection. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   models to simulate the lateral behaviour are presented and the

Abstract = {{This study investigates, experimentally and using finite element

   model for selected test specimens was developed to analyze the stress
   within the adhesive. The model was verified by comparison with strain
   data from the shear lap-splice tests. The model was used to determine
   the maximum principal stress in the epoxy adhesive and the maximum shear
   strain in the methacrylate adhesive at failure, and thus quantify the
   characteristic strength of these adhesives. It was shown that the
   ductility of the methacrylate adhesive allowed it to yield at locations
   of stress concentrations, providing higher splice capacity, despite
   having a lower nominal shear strength as compared with the epoxy

Abstract = {{The occurrence of ca. 360 Ma greisen-related molybdenite mineralization
   in the Clayton Hill biotite-muscovite leucomonzongranite (<1 km(2)) is
   unusual for the southwestern Meguma terrane of the Maritime
   Appalachians, where 380 Ma granite-related Sn mineralization dominates.
   The presence of extensive hornfelsing and occurrence of mineralized
   (Sn-W-Cu-Zn) skarns in the area suggests a larger intrusion occurs at
   depth. The intrusion and mineralization are constrained to 361 Ma based
   on concordant Re-Os (molybdenite) and Ar-40/Ar-39 (muscovite) ages,
   which equates to other ca. 360 Ma granites in the area, hence magmatism
   of this age is more widespread than previously considered. The intrusion
   is highly evolved (74 wt.\% SiO2), metaluminous (A/CNK = 1-1.05; A/CNK =
   molar ratio {[}Al2O3/(CaO + Na2O + K2O)]) and depleted in cafemic and
   transition elements. Rare-earth elements (Sigma REE = 106-23 ppm) are
   strongly fractionated with light rare-earth elements (LREE) enriched
   (La/Lu-N = 10), and negative Eu anomalies. Biotite is Fe-rich (Fe/(Fe +
   Mg) = 0.75), and both biotite and muscovite are F deficient. These
   geochemical features indicate affinity to the other 360 Ma granites and
   suggest a similar petrogenesis with some A-type affinity. Mineralization
   occurs as molybdenite-bearing greisens and rusty miaroles lined with
   pyrite and enrichment in Cu-As-Bi-Au. Stable isotopes (O, S) indicate
   greisen formation at 450 degrees C from fluids with delta O-18(H2O) = 7
   parts per thousand and delta S-34(H2S) = 2 parts per thousand-3 parts
   per thousand, which suggests an A- or I-type magmatic reservoir rather
   than a peraluminous magma. These data indicate the presence of a
   widespread magmatic event that is 20 Ma younger than the 380 Ma Sn-base
   metal event in southern Nova Scotia (e. g., East Kemptville). That this
   event is the same age as the world class Mount Pleasant Mo-Sn-W-Zn-In
   deposit of southern New Brunswick indicates additional potential for
   significant granite-related mineralization in this part of Atlantic
   Canada.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new digital control algorithm is presented to improve
   the dynamic performance of the dual-transistor forward converter (DTFC)
   during a transient event. The algorithm uses a linear control scheme
   under the stable-state condition and the charge balance control scheme
   under the transient condition. Based on the principle of capacitor
   charge balance, the proposed algorithm predicts the switch over time to
   achieve optimal transient response for a DTFC, thus the minimal voltage
   derivation and recovery time are achieved when the load current has a
   step change. Compared with a conventional voltage mode controller, the
   proposed algorithm provides a much better dynamic performance.
   Furthermore, simulation and experiment results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the algorithm.}},

Volume = {{734}},

Abstract = {{We performed large-eddy simulations of the flow over a series of
   three-dimensional (3D) dunes at laboratory scale. The bedform
   three-dimensionality was imposed by shifting a standard two-dimensional
   (2D) dune shape in the streamwise direction according to a sine wave.
   The turbulence statistics were discussed in Part 1 of this article
   (Omidyeganeh \& Piomelli, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 721, 2013, pp. 454-483).
   Coherent flow structures and their statistics are discussed
   concentrating on two cases with the same crestline amplitudes and
   wavelengths but different crestline alignments: in-phase and staggered.
   The present paper shows that the induced large-scale mean streamwise
   vortices are the primary factor that alters the features of the
   instantaneous flow structures. Wall turbulence is insensitive to the
   crestline alignment; alternating high-and low-speed streaks appear in
   the internal boundary layer developing on the stoss side, whereas over
   the node plane (the plane normal to the spanwise direction at the node
   of the crestline), they are inclined towards the lobe plane (the plane
   normal to the spanwise direction at the most downstream point of the
   crestline) due to the mean spanwise pressure gradient. Spanwise vortices
   (rollers) generated by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the separated
   shear layer appear regularly over the lobe with much larger length scale
   than those over the saddle (the plane normal to the spanwise direction
   at the most upstream point of the crestline). Rollers over the lobe may
   extend to the saddle plane and affect the reattachment features; their
   shedding is more frequent than in 2D geometries. Vortices shed from the
   separated shear layer in the lobe plane undergo a three-dimensional
   instability while being advected downstream, and rise toward the free
   surface. They develop into a horseshoe shape (similar to the 2D case)
   and affect the whole channel depth, whereas those generated near the
   saddle are advected downstream and toward the bed. When the tip of such
   a horseshoe reaches the free surface, the ejection of flow at the
   surface causes `boils' (upwelling events on the surface). Strong boil
   events are observed on the surface of the lobe planes of 3D dunes more
   frequently than in the saddle planes. They also appear more frequently
   than in the corresponding 2D geometry. The crestline alignment of the
   dune alters the dynamics of the flow structures, in that they appear in
   the lobe plane and are advected towards the saddle plane of the next
   dune, where they are dissipated. Boil events occur at a higher frequency
   in the staggered alignment, but with less intensity than in the in-phase
   alignment.}},

   McArthur River Zone 4 Orebody in the Athabasca Basin, Canada:
   Implications of a Silicified Zone}},

Abstract = {{The McArthur River unconformity-related uranium deposit, located near
   the southeastern margin of the Proterozoic Athabasca basin in northern
   Saskatchewan, Canada, contains both basement-hosted and sandstone-hosted
   orebodies, one of which is the sandstone-hosted Zone 4 orebody and its
   alteration system. Early pre-ore quartz cementation forming immediately
   above Zone 4 produced a 200-m-thick silicified zone within the lower
   Manitou Falls Formation. Late pre-ore oxidizing basinal fluids (delta
   O-18 = 1.1-8.9 parts per thousand, delta H-2 = -70 to -34 parts per
   thousand) formed zones of dickite, magnesiofoitite, and sudoite-rich
   alteration in the Manitou Falls Formation above the deposit. These zones
   were overprinted by an outer halo of illite and illite-chlorite
   mixed-layer clay that coincided with illite and clinochlore alteration
   of the Wollaston Group basement rocks. Circulation of basinal fluids
   into the fault zone, promoted by fault reactivation, created a reducing
   fluid (delta O-18 = 3.9-7.8 parts per thousand, delta H-2= -62 to -25
   parts per thousand) through basement interaction, which formed a narrow
   sudoite alteration halo near the faulted unconformity. Mixing of these
   two contrasting fluids initiated uranium mineralization at ca. 1600 Ma.
   Post-ore alteration caused isotopic resetting of primary uraninite,
   broadly coincident with the intrusion of the Mackenzie dikes into the
   basin, followed by alteration of uraninite to coffinite, poorly
   crystalline uraninite, and gummite during the Neoproterozoic. Cool (ca.
   10 degrees C), oxidizing, meteoric waters (delta O-18 = -15.7 to -13.2
   parts per thousand, delta H-2 = -120 to -93 parts per thousand) later
   infiltrated fractures, produced post-ore kaolinite, and caused partial
   oxidation of uraninite to uranophane.
   The silicified zone at Zone 4 functioned as a physical barrier to fluid
   flow, creating favorable conditions for uranium mineralization by
   focusing basinal fluids into the fault zone, localizing reducing
   basement-modified basinal fluids, and enhancing ore preservation.
   However, the silicified zone limited the spatial extent of late pre-ore
   sudoite alteration and obstructed the post-ore mobilization of
   components such as radiogenic Pb and other pathfinder elements into the
   overlying strata.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of a radial basis function (RBF) network involves the
   determination of the model size, hidden nodes, and output weights. Least
   squares-based subset selection methods can determine a RBF model size
   and its parameters simultaneously. Although these methods are robust,
   they may not achieve optimal results. Alternatively, gradient methods
   are widely used to optimize all the parameters. The drawback is that
   most algorithms may converge slowly as they treat hidden nodes and
   output weights separately and ignore their correlations. In this paper,
   a new discrete-continuous algorithm is proposed for the construction of
   a RBF model. First, the orthogonal least squares (OLS)-based forward
   stepwise selection constructs an initial model by selecting model terms
   one by one from a candidate term pool. Then a new Levenberg-Marquardt
   (LM)-based parameter optimization is proposed to further optimize the
   hidden nodes and output weights in the continuous space. To speed up the
   convergence, the proposed parameter optimization method considers the
   correlation between the hidden nodes and output weights, which is
   achieved by translating the output weights to dependent parameters using
   the OLS method. The correlation is also used by the previously proposed
   continuous forward algorithm (CFA). However, unlike the CFA, the new
   method optimizes all the parameters simultaneously. In addition, an
   equivalent recursive sum of squared error is derived to reduce the
   computation demanding for the first derivatives used in the LM method.
   Computational complexity is given to confirm the new method is much more
   computationally efficient than the CFA. Different numerical examples are
   presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
   Further, Friedman statistical tests on 13 classification problems are
   performed, and the results demonstrate that RBF networks built by the
   new method are very competitive in comparison with some popular
   classifiers.}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The present paper was aimed at presenting the time-averaged velocity and
   turbulence intensity at the initial plane from a ship's propeller using
   a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach. Previous experimental
   studies found that the maximum velocity occurred at the initial plane
   within a jet, but no agreement was found With regards to the position of
   this maximum velocity and the velocity distribution across the initial
   plane. All work to date has been empirical in nature and new approaches
   are required to provide a better understanding of the flow field. The
   current investigation was conducted using a Computational Fluid Dynamics
   (CFD) approach, and found the position of the maximum velocity occurred
   at a distance of 0.585 R-p from the rotation axis. The CFD prediction
   showed that the axial component of velocity is the main contributor to
   the velocity magnitude, followed by the tangential and radial velocities
   which are 78\% and 3\% of the maximum axial velocity respectively. The
   axial velocity distribution across the section showed a two-peaked-ridge
   profile with a low velocity core at the rotation axis. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Decision making is an important element throughout the life-cycle of
   large-scale projects. Decisions are critical as they have a direct
   impact upon the success/outcome of a project and are affected by many
   factors including the certainty and precision of information. In this
   paper we present an evidential reasoning framework which applies
   Dempster-Shafer Theory and its variant Dezert-Smarandache Theory to aid
   decision makers in making decisions where the knowledge available may be
   imprecise, conflicting and uncertain. This conceptual framework is novel
   as natural language based information extraction techniques are utilized
   in the extraction and estimation of beliefs from diverse textual
   information sources, rather than assuming these estimations as already
   given. Furthermore we describe an algorithm to define a set of maximal
   consistent subsets before fusion occurs in the reasoning framework. This
   is important as inconsistencies between subsets may produce results
   which are incorrect/adverse in the decision making process. The proposed
   framework can be applied to problems involving material selection and a
   Use Case based in the Engineering domain is presented to illustrate the
   approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Extracting high-quality RNA from hydrogels containing polysaccharide
   components is challenging, as traditional RNA isolation techniques
   designed for cells and tissues can have limited yields and purity due to
   physiochemical interactions between the nucleic acids and the
   biomaterials. In this study, a comparative analysis of several different
   RNA isolation methods was performed on human adipose-derived stem cells
   photo-encapsulated within methacrylated glycol chitosan hydrogels. The
   results demonstrated that RNA isolation methods with cetyl
   trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer followed by purification with an
   RNeasy((R)) mini kit resulted in low yields of RNA, except when the
   samples were preminced directly within the buffer. In addition, genomic
   DNA contamination during reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR) analysis was observed in the hydrogels processed with the
   CTAB-based methods. Isolation methods using TRIzol((R)) in combination
   with one of a Qiaex((R)) gel extraction kit, an RNeasy((R)) mini kit, or
   an extended solvent purification method extracted RNA suitable for gene
   amplification, with no evidence of genomic contamination. The latter two
   methods yielded the best results in terms of yield and amplification
   efficiency. Predigestion of the scaffolds with lysozyme was investigated
   as a possible means of enhancing RNA extraction from the polysaccharide
   gels, with no improvements observed in terms of the purity, yield, or
   amplification efficiency. Overall, this work highlights the application
   of a TRIzol((R))+extended solvent purification method for optimizing RNA
   extraction that can be applied to obtain reliable and accurate gene
   expression data in studies investigating cells seeded in chitosan-based
   scaffolds.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an experimental investigation on the pressure dip
   phenomenon in a conical pile of granular solids. The roles of different
   deposition processes such as the pouring rate, pouring height and
   deposition jet size on the pressure dip formation were studied. Test
   results confirmed that the pressure dip is a robust phenomenon in a pile
   formed by top deposition. When the deposition jet radius is
   significantly smaller than the final pile radius (i.e. concentrated
   deposition), a dip developed in the centre as shown in previous studies.
   However, when the deposition jet radius is comparable to the final pile
   radius (i.e. diffuse deposition), the location of the dip moves towards
   the edge of deposition jet, with a local maximum pressure developed in
   the centre. For concentrated deposition, an increase in the pouring rate
   may enhance the depth of the dip and reduce its width, while an increase
   in the pouring height has only a negligible effect in the studied range.
   The results suggest the pressure dip is closely related to the initial
   location, intensity and form of downslope flows. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Lisfranc injuries affect at least 1 out of every 55,000 people each
   year. Although they are relatively uncommon foot injuries, their effects
   can be severe: 20-40\% of Lisfranc injuries are missed upon first
   presentation. This increases the likelihood of poor outcomes, especially
   if associated with a workplace injury. These injuries result in a
   disproportionate number of malpractice lawsuits and compensation claims.
   The Kingston Brace was designed to support an injured foot during a
   computed tomography (CT) scan with the goal of providing the diagnosing
   physician with the best diagnostic information possible. A prototype was
   designed and built to support a variety of foot orientations. It was
   used to determine which orientation is optimal for Lisfranc joint CT
   scanning. Three fresh frozen cadaver feet were put through several
   experiments with the Brace. The 2D diagnostic quality of CT scans taken
   using the Kingston Brace was compared against that of CT scans taken
   using the existing protocol. The Kingston Brace allows for a better
   visualization of the injured Lisfranc joint than the existing CT
   protocol. Lisfranc joint spreading was used as a measure of potential
   pain in injured patients. The joint spreading in the Kingston Brace was
   minimal, suggesting that additional pain felt by injured patients during
   imaging would also be minimal. The adoption of the Kingston Brace
   resulted in no change in the morphological parameters resulting from
   more advanced 3D analysis. The best experimentally determined Kingston
   Brace orientation was found to be 10 degrees of plantarflexion and 11
   degrees of eversion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{126-133}},

Abstract = {{Drilling is a major process in the manufacturing of holes required for
   the assemblies of composite laminates in aerospace industry. Simulation
   of drilling process is an effective method in optimizing the drill
   geometry and process parameters in order to improve hole quality and to
   reduce the drill wear. In this research we have developed
   three-dimensional (3D) FE model for drilling CFRP. A 3D progressive
   intra-laminar failure model based on the Hashin's theory is considered.
   Also an inter-laminar delamination model which includes the onset and
   growth of delamination by using cohesive contact zone is developed. The
   developed model with inclusion of the improved delamination model and
   real drill geometry is used to make comparison between the step drill of
   different stage ratio and twist drill. Thrust force, torque and work
   piece stress distributions are estimated to decrease by the use of step
   drill with high stage ratio. The model indicates that delamination and
   other workpiece defects could be controlled by selection of suitable
   step drill geometry. Hence the 3D model could be used as a design tool
   for drill geometry for minimization of delamination in CFRP drilling.

Abstract = {{Reactive power has become a vital resource in modern electricity
   networks due to increased penetration of distributed generation. This
   paper examines the extended reactive power capability of DFIGs to
   improve network stability and capability to manage network voltage
   profile during transient faults and dynamic operating conditions. A
   coordinated reactive power controller is designed by considering the
   reactive power capabilities of the rotor-side converter (RSC) and the
   grid-side converter (GSC) of the DFIG in order to maximise the reactive
   power support from DFIGs. The study has illustrated that, a significant
   reactive power contribution can be obtained from partially loaded DFIG
   wind farms for stability enhancement by using the proposed capability
   curve based reactive power controller; hence DFIG wind farms can
   function as vital dynamic reactive power resources for power utilities
   without commissioning additional dynamic reactive power devices. Several
   network adaptive droop control schemes are also proposed for network
   voltage management and their performance has been investigated during
   variable wind conditions. Furthermore, the influence of reactive power
   capability on network adaptive droop control strategies has been
   investigated and it has also been shown that enhanced reactive power
   capability of DFIGs can substantially improve the voltage control

Abstract = {{Boundary conduction mode (BCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM)
   control strategies are widely used for the flyback microinverter. The
   BCM and DCM control strategies are investigated for the interleaved
   flyback microinverter concentrating on the loss analysis under different

   the loss distribution and thus the efficiency of the flyback
   microinverter. For the interleaved flyback microinverter, the dominant
   losses with heavy load include the conduction loss of the power MOSFETs
   and diodes, and the loss of the transformer; while the dominant losses
   with light load include the gate driving loss, the turn-off loss of the
   power MOSFETs and the transformer core loss. Based on the loss analysis,
   a new hybrid control strategy combing the two-phase DCM and one-phase
   DCM control is proposed to improve the efficiency in wide load range by
   reducing the dominant losses depending on the load current. The optimal
   design method based on the boundary condition of the hybrid control is

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel control approach for a current-driven
   full-bridge dc/dc converter, which is able to significantly improve the
   converter performance over a very wide range of operating conditions.
   The proposed control approach is based on the self-sustained oscillating
   control (SSOC) scheme, in order to adaptively change the phase shift and
   the switching frequency of the converter for different operating points.
   In this control technique, the timing signal is produced based on the
   transformer primary current, which is a feedback to the control system
   to determine the switching instants of the power MOSFETs. Therefore, the
   control system automatically tunes the control variables for different
   operating conditions. The comprehensive mathematical analysis of the
   proposed SSOC scheme is presented in detail. The mathematical analysis
   is based on the geometric viewpoint of the control system, which
   provides a very good insight into designing the control system.
   Experimental results provided from a 3 kW prototype confirm the
   feasibility of the proposed scheme and prove the superiority of the
   performance compared to the conventional phase-shift control approach.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{The efficient electrocatalysts for many heterogeneous catalytic
   processes in energy conversion and storage systems must possess
   necessary surface active sites. Here we identify, from X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations,
   that controlling charge density redistribution via the atomic-scale
   incorporation of heteroatoms is paramount to import surface active
   sites. We engineer the deterministic nitrogen atoms inserting the bulk
   material to preferentially expose active sites to turn the inactive
   material into a sufficient electrocatalyst. The excellent
   electrocatalytic activity of N-In2O3 nanocrystals leads to higher
   performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) than the DSCs
   fabricated with Pt. The successful strategy provides the rational design
   of transforming abundant materials into high-efficient electrocatalysts.
   More importantly, the exciting discovery of turning the commonly used
   transparent conductive oxide (TCO) in DSCs into counter electrode
   material means that except for decreasing the cost, the device structure
   and processing techniques of DSCs can be simplified in future.}},

   H2O, P, S, F and Cl at 1200 degrees C, P = 200 MPa has been determined
   at fO(2) = QFM, NNO and MH oxygen buffers. H2O is shown to increase the
   partitioning of HFSE, REE and transition elements into the Fe-rich melt.
   H2O alone or with 6.67 x 10(-4) mol/g of P or S produces nearly similar
   partitioning trends for HFSE and REE, at experimental fO(2) = QFM, NNO
   and MH. H2O + F causes Rb and Cs to partition into the Fe-rich melt and
   significantly increases U partitioning into the Fe-rich melt. Absolute
   partitioning values of Mn, Co, Mo, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cr, Cr, V, Ti and Ag are
   strongly dependent on the H2O, P, S, F, and Cl compositions of the melt.

Abstract = {{The mechanical impact of adding milled glass fibers and nanoparticles at
   different mass fractions to low-density (relative density < 0.2)
   polyurethane (PU) foams is investigated. Tensile, compressive, and shear
   stress-strain curves are measured in the plane parallel to the foam-rise
   direction and the in-plane components of the elastic modulus are
   determined in order to assess the mechanical anisotropy of the foams.
   Power-law relationships between the moduli and apparent density are
   established for pure PU foams and used as a baseline to which the
   properties of composite foams are compared. Cellular mechanics models
   based on both rectangular and Kelvin unit-cell geometries are employed
   to estimate changes in the cell shape based on the mechanical anisotropy
   of composite foams, and the model results are compared with direct
   observations of the cellular structure from microscopy. A single measure
   of foam stiffness reinforcement is defined that excludes the effects of
   the apparent foam density and cell shape. The analysis reveals the large
   impact of cell shape on the moduli of the glass-fiber and nanocomposite
   foams. Nanocomposite foams exhibit up to an 11.1\% degree of
   reinforcement, and glass-fiber foams up to 18.7\% using this method for
   quantifying foam reinforcement, whereas a simple normalization to the
   in-plane modulus components of the pure PU foam would indicate from
   40.5\% to 25.9\% reinforcement in nanocomposite foams, and -7.5 to
   20.2\% in glass-fiber foams. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, the notion that globular clusters (GCs) are composed
   of coeval stars with homogeneous initial chemical compositions has been
   challenged by growing evidence that they host an intricate stellar
   population mix, likely indicative of a complex history of star formation
   and chemical enrichment. Several models have been proposed to explain
   the existence of multiple stellar populations in GCs, but no single
   model provides a fully satisfactory match to existing data. Correlations
   between chemistry and global parameters such as cluster mass or
   luminosity are fundamental clues to the physics of GC formation. In this
   Letter, we present an analysis of the mean abundances of Fe, Mg, C, N,
   and Ca for 72 old GCs from the Andromeda galaxy. We show for the first
   time that there is a correlation between the masses of GCs and the mean
   stellar abundances of nitrogen, spanning almost two decades in mass.
   This result sheds new light on the formation of GCs, providing important
   constraints on their internal chemical evolution and mass loss history.}},

Abstract = {{Asystematic study of the effect of the Reynolds number on the fluid
   dynamics and turbulence statistics of pulsed jets impinging on a flat
   surface is presented. It has been suggested that the influence of the
   Reynolds number may be somewhat different for a jet subjected to
   pulsation when compared to an equivalent steady jet. A comparative study
   of both steady and pulsating jets is presented for a Reynolds number
   range from Re = 4,730 to Re = 10,000. All the other factors that affect
   the flowfield are kept constant, which are H/d = 3, St = 0.25, and d =
   30.5 mm. It was found that for the range of the Reynolds numbers tested,
   pulsation results in a shortening of the jet core, the centerline axial
   velocity component declines more rapidly, and higher values of the
   radial velocity component for r/d > 0.75 are observed. As the Reynolds
   number increases, the jet spreads more rapidly, the turbulent kinetic
   energy and nondimensional turbulent fluctuations decrease, and the
   flowfield near the impinging surface changes drastically, which is
   evident with the development of a turbulent momentum exchange
   interaction away from the wall for r/d > 1.5.}},

Abstract = {{Recent literature suggests that the increasingly blurred relationship
   between paid employment and retirement facilitates a retirement
   transition period, a life course stage, which may involve a change of
   residence. The role of such pre-retirement age mobility in the
   repopulation of rural areas has, however, received relatively little
   academic scrutiny. This paper draws upon findings from a two-year study
   conducted in three UK case study areas. It examines the extent of
   pre-retirement age (aged 50-64) migration into remote rural communities
   and the impacts this type of movement has upon economic activity, social
   and community engagement and service provision. It is argued that while
   this under-researched cohort offers opportunities to support the social
   and economic sustainability of rural communities (at least in the short
   and medium term), there are notable challenges which are likely to
   emerge as it ages in situ. The findings are particularly relevant given
   national trends on population ageing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{In the geosciences, fine-scale detail of geomorphic surfaces, commonly
   parameterized as roughness, is growing in importance as a source of
   information for modeling natural phenomena and classifying features of
   interest. Terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanning
   (TLS), now well known to geologists, is a natural choice for collecting
   geospatial data. While many recent studies have investigated
   methodologies for estimating surface roughness from point clouds,
   research on the influence of instrumental bias on those point clouds and
   the resulting roughness estimates is scant. A scale-dependent bias in
   TLS range measurements could affect the outcome of studies relying on
   high-resolution surface morphology. Growing numbers of research
   applications in geomorphology, neotectonics, and other disciplines seek
   to measure the roughness of surfaces with local topographic variations
   (referred to as asperities) on the order of a few centimeters or less in
   size. These asperities may manifest as bed forms or pebbles in a
   streambed, or wavy textures on fault-slip surfaces. In order to assess
   the feasibility of applying TLS point cloud data sets to the task of
   measuring centimeter-scale surface roughness, we evaluated the
   relationship between roughness values of dimensionally controlled test
   targets measured with TLS scans and numerical simulations. We measured
   and simulated instrument rangefinder noise to estimate its influence on
   surface roughness measurements, which was found to decrease with
   increasing real surface roughness. The size of the area sampled by a
   single point measurement (effective radius) was also estimated. The
   ratio of the effective radius to the radius of surface asperities was
   found to correlate with the disparity between measured and expected
   roughness. Rangefinder noise was found to overestimate expected
   roughness by up to similar to 5\%, and the smoothing effect of the
   measurement size disparity was found to underestimate expected roughness
   by up to 20\%. Based on these results, it is evident that TLS point
   cloud geometry is correlated with instrument parameters, scan range, and
   the morphology of the real surface. As different geological applications
   of TLS may call for relative or absolute measurements of roughness at
   widely different scales, the presence of these biases imposes
   constraints on choice of instrument and scan network design. A general
   solution for such measurement biases lies in the development of
   calibration processes for TLS roughness measurement strategies, for
   which the results of this study establish a theoretical basis.}},

Title = {{Monitoring the cementitious materials subjected to sulfate attack with
   optical fiber excitation Raman spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{OPTICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Formation of ettringite and gypsum from sulfate attack together with
   carbonation and chloride ingress have been considered as the most
   serious deterioration mechanisms of concrete structures. Although
   electrical resistance sensors and fiber optic chemical sensors could be
   used to monitor the latter two mechanisms on site, currently there is no
   system for monitoring the deterioration mechanisms of sulfate attack. In
   this paper, a preliminary study was carried out to investigate the
   feasibility of monitoring sulfate attack with optical fiber excitation
   Raman spectroscopy through characterizing the ettringite and gypsum
   formed in deteriorated cementitious materials under an optical fiber
   excitation + objective collection configuration. Bench-mounted Raman
   spectroscopy analysis was also conducted to validate the spectrum
   obtained from the fiber-objective configuration. The results showed that
   the expected Raman bands of ettringite and gypsum in the
   sulfate-attacked cement paste can be clearly identified by the optical
   fiber excitation Raman spectrometer and are in good agreement with those
   identified from bench-mounted Raman spectrometer. Therefore, based on
   these preliminary results, it is considered that there is a good
   potential for developing an optical fiber-based Raman system to monitor
   the deterioration mechanisms of concrete subjected to sulfate attack in
   the future. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons

Abstract = {{Housing policy formation under the United Kingdom's devolution
   settlement is currently under-researched and insufficiently understood.
   This article uses the example of social housing policy-making in
   Northern Ireland to reflect on its impact. Five factors with the
   potential to influence post-devolution policy-making are identified:
   common UK citizenship and ideology, policy networks, the political
   process, the mechanics of devolution and membership of the European
   Union. A post-devolution review of social housing policy in Northern
   Ireland is followed by a discussion of three key issues from the 2007 to
   2011 administration: governance, procurement of new social housing, and
   shared space' and a shared future. Interviews with policy-makers
   indicate that 2007-2011 marked the beginnings of a trend away from the
   technocratic domination of officials towards greater intervention and
   policy ownership by politicians, but that the significance of this
   should not be overstated. The implications for multi-level and
   multi-jurisdictional policy-making in devolved and federal states are
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{An in situ high-energy X-ray diffraction cyclic tension test was carried
   out on a beta III Ti alloy to study its micromechanical behavior and the
   stress-induced phase transformation. Pre-strained material showed a
   microscopic multi-stage re-loading behavior following the sequence of
   elastic deformation, stress-induced martensite (SIM) transformation, a
   second stage of elastic deformation followed by a final stage of SIM
   transformation. Based on the relationship of internal strains and
   diffraction intensities between the beta phase and the SIM, it is
   concluded that after a small strain deformation, the austenite is
   divided into two different sets of grains with different properties.
   Those that previously experienced phase transformation have a lower
   critical stress for the SIM transformation due to residual martensite
   and dislocations, while the rest have a higher trigger stress and only
   transform to martensite after the stress is back to levels comparable to
   where transformation was seen in the previous cycle. The different
   properties within the same austenite grain family cause the multistage
   re-loading behavior. The reverse phase transformation during unloading
   was impeded by the combination of increased dislocation density in the
   austenite and the increased tensile strain in the martensite prior to
   unloading. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The aims of this study were to investigate wrist postures and forces
   while operating the shovel during tree planting and to determine if
   different tree unloading techniques result in variations in wrist
   postures and forces. Experienced tree planters performed the planting
   task in a laboratory environment for three conditions: (1) symmetric
   tree unloading, and asymmetric unloading resulting in (2) right-loaded
   planting bags and (3) left-loaded planting bags. An optoelectric system
   and a shovel instrumented with strain gauges captured wrist posture and
   forces at the wrist, respectively. Wrist extension of up to 45 degrees
   was observed, and this posture, in combination with varying degrees of
   wrist deviation, may be a primary risk factor for musculoskeletal pain.
   Average resultant forces at the wrist were moderately high (>30 N) for
   each unloading condition, indicating increased risk for the development
   of repetitive strain injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome. No
   significant differences in wrist posture or forces existed between
   unloading conditions. Practitioner Summary: Wrist pain is a major
   musculoskeletal complaint among tree planters. This study measured wrist
   postures and forces at the wrist while operating the shovel during tree
   planting. The wrist extension observed, in combination with deviation,
   may be a key risk factor for musculoskeletal pain. Forces at the wrist
   indicate increased risk for repetitive strain injuries.}},

Abstract = {{Isothermal heat treatment close to the martensite-start temperature at
   various transformation times, followed by hardness and compression
   tests, has been performed for three new high carbon experimental
   nanobainitic steels. Microstructural characterization clearly revealed
   the formation of lower bainitic structures with plate thickness in the
   range of nanometers. Analysis of the volume fraction of the bainitic
   phase via x-ray diffraction indicates that the presence of Co and Al
   accelerates the transformation resulting in almost complete
   transformation within 24 h. The effect of transformation and the
   resulting microstructure on the mechanical properties are also
   presented. Finally, the data collected from the compression tests have
   been used to develop an enhanced correlation between the yield strength
   and hardness in steels. Comparison of the improved correlation with
   three other frequently used correlations from the literature reveals a
   good performance of the proposed correlation.}},

Title = {{The influence of water motion on the growth rate of the kelp Laminaria

Abstract = {{The kelp Laminaria hyperborea is a dominant component of the subtidal
   nearshore ecosystem and is subjected to a heterogeneous wave and current
   climate. Water motion is known to influence physiological processes in
   macroalgae such as photosynthesis and nutrient uptake attributed to
   mass-transfer limitation. The study attempts to establish the effect of
   water motion on the growth rates of blades and elongation rates of the
   stipes of L hyperborea at adjacent wave-exposed and wave-sheltered
   locations over a 12 month period from field observations. The
   observations were supported by detailed physical and chemical
   measurements (light, temperature, seawater nutrient concentrations and
   hydrodynamics) and of tissue carbon and nitrogen concentrations together
   with delta(13) carbon. Despite a 30\% difference in the root mean square
   of the velocity (Vel(rms)) between the two survey locations, there was
   no evidence to suggest that water motion had any direct influence on the
   growth rates of either the blades or elongation of stipes of L.
   hyperborea. No significant differences were observed between either
   environmental or plant physiological variables between the sheltered and
   exposed locations. Using an integral velocity parameter (Vel(rms)) the
   present study also highlighted the importance of the tidally induced
   current component of water flow in the subtidal zone. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We present the results of direct and large-eddy simulations of spatially
   developing boundary layers subjected to favorable pressure gradient,
   strong enough to cause reversion of the flow towards a quasi-laminar
   state. The numerical results compare well with experimental data.
   Visualization of the flow structures shows the well-known stabilization
   of the streaks, the re-orientation of outer layer vortices in the
   streamwise direction, and the appearance of turbulent spots in the
   re-transition region. Both instantaneous visualizations and turbulent
   statistics highlight the significant damping of wall-normal and spanwise
   fluctuations. The fast component of the pressure fluctuations appears to
   be the main driver of this process, contributing to reduce pressure
   fluctuations and, as a consequence, the energy redistribution term in
   the Reynolds stress budgets. The streamwise stresses, in whose budget a
   separate production term plays a role, do not decay but remain frozen at
   their upstream value. The decrease of wall-normal and spanwise
   fluctuations appears to be the main cause of the inner-layer
   stabilization, by disrupting the generation and subsequent growth of
   streaks, consistent with various models of the turbulence-generation
   cycle proposed in the literature. The outer layer seems to play a
   passive role in this process. The stretching and reorientation of the
   outer-layer vortices results in a more orderly and organized structure;
   since fewer ejections occur, the inner layer does not break this
   reorganization, which is maintained until re-transition begins. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The exact maximum-likelihood (ML) detector for amplify-and-forward (AF)
   cooperative networks employing M-ary differential phase-shift keying
   (DPSK) in Rayleigh fading is derived in a single-integral form, which
   serves as a benchmark for differential AF networks. Two algorithms are
   then developed to reduce the complexity of the ML detector.
   Specifically, the first algorithm can eliminate a number of candidates
   in the ML search, while causing no loss of optimality of ML detection.
   In high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), this algorithm almost surely
   identifies a single candidate that amounts to the ML estimate of the
   signal. For low to medium SNRs with multiple candidates determined, we
   then derive an accurate closed-form approximation for the integral
   involved in the likelihood function, which only requires a five-sample
   evaluation per symbol candidate. Finally, combining these algorithms, we
   propose a closed-form approximate ML detector, which achieves an almost
   identical bit-error-rate (BER) performance to the exact ML detector at
   practical complexity. In particular, it is shown that the proposed
   approximate ML detector is far less complex than the well-known
   diversity combiner in high SNRs, while achieving approximately 1.7-dB
   gain in the 10(-5) BER when the relay is closer to the destination.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundIn this study, the efficiency of Guar gum as a biopolymer has
   been compared with two other widely used inorganic coagulants, ferric
   chloride (FeCl3) and aluminum chloride (AlCl3), for the treatment of
   effluent collected from the rubber-washing tanks of a rubber concentrate
   factory. Settling velocity distribution curves were plotted to
   demonstrate the flocculating effect of FeCl3, AlCl3 and Guar gum. FeCl3
   and AlCl3 displayed better turbidity removal than Guar gum at all
   settling velocities.
   ResultFeCl(3), AlCl3 and Guar gum removed 92.8\%, 88.2\% and 88.1\%
   turbidity, respectively, of raw wastewater at a settling velocity of 0.1
   cm min(-1), respectively. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) study
   conducted on the flocs revealed that Guar gum and FeCl(3)produced strong
   intercoiled honeycomb patterned floc structure capable of entrapping
   suspended particulate matter. Statistical experimental design Response
   Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to design all experiments, where the
   type and dosage of flocculant, pH and mixing speed were taken as control
   factors and, an optimum operational setting was proposed.
   ConclusionDue to biodegradability issues, the use of Guar gum as a
   flocculating agent for wastewater treatment in industry is highly
   recommended. (c) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Facilities management (FM) has witnessed a rapid development since its
   nascence in 1980s. Following its development, the concept of involving
   FM specialists in building design, simply called early FM involvement,
   has received an increasing attention from practitioners and researchers
   in the last decade, which makes it possible to incorporate FM knowledge
   and experience into the design process. This study investigates the
   involvement through a series of expert interviews in the United Kingdom.
   The objective of this study is to get a more thorough understanding of
   early FM involvement practice. The analysis of interview results shows
   that it is very important to address a variety of potential problems,
   such as the lack of operability, maintainability, and serviceability, by
   applying FM expertise to design decision-making. Early FM involvement in
   design is found to be particularly useful for the improvement of cost
   efficiency and effectiveness from a long-term perspective. Although it
   has received wide recognition today, it still encounters resistance in
   practice. To ensure its success, there is a need for all the key
   stakeholders, such as project clients, designers, and FM providers, to
   continue to make intense efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Digital manufacturing techniques can simulate complex assembly sequences
   using computer-aided design-based, as-designed' part forms, and their
   utility has been proven across several manufacturing sectors including
   the ship building, automotive and aerospace industries. However, the
   reality of working with actual parts and composite components, in
   particular, is that geometric variability arising from part forming or
   processing conditions can cause problems during assembly as the
   as-manufactured' form differs from the geometry used for any simulated
   build validation. In this work, a simulation strategy is presented for
   the study of the process-induced deformation behaviour of a 90 degrees,
   V-shaped angle. Test samples were thermoformed using pre-consolidated
   carbon fibre-reinforced polyphenylene sulphide, and the processing
   conditions were re-created in a virtual environment using the finite
   element method to determine finished component angles. A procedure was
   then developed for transferring predicted part forms from the finite
   element outputs to a digital manufacturing platform for the purpose of
   virtual assembly validation using more realistic part geometry.
   Ultimately, the outcomes from this work can be used to inform process
   condition choices, material configuration and tool design, so that the
   dimensional gap between as-designed' and as-manufactured' part forms can
   be reduced in the virtual environment.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for the desiccation of a geosynthetic clay liner (GCL)
   forming part of a single composite landfill liner is evaluated. A
   thermohydromechanical model is used to identify conditions likely to
   cause desiccation. Simulations for typical landfill conditions show that
   the potential risk of desiccation exists even at relatively low
   temperatures (i.e., 35 degrees C). It is found that the water content of
   the GCL prior to waste placement, the liner temperature, the overburden
   stress, the grain size and water content of the subsoil, and the depth
   to aquifer all affect the potential for desiccation. The results suggest
   that the placement of GCLs directly over coarse-grained soils or
   drainage layers should be evaluated carefully. This study highlights the
   need for more research into the potential for GCL desiccation and, in
   particular, the need to establish water retention curves for different
   GCLs over a range of stresses and degrees of hydration before heating,
   so that the effect of stress and hysteresis on the potential for
   desiccation can be examined. The findings of this study are limited by
   the approximations and assumptions described in the paper and, even
   then, apply only to the GCL and conditions examined. Changing the
   assumptions may change the findings. The findings should not be
   generalized to other composite liners without independent verification.
   The results serve to identify some of the situations that may lead to
   GCL desiccation, and it is hoped that they will prompt more research on
   this important topic. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The in situ ion irradiation technique has been employed to elucidate
   irradiation damage in the dual phase Zr-Excel alloy. 1 MeV Kr ion
   irradiation experiments were conducted at different temperatures ranging
   from 100 degrees C to 400 degrees C. Damage microstructures have been
   characterized by transmission electron microscopy in both the alpha
   (alpha) and beta (beta) phases after a maximum dose of 10 dpa at
   different temperatures. Several important observations including low
   temperature < c >-component loop formation, and irradiation induced
   omega (omega) phase precipitation have been reported. In situ
   irradiation provided an opportunity to observe the nucleation and growth
   of basal plane < c >-component loops and irradiation induced dissolution
   of secondary phase precipitates at the same time. It has been shown that
   under Kr ion irradiation the < c >-component loops start to nucleate and
   grow above a threshold dose, as has been observed for neutron
   irradiation. Furthermore, the role of temperature, material composition
   and pre-irradiation microstructure has been discussed in detail. (C)

Title = {{The role of chemical free energy and elastic strain in the nucleation of
   zirconium hydride}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{441}},
Number = {{1-3}},
Pages = {{395-401}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this work a combination of synchrotron X-ray diffraction and
   thermodynamic modelling has been used to study the dissolution and
   precipitation of zirconium hydride in alpha-Zr establishing the role of
   elastic misfit strain and chemical free energy in the alpha -> alpha +
   delta phase transformation. The nucleation of zirconium hydride is
   dominated by the chemical free energy where the chemical driving force
   for hydride precipitation is proportional to the terminal-solid
   solubility for precipitation and can be predicted by a function that is
   analogous to the universal nucleation parameter for the bainite
   transformation in ferrous alloys. The terminal-solid solubility for
   precipitation was found to be kinetically limited >= 287 degrees C at a
   cooling rate of 5 degrees C min(-1) or greater. The terminal
   solubilities were established using an offset method applied to the
   lattice strain data where a resolution of similar to 10 wppm H can be
   achieved in the < c >-direction. This is aided by the introduction of
   intra-granular strains in the < c >-direction during cooling as a result
   of the thermal expansion anisotropy which increases the anisotropy
   associated with the misfitting H atoms within the alpha-Zr lattice. (C)

Abstract = {{Porous titanium samples were manufactured using the 3D printing and
   sintering method in order to determine the effects of final sintering
   temperature on morphology and mechanical properties. Cylindrical samples
   were printed and split into groups according to a final sintering
   temperature (FST). Irregular geometry samples were also printed and
   split into groups according to their FST. The cylindrical samples were
   used to determine part shrinkage, in compressive tests to provide
   stress-strain data, in microCT scans to provide internal morphology data
   and for optical microscopy to determine surface morphology. All of the
   samples were used in microhardness testing to establish the hardness.
   Below 1100 degrees C FST, shrinkage was in the region of 20\% but
   increased to approximately 30\% by a FST of 1300 degrees C. Porosity
   varied from a maximum of approximately 65\% at the surface to the region
   of 30\% internally. Between 97 and 99\% of the internal porosity is
   interconnected. Average pore size varied between 24 mu m at the surface
   and 19 pm internally. Sample hardness increased to in excess of 300
   HV0.05 with increasing FST while samples with an FST of below 1250
   degrees C produced an elastic-brittle stress/strain curve and samples
   above this displayed elastic-plastic behaviour. Yield strength increased
   significantly through the range of sintering temperatures while the
   Young's modulus remained fairly consistent. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The remit of the UK-China Science Bridge is to accelerate deployment of
   research knowledge in sustainable solutions for the built environment
   developed at Queen's University Belfast, to high-ranking partner
   universities and research institutions in China. To achieve this, proof
   of concept studies are being undertaken at key Chinese universities and
   research centres to assess the relevance and transferability of Queen's
   University-developed technologies. Particular attention is given to
   non-destructive testing and sensors for monitoring the durability of
   structures as well as a novel form of construction called `flexible
   arch'. Chinese counterparts aim to set up monitoring systems in concrete
   bridges using sensor systems from Queen's. Data from these monitoring
   stations will be used to predict the service life and structural health
   performance of concrete bridges in marine environments. The aim of this
   paper is to introduce this international collaborative programme and
   research, allowing other organisations to benefit from the outcomes. (C)

Abstract = {{A series of laboratory tests were carried out to investigate the effect
   of temperature on the early-age strength development of lightweight
   self-compacting and vibrated concrete mixtures. These had been developed
   at Queen's University Belfast as part of a Technology Strategy Board.
   funded project aimed at developing lightweight and low energy concretes.
   The new mixtures incorporated high volumes of pulverised fuel ash (PFA),
   ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), and limestone powder (LSP).
   Activator, i.e. sodium sulphate, was used to improve the early age
   strength development of vibrated concrete mixtures proportioned with PFA
   and GGBS. For each mixture, concrete cubes were manufactured and cured
   under isothermal (20 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 40 degrees C and 50
   degrees C) as well as adiabatic conditions. The temperature rise under
   adiabatic curing conditions was also measured. The resulting isothermal
   strength data were analysed to determine the apparent activation
   energies of the binders/mixtures used. The suitability of maturity
   methods for predicting concrete strength development of these low energy
   lightweight self-compacting and vibrated concrete mixtures under
   non-isothermal, i.e. adiabatic, curing was assessed. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A bridge was damaged when a dump truck violated the height clearance
   limitation on Highway 401 in Ontario, Canada. The collision caused
   extensive damage to the AASHTO Type-III precast/prestressed bridge
   girders, which led to the closure of the two-lane bridge. Crack mapping
   showed extensive torsion-shear cracks between the girder quarter points,
   horizontal crack at the flange-web junctions, and spalled concrete at
   point of impact. Preliminary elastic testing on the girder established
   that the flexural capacity of the girder had not been significantly
   affected. As such, flexural strengthening was not necessary. Crack
   patterns and severity, followed by analysis, have shown that the girder
   is deficient in shear capacity. Therefore, the girder was strengthened
   for shear throughout its entire length using carbon fiber-reinforced
   polymer (CFRP) sheets. This paper presents a summary of the design and
   detailing of the elastic behavior test conducted before repair, the
   girder repair methodology, and results from proof load testing of the
   repaired girder. It was shown that the rehabilitated girder could
   sustain flexural live load demand. A field application was also carried
   out using the same rehabilitation technique on another impact-damaged
   bridge in Ontario. It was viewed as a major budget-saving project
   compared to the girder replacement alternative, because of the speed of
   rehabilitation and the minor traffic disruptions.}},

Abstract = {{Pipelines extend thousands of kilometers for transport and distribution
   of oil, gas, and other chemical products. With the ever persistent
   challenges often faced with corrosion, relative rigidity, and other
   issues characteristic to steel pipes, the need to explore the use of new
   pipeline materials, such as glass fiber-reinforced polymers (GFRP),
   increases. The pipe-soil interaction and the longitudinal behavior of
   such pipes resulting from relative ground movements is poorly
   understood. In this study, a series of GFRP pipe bending experiments
   have been conducted on 115-mm-diameter and 1,830-mm-long GFRP pipes
   buried in dense sand. The pipe ends were pulled by two parallel cables
   attached to a spreader beam outside the test region, which was pulled by
   a hydraulic actuator. The study investigated the effect of laminate
   structure of pipe, including a cross-ply and angle-ply laminates, on the
   strength, deflections and failure modes, at different burial
   depth-to-diameter (H/D) ratios of 3, 5, and 7. Results were also
   compared with steel control pipes of comparable dimensions and pressure
   rating. The peak load was shown to increase as burial depth increases,
   and was generally associated with soil failure, except for the angle-ply
   pipe at H/D=7 that experienced a structural failure. At peak loads, the
   net deflections of GFRP pipes were 4-7.5 times those of the equivalent
   steel pipes, with the cross-ply pipes being stiffer than angle-ply
   pipes.}},

Abstract = {{Glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) shear connectors provide much
   reduced thermal bridging in insulated concrete sandwich panels compared
   to steel connectors. In this study, 50 specimens with dimensions of
   254x254x900mm representing segments of a precast sandwich wall
   comprising two concrete wythes and a concrete stud surrounded by
   insulation foam have been tested in a double-shear configuration. Three
   types of GFRP connectors produced from available sand-coated and
   threaded rods were tested and compared to conventional steel and polymer
   connectors. GFRP connector diameters varied from 6 to 13mm, and spacing
   varied from 80 to 300mm. Both circular and rectangular cross sections
   were examined, along with various end treatments to compare with simple
   straight embedment. The shear strength of GFRP connectors, including the
   effect of friction between concrete and foam, ranged from 60 to 112MPa,
   significantly higher than polymer connectors but lower than steel
   connectors. As the connectors bridged a small gab of insulation between
   concrete wythe and stud, their shear strength was lower than
   manufacturer-reported values. Varying the size, spacing, cross-section
   shape, or end treatment of connectors had insignificant effect on their
   strength. The connectors failed by longitudinal delamination then
   transverse shear but did not pull out of the concrete wythe. Adhesion
   bond between concrete and insulation was quite significant and
   contributed about 28\%, but was quite random and variable. A model was
   developed to predict the strength of connectors and clearly demonstrated
   the reduction in strength as thickness of insulation layer increases.}},

Abstract = {{We present a needle deflection estimation method to anticipate needle
   bending during insertion into deformable tissue. Using limited
   additional sensory information, our approach reduces the estimation
   error caused by uncertainties inherent in the conventional needle
   deflection estimation methods. We use Kalman filters to combine a
   kinematic needle deflection model with the position measurements of the
   base and the tip of the needle taken by electromagnetic (EM) trackers.
   One EM tracker is installed on the needle base and estimates the needle
   tip position indirectly using the kinematic needle deflection model.
   Another EM tracker is installed on the needle tip and estimates the
   needle tip position through direct, but noisy measurements. Kalman
   filters are then employed to fuse these two estimates in real time and
   provide a reliable estimate of the needle tip position, with reduced
   variance in the estimation error. We implemented this method to
   compensate for needle deflection during simulated needle insertions and
   performed sensitivity analysis for various conditions. At an insertion
   depth of 150 mm, we observed needle tip estimation error reductions in
   the range of 28\% (from 1.8 to 1.3 mm) to 74\% (from 4.8 to 1.2 mm),
   which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, offering a
   clinically practical solution.}},

Abstract = {{In intelligent video surveillance systems, scalability (of the number of
   simultaneous video streams) is important. Two key factors which hinder
   scalability are the time spent in decompressing the input video streams,
   and the limited computational power of the processor. This paper
   demonstrates how a combination of algorithmic and hardware techniques
   can overcome these limitations, and significantly increase the number of
   simultaneous streams. The techniques used are processing in the
   compressed domain, and exploitation of the multicore and vector
   processing capability of modern processors. The paper presents a system
   which performs background modeling, using a Mixture of Gaussians
   approach. This is an important first step in the segmentation of moving
   targets. The paper explores the effects of reducing the number of
   coefficients in the compressed domain, in terms of throughput speed and
   quality of the background modeling. The speedups achieved by exploiting
   compressed domain processing, multicore and vector processing are
   explored individually. Experiments show that a combination of all these
   techniques can give a speedup of 170 times on a single CPU compared to a
   purely serial, spatial domain implementation, with a slight gain in
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the numerical modeling of lightweight sandwich
   panels intended for cladding of buildings. The proposed sandwich panels
   are composed of woven glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) skins and
   ribs and soft polyurethane foam core, which provides excellent
   insulation. The panels are designed to resist wind loading. A robust 3D
   FE model was developed for the large scale panels (9145 x 2440 x 78
   mm(3)) tested under transverse loading. The model accounts for material
   nonlinearities; most pronounced in the soft polyurethane core and in the
   {[}0/90] GFRP ribs under shear, as well as geometric nonlinearities in
   the form of a reduction in panel thickness due to the soft core. The
   model captures both stability and material failure modes, essentially
   skin wrinkling and crushing in compression. It was then successfully
   validated using experimental results. Failure of the tension skin never
   occurred in this type of panels as compression skin wrinkling and
   crushing consistently governed. The cladding panel was shown to satisfy
   design code requirements in terms of strength and stiffness. Crown

Abstract = {{Results are presented of a surficial geomicrobiological investigation of
   glacial cover overlying buried mineralization at the Talbot prospect,
   Manitoba, Canada, where previous surficial geochemistry surveys
   indicated anomalous concentrations of elements above the buried
   mineralization. The Cu-Zn volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) occurrence
   is overlain by 100 m of Paleozoic dolomites and Quaternary glacial
   cover. The geomicrobiological investigation demonstrates that there is a
   distinct microbial ecology at the anomalous sampling locations,
   especially directly overlying buried mineralization. The combined
   geochemical and geomicrobiological analyses reveal the presence of an
   anomaly directly over mineralization due to oxidation of the buried ore.
   Specifically, geomicrobiological analyses yield an inverse correlation
   between Zn in the clay-size (<2 mu m) fraction and total microbial
   biomass and a direct correlation between Cu in the clay-size (<2 mu m)
   fraction and abundance of methanotrophic bacteria. These results
   demonstrate that microbiological analyses can be a useful addition to
   geochemical exploration by revealing metal transport and sequestration
   processes and enhancing surficial anomalies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this study, the use of co-occurring discriminators of sewage and
   manure was assessed as a potential way to disentangle sewage and manure
   sources. A suite of human and veterinary derived chemical markers, which
   includes pharmaceuticals and compound such as food additives, has been
   identified for this purpose. The suite was selected in such a manner as
   to provide additional source characterisation, e.g. differentiating raw
   versus treated sewage inputs. An SPE-LC-MS/MS method was developed and
   validated for the determined suite of chemical markers with a detection
   limit of up to 50 pg L-1. This represents one of the lowest limits of
   detection for pharmaceuticals reported in literature. To illustrate the
   suitability of the proposed method to differentiate sewage and manure
   inputs to surface water bodies, results from surface water samples
   collected at monitoring sites corresponding to specific land use types
   within Ireland are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Potentially toxic elements (PTEs) including nickel and chromium are
   often present in soils overlying basalt at concentrations above
   regulatory guidance values due to the presence of these elements in
   underlying geology. Oral bioaccessibility testing allows the risk posed
   by PTEs to human health to be assessed; however, bioaccessibility is
   controlled by factors including mineralogy, particle size, solid-phase
   speciation and encapsulation. X-ray diffraction was used to characterise
   the mineralogy of 12 soil samples overlying Palaeogene basalt lavas in
   Northern Ireland, and non-specific sequential extraction coupled with
   chemometric analysis was used to determine the distribution of elements
   amongst soil components in 3 of these samples. The data obtained were
   related to total concentration and oral bioaccessible concentration to
   determine whether a relationship exists between the overall
   concentrations of PTEs, their bioaccessibility and the soils mineralogy
   and geochemistry. Gastric phase bioaccessible fraction (BAF \%) ranged
   from 0.4 to 5.4 \% for chromium in soils overlying basalt and
   bioaccessible and total chromium concentrations are positively
   correlated. In contrast, the range of gastric phase BAF for nickel was
   greater (1.4-43.8 \%), while no significant correlation was observed
   between bioaccessible and total nickel concentrations. However, nickel
   BAF was inversely correlated with total concentration. Solid-phase
   fractionation information showed that bioaccessible nickel was
   associated with calcium carbonate, aluminium oxide, iron oxide and
   clay-related components, while bioaccessible chromium was associated
   with clay-related components. This suggests that weathering
   significantly affects nickel bioaccessibility, but does not have the
   same effect on the bioaccessibility of chromium.}},

Abstract = {{Correlation analyses were conducted on nickel (Ni), vanadium (V) and
   zinc (Zn) oral bioaccessible fractions (BAFs) and selected geochemistry
   parameters to identify specific controls exerted over trace element
   bioaccessibility. BAFs were determined by previous research using the
   unified BARGE method. Total trace element concentrations and soil
   geochemical parameters were analysed as part of the Geological Survey of
   Northern Ireland Tellus Project. Correlation analysis included Ni, V and
   Zn BAFs against their total concentrations, pH, estimated soil organic
   carbon (SOC) and a further eight element oxides. BAF data were divided
   into three separate generic bedrock classifications of basalt, lithic
   arenite and mudstone prior to analysis, resulting in an increase in
   average correlation coefficients between BAFs and geochemical
   parameters. Sulphur trioxide and SOC, spatially correlated with upland
   peat soils, exhibited significant positive correlations with all BAFs in
   gastric and gastro-intestinal digestion phases, with such effects being
   strongest in the lithic arenite bedrock group. Significant negative
   relationships with bioaccessible Ni, V and Zn and their associated total
   concentrations were observed for the basalt group. Major element oxides
   were associated with reduced oral trace element bioaccessibility, with
   Al2O3 resulting in the highest number of significant negative
   correlations followed by Fe2O3. spatial mapping showed that metal oxides
   were present at reduced levels in peat soils. The findings illustrate
   how specific geology and soil geochemistry exert controls over trace
   element bioaccessibility, with soil chemical factors having a stronger
   influence on BAF results than relative geogenic abundance. In general,
   higher Ni, V and Zn bioaccessibility is expected in peat soil types.}},

Abstract = {{A novel selective fluorescent chemosensor based on naphthalimide

   subtle disturbance. The complex (AN-SB-Cu2+) formed by Cu2+ and AN-SB
   displayed high specificity for H2PO4-. Among the various anions, only
   H2PO4- induced the revival of color and fluorescence of AN-SB, resulting
   in ``off-on{''} type sensing of H2PO4- anion. The signal transduction
   occured via reversible formation-separation of complex AN-SB-Cu2+,
   however, slight changes were observed in the presence of other anions.

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{Broadcast spawning invertebrates that live in shallow, high-energy
   coastal habitats are subjected to oscillatory water motion that creates
   unsteady flow fields above the surface of animals. The frequency of the
   oscillatory fluctuations is driven by the wave period, which will
   influence the stability of local flow structures and may affect
   fertilization processes. Using an oscillatory water tunnel, we
   quantified the percentage of eggs fertilized on or near spawning green
   sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis. Eggs were sampled in the
   water column, wake eddy, substratum and aboral surface under a range of
   different periods (T = 4.5 - 12.7 s) and velocities of oscillatory flow.
   The root-mean-square wave velocity (rms(u(w))) was a good predictor of
   fertilization in oscillatory flow, although the root-mean-square of
   total velocity (rms(u)), which incorporates all the components of flow
   (current, wave and turbulence), also provided significant predictions.
   The percentage of eggs fertilized varied between 50 - 85\% at low flows
   (rms(u(w)) < 0.02 m s(-1)), depending on the location sampled, but
   declined to below 10\% for most locations at higher rms(u(w)). The water
   column was an important location for fertilization with a relative
   contribution greater than that of the aboral surface, especially at
   medium and high rms(u(w)) categories. We conclude that gametes can be
   successfully fertilized on or near the parent under a range of
   oscillatory flow conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A new class of functionalised dicationic ionic liquids, containing a
   central cationic unit capped by a basic functionality (imidazole), has
   been synthesised. These salts have been characterised in isotropic
   solution using proton and 2D-NMR spectroscopy, and their thermal
   stability has been studied by DSC and TGA. All these novel salts contain
   the
   1-(1-imidazolylmethyl)-3,5-di\{1-(3'-octylimidazolyInnethyl)\}-benzene
   cation as a defining structural motif. Salts of both singly and doubly
   charged anions were prepared and, in particular, the selected monoanions
   (Br-, {[}BF4](-), or {[}NTf2](-)) differ in size, shape and
   hydrogen-bonding ability, whereas the dianions differ in the nature of
   the spacer, such as 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate,
   2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate, 1,5- and 2,6-naphthalenedisulfonate,
   1,4-butanedicarboxylate, and 1,6-hexanedicarbmlate. These ionic liquids
   exhibit the presence of different conformers in solution, whose
   distribution is affected by the nature of the anion. The nature of the

Title = {{Multiple sources of selenium in ancient seafloor hydrothermal systems:
   Compositional and Se, S, and Pb isotopic evidence from volcanic-hosted
   and volcanic-sediment-hosted massive sulfide deposits of the Finlayson
   Lake District, Yukon, Canada}},

Abstract = {{Volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) and volcanic-sediment-hosted
   massive sulfide (VSHMS; i.e., hosted by both volcanic and sedimentary
   rocks) deposits in the Finlayson Lake District, Yukon, Canada, provide a
   unique opportunity to study the influence of seafloor and sub-seafloor
   hydrothermal processes on the formation of Se-poor (GP4F VHMS deposit; 7
   ppm Se average), intermediate (Kudz Ze Kayah-KZK VHMS deposit; 200 ppm
   Se average), and Se-enriched (Wolverine VSHMS deposit; 1100 ppm Se
   average) mineralization. All three deposits are hosted by mid-Paleozoic
   (similar to 360-346 Ma) felsic volcanic rocks, but only the Wolverine
   deposit has voluminous coeval carbonaceous argillites (black shales) in
   the host rock package. Here we report the first application of Se
   isotope analyses to ancient seafloor mineralization and use these data,
   in conjunction with Pb and S isotope analyses, to better understand the
   source(s) and depositional process(es) of Se within VHMS and VSHMS
   systems. The wide range of delta Se-82 (-10.2 parts per thousand to 1.3
   parts per thousand, relative to NIST 3149), delta S-34 (+2.0 parts per
   thousand to +12.8 parts per thousand CDT), and elevated Se contents (up
   to 5865 ppm) within the Wolverine deposit contrast with the narrower
   range of delta Se-82 (-3.8 parts per thousand to -0.5 parts per
   thousand), delta S-34 (9.8 parts per thousand to 13.0 parts per
   thousand), and lower Se contents (200 ppm average) of the KZK deposit.
   The Wolverine and KZK deposits have similar sulfide depositional
   histories (i.e., deposition at the seafloor, with concomitant zone
   refining). The Se in the KZK deposit is magmatic (leaching or degassing)
   in origin, whereas the Wolverine deposit requires an additional large
   isotopically negative Se source (i.e. similar to-15 parts per thousand
   delta Se-82). The negative delta Se-82 values for the Wolverine deposit
   are at the extreme light end for measured terrestrial samples, and the
   lightest observed for hypogene sulfide minerals, but are within
   calculated equilibrium values of delta Se-82 relative to NIST 3149
   (similar to 30 parts per thousand at 25 degrees C between SeO4 and
   Se-2(-)). We propose that the most negative Se isotope values at the
   Wolverine deposit record the delta Se-82 of the Se-source, and that the
   wide range in delta Se-82 values results from the combined effects of
   thermal and chemical degradation and Se-loss from the carbonaceous
   argillite source to a hydrothermal fluid (including magmatic Se i.e.,
   leached and/or magmatic-hydrothermal) with deposition at or near the
   paleoseafloor. Pristine unaltered black shales show little variation in
   delta Se-82 relative to bulk earth; Se accumulation and fractionation to
   more negative isotopic values is interpreted to have been produced by
   post-sediment deposition, but pre-ore stage, reduction of seawater Se
   within the black shales. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The semiconductor-sensitised photocatalytic (SPC) carbon-carbon coupling
   of phenoxyacetic acid (PAA) and N-methylmaleimide (NMI) or maleimide
   (MI) has recently been reported and is studied in more detail.
   Irradiations are performed on a much smaller scale than commonly used,
   i.e. 1 mL of reaction solution in a sol-gel titania coated NMR tube, and
   NMR is used to monitor the progress of the various photoreactions. Use
   of an NMR tube as the photoreactor allows much faster reaction times
   (ca. 10 times faster than the 40 mL scale reaction), and helps avoid the
   more usual need for sample-taking and pre-treatment, before analysis by
   NMR, HPLC etc. The photochemistries and photocatalytic processes
   associated with the individual reactants (i.e. PAA and NMI or MI) reveal
   the production of significant products which are largely absent in the
   SPC-sensitised coupling reaction. Thus, when both PM and NMI or MI are
   irradiated together, in the study of the coupling reaction the two main
   products formed are: 1-methyl-3-(phenoxymethyl)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione
   (the adduct product), and
   2methyl-3a,4-dihydrochromeno{[}3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3(2H,9bH)-dione (the
   cyclic product), which are formed in reasonable yields up to 67\% and
   15\% respectively after only 15 min (I=3.5 mW cm(-2) per photoreactor
   hemisphere). Despite the well-known photochemical feature of NMI to form
   dimers efficiently, this work demonstrates that the background
   photochemistry and photocatalysis associated with the individual
   reactants, PM and NMI, in the photocatalysed coupling reaction are
   minimal due to the faster SPC kinetics for the coupling reaction, and
   the UV-filter effect of the sal-gel titania coating. The additional
   formation of organic polymeric material in all the photocatalytic
   processes studied is discussed briefly. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The phase transformation and texture change of two Co-28Cr-6Mo alloys
   during room temperature deformation were studied by using the in-situ
   synchrotron X-ray diffraction. It is found that a slight difference in
   chemical compositions can significantly change the phase constitutions
   and the mechanical properties. For the material with less Ni, C and N
   (lower alpha-phase stability), increasing the grain size promotes the
   athermal martensite transformation during cooling. The kinetics of the
   Stress Induced Martensite (SIM) phase transformation may be more
   affected by the athermal martensite instead of the grain size of the
   alpha-phase. After deformation, similar textures are produced in samples
   regardless the differences in the initial structures such as the phase
   constitution and the grain size; while a relatively strong (111) texture
   and a weak (100) texture are produced in the alpha-phase, a \{10 (1)
   over bar1\} fiber texture is gradually developed in the epsilon-phase
   during uniaxial tension. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   and CO2 methanation were more important than decarbonylation and
   hydrodeoxygenation at small conversions for all catalysts whereas the

Abstract = {{A series of Sr2 xNdxNi2 Fe28 yCoyO46 (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10
   and y = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) X-type hexagonal ferrites has been
   prepared by sol-gel method at 1250 degrees C for 6 h. XRD analysis shows
   the single phase of the prepared ferrites material. The lattice constant
   values and c/a ratio shows that the present assembled material belongs
   to the family X-type hexagonal ferrites. The peaks in the FTIR spectra
   are the characteristics of the hexagonal ferrites. The crystallite size
   measured by Scherer formula is in good agreement with the crystallite
   size measured by TEM and HRTEM. The enhancement in the magnetic
   properties can easily be observed with the doping of rare earth element
   Nd3+ and divalent Co2+. Due to high saturation and low coercivity values
   the present material can be good microwave absorber. The temperature
   dependent saturation and remanance magnetization decreases monotonically
   with temperature. The minimum value of reflection loss enhances with the
   substituent and the attenuation constant results are in agreement with
   reflection loss results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Development of a Model Selection Criterion for Accurate Model
   Predictions at Desired Operating Conditions}},

Abstract = {{A methodology is proposed for selecting parameters to estimate when data
   are too limited to estimate all kinetic,thermodynamic, and mass transfer
   parameters. in complex models Of chemical processes. When data are
   sparse, noisy, or correlated, it is often letter to obtain predictions
   from a simplified model (SM) where a few parameters have been removed
   via simplifying assumptions or some parameters are fixed at nominal
   values based on prior knowledge. Reducing the number of estimated
   parameters leads to bias in model predictions, but also lowers
   prediction variance. Trade-off between bias and variance is assessed
   using the mean squared error (MSE) of the model predictions. The
   proposed model selection criterion is an advance over previous criteria
   in the literature because arbitrary tuning parameters are not required,
   computations are relatively simple, and the user can specify key
   operating conditions where accurate predictions are desired. Important
   benefits are that overfitting of noisy data is prevented and standard
   least-squares parameter estimation can be used without numerical
   difficulties. Monte Carlo simulations are used to assess the
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology for parameter selection in
   linear and nonlinear models. This approach will be valuable for
   industrial modelers who want to make accurate predictions about new
   product specifications or grades.}},
