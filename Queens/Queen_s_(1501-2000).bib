Abstract = {{Numerical models used by engineers to simulate rockmass behaviour are
   often limited by poor or incomplete representations of post-yield
   behaviour. Although conventional plasticity theory is often capable of
   predicting stress distributions around excavations, it is more difficult
   to fully capture the complex displacement patterns that are observed in
   situ. This is largely because conventional material models fail to
   capture the confinement and damage accumulation dependencies of
   post-yield dilatancy. Even with these mechanistic limitations in mind,
   simple constitutive models can be used for practical applications,
   although no reliable methodology for parameter selection exists. This
   study aims to remedy this deficiency. In this work, existing models for
   dilatancy based on laboratory testing data are considered and their
   limitations are discussed. The most accurate of these models add
   complexity to the analyses and also require additional input parameters
   beyond those which are typically obtained from laboratory testing. While
   the concept of a constant dilation angle during yield is not physically
   valid, it may be, in some cases, a sufficient model for ground response
   prediction. It is of interest, for practical engineering analyses, to
   understand the conditions where this additional complexity is required
   and where simplified models may be adequate. For the case of circular
   excavations in a uniform stress field, plastic zone displacements for
   mobilized and constant dilation angle models are compared and parametric
   sensitivities are discussed. Many material parameter combinations
   representative of relatively ductile rockmasses are tested, and it is
   shown that for most of these cases, the results obtained using a
   mobilized dilation angle can be well approximated through the use of an
   appropriate best-fit constant dilation angle. Through a statistical
   analysis of the data, a practical methodology for the selection of a
   constant dilation angle for use in simpler continuum numerical models is
   proposed. Further analysis under more general conditions performed using
   finite-difference models shows that the methodology can be applied to
   non-circular excavation geometries (errors are only significant near
   corners), general strain softening behaviour, and non-hydrostatic stress
   conditions where the stress anisotropy is moderate. An example of the
   methodology is presented in the context of extensometer data from a deep
   mine shaft, and the success of the methodology in providing a reasonable
   dilation angle estimate is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for using a distributed fibre optic strain sensor system
   to detect and quantify localised reinforcement deterioration and explore
   the failure mechanism of reinforced concrete beams is investigated. The
   objective is to discover whether distributed fibre optic strain sensors
   installed either internally or externally can detect pitting corrosion
   in reinforced concrete beams, and be used to better understand
   structural behaviour. These sensors enable strain to be measured along
   the full length of the fibre optic cable, whereas conventional
   electrical resistance strain gauges offer discrete measurements that may
   not capture localised strain changes. Axial tension tests on
   reinforcement bars demonstrate that deterioration detection is possible,
   but that quantification of deterioration is not necessarily
   straightforward, depending on the extent of deterioration. Four-point
   bending tests on reinforced concrete beams illustrate that localised
   deterioration can be detected and quantified with embedded sensing
   fibres and that cracks can be detected using externally bonded fibres.
   The top and bottom reinforcement strain profiles are used to demonstrate
   that the unexpected ultimate failure loads of the beams are the result
   of specimens behaving as tied arches at failure. Overall the distributed
   fibre optic sensor system proves to be effective for detection and
   quantification of localised deterioration and provides the necessary
   data to assess the beam failure mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Increased unilateral foot pronation may cause biomechanical
   changes on the lower limbs during gait. We investigated the effects of
   increased unilateral foot pronation on the biomechanics of lower limbs
   and pelvis during gait.
   Methods: Kinematic and kinetic data of 22 participants were collected
   while they walked wearing flat and laterally wedged sandals. Principal
   omponent analysis was used to compare differences between conditions.
   Findings: Wearing the wedged sandal on the ipsilateral side increased
   ankle eversion moment (p < 0.001; effect size = 0.97); rearfoot eversion
   angle (p < 0.001; effect size = 0.76); shank internal rotation (p =
   0.009; effect size = 0.53); increased and reduced knee internal rotation
   angle during early and late stance, respectively (p < 0.001; effect size
   = 0.89); increased femur internal rotation (p = 0.005; effect size =
   0.90); reduced hip internal rotation moment during late stance (p =
   0.001; effect size = 0.68); and increased pelvic ipsilateral drop (p =
   0.02; effect size = 0.48) of the ipsilateral side. Wearing the wedged
   sandal on the contralateral side increased pelvic contralateral drop (p
   = 0.001; effect size = 0.63); hip adduction moment throughout stance (p
   = 0.027; effect size = 0.46); and increased and reduced the knee
   adduction moment in early and late stance, respectively (p < 0.001;
   effect size = 0.79).
   Interpretation: The increased lower limb internal rotation caused by the
   wedged sandal reinforces the assumption that rearfoot eversion is
   coupled with shank internal rotation. The increased pelvic contralateral
   drop caused by the wedged sandal on the contralateral side may explain
   the increased hip and knee adduction moments on the ipsilateral side.
   Increased unilateral foot pronation causes biomechanical changes on both
   lower limbs that are associated with the occurrence of injuries. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: A decline in walking capacity and high energy cost can limit
   mobility following stroke. Mechanical energy exchange between lower limb
   and trunk segments can reflect gait inefficiencies, but reveals little
   about active energy flow between adjacent segments through muscle
   actions. This study evaluated mechanical energy expenditures (MEEs)
   during walking in stroke and healthy groups to understand movement
   control and explore the impact of walking speed on mechanical energy
   exchanges.
   Methods: Thirteen adults with hemiparesis and six healthy controls
   walked at self-selected speed. Power curves for each lower limb joint
   were segmented into concentric and eccentric sources of muscle power and
   transfer/no-transfer modes to calculate MEEs during stance.
   Findings: MEEs were lower in the stroke group on the affected side
   compared to the less affected side and compared to controls.
   Specifically, the affected plantarflexors transferred less energy
   distally via concentric action in late stance compared to the less
   affected side. However, the stroke group generated greater energy at the
   ankle in the absence of transfer compared to controls. Less
   concentrically transferred energy through midstance and absorbed in late
   stance was evident by the knee extensors bilaterally in stroke. At the
   hip, the total energy (no transfer) was reduced on the affected side.
   Classifying stroke subjects by walking speed (<.6 m/s, >.6 m/s) revealed
   disruptions in harnessing energy through motion and transfer energy
   across segments in the slower group.
   Interpretation: The limited ability of those with stroke to exploit
   intersegmental energy transfer to optimize efficiency may limit
   endurance and functional independence. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An automotive engine cradle supports many crucial components and
   systems, such as an engine, transmission, and suspension. Important
   performance measures for the design of an engine cradle include
   stiffness, natural frequency, and durability, while minimizing weight is
   of primary concern. This paper presents an effective and efficient
   methodology for engine cradle design from conceptual design to detailed
   design using design optimization. First, topology optimization was
   applied on a solid model which only contains the possible engine cradle
   design space, and an optimum conceptual design was determined which
   minimizes weight while satisfying all stiffness constraints. Based on
   topology optimization results, a design review was conducted, and a
   revised model was created which addresses all structural and
   manufacturability concerns. Shape and size optimization was then
   performed in the detailed design stage to further minimize the mass
   while meeting the stiffness and natural frequency targets. Lastly, the
   final design was validated for durability. The initial design domain had
   the mass of 82.6 kg; topology optimization in conceptual design reduced
   the mass to 26.7 kg; and the detailed design task involving shape and
   size optimization further reduced the mass to 21.4 kg.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors deal with the problem of parametric detection
   for relatively small targets using space-time adaptive processing
   (STAP). In contrast to the existing parametric STAP detectors, the
   proposed detectors perform range estimation by exploiting the spillover
   of the target energy between consecutive samples. To this end, the
   authors assume that the received useful signal is known up to a complex
   unknown deterministic factor parameter and the disturbance signal is
   modelled as a multichannel autoregressive Gaussian process. Moreover,
   the authors assume that a set of secondary data is available which are
   free of signal components, but have the same unknown parameters as the
   disturbance in the cells under test. Using these assumptions, the
   so-called simplified generalised likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and the
   two-step GLRT are derived and assessed. It is worth noting that the
   simplified GLRT is based on an asymptotic ML estimate of the amplitude,
   which leads to a simple and closed-form detection statistic. The
   performance assessment, conducted resorting to both simulated dataset
   and KASSPER dataset, has shown that the proposed decision schemes can
   provide accurate estimates of the target position within the cell under
   test and ensure enhanced detection performance compared with their
   natural competitors.}},

Abstract = {{Electing a leader is a fundamental task in distributed computing. In its

   This article focuses on studying the message and time complexity of

   Surprisingly, the most ``obvious{''} complexity bounds have not been

   nontrivial to show for randomized (Monte Carlo) algorithms. (Recent

   the network, is not a lower bound on the messages in complete networks,
   make the above bounds somewhat less obvious). To the best of our
   knowledge, these basic lower bounds have not been established even for
   deterministic algorithms, except for the restricted case of comparison
   algorithms, where it was also required that nodes may not wake up
   spontaneously and that D and n were not known. We establish these
   fundamental lower bounds in this article for the general case, even for
   randomized Monte Carlo algorithms. Our lower bounds are universal in the
   sense that they hold for all universal algorithms (namely, algorithms
   that work for all graphs), apply to every D, m, and n, and hold even if
   D, m, and n are known, all the nodes wake up simultaneously, and the
   algorithms can make any use of node's identities. To show that these
   bounds are tight, we present an O(m) messages algorithm. An O(D) time
   leader election algorithm is known. A slight adaptation of our lower
   bound technique gives rise to an Omega(m) message lower bound for
   randomized broadcast algorithms. An interesting fundamental problem is
   whether both upper bounds (messages and time) can be reached
   simultaneously in the randomized setting for all graphs. The answer is
   known to be negative in the deterministic setting. We answer this
   problem partially by presenting a randomized algorithm that matches both
   complexities in some cases. This already separates (for some cases)
   randomized algorithms from deterministic ones. As first steps towards
   the general case, we present several universal leader election
   algorithms with bounds that tradeoff messages versus time. We view our
   results as a step towards understanding the complexity of universal
   leader election in distributed networks.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental results on the near field development of a free rectangular
   jet with aspect ratio 10 are presented. The jet issues from a
   sharp-edged orifice attached to a rectangular settling chamber at Re-h
   similar to 23,000, based on slot width, h. Measurements on cross plane
   grids were obtained with a two-component hot wire anemometry probe,
   which provided information on the three dimensional characteristics of
   the flow field. Two key features of this type of jet are mean axial
   velocity profiles presenting two off axis peaks, commonly mentioned as
   saddleback profiles, and a predominant dumbbell shape as described by,
   for example, a contour of the axial mean velocity. The saddleback shape
   is found to be significantly influenced by the vorticity distribution in
   the transverse plane of the jet, while the dumbbell is traced to two
   terms in the axial mean vorticity transport equation that diffuse fluid
   from the centre of the jet towards its periphery. At the farthest
   location where measurements were taken, 30 slot widths from the jet
   exit, the flow field resembles that of an axisymmetric jet. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Recent advances in the use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) for
   motion analysis suggest the possibility of using this technology for the
   monitoring of daily activities of individuals during rehabilitation
   post-stroke. Previous studies have utilized features extracted from
   accelerometer and gyroscope signals to develop classification models
   capable of identifying activities performed within large datasets. In
   this study, nine k-nearest neighbor cross-validated classifiers were
   developed using frequency-features derived from shank-mounted IMUs on
   the less-affected and affected limbs of subjects with stroke. These
   classifiers were evaluated for two separate datasets of post-stroke
   gait; the first a classification of three separate gait activities
   (overground walking, stair ascent, and stair descent), and the second a
   classification of five gait activities, overground walking, stair
   ascent, and descent with a distinction between stepping pattern used
   while negotiating stairs (step-over-step (SOS) and step-by-step (SBS)).
   The comparison showed the highest classification accuracy, 100\% for the
   three-activities and 94\% for the five-activities, was obtained using a
   classifier composed of features derived from accelerometer and gyroscope
   measurements from both IMUs on less-affected and affected limbs. (C)

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{A novel technique is described for pressure extraction from Lagrangian
   particle-tracking data. The technique uses a Poisson solver to extract
   the pressure field on a network of data nodes, which is constructed
   using the Voronoi tessellation and the Delaunay triangulation. The
   technique is demonstrated on two cases: synthetic Lagrangian data
   generated for the analytical case of Hill's spherical vortex, and the
   flow in the wake behind a NACA 0012 which was impulsively accelerated to
   Re = 7,500. The experimental data were collected using four-camera,
   three-dimensional particle-tracking velocimetry. For both the analytical
   case and the experimental case, the dependence of pressure-field error
   or sensitivity on the normalized spatial particle density was found to
   follow similar powerlaw relationships. It was shown that in order to
   resolve the salient flow structures from experimental data, the required
   particle density was an order of magnitude greater than for the
   analytical case. Furthermore, additional sub-structures continued to be
   identified in the experimental data as the particle density was
   increased. The increased density requirements of the experimental data
   were assumed to be due to a combination of phase-averaging error and the
   presence of turbulent coherent structures in the flow. Additionally, the
   computational requirements of the technique were assessed. It was found
   that in the current implementation, the computational requirements are
   slightly nonlinear with respect to the number of particles. However, the
   technique will remain feasible even as advancements in particle-tracking
   techniques in the future increase the density of Lagrangian data.}},

Abstract = {{The stall-delaying properties of the humpback whale flipper have been
   observed and quantified in recent years, through both experimental and
   numerical studies. In the present work, numerical simulations of an
   infinite-span wing with an idealized representation of this geometry are
   reported at a Reynolds number of 1.2x105. Using large-eddy simulation,
   an adequate spatial resolution is first established before also
   examining the spanwise extent of the domain. These results are then
   analyzed to provide an explanation of the conditions that drive the lift
   observed beyond the conventional stall angle. The undulating
   leading-edge geometry gives rise to a spanwise pressure gradient that
   drives a secondary flow toward the regions of minimum chord. In turn,
   this leads to the entrainment of higher-momentum fluid into the region
   behind the maximum chord, which energizes the boundary layer and delays
   stall. Aside from demonstrating a significant poststall lift, the
   undulations also have the added benefit of substantially reducing lift
   fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{Vocal fold lamina propria extracellular matrix (ECM) is highly aligned
   and when injured, becomes disorganized with loss of the tissue's
   critical biomechanical properties. This study examines the effects of
   electrospun fiber scaffold architecture and elastin-like polypeptide
   (ELP4) coating on human vocal fold fibroblast (HVFF) behavior for
   applications toward tissue engineering the vocal fold lamina propria.
   Electrospun Tecoflex (TM) scaffolds were made with aligned and unaligned
   fibers, and were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and
   uniaxial tensile testing. ELP4 was successfully adsorbed onto the
   scaffolds; HVFFs were seeded and their viability, proliferation,
   morphology and gene expression were characterized. Aligned and unaligned
   scaffolds had initial elastic moduli of similar to 14 MPa, similar to 5
   MPa and similar to 0.3 MPa, similar to 0.6 MPa in the preferred and
   cross-preferred directions, respectively. Scaffold topography had an
   effect on the orientation of the cells, with HVFFs seeded on aligned
   scaffolds having a significantly different (p <0.001) angle of
   orientation than HVFFs cultured on unaligned scaffolds. This same effect
   and significant difference (p < 0.001) was seen on aligned and unaligned
   scaffolds coated with ELP4. Scaffold alignment and ELP4 coating impacted
   ECM gene expression. ELP4 coating, and aligned scaffolds upregulated
   elastin synthesis when tested on day 7 without a concomitant
   upregulation of collagen III synthesis. Collectively, results indicate
   that aligned electrospun scaffolds and ELP4 coating are promising
   candidates in the development of biodegradeable vocal fold lamina
   propria constructs. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Traditional mapping and monitoring of active slope processes in
   mountainous terrain is challenging, given often difficult site
   accessibility, obstructed visibility, and high complexity of the
   terrain. For example, the rockfall hazard evaluation system employed by
   Canadian railways relies partly on visibility of the rockfall source
   zone from track level, which is often impossible for large or complex
   slopes, in the mountains and elsewhere. Recent advancements in remote
   sensing, data collection, and analysis algorithms have helped resolve
   some of these issues by allowing the slope processes to be mapped, and
   thereby understood, with a greater degree of accuracy and confidence
   than was previously possible. For example, a better understanding of the
   rate of movement of material around a natural rock slope affecting a
   transportation corridor would certainly improve any assessment of the
   hazards caused by those movements. Various remote sensing technologies
   have the capability to be used to assess these processes; however, the
   optimal conditions under which the technology should be deployed are not
   clearly defined. Between December 2012 and December 2013 the efficacy of
   three remote sensing technologies (terrestrial and aerial LiDAR (light
   detection and ranging) and terrestrial photogrammetry) were compared for
   their ability to detect natural and anthropogenic changes at a location
   along the CN railway, in British Columbia, Canada. The results
   demonstrate a high degree of interoperability between the different
   technologies, the ability to map topographical change with all three
   technologies, and the limitations and (or) weaknesses of each technology
   with respect to mapping change. The project location and site
   accessibility represent a real world situation with nonideal facets,
   which challenge the capabilities of these state-of-the-art technologies.
   These results will aid decision-making with respect to implementation of
   remote sensing technologies to monitor changes to rock slopes adjacent
   to transportation corridors, which will lead to better understanding and
   assessment of hazards.}},

Title = {{Measurement of vertical and longitudinal rail displacements using

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{Excessive rail displacements can result in reduced rail traffic speeds
   and increased risk of derailments. A number of methods exist for the
   measurement of vertical rail displacements, including using geophones,
   high-speed cameras, and rail vehicle mounted systems. The advantage of
   rail vehicle mounted methods is that large lengths of track can be
   assessed. However, there are some instances where the measurement of
   absolute rail deformations is essential, particularly in poor subgrade
   conditions where significant long-term settlements are possible.
   Vehicle-mounted monitoring strategies cannot capture the so-called
   ``running rail{''} phenomena, where the passage of a train can push the
   rails longitudinally. Monitoring rail displacements using digital image
   correlation (DIC) has the potential to capture both of these phenomena
   unlike other technologies. The objectives of this paper are to evaluate
   the use of a system of synchronized high-speed cameras to measure
   absolute longitudinal and vertical rail displacements using DIC, to
   observe what factors influence the relative magnitudes of these
   displacements, and to investigate whether DIC measurements can be used
   to evaluate the stiffness and damping parameters required to develop the
   displacement-time response of a rail foundation system. The DIC system
   was evaluated at two sites: one with a high-quality subgrade and one
   with a peat subgrade. The DIC system was able to capture the absolute
   vertical and longitudinal displacements due to the passage of trains at
   both sites. The data from one of the sites, with the high-quality
   subgrade, were used to develop parameters for system stiffness and
   damping.}},

Abstract = {{The ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) technique has been used
   to investigate and to quantify the morphology and size distribution of
   second-phase particles in Zircaloy-4 under various heat-treatment
   conditions. The alloy samples were solutionized in the phase field at
   1293K for 15min and then cooled at different rates, including water
   quenching, air cooling and furnace cooling. The water-quenched samples
   were subsequently subjected to a thermal aging treatment at 873K for
   different aging times (30, 60, 120 and 300min). The USAXS results show
   that water quenching and air cooling from the phase field produces a
   narrow size distribution of fine-size precipitates with an average
   diameter of 300-800 angstrom, while furnace cooling resulted in
   coarsening of the particles, with a broad size distribution having an
   average precipitate size of 600-1200 angstrom. Further, the
   furnace-cooled sample shows a higher volume fraction of particles than
   the water-quenched or air-cooled sample. The USAXS results on the
   quenched then aged samples show that aging at 873K for 10min resulted in
   very fine size precipitates with an average diameter of 200-350
   angstrom. A rapid precipitation with the highest number density of
   second-phase particles amongst all the heat-treated samples (4.3 x
   10(20)m(-3)) was observed in the sample aged for 10min at 873K.
   Particles of larger size and with a broad size distribution were
   observed in the sample aged at 873K for 300min. A bimodal type of
   particle size distribution was observed in all the heat-treated samples.
   Important parameters in the characterization of second-phase particles,
   such as the average size, size distribution, volume fraction and number
   density, were evaluated and quantified. These parameters are discussed
   for both heat-treated and aged specimens. Transmission and scanning
   transmission electron microscopy characterization were carried out on
   all heat-treated samples, to assist in interpretation and to
   substantiate the results from the USAXS measurements.}},

Title = {{Consideration of coastal risk in the Irish spatial planning process}},
Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{161-169}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The vulnerability of coastal areas to associated hazards is increasing
   due to population growth, development pressure and climate change. It is
   incumbent on coastal governance regimes to address the vulnerability of
   coastal inhabitants to these hazards. This is especially so at the local
   level where development planning and control has a direct impact on the
   vulnerability of coastal communities. To reduce the vulnerability of
   coastal populations, risk mitigation and adaptation strategies need to
   be built into local spatial planning processes. Local government,
   however, operates within a complex hierarchal governance framework which
   may promote or limit particular actions. It is important, therefore, to
   understand how local coastal planning practices are shaped by national
   and supranational entities. Local governments also have to respond to
   the demands of local populations. Consequently, it is important to
   understand local populations' perceptions of coastal risk and its
   management. Adopting an in-depth study of coastal planning in County
   Mayo, Ireland, this paper evaluates: (a) how European and national
   policies and legislation shape coastal risk management at local level;
   (b) the incorporation of risk management strategies into local plans;
   and (c) local perception of coastal risks and risk management. Despite a
   strong steer from supranational and national legislation and policy,
   statutory local plans are found to be lacking in appropriate risk
   mitigation or adaptation strategies. Local residents appear to be lulled
   into a sense of complacency towards these risks because of the low level
   of attention afforded to them by the local planning authorities. To
   avoid potentially disastrous consequences for local residents and
   businesses, it is imperative that this situation is redressed urgently.
   Based on our analysis, we recommend: the development and implementation
   of a national ICZM strategy, supported by detailed local ICZM plans; and
   obliging local government to address known risks in their plans rather
   than defer them to project level decision making. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   Behavior}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The technique of externally bonding fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP)
   composites has become very popular worldwide for retrofitting existing
   reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Debonding of FRP from the concrete
   substrate is a typical failure mode in such strengthened structures. The
   bond behavior between FRP and concrete thus plays a crucial role in
   these structures. The FRP-to-concrete bond behavior has been extensively
   investigated experimentally, commonly using a single or double shear
   test of the FRP-to-concrete bonded joint. Comparatively, much less
   research has been concerned with numerical simulation, chiefly due to
   difficulties in the accurate modeling of the complex behavior of
   concrete. This paper presents a simple but robust finite-element (FE)
   model for simulating the bond behavior in the entire debonding process
   for the single shear test. A concrete damage plasticity model is
   proposed to capture the concrete-to-FRP bond behavior. Numerical results
   are in close agreement with test data, validating the model. In addition
   to accuracy, the model has two further advantages: it only requires the
   basic material parameters (i.e., no arbitrary user-defined parameter
   such as the shear retention factor is required) and it can be directly
   implemented in the FE software ABAQUS. (C) 2014 American Society of

Abstract = {{Coextruded geomembranes with an inner ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH)
   layer are gaining attention as potential improved barriers to volatile
   organic compounds (VOCs) when used in barrier systems that would
   traditionally use high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembranes. The
   permeation characteristics of nine common VOCs in aqueous solutions
   through the EVOH layer are investigated for two thin films: a
   0.015-mm-thick, 32 mol\% EVOH and a 0.02-mm-thick, 44 mol\% EVOH. The
   VOCs included aromatic hydrocarbons {[}benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
   and xylenes (BTEX)] and chlorinated hydrocarbons {[}1,2-dichloroethane
   (1,2-DCA), dichloromethane (DCM), trichloroethylene (TCE), and
   tetrachloroethylene (PCE)]. The BTEX permeation coefficients, P-g, range
   from 1.4 x 10(-14) to 25 x 10(-14) m(2).s(-1) depending on the
   contaminant and mol\% EVOH. When a 0.02-mm-thick, 38 mol\% EVOH thin
   film layer is coextruded with linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) to
   form a 0.53-mm-thick geomembrane, the BTEX permeation values of the EVOH
   thin film itself are reduced to P-g = 0.4 x 10(-14) to 0.7 x 10(-14)
   m(2).s(-1). The higher permeation coefficients for the thin films as
   compared with the film contained in the coextruded LLDPE/EVOH/LLDPE
   geomembrane are attributed to interactions between the water in the
   aqueous solution and the EVOH layer, an interaction that is prevented by
   the presence of the LLDPE in the coextruded geomembrane. These P-g
   values are two to four orders of magnitude lower than values that have
   been observed for LLDPE and HDPE geomembranes. The effect of temperature
   on VOC permeation was also studied for the 32 mol\% EVOH thin films at
   23, 30, 40, and 50 +/- 1 degrees C. An Arrhenius relationship was
   developed that allows the evaluation of the permeation characteristics
   at temperatures 23-50 degrees C and, by extrapolation, an estimation of
   the values for temperatures a little higher or lower than the test
   temperatures. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{In collaboration with Airbus-UK, the dimensional growth of aircraft
   panels while being riveted with stiffeners is investigated. Small panels
   are used in this investigation. The stiffeners have been fastened to the
   panels with rivets and it has been observed that during this operation
   the panels expand in the longitudinal and transverse directions. It has
   been observed that the growth is variable and the challenge is to
   control the riveting process to minimize this variability. In this
   investigation, the assembly of the small panels and longitudinal
   stiffeners has been simulated using static stress and nonlinear explicit
   finite element models. The models have been validated against a limited
   set of experimental measurements; it was found that more accurate
   predictions of the riveting process are achieved using explicit finite
   element models. Yet, the static stress finite element model is more time
   efficient, and more practical to simulate hundreds of rivets and the
   stochastic nature of the process. Furthermore, through a series of
   numerical simulations and probabilistic analyses, the manufacturing
   process control parameters that influence panel growth have been
   identified. Alternative fastening approaches were examined and it was
   found that dimensional growth can be controlled by changing the design
   of the dies used for forming the rivets.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the cyclic fatigue behavior of sandwich panels
   composed of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) skins connected by
   longitudinal Z-shape ribs and low-density polyurethane foam core.
   Eighteen 1,143 x 635 x 78-mm panels with ribs of two different flange
   widths, including three control static tests, were tested in fatigue
   under fully reversed loading (R = -1) and fully unloaded (R = 0)
   conditions, to maximum loads (P-max) of 20-70\% of their ultimate static
   strength (P-ult). Fatigue life curves were established and compared with
   those of panels without any ribs. It was shown that internal ribs
   increased static strength and stiffness by 80 and 66\%, respectively,
   but were only beneficial within the low cycle fatigue range. Under P-max
   of 50\% P-ult, number of cycles to failure (N-f) at R = -1 was only 6\%
   of N-f at R = 0 in the ribbed panels. Fatigue failure consistently
   initiated by flange debonding of the rib from skin. In panels loaded to
   higher than P-ult of their nonribbed counterparts, final shear failure
   of foam core occurred simultaneously with rib debonding, whereas in
   panels loaded below this level, additional fatigue life was attained
   after rib debonding, until core shear failure, but at significantly
   lower stiffness. To achieve an N-f of 2M cycles, P-max should not exceed
   35 and 21\% of P-ult at R = 0 and -1, respectively. A three-dimensional
   (3D) failure surface (Haigh diagram) was established for the ribbed
   panels. It predicts fatigue life for a given mean and amplitude loads.

Abstract = {{An environment friendly arsenic removal technique from contaminated soil
   with high iron content has been studied. A natural surfactant extracted
   from soapnut fruit, phosphate solution and their mixture was used
   separately as extractants. The mixture was most effective in desorbing
   arsenic, attaining above 70 \% efficiency in the pH range of 4-5.
   Desorption kinetics followed Elovich model. Micellar solubilization by
   soapnut and arsenic exchange mechanism by phosphate are the probable
   mechanisms behind arsenic desorption. Sequential extraction reveals that
   the mixed soapnut-phosphate system is effective in desorbing arsenic
   associated with amphoteric-Fe-oxide forms. No chemical change to the
   wash solutions was observed by Fourier transform-infrared spectra. Soil:
   solution ratio, surfactant and phosphate concentrations were found to
   affect the arsenic desorption process. Addition of phosphate boosted the
   performance of soapnut solution considerably. Response surface
   methodology approach predicted up to 80 \% desorption of arsenic from
   soil when treated with a mixture of approximate to 1.5 \% soapnut,
   approximate to 100 mM phosphate at a soil: solution ratio of 1: 30.}},

Abstract = {{Currently there is no reliable objective method to quantify the setting
   properties of acrylic bone cements within an operating theatre
   environment. Ultrasonic technology can be used to determine the acoustic
   properties of the polymerising bone cement, which are linked to material
   properties and provide indications of the physical and chemical changes
   occurring within the cement. The focus of this study was the critical
   evaluation of pulse-echo ultrasonic test method in determining the
   setting and mechanical properties of three different acrylic bone cement
   when prepared under atmospheric and vacuum mixing conditions. Results
   indicated that the ultrasonic pulse-echo technique provided a highly
   reproducible and accurate method of monitoring the polymerisation
   reaction and indicating the principal setting parameters when compared
   to ISO 5833 standard, irrespective of the acrylic bone cement or mixing
   method used. However, applying the same test method to predict the final
   mechanical properties of acrylic bone cement did not prove a wholly
   accurate approach. Inhomogeneities within the cement microstructure and
   specimen geometry were found to have a significant influence on
   mechanical property predictions. Consideration of all the results
   suggests that the non-invasive and non-destructive pulse-echo ultrasonic
   test method is an effective and reliable method for following the full
   polymerisation reaction of acrylic bone cement in real-time and then
   determining the setting properties within a surgical theatre
   environment. However the application of similar technology for
   predicting the final mechanical properties of acrylic bone cement on a
   consistent basis may prove difficult. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Green roofs which use sewage sludge to sequestrate urban carbon dioxide
   may represent a potential opportunity to evaluate carbon sequestration
   benefits for the urban development under increasing global climate
   change. In this study, green roofs composed of 6 small green segments
   with two different substrates, mixed-sewage-sludge substrate (MSSS,
   volume ratio of sewage sludge and local-natural soil 1:1), and
   local-natural soil (LNS), three different substrate depths (20 cm, 25 cm
   and 30 cm), and three types of native plants (Ligustrum vicaryi, Neottia
   auriculata, and Liriape spicata) in Chengdu City were established to
   determine carbon sequestration from July 2012 to July 2013 through
   assessment of the carbon storage and sequestration. Results show that
   the average carbon storage of MSSS and LNS on green roofs was
   respectively 13.15 kg C m(-2) and 8.58 kg C m(-2), and the average
   carbon sequestration followed the order of LNS (3.89 kg C m(-2) yr(-1))
   > MSSS (3.81 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). Thus MSSS could be considered as a
   potential material for carbon sequestration. The carbon storage and
   carbon sequestration by native plants on the green roofs followed the
   order of L. vicaryi > L. spicata > N. auriculata. The whole green roof
   had a mean carbon storage of 18.28 kg C m(-2) and average carbon

   multiple cycles of heating and cooling over the extended temperature

   hysteresis effects were evident over the entire temperature range

   simplified approach is presented to evaluate the volumetric ratio of
   frozen pore water in terms of conductivity measurements. The results

Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Renewable energy is high on international and national agendas.
   Currently, grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems are a popular
   technology to convert solar energy into electricity. Existing PV panels
   have a relatively low and varying output voltage so that the converter
   installed between the PVs and the grid should be equipped with high
   step-up and versatile control capabilities. In addition, the output
   current of PV systems is rich in harmonics which affect the power
   quality of the grid. In this paper, a new multi-stage hysteresis control
   of a step-up DC-DC converter is proposed for integrating PVs into a
   single-phase power grid. The proposed circuitry and control method is
   experimentally validated by testing on a 600 W prototype converter. The
   developed technology has significant economic implications and could be
   applied to many distributed generation (DG) systems, especially for the
   developing countries which have a large number of small PVs connected to
   their single-phase distribution network. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This work comprises the photoactivity assessment of transparent sol-gel
   TiO2 coatings of various thickness using two test systems. The initial
   rates of both photocatalytic reactions, namely the oxidative bleaching
   of Acid Orange 7 (A07) and the reductive bleaching of
   2,6-dichlorindophenol (DCIP) increase linearly with increasing titania
   film thickness as well as with increasing absorbed light flux. The
   latter work revealed quantum yields (QY) of 0.19\% and 92\% for the A07
   and DCIP test system, respectively. The low QY for the A07 oxidation is
   due to the combination of a slow irreversible reduction of oxygen and
   also for the oxidation of A07, thus favouring the high efficiency for
   electron-hole recombination that is typical for aqueous organic
   pollutants. In contrast, the very high QY for the photocatalysed
   reduction of DCIP is due to the presence of a vast excess of glycerol
   which traps the photogenerated holes efficiently and so allow time for
   the slower reduction of dye to take place. Furthermore, the oxidation of
   glycerol results in the generation of highly reducing R-hydroxyalkyl
   radicals that are able to also reduce DCIP. As a consequence of this
   `current doubling' effect, the observed QY (92\%) is much higher than
   the apparent theoretical value of 50\%. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Chili powder is a globally traded commodity which has been found to be
   adulterated with Sudan dyes from 2003 onwards. In this study, chili
   powders were adulterated with varying quantities of Sudan I dye
   (0.1-5\%) and spectra were generated using near infrared reflectance
   spectroscopy (NIRS) and Raman spectroscopy (on a spectrometer with a
   sample compartment modified as part of the study). Chemometrics were
   applied to the spectral data to produce quantitative and qualitative
   calibration models and prediction statistics. For the quantitative
   models coefficients of determination (R-2) were found to be 0.891-0.994
   depending on which spectral data (NIRS/Raman) was processed, the
   mathematical algorithm used and the data pre-processing applied. The
   corresponding values for the root mean square error of calibration
   (RMSEC) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) were found to
   be 0.208-0.851\% and 0.141-0.831\% respectively, once again depending on
   the spectral data and the chemometric treatment applied to the data.
   Indications are that the NIR spectroscopy based models are superior to
   the models produced from Raman spectral data based on a comparison of
   the values of the chemometric parameters. The limit of detection (LOD)
   based on analysis of 20 blank chili powders against each calibration
   model gave 0.25\% and 0.88\% for the NIR and Raman data, respectively.
   In addition, adopting a qualitative approach with the spectral data and
   applying PCA or PLS-DA, it was possible to discriminate between
   adulterated chili powders from non-adulterated chili powders. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper presents a very fast dc-bus voltage controller for a
   single-phase grid-connected voltage-source inverter (VSI) with an LCL
   output filter used in renewable energy applications. In single-phase
   grid-connected inverters, the design of the dc-bus voltage control
   scheme is very challenging due to the presence of a second harmonic
   ripple across the dc-bus voltage. The proposed dc-bus voltage control
   scheme is able to address the difficulties introduced by the
   second-harmonic ripple. The dc-bus voltage controller is based on an
   adaptive droop control technique, which is able to provide a very fast
   transient response for the closed-loop system and ensures the optimal
   operation of the VSI during steady-state conditions. Also, the simple
   structure of the controller makes it very practical for grid-connected
   VSIs used in renewable energy power conditioning systems. Theoretical
   analysis and experimental results demonstrate the superior performance
   of the proposed control approach compared to conventional dc-bus voltage
   control schemes.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Light emitting diode (LED) lamps with ac-input (50 or 60 Hz) usually
   require an electrolytic capacitor as the dc-link capacitor in the driver
   circuit to: 1) balance the energy between the input and output power,
   and 2) to minimize the low-frequency component of the output ripple
   across the LEDs. The lifetime of this capacitor, however, is much
   shorter than that of a LED. To maximize the potential lifetime of the
   LED lighting system, a new pulsating current driving LED driver that
   does not require any electrolytic capacitors or complicated control
   circuits to minimize the low-frequency (i.e., 100 or 120 Hz) output
   ripple is proposed in this paper. The proposed circuit is simple and a
   single-switch topology is designed to simplify the controller design.
   The proposed circuit is able to reduce the energy storage capacitance to
   a few microfarads range, so that film capacitor can be used to replace
   the unreliable electrolytic capacitor. The circuit operating principles
   and its theoretical analysis are provided in this paper. Simulation and
   experimental results are given on a 9-W LED lamp to highlight the merits
   of the proposed circuit.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a Bang-Bang Charge Control (BBCC) method for LLC
   resonant converters. Instead of switching frequency control, the BBCC
   method utilizes the series resonant capacitor voltage level to trigger
   the MOSFETs' switching actions. Advantages of the proposed method
   include fast dynamic performance and simple implementations.
   Small-signal analysis shows that the loop bandwidth can achieve around
   1/6 of the switching frequency in all operating conditions. Experimental
   results show that 5 to 25 A load step transients are completed within
   only seven switching cycles at both 400- and 300-V input-voltage
   conditions. Practical considerations are also discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Loss-of-mains protection is an important component of the protection
   systems of embedded generation. The role of loss-of-mains is to
   disconnect the embedded generator from the utility grid in the event
   that connection to utility dispatched generation is lost. This is
   necessary for a number of reasons, including the safety of personnel
   during fault restoration and the protection of plant against
   out-of-synchronism reclosure to the mains supply. The incumbent methods
   of loss-of-mains protection were designed when the installed capacity of
   embedded generation was low, and known problems with nuisance tripping
   of the devices were considered acceptable because of the insignificant
   consequence to system operation. With the dramatic increase in the
   installed capacity of embedded generation over the last decade, the
   limitations of current islanding detection methods are no longer
   acceptable. This study describes a new method of loss-of-mains
   protection based on phasor measurement unit (PMU) technology,
   specifically using a low cost PMU device of the authors' design which
   has been developed for distribution network applications. The proposed
   method addresses the limitations of the incumbent methods, providing a
   solution that is free of nuisance tripping and has a zero non-detection
   zone. This system has been tested experimentally and is shown to be
   practical, feasible and effective. Threshold settings for the new method
   are recommended based on data acquired from both the Great Britain and
   Ireland power systems.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this work are to quantify the degree of multiwalled
   carbon nanotube (MWCNT) length reduction upon melt compounding and to
   demonstrate unambiguously that the length reduction is mainly
   responsible for the increase in electrical percolation threshold of the
   resulting composites. Polyolefin matrices of varying viscosities and
   different functional groups are melt compounded with MWCNTs. A simple
   method is developed to solubilize the polymer matrix and isolate the
   MWCNTs, enabling detailed imaging analysis. In spite of the perceived
   strength of the MWCNTs, the results demonstrate that the shear forces
   developed during melt mixing are sufficient to cause significant
   nanotube breakage and length reduction. Breakage is promoted when higher
   MWCNT contents are used, due to increased probability of particle
   collisions. Furthermore, the higher shear forces transmitted to the
   nanotubes in the presence of higher matrix viscosities and functional
   groups that promote interfacial interactions, shift the nanotube
   distribution toward smaller sizes. The length reduction of the MWCNTs
   causes significant increases in the percolation threshold, due to the
   loss of interconnectivity, which results in fewer conductive pathways.
   These findings are validated by comparing the experimental percolation
   threshold values with those predicted by the improved interparticle
   distance theoretical model.}},

Abstract = {{The unique behaviors of Nafion nanothin films with thicknesses of 10 nm
   (ultrathin) and 160 nm (thin) were evaluated using variable-temperature
   and variable-humidity solid-state H-1 NMR spectroscopy. These
   unprecedented measurements of nanothin films stacked within an NMR rotor
   represent a remarkable experimental achievement and demonstrate that H-1
   NMR spectroscopy of such minute amounts of ionomer might be possible
   within active catalyst layers in polymer electrolyte fuel-cell
   electrodes. This study was motivated by the observation, in a separate
   work, of thickness-dependent and highly suppressed conductivity in
   nanothin films of Nafion (4-300 nm) compared to counterpart
   free-standing Nafion membranes. Trends in the line width and, more
   precisely, the T2 relaxation, as probed using a Hahn echo, showed that
   the local mobility within the hydrogen-bonded domain is equivalent for
   10 and 160 nm films and is governed by the fast exchange limit in terms
   of NMR time scales. Subtle differences in the chemical shift trends
   provide insight into the domain structures, where the 10 nm films show
   no changes whereas the thicker 160 nm films exhibit chemical shift
   trends that indicate a rearranging hydrogen-bonded network. Thus, it is
   inferred that domain structure formation is influenced by film thickness
   and that the interaction with the substrate becomes limiting as the film
   becomes thinner.}},

   a numerical integration technique. Moreover, experimental data at
   atmospheric pressure were then used to determine the SAFT-VR Mie
   molecular parameters for these liquids. The accuracy of the model has

Abstract = {{The existence of loose particles left inside the sealed electronic
   devices is one of the main factors affecting the reliability of the
   whole system. It is important to identify the particle material for
   analyzing their source. The conventional material identification
   algorithms mainly rely on time, frequency and wavelet domain features.
   However, these features are usually overlapped and redundant, resulting
   in unsatisfactory material identification accuracy. The main objective
   of this paper is to improve the accuracy of material identification.
   First, the principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to reselect
   the nine features extracted from time and frequency domains, leading to
   six less correlated principal components. And then the reselected
   principal components are used for material identification using a
   support vector machine (SVM). Finally, the experimental results show
   that this new method can effectively distinguish the type of materials
   including wire, aluminum and tin particles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Nonlinear terahertz field-induced carrier dynamics in photoexcited
   epitaxial monolayer graphene}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{We report nonlinear terahertz (THz) field transmission through
   photoexcited monolayer epitaxial graphene via differential transmission
   measurements enabled by optical-pump/intense-terahertz-probe (OPITP)
   spectroscopy. After photoexcitation of graphene, a transmission
   enhancement, defined by a positive differential transmission of the
   intense terahertz probe pulse, is observed. This is due to suppression
   of the graphene photoconductivity arising from an increased carrier
   scattering rate due to the increase in the carrier density and the extra
   energy from the photoexcited hot carriers. Thus, the transient
   enhancement in transmission increases as the optical pump fluence
   increased. Most interestingly, we observe that the transmission
   enhancement after photoexcitation decreases as the THz field strength is
   increased, which we attribute to the combined effects of the intense THz
   electric field and the optical pump fluence on the carrier scattering
   rate. We model the carrier dynamics in the graphene using the length
   gauge interaction Hamiltonian with the inclusion of short-range
   scattering by neutral impurities and the interaction of the carriers
   with optical phonons. Comparing the experimental and simulated
   transmission results, we extract the nonequilibrium effective lattice
   temperature of graphene as a function of the optical pump fluence and
   THz field strength.}},

Abstract = {{Nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) of 2-(diethylamino)ethyl
   methacrylate (DEAEMA) with a small amount of acrylonitrile (AN) as a
   comonomer was performed for the first time in water at 90 degrees C and
   atmospheric pressure using n-hydroxysuccinimidyl BlocBuilder (NHS-BB)
   alkoxyamine without addition of excess nitroxide. The same reaction was
   carried out using the bicomponent initiating system composed of
   2,2'-azobis{[}2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane]dihydrochloride (VA-044) as
   initiator and N-tert-butyl-N-(1-diethylphosphono-2,2-dimethylpropyl)
   nitroxide (SG1) as nitroxide. Both polymerization reactions were
   well-controlled and exhibited excellent livingness as evidenced by low
   molar dispersity and evolution of the molar mass distribution. The
   hydrolytic stability of DEAEMA at the polymerization conditions and the
   effects of several parameters including initiating system, temperature,
   ratio of nitroxide to initiator, initiator and monomer concentrations,
   and comonomer type were investigated. Chain extension of the synthesized
   macroinitiator with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene (S) in a
   one-pot process led to the in situ formation of

Title = {{A novel software program for detection of potential air emboli during
   cardiac surgery}},
Journal = {{CARDIOVASCULAR ULTRASOUND}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JAN 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Risks associated with air emboli introduced during cardiac
   surgery have been highlighted by reports of postoperative
   neuropsychological dysfunction, myocardial dysfunction, and mortality.
   Presently, there are no standard effective methods for quantifying
   potential emboli in the bloodstream during cardiac surgery. Our
   objective was to develop software that can automatically detect and
   quantify air bubbles within the ascending aorta and/or cardiac chambers
   during cardiac surgery in real time.
   Findings: We created a software algorithm ({''}Detection of Emboli using
   Transesophageal Echocardiography for Counting, Total volume, and Size
   estimation{''}, or DETECTS (TM)) to identify and measure potential
   emboli present during cardiac surgery using two-dimensional ultrasound.
   An in vitro experiment was used to validate the accuracy of DETECTS (TM)
   at identifying and measuring air emboli. An experimental rig was built
   to correlate the ultrasound images to high definition camera images of
   air bubbles created in water by an automatic bubbler system. There was a
   correlation between true bubble size and the size reported by DETECTS
   (TM) in our in vitro experiment (r = 0.76). We also tested DETECTS (TM)
   using TEE images obtained during cardiac surgery, and provide
   visualization of the software interface.
   Conclusions: While monitoring the heart during cardiac surgery using
   existing ultrasound technology and DETECTS (TM), the operative team can
   obtain real-time data on the number and volume of potential air emboli.
   This system will potentially allow de-airing techniques to be evaluated
   and improved upon. This could lead to reduced air in the cardiac
   chambers after cardiopulmonary bypass, possibly reducing the risk of
   neurological dysfunction following cardiac surgery.}},

Journal = {{IET MICROWAVES ANTENNAS \& PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-48}},
Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a far-field power pattern separation approach is proposed
   for the synthesis of directional modulation (DM) transmitter arrays.
   Separation into information patterns and interference patterns is
   enabled by far-field pattern null steering. Compared with other DM
   synthesis methods, for example, bit error rate-driven DM optimisation
   and orthogonal vector injection, the approach developed in this study
   facilitates manipulation of artificial interference spatial
   distributions. With such capability more interference power can be
   projected into those spatial directions most vulnerable to
   eavesdropping, that is, the information side lobes. In such a fashion,
   information leaked through radiation side lobes can be effectively
   mitigated in a transmitter power efficient manner. Furthermore, for the
   first time, the authors demonstrate how multi-beam DM transmitters can
   be synthesised via this approach.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{391}},
Pages = {{83-89}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{Nitrogen isotopic compositions and concentrations in micas from
   kimberlite-hosted MARID (mica-amphibole-rutile-ilmenite-diopside) suite
   of xenoliths from the Kimberley area of the Kaapvaal Craton, South
   Africa, were measured using continuous-flow isotope-ratio mass
   spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy data suggest that the nitrogen in MARID
   phlogopite is from ammonium in the mica structure. The replacement of
   potassium by ammonium is the major mechanism for the storage of nitrogen
   within these phlogopites. The delta N-15 values of micas from MARID
   xenoliths range from -11 to +9 parts per thousand, and nitrogen contents
   range between 113 and 272 ppm. The N-15 enrichment of most samples
   relative to the average upper mantle delta N-15 value of -5 parts per
   thousand suggests that the nitrogen reflects a recycled reservoir from
   subducted material within their source region. The presence of nitrogen
   from a recycled reservoir indicates that sedimentary organic nitrogen in
   the sub-continental lithosphere is not effectively cycled to the surface
   resulting in a geochemically heterogeneous upper mantle. (C) 2014

Title = {{Ultra-high Q even eigenmode resonance in terahertz metamaterials}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 5}},
Abstract = {{We report the simultaneous excitation of the odd and the even eigenmode
   resonances in a periodic array of square split-ring resonators, with
   four resonators per unit cell. When the electric field is parallel to
   their gaps, only the two well-studied odd eigenmodes are excited. As the
   resonators are rotated relative to one another, we observe the emergence
   and excitation of an extremely sharp even eigenmode. In uncoupled
   split-ring resonators, this even eigenmode is typically radiative in
   nature with a broad resonance linewidth and low Q-factor. However, in
   our coupled system, for specific range of rotation angles, our
   simulations revealed a remarkably high quality factor (Q similar to 100)
   for this eigenmode, which has sub-radiant characteristics. This type of
   quad-supercell metamaterial offers the advantage of enabling access to
   all the three distinct resonance features of the split-ring resonator,
   which consists of two odd eigenmodes in addition to the high-Q even

Abstract = {{Active flow control to improve performances and efficiencies of
   technical fluid systems is of significant importance in many engineering
   applications. In this work, we investigate two optimisation strategies
   that are commonly used for systems which can be described by partial
   differential equations, namely the adjoint-based and the
   sensitivity-based approach. The approaches are reviewed and their merits
   and disadvantages are discussed. We employ both strategies to minimise
   the separation of a laminar flow over a backward-facing step and
   critically compare the outcome. It turns out that both strategies are
   able to considerably reduce the reattachment length compared to the
   uncontrolled case. Nevertheless, the sensitivity-based approach allows
   for a simpler implementation and a less complex solution process and
   therefore appears attractive for engineering applications. The
   sensitivity-based approach is implemented for the active flow control in
   an electrokinetic micromixer and various numerical experiments are
   performed. It is shown that the sensitivity-based optimisation leads to
   very high mixing degrees in short operation times. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers the solution of a multi-objective optimisation
   problem using adaptive extremum-seeking control for a class of uncertain
   nonlinear systems. It is assumed that the equations describing the
   dynamics of the nonlinear system and the cost functions to be optimised
   are unknown and that the objective functions are measured. The proposed
   extremum-seeking control technique uses a time-varying estimation of the
   unknown gradients that minimises the impact of the choice of dither
   signal on the performance of the extremum-seeking control system. The
   technique guarantees convergence of the system to any point of the set
   of Pareto optimal solutions. It is adapted to allow the computation of
   specific desirable Pareto solutions using a utopic formulation.
   Simulation examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed technique.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{12-26}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the potential of gabions as roadside safety
   barriers. Gabions have the capacity to blend into natural landscape,
   suggesting that they could be used as a safety barrier for low-volume
   road in scenic environments. In fact, gabions have already been used for
   this purpose in Nepal, but the impact response was not evaluated. This
   paper reports on numerical and experimental investigations performed on
   a new gabion barrier prototype. To assess the potential use as a
   roadside barrier, the optimal gabion unit size and mass were
   investigated using multibody analysis and four sets of 1:4 scaled crash
   tests were carried out to study the local vehicle-barrier interaction.
   The barrier prototype was then finalised and subjected to a TB31 crash
   test according to the European EN1317 standard for N1 safety barriers.
   The test resulted in a failure due to the rollover of the vehicle and
   tearing of the gabion mesh yielding a large working width. It was found
   that although the system potentially has the necessary mass to contain a
   vehicle, the barrier front face does not have the necessary stiffness
   and strength to contain the gabion stone filling and hence redirect the
   vehicle. In the EN1317 test, the gabion barrier acted as a ramp for the
   impacting vehicle, causing rollover.}},

Abstract = {{The capability to numerically model the crushing behaviour of composite
   structures will enable the efficient design of structures with high
   specific energy absorption capacity. This is particularly relevant to
   the aerospace and automotive industries where cabin structures need to
   be shown to be crashworthy. In this paper, a three-dimensional damage
   model is presented, which accurately represents the behaviour of
   composite laminates under crush loading. Both intralaminar and
   interlaminar failure mechanisms are taken into account. The crush damage
   model was implemented in ABAQUS/Explicit as a VUMAT subroutine.
   Numerical predictions are shown to agree well with experimental results,
   accurately capturing the intralaminar and interlaminar damage for a
   range of stacking sequences, triggers and composite materials. The use
   of measured material parameters required by the numerical models,
   without the need to `calibrate' this input data, demonstrates this
   computational tool's predictive capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the fact that the UK has the highest potential in the European
   Union to generate renewable energy from wind, it lags behind its
   European partners. The departure point for this study is provided by the
   fact that the land use planning system has been perceived by some to
   create difficulties in the pursuit of the achievement of National Action
   Plan targets. In the course of a review of literature, legislation,
   policy and case files, a number of issues emerge relating not only to
   operational practice but also structural concerns regarding knowledge,
   legitimacy and ethics. These are scrutinized in an empirical
   investigation which provides insights into the ontologies behind how
   knowledge is used and abused. Concerns are highlighted regarding the
   tactical manipulation of knowledge and the difficulties associated with
   objectifying evidence so that it can be understood, validated and
   authenticated. The paper concludes by reflecting on the implications for
   the regulatory framework, the legitimization of decisions and the ethics
   of the profession and how these, in turn, are conditioned by the
   production, use and transparency of planning knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a multiple target localization problem is considered with
   only a partially known signal propagation model. Specifically, we assume
   that localization is to be effected by measuring the received signal
   strength (RSS) at each sensor. That RSS is modeled by a standard signal
   propagation model, though with unknown parameters. We adopt a Bayesian
   approach to propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) type of algorithm
   for simultaneously estimating these unknown parameters and the source
   locations. Our approach also yields a posterior density function of
   these quantities conditioned on the RSS measurements. Such a density is
   useful for a visual inspection of the terrain to ascertain the source
   locations. The convergence of the algorithm is established under mild
   assumptions. Simulation results that support the analysis are provided.}},

   equilibrium of a measured objective function. The main contribution of
   the proposed technique is the addition of a proportional action that can
   be used to minimize the impact of a time-scale separation on the
   transient performance of the extremum-seeking control system. The
   integral action fulfills the role of standard ESC techniques to identify
   optimal equilibrium conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed

Abstract = {{The goal to achieve accurate and ubiquitous localization is the driving
   force for location based services in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs).
   In urban areas, global positioning system (GPS) and in-vehicle
   navigation sensors (e.g. odometers) suffer from prolonged outages and
   unsustainable error accumulation, respectively. The need for precise
   vehicle localization remains paramount, and cooperative vehicle
   localization based on ranging techniques are being exploited to this
   end. This paper presents a novel cooperative localization scheme that
   utilizes round trip time (RTT) for inter-vehicle distance calculation,
   integrated with inertial sensor measurements to update the position of
   not only the vehicle to be localized, but its neighbors as well. We
   adopted the extended Kalman filter (EKF), to limit the effect of errors
   in both the sensors and the neighbors' positions, in computing the new
   location. In comparison to the existing cooperative localization
   techniques, our proposed cooperative scheme does not depend on GPS
   updates for the neighbors' positions thus making it far more suitable in
   urban canyons and tunnels. In addition, our scheme considers updating
   the neighbors' positions using their current inertial sensor
   measurements resulting in; better position estimation. The scheme is
   implemented and tested using the network simulator 3 (ns-3), vehicle
   traces are generated using SUMO and error models are introduced to the
   sensors and initial positions for different velocities and densities.
   Results show that our scheme outperforms the inertial navigation systems
   (INS) technology typically used in environments where GPS fails.}},

Abstract = {{The development of 5G enabling technologies brings new challenges to the
   design of power amplifiers (PAs). In particular, there is a strong
   demand for low-cost, nonlinear PAs which, however, introduce nonlinear
   distortions. On the other hand, contemporary expensive PAs show great
   power efficiency in their nonlinear region. Inspired by this trade-off
   between nonlinearity distortions and efficiency, finding an optimal
   operating point is highly desirable. Hence, it is first necessary to
   fully understand how and how much the performance of multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) systems deteriorates with PA nonlinearities. In
   this paper, we first reduce the ergodic achievable rate (EAR)
   optimization from a power allocation to a power control problem with
   only one optimization variable, i.e. total input power. Then, we develop
   a closed-form expression for the EAR, where this variable is fixed.
   Since this expression is complicated for further analysis, two simple
   lower bounds and one upper bound are proposed. These bounds enable us to
   find the best input power and approach the channel capacity. Finally,
   our simulation results evaluate the EAR of MIMO channels in the presence
   of nonlinearities. An important observation is that the MIMO performance
   can be significantly degraded if we utilize the whole power budget.}},

Abstract = {{Realistic modeling of energy consumption is crucial for accurate
   performance analysis of wireless-powered sensor nodes. In this paper, we
   analyze the performance of wirelesspowered sensor transmissions taking
   into account both the energy cost of sensing and transmission. We
   consider a sensor that is harvesting energy from an ambient
   radio-frequency (RF) signal and using this energy to perform sensing and
   transmission. Since energy harvesting is time-varying in nature, it
   introduces a delay in the sensor transmissions. We study two
   delay-related metrics, one measuring how frequent the sensed information
   is updated at the sink and the other measuring the time taken from the
   sensing operation to successful transmission of sensed information. We
   analytically characterize the statistical behavior of both metrics and
   find an important tradeoff between them. In particular, our results
   illustrate that more frequent update of sensed information at the sink
   increases the time taken from the sensing operation to successful
   transmission of sensed information.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new detector for multiantenna spectrum
   sensing in cognitive radios (CR) by exploiting the Separating Function
   Estimation Test (SFET) framework. Specifically, we consider a blind
   scenario for multiantenna spectrum sensing in which both the channel
   gains and noise variance are assumed to be unknown. For such a scenario,
   we find an appropriate Separating Function (SF) whose Maximum Likelihood
   Estimate (MLE) leads us to a SFET-based detector which uses the second
   order moments of the eigenvalues of the Sample Covariance Matrix (SCM).
   We also find closed-form expressions for the detection and false-alarm
   probabilities of the proposed detector. The performance of the proposed
   detector asymptotically tends to that of the Uniformly Most Powerful
   Unbiased (UMPU) detector as the number of independent and identically

Abstract = {{Spectrum sensing constitutes a key functionality of a cognitive radio
   (CR), and sensing devices are required to detect a change in spectrum
   occupancy as quickly as possible. A new decentralized change detection
   framework is developed for cognitive wireless networks, where local
   sensors are memoryless, receive independent observations, and no
   feedback from the fusion center. In addition to traditional criteria of
   detection delay and false alarm rate, we introduce a new constraint: the
   number of communications between local sensors and the fusion center.
   This communication metric is able to reflect both the cost of
   establishing communication links as well as overall energy consumption
   over time. The proposed detection scheme minimizes detection delay with
   constraints on both false alarm rate and number of communications.
   Simulation results are investigated to explore the tradeoffs in
   parameter choices of the proposed algorithm.}},

   evaluate the sum-rate of the system. More importantly, we characterize
   the impact of channel aging on the power scaling law. Specifically, we
   show that the transmit power of each user can be scaled down by 1/root
   M, which indicates that aged CSI does not affect the power scaling law;
   instead, it causes only a reduction on the sum rate by reducing the
   effective signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR).}},

Abstract = {{A biomechanical energy harvesting backpack that generates electricity
   during human walking is presented. By recognizing the out-of-phase
   motion between two limbs, this energy harvesting technology differs from
   previous designs in a way that it integrates the motion from both of the
   user's lower limbs into a single mechanical drive train and generator. A
   prototype was developed and experimental results demonstrated that the
   device was able to generate a large amount of electricity (9W) with a
   efficiency of 72\%, which is higher than the existing walking based
   energy harvesters. To quantify the performance of the harvester we
   introduced a new performance measure, total cost of harvesting (TCOH),
   which evaluates a harvesters overall efficiency in generating
   electricity including the device carrying cost. The new harvester
   captured the motion from both lower limbs and operated in the generative
   braking mode to assist the knee flexor muscles in slowing the lower
   limbs. From testing on 10 participants, under different walking
   conditions, the harvester achieved an average TCOH of 6.1, which is
   comparable to the estimated TCOH for a conventional power generation
   method of 6.2. When generating 5.2W of electricity, the TCOH of the
   lower limb-driven energy harvester (4.0) is lower than that of
   conventional power generation methods. These results demonstrated that
   the lower limb-driven energy harvester is an energetically effective
   option for generating electricity during daily activities.}},

Abstract = {{A low noise variable gain amplifier (LNVGA) is fully designed for
   operation over a wideband. Since a low noise figure (NF) and a high 1 dB
   compression point (P1dB), i.e. large dynamic range, is difficult to
   achieve in CMOS technology, gain controllability is exploited to
   increase the overall system dynamic range. The LNVGA is composed by a
   low noise amplifier (LNA) stage and a voltage variable attenuator (VVA)
   stage. The former aims to keep the NF low, and the latter aims to
   provide a very large gain variation. Also, an output buffer is used to
   allow for measurement with 50 Omega probes. In addition, a novel Active
   Balun topology is proposed which achieves competitive results for
   magnitude imbalance and phase imbalance. The LNVGA simulation results
   show a gain control range of 47.7 dB, its voltage gain varies from -26.7
   dB to 21 dB, the minimum NF is 3.43 dB, the IIP3 is -4.6 dBm, and a band

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles (EVs) provide a feasible solution to reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions and thus become a heated topic for research and
   development. Switched reluctance motors are one of promised motors for
   EV applications. In order to extend the EVs' driving miles, the use of
   photovoltaic (PV) panels on the vehicle helps decrease the reliance on
   vehicle batteries. Based on phase winding characteristics of SRMs, a
   tri-port converter is proposed in this paper to control the energy flow
   between the PV panel, battery and SRM. Six operating modes are
   presented, four of which are developed for driving and two for
   standstill on-board charging. In the driving modes, the energy
   decoupling control for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the PV
   panel and speed control of the SRM are realized. In the standstill
   charging modes, a grid-connected charging topology is developed without
   a need for external hardware. When the PV panel directly charges the
   battery, a multi-section charging control strategy is used to optimize
   energy utilization. Simulation results based on Matlab/Simulink and
   experiments on a 3kW SRM prove the effectiveness of the proposed triport
   converter, which has potential economic implications to improve the
   market acceptance of EVs.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging mobility-aware content delivery approaches are being proposed
   to cope with the increasing usage of data from vehicular users. The main
   idea is to forecast the user locations and associated link capacity, and
   then proactively counter service fluctuations in advance. For instance,
   a user that is heading towards low coverage can be prioritized and have
   video content prebuffered. While the reported gains are encouraging, the
   results are primarily based on assumptions of perfect prediction.
   Investigating the predictability of mobility and future signal
   variations is therefore imperative to evaluate the practical viability
   of such predictive content delivery paradigms. To this end, this paper
   presents a large-scale measurement study of 33 repeated trips along a
   23.4 km bus route covering urban and sub-urban areas in Kingston,
   Canada. We provide a thorough analysis of the collected traces to
   investigate the effects of geographical area, time, forecasting window,
   and contextual factors such as signal lights and bus stops. The
   collected dataset can also be used in several other ways to further
   investigate and drive research in predictive vehicular content delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Radiation therapy (RT) is a common treatment option for a wide variety
   of cancer types. Despite significant improvements in this technique over
   the past years, software tools for research in RT are limited to either
   expensive, closed, proprietary applications or heterogeneous sets of
   open-source software packages with limited scope, reliability, and user
   support. Our SlicerRT toolkit aspires to overcome these limitations by
   providing an extensive set of RT research tools leveraging the advanced
   visualization and image analysis features of its base platform 3D
   Slicer.
   The SlicerRT toolkit comprises of a set of 3D Slicer extensions:
   SlicerRT core, Matlab Bridge, Multi-dimensional Data, and Gel Dosimetry.
   The SlicerRT core extension contains 26 modules, many of which provide
   common RT tools used in most RT research scenarios. Matlab Bridge
   provides a convenient way for connecting the researchers' existing
   MATLAB algorithms to the SlicerRT ecosystem. Multi-dimensional Data
   offers a feature set for handling multi-dimensional datasets, such as
   longitudinal studies or 4D data. Finally, Gel Dosimetry facilitates gel
   dosimetry analysis workflows through a streamlined, workflow-based
   end-user application. It serves as an example and proof of concept for
   such applications implementing advanced clinical or research workflows.
   Using these open-source software tools makes it possible to conduct
   cutting edge RT research without parallel development efforts. It acts
   as a medium into which researchers can integrate their methods into, and
   which they can use to perform comparative validation, develop novel RT
   techniques, or transition advanced methods into routine clinical
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Robust estimation of net limb forces has a plethora of important
   applications. However, the most reliable methods are invasive and are
   not feasible in most cases. The use of surface electromyography (EMG)
   for estimating muscle forces is non-invasive, and generally unobtrusive.
   However, many physiological and non-physiological factors limit the
   precision of these methods. The rich spatiotemporal information
   collected from high-density surface EMG (HD-EMG) grids has been used to
   mitigate the problem; however, the instability of electrode-skin contact
   for these systems creates outlying channels, which may lead to
   substantial error. We build non-linear predictors on rotated ensembles,
   which when aggregated provide robust and highly accurate (RMSE<2.6\%)
   estimation of the force induced at the wrist under isometric
   contractions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the impact of transceiver impairments on outage
   probability (OP) and throughput of decode and-forward two-way cognitive
   relay (TWCR) networks, where the relay is self-powered by harvesting
   energy from the transmitted signals. We consider two bidirectional
   relaying protocols namely, multiple access broadcast (MABC) protocol and
   time division broadcast (TDBC) protocol, as well as, two power transfer
   policies namely, dual-source (DS) energy transfer and single
   fixed-source (SFS) energy transfer. Closed-form expressions for OP and
   throughput of the network are derived in the context of delay-limited
   transmission. Numerical results corroborate our analysis, thereby we can
   quantify the degradation of OP and throughput of TWCR networks due to
   transceiver hardware impairments. Under the specific parameters, our
   results indicate that the MARC protocol achieves asymptotically a higher
   throughput by 0.65 {[}bits/s/Hz] than the TDBC protocol, while the DS
   energy transfer scheme offers better performance than the SFS policy for
   both relaying protocols.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a unique environment whose features are able to
   satisfy requirements for both virtual maintenance and virtual
   manufacturing through the conception of original virtual reality (VR)
   architecture. Virtual Reality for the Maintainability and Assemblability
   Tests (VR\_MATE) encompasses VR hardware and software and a simulation
   manager which allows customisation of the architecture itself as well as
   interfacing with a wide range of devices employed in the simulations.
   Two case studies are presented to illustrate VR\_MATE's unique ability
   to allow for both maintainability tests and assembly analysis of an
   aircraft carriage and a railway coach cooling system respectively. The
   key impact of this research is the demonstration of the potentialities
   of using VR techniques in industry and its multiple applications despite
   the subjective character within the simulation. VR\_MATE has been
   presented as a framework to support the strategic and operative
   objectives of companies to reduce product development time and costs
   whilst maintaining product quality for applications which would be too
   expensive to simulate and evaluate in the real world. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Virtual topology operations have been utilized to generate an analysis
   topology definition suitable for downstream mesh generation. Detailed
   descriptions are provided for virtual topology merge and split
   operations for all topological entities, where virtual decompositions
   are robustly linked to the underlying geometry. Current virtual topology
   technology is extended to allow the virtual partitioning of volume
   cells. A valid description of the topology, including relative
   orientations, is maintained which enables downstream interrogations to
   be performed on the analysis topology description, such as determining
   if a specific meshing strategy can be applied to the virtual volume
   cells. As the virtual representation is a true non-manifold description
   of the sub-divided domain the interfaces between cells are recorded
   automatically. Therefore, the advantages of non-manifold modelling are
   exploited within the manifold modelling environment of a major
   commercial CAD system without any adaptation of the underlying CAD
   model. A hierarchical virtual structure is maintained where virtual
   entities are merged or partitioned. This has a major benefit over
   existing solutions as the virtual dependencies here are stored in an
   open and accessible manner, providing the analyst with the freedom to
   create, modify and edit the analysis topology in any preferred sequence.

Abstract = {{Hyper-Dense Heterogeneous (HDH) deployments, which are made of different
   kinds of Base Stations (BSs), constitute a promising solution to meet
   the high data rates envisioned for 5G cellular systems. However, the
   presence of such a large number of BSs, each of which is expected to
   deliver a large amount of data to the end-users, is pushing the
   bottleneck of cellular networks from the Radio Access Network (RAN) to
   the backhaul, which is becoming as critical as the radio infrastructure.
   Hence, new network topologies and network architectures are under
   debate, whose objective is to overcome the backhaul cost and capacity
   crunch. In order to adequately design these emerging network topologies,
   appropriate abstraction models need to be introduced for system-level
   analysis. In this context, stochastic geometry has recently emerged as a
   promising tool for system-level performance evaluation of cellular
   systems. In this paper, we adopt a Poisson Tree model for analyzing a
   hierarchical backhaul and the RAN of a HDH network, where the nodes of
   the tree are traffic concentrators, BSs and users. The proposed model
   captures the impact of the finite user density (load) on the network
   performance and the distribution of the
   Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR), which is determined by
   the positions of users and BSs, as well as by the channel conditions and
   the other-cell interference.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the poor performance of the existing transmit beamforming
   methods in low signal to noise ratio regime, and assuming that the
   knowledge of the modulation type could result in a more intelligent
   design of beamformers, this paper proposes a transmit beamforming method
   based on the concept of minimum probability of error (MPE) beamforming.
   We calculate the error probability of each user in the downlink of a
   multiuser scenario and design an objective function based on the
   weighted sum of these error probabilities. We take a convex optimization
   approach to solve this ill-behaved nonconvex optimization problem. It is
   shown that by minimizing this objective function, the performance of the
   system could be dramatically improved.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing penetration of large-scale wind generation in power
   systems will challenge the power system inertia due to the reason that
   the converter based variable speed wind turbines have no contribution to
   the system inertia. Traditionally, a doubly fed induction generator
   (DFIG)-based wind power plant naturally does not provide frequency
   response because of the decoupling between the output power and the
   frequency. Moreover, DFIGs also lack power reserve margin because of the
   maximum power point tracking (MPPT) operation. In this paper, a virtual
   inertial control strategy of the DFIG based wind turbines called
   supplementary control loop for inertial response is investigated. When
   the system frequency is changing severely, the output power of DFIG
   should respond to it rapidly through the virtual inertial controller at
   the same time. The rotor speeds of wind turbines can also be adjusted
   into this procedure. The inertial control methods proposed in this paper
   can supply controllable virtual inertia of DFIGs to the power system so
   that the system frequency stability can be strengthened through inertial
   control of wind turbines on the basis of damping torque analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This summary article proposes a new and compact cavity-backed antenna
   structure offering circular polarization where a dielectric resonator
   (DR) element is surrounded by a meandered circular slot ring etched in
   the antenna ground plane (90 mm by 90 mm) to improve gain and radiation
   performance values. In particular, antenna gain values are greater than
   3 dBic from 1.10 GHz to 1.72 GHz defining a bandwidth of more than 35\%.
   The DR for the antenna is cylindrical in shape with epsilon(tau) = 30
   and excites four radiating HE11 delta modes which are driven by four,
   quadrature fed aperture coupled slots. Such a compact implementation
   hybridizes operation of the DR with its meandered circular slot ring as
   well as the four aperture coupled slots. Measurements and simulations
   are in agreement and the proposed design technique to employ such a
   secondary meandered slot ring may also be useful to improve antenna gain
   and efficiency for other compact antenna implementations.}},

   paper proposes an average current modulation method that is capable of

   low frequency current ripple. This allows the energy storage capacitance
   to be reduced, avoiding the need for electrolytic capacitors and
   prolongs the life of the driver. The average current modulator requires
   a single low voltage MOSFET, a current sense resistor and a simple

   impact on efficiency to a minimum. An 8.75 W experimental prototype has
   been built to verify the proposed design.}},

Abstract = {{High reliability and ever increasing cost-effectiveness of power
   electronics components and digital processors have resulted in high
   interests in inductive power transfer techniques. The interest is
   directed mostly at electric and hybrid passenger car battery charging,
   although the first solutions have already been conceptualized and turned
   into homologated products for much higher power levels for bus and light
   rail vehicles. Transformers used for automotive applications have a
   large air gap and relatively low coupling coefficients. High levels of
   output power require tuning techniques in order to eliminate or decrease
   the associated reactive power. In this paper a parallel load side
   compensation technique and its consequences are described. The analysis
   is done by utilizing a novel method based on Boucherot Bridge model for
   the wireless power transformer. The analytical results are confirmed by
   circuit simulation using the transformer parameters derived from finite

Abstract = {{Dense deployment of wireless local area networks (WLANs) is part of the
   next generation Wi-Fi and standardization (802.11ax) efforts are
   underway. However, dense deployment of WLAN access points (APs) faces
   increased interference and uncoordinated association of user stations
   (STAs) with APs, which degrade network throughput. To assess the
   potential of improving uplink throughput in the presence of interference
   using AP association coordination, we propose an association
   optimization algorithm that matches STAs to APs in dense WLAN (DWLAN).
   While existing cell breathing approaches suggest tuning of APs' beacon
   powers for association control, the proposed approach utilizes uplink
   signal-interference-noise ratio (SINR) of stations (STAs) to coordinate
   STA-AP association. In order to further coordinate interference and
   increase spatial reuse, an algorithm is proposed to adjust the clear
   channel assessment (CCA) threshold of the 802.11 MAC protocol in each AP
   cell to address the problem of overlapped basic service set (OBSS) that
   degrades overall network throughput. Performance evaluation reveals that
   our SINR-based AP association coordination and CCA threshold adjustment
   schemes achieve significant increase in per-user throughput in a DWLAN.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, design, simulation and optimization study of a 1x2
   circular microstrip patch antenna (MPA) array for next generation
   802.11ac wireless LAN (WLAN) is presented. The IEEE 802.11ac is a set of
   MAC layer enhancements for higher throughput in the 5GHz band. This
   emerging standard provides wider channels, higher throughput and
   efficient use of spectrum. The proposed antenna array is designed and
   simulated using Agilent ADS momentum. The antenna array is designed
   using the FR4 substrate (epsilon(r) = 4.6 and h = 1.6mm). The dimensions
   of the proposed design is calculated using the transmission-line model.
   An inset-feed with quarter-wave transformer is used to feed the antenna
   elements. The proposed design improves the shortcomings of a classical
   rectangular MPA. Hence, the maximum achieved bandwidth and gain of the
   1x2 circular patch antenna array are 292MHz and 5.17dBi respectively.
   The proposed array may be used as a template to form larger arrays which

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a sparse multi-carrier index keying (MCIK)
   method for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system,
   which uses the indices of sparse sub-carriers to transmit the data, and
   improve the performance of signal detection in highly correlated
   sub-carriers. Although a receiver is able to exploit a power gain with
   precoding in OFDM, the sensitivity of the signal detection is usually
   high as the orthogonality is not retained in highly dispersive
   environments. To overcome this, we focus on developing the trade-off
   between the sparsity of the MCIK, correlation, and performances,
   analyzing the average probability of the error propagation imposed by
   incorrect index detection over highly correlated sub-carriers. In
   asymptotic cases, we are able to see how sparsity of MCIK should be
   designed in order to perform superior to the classical OFDM system.
   Based on this feature, sparse MCIK based OFDM is a better choice for low
   detection errors in highly correlated sub-carriers.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the downlink of a realistic cellular network composed of
   multiple clusters, each of which includes multiple relays and a
   destination terminal. In this scenario, the interference among the
   clusters is a critical issue, affecting the end-to-end performance of
   the system significantly. Considering the inter-cluster interference, we
   propose optimal and suboptimal relay selection schemes to maximize the
   sum rate of the network. The first algorithm is a truly optimal
   network-wise relay selection scheme which provides the ultimate
   performance upper bound. However, the computational complexity and the
   signaling overhead involved with the optimal scheme are fairly high.
   Addressing the issues, we propose a suboptimal cluster-wise scheme with
   a much less computational complexity and signaling overhead. Numerical
   results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms provide excellent
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{The promising energy saving and QoS gains of Predictive Resource
   Allocation (PRA) techniques have recently been recognized in the
   wireless network research community. These gains were primarily
   introduced in light of perfect prediction of both mobility traces and
   anticipated channel rates. However, under real world considerations of
   prediction errors, the reported gains cannot be guaranteed and further
   investigation is needed. In this paper, we demonstrate the practical
   potential of PRA by developing a robust, probabilistic framework that
   guarantees QoS satisfaction for video streaming under imperfect
   predictions, without compromising the energy saving gains. The proposed
   PRA framework uses chance-constrained programming to model video
   streaming QoS for all users during the foreseen time horizon. Closed
   form solutions are developed using the Gaussian and Bernstein
   approximations based on the channel statistical measures. Extensive
   numerical simulations using a standard compliant Long Term Evolution
   (LTE) system are presented to examine the developed solutions, for
   different user mobility scenarios and target QoS levels. The results
   demonstrate the various design trade-offs involved toward the practical
   deployment of predictive video streaming in future generation networks.}},

Abstract = {{Fault detection and classification in an automated assembly machine
   using machine vision (MV) based inspection methods is the subject of
   this paper. A high speed automated assembly machine is used as the test
   apparatus. The machine is designed to assemble circular O-rings, from a
   bulk supply, onto continuously moving carriers at a rate of over 100
   assemblies per minute. Video data was collected for both normal and
   abnormal machine conditions, and in particular transfer track jams.
   Three MV classification methods were adapted to this application and
   subsequently tested: 1) Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with blob
   analysis, 2) optical flow and 3) running average. The methods are
   compared with a previously developed fault detection method based on
   spatiotemporal volumes (STVs). It is observed that the new methods
   require less training and processing time and are able to detect faults
   faster than the STV method. Amongst the three new methods, the running
   average method is shown experimentally to be the best in terms of having
   the lowest processing time per frame and the fastest response time. The
   work continues in order to see how the methods perform as different
   machine faults are introduced.}},

Abstract = {{Cast iron water mains comprise approximately 28\%, by length, of all
   water mains in Canada and the United States. Many of these cast-iron
   water mains are reaching the end of their expected service lives and
   their rate of failure is increasing. Of particular concern are
   large-diameter water mains, for which the consequences of failure can be
   severe. The aim of this paper is to use a physical, stochastic model
   previously developed by the authors to identify the most important
   factors that influence the probability of failure of large-diameter
   water mains in the City of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada distribution
   system. Failure is assumed to occur due to tensile hoop stress and a
   reduction in strength due to pitting corrosion. The stochastic analysis
   is implemented using Monte Carlo simulations.
   A case study of the City of Hamilton water distribution system is
   presented, in which the model is applied to 20 large-diameter, cast iron
   water mains. The results suggest that the diameter and burial depth have
   a moderate to strong influence on the probability of failure. With some
   exceptions, small-diameter pipes with shallow burial depths were
   associated with high probabilities of failure and large-diameter pipes
   deep burial depths were associated with low probabilities of failure.
   Soil corrosivity and pipe age were found to have a weak effect on
   probability of failure. There were insufficient samples of pit-cast
   pipes in the study to draw conclusions on the effect of the casting
   technique. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Abstract = {{The present paper introduces new pipe-level energy metrics to evaluate
   the energy transformations in the individual pipes of water distribution
   systems. To evaluate these metrics, energy supplied to each pipe is
   categorized into delivered and required energy, leakage, friction and
   surplus energy and then compared to each other. The results of the
   pipe-level energy assessment of the two systems imply that the energy

Abstract = {{Over the past 14 years, researchers have been developing energy
   indicators to better quantify where energy is being wasted in relation
   to the operation of a water distribution system. These energy indicators
   have helped municipalities identify ways to make their systems more
   energy efficient. This paper builds upon research completed by Cabrera
   et al. {[}4] where five (5) energy indicators were developed. The
   indicators strive to describe the efficiency of a distribution network
   by focusing on what is causing the energy consumption within a system
   (i.e. friction, leakage etc.). In this paper these indicators are
   applied to three (3) distribution networks. The energy use indicators
   are used to compare energy efficiency, energy lost to friction and
   leakage, and useful energy between each of the modelled distribution
   networks. This paper also discusses the key characteristics of the
   networks that account for the energy use patterns observed with the
   energy indicators. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of modern high-speed motorways has increased over the
   last decade all over the world. However, the financial crisis led many
   financial institutions worldwide to impose stricter credit limitations
   and seek to finance only high-profit investments. As a result, the
   financing of transport projects was made even more difficult. At the
   same time, accurate cost estimates at the preliminary stages of a
   project are essential to all the major project stakeholders, since they
   are necessary for the budget determination, allocation and monitoring,
   the comparison of alternative projects and technical solutions and
   finally, the selection of the projects to be implemented. However, the
   degree of accuracy required is very difficult to be achieved at the
   preliminary stages due to the limited extent of available information.
   This paper presents a preliminary predesign cost estimate model for
   culverts i.e. conduits for the passage of surface drainage water under
   the motorway. Although individual culverts present low construction cost
   when compared to bridges, tunnels or large retaining walls, their total
   number along a motorway is significant and thus, their total
   construction cost is also substantial. The proposed model utilizes a
   properly developed database derived from actual construction projects to
   produce accurate quantity estimates by means of the statistical
   technique of linear regression. Following the estimation of quantities,
   proper material unit prices are applied for quick and reliable cost
   estimates to be provided. The proposed model only requires limited input
   and thus, can be used in the early project stages, offering valuable
   contribution towards the accurate culverts' cost prediction in motorway
   projects. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Video Capture of university lectures enables learners to be more
   flexible in their learning behaviour, for instance choosing to attend
   lectures in person or watch later. However attendance at lectures has
   been linked to academic success and is of concern for faculty staff
   contemplating the introduction of Video Lecture Capture. This research
   study was devised to assess the impact on learning of recording lectures
   in computer programming courses. The study also considered behavioural
   trends and attitudes of the students watching recorded lectures, such as
   when, where, frequency, duration and viewing devices used. The findings
   suggest there is no detrimental effect on attendance at lectures with
   video materials being used to support continual and reinforced learning
   with most access occurring at assessment periods. The analysis of the
   viewing behaviours provides a rich and accessible data source that could
   be potentially leveraged to improve lecture quality and enhance lecturer
   and learning performance.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of fast changing temperature fluctuations is a
   challenging problem in many scientific and engineering disciplines. The
   limited bandwidth of temperature sensors such as thermocouples and
   resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) means that measurement errors
   can be significant during temperature transients. Compensation of the
   sensor output is therefore necessary in order to provide reliable
   temperature measurements but requires that a fully parametrised model of
   the sensor is available. However, parameter estimation is intractable
   when using only output measurements from a single sensor. Difference
   equation characterisation provides a solution to this problem by using
   measurements from two sensors, each represented as first-order models
   and subject to the same thermal field. Recently the authors have
   demonstrated that it is possible to extend this method to second-order,
   resulting in a linear system identification problem for estimation of a
   set of intermediate parameters which are nonlinearly related to the
   sensor parameters and which can be solved analytically. The contribution
   of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of extending the method
   to higher-order sensor models. It is concluded that while blind
   characterisation is theoretically possible for higher-order models, it
   is not practical to implement the approach due to the increasingly
   complex multimodal cost function that makes identification and isolation
   of the correct optimum very challenging. Results and conclusions are
   verified using Monte-Carlo simulations.}},

   sensing is one of the important aspect for opportunistic spectrum access

   sensing can improve the sensing performance in which multiple cognitive
   radio users cooperate to sense primary user bands. However, cooperative
   spectrum sensing is vulnerable to incumbent emulation and spectrum

   reduce strain on storage node input-output (I/O) resources during node
   repair operations after a failure. In this paper, we consider the use of
   Fountain codes for distributed storage systems and aim to understand the
   relationship between repair locality and code parameters for a
   systematic Fountain code. While the information-theoretic trade-off
   between repair locality and storage overhead has been understood and
   characterized, the challenge of choosing a locality value that satisfies
   multiple storage system design metrics is yet to be resolved. We
   approach this problem by deriving an expression for the probability
   distribution of repair locality in terms of the rateless code degree
   distribution coefficients and suggest that factoring this relationship
   into the code design process enables the design of rateless codes better
   adjusted to the needs of a massive distributed storage system.}},

   output power from 1 GHz to 6 GHz. The PA exhibits a flat power gain of
   13.5 +/- 1.2 dB over its operating frequency range. It features a high
   linearity with an output 1dB compression point (OP1dB) and third order
   intercept point (OIP3) of more than +16 dBm and +25 dBm respectively.
   The measured OIP3 remains above +25 dBm, i.e. 9 dB higher than OP1dB,
   for a wide range of power levels up to 4 dB backoff from OP1dB. The chip
   was fabricated using a 0.13 mu m CMOS process, occupying an active area
   of only 200 mu m x 110 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the detection of a narrowband signal in Gaussian
   noise with unknown parameters. Assuming unknown direction-of-arrival
   (DoA), amplitude, frequency, phase and noise variance, two Separating
   Function Estimation Tests (SFETs) and a Generalized Likelihood Ratio
   Test (GLRT) are proposed to detect the signal. These SFETs are estimates
   of a proposed Separating Function (SF). This proposed SF provides
   asymptotically optimal detectors using Maximum Likelihood Estimation
   (MLE) and is derived by the decomposition of Fisher information function
   of the induced maximal invariant. We propose two estimators MLE and
   Outlier Processed MLE (OP-MLE) for estimation of the SF. It is shown
   that, the MLE of frequency and DoA are obtained by an exhaustive search
   to maximize the absolute of the two-dimensional discrete Fourier
   transform (DFT) of the received signals. We propose OP-MLE as an MLE
   based estimator by first eliminating the outliers from the DFT of the
   received signal using a pre-estimation of DoA and frequency. The
   simulation results show that the omission of outliers results in
   considerable improvement. Similarly, the resulting SFET using OP-MLE
   provides a higher probability of detection comparing with SFET using MLE
   and GLRT.}},

Abstract = {{Recommender systems have played a prominent role in online platforms
   over the last decade. These systems have been incorporated into
   applications ranging from e-commerce to leisure, successfully enhancing
   user experience. Moreover, recommender systems are now being applied to
   a wider diversity of emerging context applications on the Internet
   including social media and online platforms for communities. In this
   study, we present a novel collaborative filtering recommender system
   model. This model differentiates from other recommender system models in
   that it utilizes two aggregation operators, namely OWA and uninorm, to
   compute similarity degrees between users. We demonstrate the application
   of the proposed model by integrating it in the HARMONISE platform for
   communities in the Urban Resilience domain. The application example
   illustrates how the proposed model of collaborative filtering
   recommender system can predict content of interest to users in the
   platform, based not only on user preferences but also on features of
   their user profile.}},

Abstract = {{Post-crisis response and recovery necessitates the identification and
   prioritization of the needs and capacities of the affected community in
   order to provide efficient and well-coordinated humanitarian assistance.
   The Community Based Comprehensive Recovery platform aims to facilitate
   enhanced communication flows between professional communities, affected
   communities, and volunteer responders to enhance situational awareness,
   inform and guide response planning, and ensure more effective
   coordination of activities by volunteer responders. Underpinning the
   platform, an information framework has been designed to support
   acquisition and analysis of the needs and capacities that arise across
   affected communities. In addition, a multi-criteria decision making
   algorithm has been designed and developed in order to enhance sense
   making and situational awareness within the platform. Subsequently, this
   paper introduces the core concepts that provide a basis for the
   information model, along with the associated ontology. Furthermore, the

Abstract = {{A new method is presented for robustly and efficiently registering two
   noisy point clouds. The registration is driven by establishing
   correspondences of virtual interest points, which do not exist in the
   original point cloud data, and are defined by the intersection of
   parametric surfaces extracted from the data. Parametric surfaces, such
   as planes, exist in abundance in both natural and artificial scenes, and
   can lead to regions in the data of relatively low noise. This in turn
   leads to repeatable virtual interest points, with stable locations
   across overlapping images. Experiments were run using virtual interest
   points defined by the intersection of three implicit planes, applied to
   data sets of four environments comprising 100 point clouds. The proposed
   method outperformed the Iterative Closest Point, Generalized Iterative
   Closest Point, and a 2.5D SIFT-based RANSAC method in registering
   overlapping images with a higher success rate, and more efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing installed capacities of wind power in an effort to achieve
   sustainable power systems for future generations pose problems for
   system operators. Volatility in generation volumes due to the adoption
   of stochastic wind power is increasing. Storage has been shown to act as
   a buffer for these stochastic energy sources, facilitating the
   integration of renewable energy into a historically inflexible power
   system. This paper examines peak and off peak benefits realised by
   installing a short term discharge storage unit in a system with a high
   penetration of wind power in 2020. A fully representative unit
   commitment and economic dispatch model is used to analyse two scenarios,
   one `with storage' and one `without storage'. Key findings of this
   preliminary study show that wind curtailment can be reduced in the
   storage scenario, with a larger reduction in peak time ramping of gas

Abstract = {{We consider the downlink of a wireless cellular network which consists
   of one Macro Base Station (MBS), multiple relays and User Equipments

   address the problem of inter-cluster interference. In each cluster, we
   adopt a time-division relaying scheme to avoid intra-cluster
   interference, but the inter-cluster interference still remains. In
   interference-aware network, an optimal clustering algorithm requires an
   exhaustive search, which is infeasible. Hence, we propose a clustering
   algorithm which improves the system capacity by exploiting the
   inter-cluster information. But this algorithm is implemented in a
   centralized manner with high complexity that requires the calculation of
   inter-cluster information. To circumvent this, we propose a cluster-wise
   distributed algorithm with manageable complexity, which shows the
   performance within acceptable range from the optimal one, far better
   than simple and intuitive algorithms because of the effect of
   inter-cluster interference.}},

Abstract = {{Code clones are unavoidable entities in software ecosystems. A variety
   of clone-detection algorithms are available for finding code clones. For
   Type-3 clone detection at method granularity (i. e., similar methods
   with changes in statements), dissimilarity threshold is one of the
   possible configuration parameters. Existing approaches use a single
   threshold to detect Type-3 clones across a repository. However, our
   study shows that to detect Type-3 clones at method granularity on a
   large-scale heterogeneous repository, multiple thresholds are often
   required. We find that the performance of clone detection improves if
   selecting different thresholds for various groups of clones in a
   heterogeneous repository (i.e., various applications). In this paper, we
   propose a threshold-free approach to detect Type-3 clones at method
   granularity across a large number of applications. Our approach uses an
   unsupervised learning algorithm, i.e., k -means, to determine true and
   false clones. We use a clone benchmark with 330,840 tagged clones from
   24,824 open source Java projects for our study. We observe that our
   approach improves the performance significantly by 12\% in terms of
   Fmeasure. Furthermore, our threshold-free approach eliminates the
   concern of practitioners about possible misconfiguration of Type-3 clone
   detection tools.}},

Abstract = {{Spectral-efficiency and energy-efficiency are the key concerns for
   next-generation wireless networks. RF energy-harvesting is emerged as a
   prominent technology which self-empowers wireless nodes to achieve
   energy-efficiency. For spectral-efficiency, the opportunistic
   spectrum-access technology (by employing cognitive radios) is an optimal
   solution. Therefore, in this paper, we merge both technologies
   (cognitive radio \& RF energy harvesting) together to achieve
   network-wide spectral and energy efficiency. A novel two-level
   residual-energy and channel-quality (capacity and idle-time) aware
   node-classification scheme is introduced for cluster-based cognitive
   radio sensor networks to select the best sensor nodes for reporting
   process. At first level, the nodes are classified as harvesting or
   transmitting nodes based on their residual energy. Later on, the best
   node-channel pairs are formed for transmitting nodes using Hungarian
   algorithm. In the second level of classification, only those nodes are
   selected for reporting, which can transmit reporting packet in the given
   duration on the allocated channel. Otherwise, the node is directed to
   perform energy harvesting task to achieve energy-balancing and avoid
   unsuccessful reporting. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
   scheme shows better performance gain in terms of successful reporting
   rate compared to existing node-classification schemes. Furthermore, we
   compare the proposed node-channel pairing scheme with greedy-pairing and
   random-pairing schemes and illustrate the performance gain in terms of
   successful reporting.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet-of-Things (IoT) envisions a world where billions of
   everyday objects and mobile devices communicate using a large number of
   interconnected wired and wireless networks. Maximizing the utilization
   of this paradigm requires fine-grained QoS support for differentiated
   application requirements, context-aware semantic information retrieval,
   and quick and easy deployment of resources, among many other objectives.
   These objectives can only be achieved if components of the IoT can be
   dynamically managed end-to-end across heterogeneous objects,
   transmission technologies, and networking architectures.
   Software-defined Networking (SDN) is a new paradigm that provides
   powerful tools for addressing some of these challenges. Using a
   software-based control plane, SDNs introduce significant flexibility for
   resource management and adaptation of network functions. In this
   article, we study some promising solutions for the IoT based on SDN
   architectures. Particularly, we analyze the application of SDN in
   managing resources of different types of networks such as Wireless
   Sensor Networks (WSN) and mobile networks, the utilization of SDN for
   information-centric networking, and how SDN can leverage
   Sensing-as-a-Service (SaaS) as a key cloud application in the IoT.}},

Abstract = {{Smart vehicles have been capturing increasing attention as major
   providers of ubiquitous information services. In this paper, we propose
   a solution to enable expedited and costeffective access of road
   information for vehicles as information requesters. The proposed
   caching-assisted data delivery with mobile requesters (CADD-MR) scheme
   employs caching on the data delivery path for handling later interests
   in similar data. CADD-MR depends on the use of light-weight road caching
   spots (RCSs) deployed at intersections for caching and heading-aware
   forwarding, and on vehicles as data carriers. To support vehicles as
   mobile information requesters, CADD-MR makes use of the RCSs for keeping
   track of the mobility registry of the requesting vehicles to ensure that
   data replies reach their corresponding mobile destinations, as long as
   they are still not expired. Performance evaluation of CADD-MR
   demonstrates significant improvements in the access cost, delay, and
   delivery ratio compared to a scheme that does not use RCSs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a current and turbulence measurement campaign
   conducted at a test site in an energetic tidal channel known as
   Strangford Narrows, Northern Ireland. The data was collected as part of
   the MaRINET project funded by the EU under their FP7 framework. It was a
   collaborative effort between Queen's University Belfast, SCHOTTEL and
   Fraunhofer IWES. The site is highly turbulent with a strong shear flow.
   Longer term measurements of the flow regime were made using a bottom
   mounted Acoustic Doppler Profiler (ADP). During a specific turbulence
   measurement campaign, two collocated instruments were used to measure
   incoming flow characteristics: an ADP (Aquadopp, Nortek) and a
   turbulence profiler (MicroRider, Rockland Scientific International). The
   instruments recorded the same incoming flow, so that direct comparisons
   between the data can be made. In this study the methodology adopted to
   deploy the instruments is presented. The resulting turbulence
   measurements using the different types of instrumentation are compared
   and the usefulness of each instrument for the relevant range of
   applications is discussed. The paper shows the ranges of the frequency
   spectra obtained using the different instruments, with the combined
   measurements providing insight into the structure of the turbulence
   across a wide range of scales.}},

Abstract = {{The 4-Points Congruent Sets ( 4PCS) Algorithm is an established approach
   to registering two overlapping 3D point sets with partial overlap and
   arbitrary initial poses. 4PCS performs the registration efficiently
   using a special set of 4 points, also known as a base, formed by two
   co-planar pairs of points within a RANSAC framework. The SUPER 4PCS
   algorithm uses intelligent indexing to reduce the complexity of the
   original 4PCS algorithm. Although SUPER 4PCS is efficient, we show in
   this work that one can gain significant practical improvements in
   runtime by reducing the number of congruent 4-point bases across the two
   3D point sets. We accomplish this by using a generalized 4-point base
   which considers non-coplanar 4-point bases as well as planar ones. We
   show through experimentation that the number of 4-point bases decreases,
   sometimes exponentially, with a non-coplanar base. Using this property,
   we propose the Super Generalized 4PCS algorithm which can exhibit a
   significant speed-up of up to 6.5x over the Super 4PCS algorithm as
   demonstrated experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{Sensor information (e.g. temperature, voltage, etc.) obtained from
   heterogeneous sources in SCADA systems may be uncertain and incomplete,

   we apply Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory to correctly model the information
   so that it can be merged in a consistent way. Unfortunately, existing
   merging operators are not suitable for every situation. We adapt a
   context-dependent strategy from possibility theory where we determine
   the context for when to merge using Dempster's rule of combination (i.e.
   for low conflicting information) and then resort to Dubois and Prade's
   disjunctive rule to merge information which is highly conflicting. We
   demonstrate the suitability of our approach with a scenario of a smart
   grid SCADA system modelled using the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI)
   multi-agent framework. In particular, we use the notion of epistemic
   states to model combined uncertain sensor information for better
   informed selection of predefined plans.}},

Abstract = {{Ring vanes were recognized as being beneficial for increasing pressure
   recovery and reducing stall in wide-angled diffusers. Augmentation
   devices can also reduce swirl-induced flow distortion. A three-point
   ring vane was inserted into a short annular diffuser with a
   length-to-inlet-height ratio of 14.5 and area ratio of 4. Numerical
   optimization studies were completed using the realizable k-epsilon
   turbulence model at zero and 12 deg inlet swirl that established a
   preferential location of the ring vane leading edge. Parametric
   computational fluid dynamics studies evaluated the influence of the
   dominant variables overall length and angle at 0 to 12 deg inlet swirl.
   Performance was dependent on the ability of the ring vane to reduce
   outer wall stall without swirl or the central toroidal recirculation
   zone with swirl and the ring vane wake. Shorter vanes angled towards the
   centre reduced back pressure with no swirl whereas longer outward angled
   vanes were preferred with 12 deg swirl.}},

Abstract = {{The flow and heat transfer inside a short airfoil shaped turbine exhaust
   strut was studied experimentally and computationally. A combination of
   transient and steady IR thermographic techniques were used to measure
   the heat transfer, and showed that the streamwise evolution of the heat
   transfer could be reliably described using a power law type
   relationship. Steady RANS CFD using the realizable k-epsilon was unable
   to accurately predict the observed heat transfer, with the main
   limitations of the model being a) a fundamental inability to calculate
   secondary flows and b) an underestimation of the restriction on boundary
   layer growth rates imposed by the opposing walls. The experiments showed
   that heat transfer rates were much higher in thinner regions of the
   strut, and lower in thicker regions. The CFD predicted an essentially
   uniform heat transfer rate, independent of the local strut thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Recommending users for a new social network user to follow is a topic of
   interest at present. The existing approaches rely on using various types
   of information about the new user to determine recommended users who
   have similar interests to the new user. However, this presents a problem
   when a new user joins a social network, who is yet to have any
   interaction on the social network. In this paper we present a particular
   type of conversational recommendation approach, critiquing-based
   recommendation, to solve the cold start problem. We present a
   critiquing-based recommendation system, called CSFinder, to recommend
   users for a new user to follow. A traditional critiquing-based
   recommendation system allows a user to critique a feature of a
   recommended item at a time and gradually leads the user to the target
   recommendation. However this may require a lengthy recommendation
   session. CSFinder aims to reduce the session length by taking a
   case-based reasoning approach. It selects relevant recommendation
   sessions of past users that match the recommendation session of the
   current user to short-cut the current recommendation session. It selects
   relevant recommendation sessions from a case base that contains the
   successful recommendation sessions of past users. A past recommendation
   session can be selected if it contains recommended items and critiques
   that sufficiently overlap with the ones in the current session. Our
   experimental results show that CSFinder has significantly shorter
   sessions than the ones of an Incremental Critiquing system, which is a
   baseline critiquing-based recommendation system.}},

Abstract = {{The current paper presents a cold flow simulation study of a low Mach
   number air-air ejector with a four ring entraining diffuser that is used
   in a variety of applications including infrared (IR) suppression of
   exhaust from helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. The main objectives of
   this investigation were to identify, key issues that must be addressed
   in successful CFD modelling of such devices, and recognize opportunities
   to improve the performance of these devices. Two-dimensional CFD
   simulations were carried out using commercial software, Ansys14. Studies
   of mesh and domain size sensitivity were made to ensure the CFD results
   were independent of both factors. A turbulence model independence study
   using k-epsilon, k-omega and RSM turbulence models was performed to
   figure out the appropriate turbulence model that produced the best
   agreement with the experimental data for several of ejector performance
   criteria. The measured flow properties in the annulus were used as input
   boundary conditions for the CFD simulations. However, in the
   comprehensive turbulence model study, the measured flow parameters at
   the nozzle exit were also applied as inlet boundary conditions for the
   CFD simulations. The measured flow velocity at the nozzle exit, at one
   centerline section inside the mixing tube and at the diffuser exit and
   the system pressure recovery were compared with the CFD predictions. The
   ejector pumping ratios, back pressure coefficient and diffuser gap
   velocities were also compared.
   It was found that the RANS-based CFD predictions were sensitive to the
   changes in the ejector domain size, mesh refinement and inlet boundary
   condition locations. With the annulus inlet boundary conditions, the
   tested turbulence models under predicted the size of the core separation
   downstream of the system, back pressure, pumping ratio and pressure
   recovery in the mixing tube and diffuser. However, the ability of the
   RNG turbulence model to predict the ejector performance parameters was
   better than that of the other turbulence models at all inlet flow
   conditions. Nevertheless, applying the inlet boundary conditions at the
   nozzle exit enhanced the capability of the RANS-based turbulence model
   particularly in predicting the ejector pumping ratios, pressure recovery
   and the size of the core separation. Finally, the acceptable agreement
   between the experimental data and the CFD predictions provides a valid
   tool to continue improving these devices using CFD techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Buried pipelines are extensively used in onshore and offshore for
   transportation of hydrocarbons. The response of pipeline due to lateral
   and upward relative displacements is one of the major concerns in
   pipeline design. Both physical modeling and numerical analyses have been
   performed in the past to understand pipeline-soil interaction
   mechanisms. The numerical analyses are generally performed using finite
   element (FE) modeling techniques. For the pipelines buried in sand, a
   large number of analyses available in the literature have been performed
   using the Mohr-Coulomb model assigning constant values of angle of
   internal friction (phi') and dilation (psi). However, dense sand shows
   post-peak softening behavior and the behavior of sand also depends on
   mode of shearing, such as triaxial (TX), direct shear (DS) or direct
   simple shear (DSS) conditions. In the present study, FE analysis of
   buried pipelines in dense sand is presented. The first set of analyses
   are performed using the built-in Mohr-Coulomb model in Abaqus FE
   software with constant angles of internal friction and dilation, as
   typically used in previous FE analysis of pipeline-soil interaction. The
   second set of analyses are performed using a modified Mohr Coulomb model
   where pre-peak hardening, post-peak softening, density and confining
   pressure dependent friction and dilation angles are considered. The FE
   analyses are performed using the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)
   approach available in Abaqus/Explicit FE software. The modified
   Mohr-Coulomb model is implemented in Abaqus FE software using a user
   defined subroutine. Shear band formation due to strain localization and
   failure patterns for both lateral and upward pipeline-soil interactions
   are discussed from the simulations with MC and MMC models. FE results
   show that the MMC model can simulate the load-displacement behavior and
   failure pattern better than the simulations with the MC model.}},

   for multi-phase LLC resonant converter for high power application.
   Automatic current sharing is achieved by using a common resonant

   automatically share the load current without any additional circuit and
   control strategy. The current share performance of the proposed common
   inductor current share method is analyzed under Fundamental Harmonic
   Analysis (FHA) assumption. A 600W two-phase LLC converter prototype

   Excellent current sharing performance (less than 0.5\% current sharing

Abstract = {{In computer and telecommunication power supplies, the front end DC-DC
   stage is required to operate with a wide input voltage range to provide
   hold up time when AC voltage fails. Conventional LLC converter serving
   as the DC-DC stage is not suitable for this task, as the normal
   operation efficiency at 400Vin will be penalized once the converter is
   designed to achieve high peak gain, i.e. the wide input voltage range.
   This paper examines the operation of the LCLC converter and proposes a
   design methodology of LCLC converter to increase the peak gain without
   sacrificing the efficiency at normal input voltage condition. In normal
   operation, LCLC converter behaves like an LLC converter with large
   magnetizing inductor Lm, hence the magnetizing inductor current is
   reduced. During the hold-up condition, by reducing the switching
   frequency, the equivalent magnetizing inductive reactance of the LCLC
   converter will reduce more than that of the LLC converter, thus the
   converter enjoys higher peak gain. To verify the effectiveness of the
   LCLC converter for hold up operation, analysis will be presented, a
   design method based on capacitor voltage stress will be introduced, and
   experimental results from a 250V-400V input and 12V/500W prototype will
   be demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Two stage AC-DC converters consisting of front-end Power Factor
   Correction (PFC) AC-DC boost converter followed by isolated DC-DC
   converters are the industry workhorse for powering network servers,
   telecom and other DC loads. Such converters are powered from single
   phase AC utility mains. For proper operation of these loads, the AC-DC
   converters provide a regulated DC voltage that ranges from 12V to 48V
   depending on the type of load. For safe uninterrupted operation during
   sudden intermittences in power supplied from the AC mains, the AC-DC
   power converter should be able to supply such loads with constant DC
   output voltage for a certain duration in order to prevent them from
   unwanted resetting. The maximum duration for which the AC -DC converter
   can supply the load with regulated DC output voltage at its maximum
   output power after input AC mains failure, is known as ``hold-up-time

Abstract = {{In this paper, a five-stage fault protection scheme against the
   short-circuit fault for parallel high-power three-phase combined
   inverter to achieve high reliability is proposed. There are two control
   modes, Voltage Controlled Mode (VCM) and Current Controlled Mode (CCM).
   VCM operates under normal operation to keep constant output voltage. CCM
   operates under fault operation to limit the output current, which is
   combined with hardware current limit circuit and software current limit
   unit. For parallel inverter system, the output voltage recovers quickly
   and then switch from CCM to VCM for inverter once the short-circuit
   fault is recovered. However, A little time difference of switching mode
   between parallel inverters results in the surge circulating current,
   which reduces the system reliability. Thus, the pre synchronized state
   is added to achieve the current sharing at any time and to achieve
   simultaneous mode change for each inverter. A prototype with two
   parallel three-phase 400kVA/50HZ inverters is built to verify the
   reliability of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Harvesting renewable energy sources is the key to solving the global
   energy crisis. The grid-connected voltage source inverter (VSI) is an
   essential part of the two-stage power conditioning system used to
   extract power from renewable energy systems and deliver it to the
   utility grid. Conventionally, an L-filter has been used to filter
   switching harmonics produced by the VSI. The LCL-filter, however, can
   provide effective filtering while using smaller components. When using
   the LCL-filter, it is necessary to provide active damping in the
   closed-loop system in order to damp the natural resonance of this
   third-order system. In this digest, the system is analyzed from a
   geometric viewpoint to see how the LCL-filter affects its stability.
   This geometric analysis entails finding the system flow and extracting
   the Poincare map in order to analyze the stability and behavioral
   characteristics of the grid-connected VSI with an LCL-filter. This
   analysis can supply insights into the system operation and controller
   design, which can prove useful for designing the closed-loop control

Abstract = {{Single stage Flyback converter with active power factor correction (PFC)
   function built-in is very popular for low power LED driver application.
   However, a universal driver design (120V similar to 277Vac wide input)
   for meeting PF>0.90 and THD<20\% at 50\% of maximum output power remains
   very challenging using peak current transition mode (PCTM) PFC control.
   Therefore, in this paper, a novel and practical scheme is presented for
   a single stage Flyback LED driver to achieve high power factor for
   universal input. Based on LED output feedback, the off-time is
   controlled to operate the Flyback converter in discontinuous conduction
   mode (DCM) to realize high PF. The control implementation can be adapted
   to existing popular PCTM PFC controller and due to the secondary side
   current regulation, it is suitable for dimmable LED driver application.
   A 22W dimmable LED driver is prototyped to verify this scheme and at 10W
   output power, PF>0.90 and THD<20\% are achieved for the universal input
   voltage range.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional single-stage AC-DC LED drivers with a high power factor
   contain significant LED current ripple at twice the AC line frequency,
   and require large energy storage capacitors to limit the effect on LED
   light. Conventional designs and novel control techniques aim to power
   LED loads with a DC voltage to ensure a limited low frequency current
   ripple. This paper proposes an average current modulation method that is
   capable of driving LEDs from a voltage that contains significant AC
   ripple, while maintaining zero low frequency current ripple. This allows
   the energy storage capacitance of the PFC stage to be reduced, avoiding
   the need for electrolytic type capacitors, and prolonging the life of
   the LED driver. The average current modulation circuit requires a single
   low voltage MOSFET, a current sense resistor and a simple control
   circuit. By requiring no additional magnetic components, the cost of the
   average current modulation circuit is very low, and has minimal impact
   on the efficiency of the overall LED driver. A 25 W experimental
   prototype with a Flyback PFC converter has been built to verify the
   capability and excellent performance of the proposed driving technique.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a closed-loop control technique in D-Q rotating
   frame for bi-directional single-phase AC/DC converters. The proposed
   control system allows the active and reactive power control in both
   directions from grid to vehicle and vehicle to grid, while controlling
   the DC-bus voltage. Due to the lack of freedom degrees required for
   orthogonal systems, using the D-Q frame is a challenge in single-phase
   power conditioning systems. In this paper, an all-pass filter has been
   used to generate the orthogonal signals in the closed-loop control
   system. This method generates the orthogonal signals without degrading
   the dynamics of the closed-loop control system and with less noise in
   comparison to the other common methods such as differentiators. A DC-bus
   voltage estimator based on adaptive filter has also been used in this
   paper to remove the double frequency ripple and in turn increase the
   reliability and speed of the proposed controller. The proposed control
   scheme is used to implement the smart charging and power management
   strategies of the residential loads using electric vehicles as a storage
   system. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the transient
   and steady-state performance of the proposed controller in different
   modes of operation. Also the performance of the proposed DC-bus voltage
   estimator in removing the double frequency ripple as well as the
   application of the proposed control scheme in implementation of power
   management strategies in a typical household, has been shown by using
   simulation results.}},

   topologies have been derived. Among them, a new family of Space NPC
   (S-NPC) multilevel topologies is also proposed by NPC-FG. Additional

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel, non-isolated step-down converter for the
   application of point-of-load (POL) voltage regulation. The new converter
   can achieve higher power density by utilizing a much smaller inductor
   compared with Buck converter in the POL application. A smaller inductor
   is achieved by increasing the effective operating frequency applied to
   the inductor by a factor of 4 and at the same time reducing the voltage
   applied to the inductor while maintaining the same switching frequency
   of control switches. The new converter uses two groups of interleaving
   switches to increase the effective operating frequency on the inductor
   and a flying capacitor to reduce the voltage across the inductor. The
   new switch topology is adopted because inductors take up much more space
   than active switches in a high power density power module {[}1]{[}2]. A
   12V-to-1V/1A prototype demonstrates that the proposed topology can use
   an inductor that is 77\% less inductance than a conventional Buck
   Converter (i.e. only 23\% of Buck's inductance is used in the
   prototype). Since two groups of switches are interleaved, the RMS (Root
   Mean Square) current in each group of control switches is reduced to
   half and the hotspot on the control switches is split into two.}},

   Existing techniques for stability analysis of cascaded converters
   systems are mainly based on Thevenin or Norton equivalents of two-port

   can be applied. In this work, further transformations of Thevenin or
   Norton equivalents to feedback interconnections of two general classes,
   i.e. heterogeneous and homogeneous cascaded converter systems are
   presented to facilitate simpler stability evaluation via the small gain
   theorem. Qualitative analysis on feedback interconnections is then
   conducted to reveal the differences in using the impedance-based

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an accurate and inexpensive method for localizing
   a calibrated monocular camera in 3D indoor environments. The objective
   of this work is to localize in 6 degrees-of-freedom (6 DOF) in the
   presence of a 3D map that contains 3D point clouds co-registered with
   intensity information. This is done by solving the Perspective-n-Point
   (PnP) problem to accurately compute the camera location in 6 DOF. An
   efficient data structure is used to store a large set of point clouds
   co-registered with intensity information, image features, and
   transformations between the images. This data structure, referred to as
   the feature database, is implemented such that it retrieves a match for
   a query image efficiently. Thus the overall process of localization in 6
   DOF becomes a real-time process with high efficiency and accuracy. Our
   technique was tested with two ground truth data sets of indoor
   environments, an office and a laboratory. The experimental results show
   the accuracy and the efficiency of our technique, with an average
   localization error of less than 10 mm from the ground truth in both
   environments. In addition, localization results on query images obtained
   using two different cameras in four different environments are
   presented. This demonstrates that any type of monocular camera may be
   used during localization, as long as a sufficient number of
   environmental features can be extracted from the query images.}},

Abstract = {{Energy efficiency is an essential requirement for all contemporary
   computing systems. We thus need tools to measure the energy consumption
   of computing systems and to understand how workloads affect it.
   Significant recent research effort has targeted direct power
   measurements on production computing systems using on-board sensors or
   external instruments. These direct methods have in turn guided studies
   of software techniques to reduce energy consumption via workload
   allocation and scaling. Unfortunately, direct energy measurements are
   hampered by the low power sampling frequency of power sensors. The
   coarse granularity of power sensing limits our understanding of how
   power is allocated in systems and our ability to optimize energy
   efficiency via workload allocation.
   We present ALEA, a tool to measure power and energy consumption at the
   granularity of basic blocks, using a probabilistic approach. ALEA
   provides fine-grained energy profiling via statistical sampling, which
   overcomes the limitations of power sensing instruments. Compared to
   state-of-the-art energy measurement tools, ALEA provides finer
   granularity without sacrificing accuracy. ALEA achieves low overhead
   energy measurements with mean error rates between 1.4\% and 3.5\% in 14
   sequential and parallel benchmarks tested on both Intel and ARM
   platforms. The sampling method caps execution time overhead at
   approximately 1\%. ALEA is thus suitable for online energy monitoring
   and optimization. Finally, ALEA is a user-space tool with a portable,
   machine-independent sampling method. We demonstrate three use cases of
   ALEA, where we reduce the energy consumption of a k-means computational
   kernel by 37\%, an ocean modeling code by 33\%, and a ray tracing code
   by 6\% compared to high-performance execution baselines, by varying the
   power optimization strategy between basic blocks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a review of the present understanding of the
   kinematics of meandering flow, and its relationship to bed deformation
   as well as downstream migration and lateral expansion of meander loops.
   Taking into account the conditions prevailing in natural, low-land
   alluvial meandering rivers, the paper focuses primarily on the behaviour
   of streams having ``large{''} values of width-to-depth ratio. The
   present review is preceded by a brief description of meandering defining
   geometric characteristics, as these are invoked throughout this
   manuscript. The paper is also used as an opportunity to outline future
   directions for research. These involve matters related to the topics
   under consideration that remain obscure and which, in the writer's view,
   constitute subjects particularly worthwhile as future research topics
   for their scientific as well as practical significance. More
   specifically, these concern the nature and analytical formulation of
   meander wavelength; the value of width-to-depth ratio beyond which the
   effect of cross-circulation becomes of secondary importance where the
   meandering bed deformation is concerned; and, finally, the unification
   of present methods of determination of meandering planimetric evolution
   with the principle of self-formation of alluvial streams as expressed by
   regime theory.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a new composite fading model which assumes that
   the mean signal power of an eta - mu it signal envelope follows an

   shadowed fading due to its semi heavy-tailed characteristics. To
   demonstrate the utility of the new eta - mu / inverse gamma composite
   fading model, we investigate the characteristics of the shadowed fading
   behavior observed in body centric communications channels which are
   known to be susceptible to shadowing effects, particularly generated by
   the human body. It is shown that the eta - mu / inverse gamma composite
   fading model provided an excellent fit to the measurement data.
   Moreover, using Kullback-Leibler divergence, the eta - mu / inverse
   gamma composite fading model was found to provide a better fit to the
   measured data than the kappa - mu / inverse gamma composite fading
   model, for the communication scenarios considered here.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical distributions have been extensively used in modeling fading
   effects in conventional and modern wireless communications. In the
   present work, we propose a novel K- p composite shadowed fading model,
   which is based on the valid assumption that the mean signal power
   follows the inverse gamma distribution instead of the lognormal or
   commonly used gamma distributions. This distribution has a simple
   relationship with the gamma distribution, but most importantly, its semi
   heavy-tailed characteristics constitute it suitable for applications
   relating to modeling of shadowed fading. Furthermore, the derived
   probability density function of the kappa - mu / inverse gamma composite
   distribution admits a rather simple algebraic representation that
   renders it convenient to handle both analytically and numerically. The
   validity and utility of this fading model are demonstrated by means of
   modeling the fading effects encountered in body centric communications
   channels, which have been known to be susceptible to the shadowing
   effect. To this end, extensive comparisons are provided between
   theoretical and respective real-time measurement results. It is shown
   that these comparisons exhibit accurate fitting of the new model for

   the nonlinear system and the cost function to be minimized are unknown.
   The cost function and its first, time derivative are assumed to be
   measured. The equilibrium of the unknown dynamics are assumed to be
   asymptotically stable and the cost function dynamics are assumed to he
   of relative order one. It is shown that the closed-loop ESC can also
   stabilize the steady-state optimum for an unknown unstable nonlinear
   control system. The stabilization result, is quite general and provides
   a new approach to output feedback control of nonlinear systems.The
   effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using several
   simulation examples. (C) 2015, IFAC (International Federation of

Abstract = {{In this paper, a distributed extremum seeking control technique is
   proposed to solve a class of real-time optimization problems over a
   network of dynamic agents with unknown unstable dynamics. Each dynamic
   agent measures a cost that is shared over a network. A dynamic average
   consensus approach is used to provide each agent with an estimate of the
   total network cost. The extremum seeking controller uses the local
   estimate of the total cost to adjust the value of the local decision
   variables. The contribution of the proposed technique is the
   simultaneous stabilization of the network dynamics and the distributed
   optimization of the total network cost. A dynamic network simulation
   example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique.

Abstract = {{This paper studies geometric properties of a class of irreversible
   dynamical systems, referred to in the literature as metriplectic
   systems. This class of systems, related to generalized (or dissipative)
   Hamiltonian systems, are generated by a conserved component and a
   dissipative component and appear, for example, in non-equilibrium
   thermodynamics. In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the two potentials
   generating the dynamics are interpreted as generalized energy and
   generalized entropy, respectively. Stability and stabilization results
   for metriplectic systems have been presented in the literature, however,
   some aspects are still poorly understood, in particular the existence of
   dynamical invariants such as periodic orbits. In this note, we study the
   properties of metriplectic systems by considering a lift from the
   n-dimensional state space to a (2n+1)-dimensional contact space,
   following an approach introduced in recent years to study irreversible
   control systems. This lift leads to a deeper geometric characterization
   of metriplectic systems in the extended space. An example is provided to
   illustrate the approach proposed in this paper. (C) 2015, IFAC

Abstract = {{Wearable devices performing advanced bio-signal analysis algorithms are
   aimed to foster a revolution in healthcare provision of chronic cardiac
   diseases. In this context, energy efficiency is of paramount importance,
   as long-term monitoring must be ensured while relying on a tiny power
   source. Operating at a scaled supply voltage, just above the threshold
   voltage, effectively helps in saving substantial energy, but it makes
   circuits, and especially memories, more prone to errors, threatening the
   correct execution of algorithms. The use of error detection and
   correction codes may help to protect the entire memory content, however
   it incurs in large area and energy overheads which may not be compatible
   with the tight energy budgets of wearable systems.
   To cope with this challenge, in this paper we propose to limit the
   overhead of traditional schemes by selectively detecting and correcting
   errors only in data highly impacting the end-to-end quality of service
   of ultra-low power wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) devices. This
   partition adopts the protection of either significant words or
   significant bits of each data element, according to the application
   characteristics (statistical properties of the data in the application
   buffers), and its impact in determining the output.
   The proposed heterogeneous error protection scheme in real ECG signals
   allows substantial energy savings (11\% in wearable devices) compared to
   state-of-the-art approaches, like ECC, in which the whole memory is
   protected against errors. At the same time, it also results in
   negligible output quality degradation in the evaluated power spectrum
   analysis application of ECG signals.}},

Abstract = {{Use of the carrier phase measurements in Global Positioning System (GPS)
   enables centimeter to millimeter level positioning accuracy. However,
   this is only possible when the Integer Ambiguities (IAs) are correctly
   resolved. In challenging GPS scenarios when fewer GPS satellites are
   visible, the Integer Ambiguity Resolution (IAR) takes longer time which
   affects continuity of precise positioning. In kinematic positioning, the
   Time-to-Fix Ambiguities (TTFA) is critical since IAR is frequently
   required as cycle-slips and satellite signal loss are common due to
   obstructions in urban canyons. Most of the previous works have utilized
   expensive high-end Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to aid GPS in IAR.
   This work investigates the use of reduced set of
   Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)-based inertial sensors along
   with the vehicle's speed measurements to help reduce TTFA. Double
   Difference (DD) GPS carrier phase and pseudorange measurements are
   integrated with other sensors' measurements using an enhanced Extended
   Kalman Filter (EKF)-based estimator to obtain the Float Ambiguities
   (FAs). FAs and their Variance-Covariance Matrix (VCM) are used in Least
   Squares Ambiguity Decorrelation Adjustment (LAMBDA) method to fix FAs to
   integers. Due to the inclusion of inertial and odometery measurements,
   entities of VCM become smaller which translates into smaller search
   space for LAMBDA and faster resolution of ambiguities. The proposed
   method was tested on several real road trajectories and it performed
   24\% better than GPS-only algorithm for the case of 4 visible
   satellites. For 5 and 6 visible satellites, it performed 19\% and 8\%
   better than GP-S only algorithm respectively. For 7 and more satellites,
   both the algorithms resolved IAs instantaneously.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a team of cooperative Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
   maintains a desired geometrical formation while tracking a reference

   providing guarantees on safety, robustness and convergence. The ability
   of the proposed DLBMPC controller in solving the problem of formation
   for a team of cooperative UAVs is solved in simulation. The designed
   controller respects the general formation constraints known as Reynolds
   rules of flocking. Our main contribution in this paper lays in the
   stabilization of a group of cooperative UAVs, in a desired formation,

Abstract = {{The Goldstrike Carlin-type gold deposits are hosted mainly in impure
   Paleozoic carbonate rocks that are cut by Jurassic diorite stocks and
   dikes (158-163 Ma), Jurassic phlogopite lamprophyre dikes (162-163 Ma),
   and Eocene biotite-plagioclase porphyry dikes (40 Ma). The Eocene dikes
   are coeval with the Carlin-type gold mineralization and have been
   interpreted as the main source of the auriferous hydrothermal fluids.
   The SiO2 versus K2O contents, Ce/Yb versus Ta/Yb, and REE values reveal
   that the Jurassic and Eocene intrusive rocks exhibit geochemical
   signatures typical of shoshonitic rocks. The Sm-Nd isotopic data
   indicate that the Jurassic Goldstrike diorite (epsilon Nd(t)=-6.5) and
   the Eocene biotite-plagioclase porphyry dikes (epsilon Nd(t)=-5.8)
   formed by melting of metasomatised Proterozoic subcontinental
   lithospheric mantle (SCLM), whereas the Jurassic phlogopite lamprophyre
   dikes (epsilon Nd(t)=0 to -0.3) were derived from juvenile source, such
   as the upwelling asthenospheric mantle. If indeed the Carlin-gold
   deposits are associated with hydrothermal magmatic fluids, our data
   integrated with the information on other magmatic hydrothermal systems
   in SW USA indicate that the Proterozoic subcontinental lithospheric
   mantle has been the main source of fertile magmas that generated Au-rich
   magmatic hydrothermal systems, from Jurassic to Eocene in the
   southern-western USA.}},

Abstract = {{The North Lac des Iles Intrusions is a large, (similar to 25 km2)
   multi-phase ultramafic component of the Lac des Iles Complex located in
   northwestern Ontario. It comprises two major intrusive centers that are
   distinguishable based on their dominant rock types and geometry of
   layering. Detailed mapping on the eastern flank of the Northern
   Ultramafic Centre (NUC) led to the identification of a marginal gabbro
   and a layered series. The layered series consists mainly of
   serpentinite, websterite, olivine-clinopyroxenite units, with lesser
   olivine-websterite and rarely gabbronorite. Two distinct cycles can be
   recognized based on the repetition of units and their mineral
   paragenesis. The contacts between the cyclic units are sharp or
   gradational. Within individual cycles, upward whole rock compositional
   variation is consistent with fractional crystallization, characterised
   by decrease in Mg contents in whole rock. However, near the top of
   cyclic units, the trend is reversed gradually or abruptly. The NUC hosts
   several anomalous occurrences of platinum- group element (PGE).
   Significantly, the highest PGE concentrations occur in zones of
   compositional reversal in the layered units. The presence of the
   PGE-bearing zones is interpreted to be the result of dynamic mixing
   between primitive and resident magmas that also caused the reversal in
   whole rock composition.}},

Abstract = {{Many smaller churches and similar buildings in Canada have been
   converted into small theaters. Such theatres are often not fitted with
   an air-conditioning system. For performances in the fall these theaters
   sometimes rely on buoyancy driven natural ventilation to moderate the
   indoor air temperature. Such ventilation systems usually involve near
   floor inlet vents and a roof level air discharge system. A preliminary
   numerical study of the effect of inlet vent position and size on the
   performance of such a system has been undertaken. A simple model of a
   typical theater building of the type considered has been used. The heat
   generated by the audience has been represented by a uniform heat flux
   distributed over the audience area. Inlet vents have been assumed to be
   located low on the side walls of the theater and the air-flow leaving
   the theatre has been assumed to be through vents at the top of a chimney
   system. The flow has been assumed to be steady and symmetrical about the
   vertical center-line through the building. The Boussinesq approach has
   been adopted. The standard k-epsilon turbulence model has been used. The
   solution has been obtained using the commercial CFD solver ANSYS FLUENT

   surface is mounted parallel to and at a relatively short distance from
   the heated element. The heated element is facing upwards with the

Abstract = {{Liquid-desiccant (LD) dehumidification technology has been used to
   extract moisture from humid air while attempting to consume less
   electricity than traditional air-conditioning methods. An evaporative
   cooling tower (ECT) was used as a cooling device to reject the latent
   heat gained by the system to regenerate the desiccant solution. The
   performance of an ECT was evaluated both experimentally and through
   TRNSYS simulations to investigate optimal operating conditions. The ECT
   often operated in humid conditions which resulted in reduced heat
   rejection rates and ineffective operation. To improve performance,
   cooling water storage (CWS) was investigated as a way to reduce ECT
   usage during periods of higher ambient humidity. To undertake this
   study, the complete LD system, incorporating CWS, was modelled in TRNSYS
   for a range of typical operating conditions. The results indicated that
   operation of the CWS system reduced the electrical power consumption and
   increased the electrical coefficient of performance (COPE) of the liquid
   desiccant air conditioning unit system by up to 16\%. The total cooling
   rate improved by up to 6\%. Smaller gains in COPT and solar fraction
   were also found in the simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{The von Karman vortex street is a flow instability that is observed in
   the wake of a blunt body if a certain (cylinder) Reynolds number is
   exceeded. It is one of the classical problems in fluid mechanics and a
   vast amount of research has been dedicated to the investigation of the
   fundamentals of this phenomenon. The present study is concerned with the
   numerical simulation of the flow in a microchannel having a cylinder
   located in its channel center. A pressure driven flow is induced in the
   channel described by the channel Reynolds number. The cylinder is
   subjected to an externally-applied electric field that causes
   electroosmosis in the electrical double layer which is present around
   the cylinder surface. In this setup, two distinctions to the classical
   von Karman vortex street can be noted. On the one hand, the presence of
   the microchannel walls confines the flow field in lateral direction. On
   the other hand, the electroosmotic slip velocity impacts the flow
   topology in the vicinity of the cylinder and, thus, may have an impact
   on the formation and the periodic nature of the von Karman vortex
   street. Various numerical simulations are performed to investigate the
   influence of the cylinder-diameter to-channel-width ratio and the
   direction of the electrical field.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we identify the type of calcium arsenates found in
   sediment samples from an aquifer located in Matehuala, San Luis Potosi,
   Mexico. Sediments in contact with levels up to 158 mg/L of arsenic in
   neutral pH water were studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
   microscopy coupled to energy dispersive X-ray analyses (SEM-EDS), and
   synchrotron based X-ray diffraction. Identification of these calcium
   arsenates by X-ray analysis has proved to be very difficult to achieve
   because the precipitates of interest are on the microscale and immerse
   in a matrix of calcite, gypsum, and quartz comprising nearly 100 \% of
   the samples. Needle-like specimens composed of calcium, arsenic, and
   oxygen were, however, commonly observed in sediment samples during
   SEM-EDS analyses in backscattered mode. Synchrotron based X-ray analyses
   revealed some peaks that were compared with published data for
   guerinite, haindingerite, and pharmacolite suggesting that these were
   the calcium arsenates present in sediments, the calcium arsenates that
   control the solubility of arsenic in the contaminated aquifer in
   Matehuala, and the calcium arsenates that prevail in the long-term in
   the environment after cycles of dissolution and precipitation. The
   identification of these calcium arsenates is consistent with the
   environmental conditions prevailing at the study area and the SEM-EDS
   observations. However, its identification is not unequivocal as the
   comparison of experimental data collected in single crystal specimens
   against X-ray diffraction references collected in powders prevents a
   strictly proper identification of the specimens analyzed. In this way,
   scorodite was also identified by synchrotron based X-ray analyses
   however its presence is inconsistent with the environmental conditions
   and the calcium arsenate associations found in this study. Scorodite
   identification was therefore considered tentative. A thorough
   examination, with additional and/or improved analytical techniques,
   should be undertaken to find an environmentally sound explanation for
   the diffraction peaks assigned to scorodite, which might be from a clay
   a mineral, probably with no arsenic.}},

Abstract = {{Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia,
   is an extremely costly public health problem. Catheter-based ablation is
   a common minimally invasive procedure to treat AF. Contemporary mapping
   methods are highly dependent on the accuracy of anatomic localization of
   rotor sources within the atria. In this paper, using simulated atrial
   intracardiac electrograms (IEGMs) during AF, we propose a
   computationally efficient method for localizing the tip of the
   electrical rotor with an Archimedean/arithmetic spiral wavefront. The
   proposed method deploys the locations of electrodes of a catheter and
   their IEGMs activation times to estimate the unknown parameters of the
   spiral wavefront including its tip location. The proposed method is able
   to localize the spiral as soon as the wave hits three electrodes of the
   catheter. Our simulation results show that the method can efficiently
   localize the spiral wavefront that rotates either clockwise or
   counterclockwise.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the uplink of a single-cell massive
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with in-phase and
   quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI). This scenario is of particular
   importance in massive MIMO systems, where the deployment of lower-cost,
   lower-quality components is desirable to make massive MIMO a viable
   technology. Particularly, we investigate the effect of IQI on the
   performance of massive MIMO employing maximum-ratio combining (MRC)
   receivers. In order to study how IQI affects channel estimation, we
   derive a new channel estimator for the IQI-impaired model and show that
   IQI can substantially downgrade the performance of MRC receivers.
   Moreover, a low-complexity IQI compensation scheme, suitable for massive
   MIMO, is proposed which is based on the IQI coefficients' estimation and
   it is independent of the channel gain. The performance of the proposed
   compensation scheme is analytically evaluated by deriving a tractable
   approximation of the ergodic achievable rate and providing the
   asymptotic power scaling laws assuming transmission over Rayleigh fading
   channels with log-normal large-scale fading. Finally, we show that
   massive MIMO effectively suppresses the residual IQI effects, as long

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a sparse signal modulation (SSM) method for
   precoded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems and
   study the signal detection. Although a receiver is able to exploit a
   path diversity gain with random precoding in OFDM, the complexity of the
   receiver is usually high as the orthogonality is not retained due to
   precoding. However, with SSM, we can derive a low-complexity detector
   that can provide reasonably good performances with a low sparsity ratio
   based on the notion of compressive sensing (CS). An important feature of

Abstract = {{Although passive sensors are widely used for many mobile robotics
   applications that perform mapping and localization functions, there are
   many environments (e.g., mining and planetary) where active sensors are
   more practical. However, at present, most 3D SLAM algorithms that do use
   LiDAR and/or time-of-flight (ToF) sensors exploit only range and bearing
   information associated with these measurements, but not intensity
   information. This paper presents a new approach that attempts to
   explicitly incorporate an intensity model as part of a sparse bundle
   adjustment (SBA) estimation problem. An observability analysis shows
   that a solution exists, and simulation results verify its potential
   utility.}},

   The array elements are cylindrical DR antennas (cDRAs) operating at 30
   GHz with a bandwidth of at least 2 GHz. The MIMO antenna system consists
   of two, four-element arrays, each with a fixed beam direction which is
   electronically tilted to provide low field correlation. In particular, a
   passive microstrip-based feed network is designed to provide appropriate
   magnitude and phase excitations for beam tilting. The complete array is
   designed on a two-layer PCB and occupies 50 mm by 20 mm making it
   suitable for inclusion at the periphery of any portable device. The
   obtained gain levels were approximately 9 dBi for each MIMO antenna

   reductions of 40 MW to 55 MW are achievable in the Single wholesale

   increases of up to 30 MW. The study also shows the importance of the

Abstract = {{This paper presents a smart energy management strategy (SEMS) to
   optimise the economic operation of a micro-grid. As an important
   component of smart grids, the micro-grid acts as a bridge to bundle
   renewable generation, energy storage systems (ESSs) and electric
   vehicles (EVs) together. It can be operated either by connecting to
   upstream distribution systems or isolated with the help of ESSs. In the
   paper, an economic model of a micro-grid is established based on the
   influence of energy prices in a day-ahead market. The SEMS is used to
   schedule power supply/demand of diversified sources to obtain optimal
   economic operation. Smart management of ESSs, EVs and power exchange
   with the upstream grid, if possible, are simplified into a
   single-objective optimisation. Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA)
   has been used to achieve a practical method for energy management based
   on three different operation policies. The paper presents results which
   exemplify the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{Dependency on thermal generation and continued wind power growth in
   Europe due to renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions targets has
   resulted in an interesting set of challenges for power systems. The
   variability of wind power impacts dispatch and balancing by grid
   operators, power plant operations by generating companies and market
   wholesale costs. This paper quantifies the effects of high wind power
   penetration on power systems with a dependency on gas generation using a
   realistic unit commitment and economic dispatch model. The test system
   is analyzed under two scenarios, with and without wind, over one year.
   The key finding of this preliminary study is that despite increased
   ramping requirements in the wind scenario, the unit cost of electricity
   due to sub-optimal operation of gas generators does not show substantial

   timely forecast wind generation to enhance the flexibility and
   reliability of the operation and control of realtime power systems.
   Special events such as ramps and spikes are hard to predict with
   traditional methods using solely recently measured data. In this paper,
   a new Gaussian Process model with hybrid training data taken from both
   the local time and historical dataset is proposed and applied to make
   short-term predictions from 10 minutes to one hour ahead. A key idea is
   that the historical data with similar patterns are selected and then
   embedded in Gaussian Process model to make new predictions. The results
   of the proposed algorithms are compared to those of standard Gaussian
   Process model and the persistence model. It is shown that the proposed
   method not only reduces the magnitude error but also the phase error.}},

   of human behavior surrounding usage and intermittent travel patterns.
   This uncertainty if unmanaged has the potential to radically change

   methods are important for large-scale electric vehicle integration in
   future power systems. This paper develops a capacity forecasting model
   considering eight particular uncertainties under three categories to
   overcome this issue. The model is then applied to a UK summer scenario
   in 2020. The results of this analysis demonstrate that the proposed

   very successfully exploited in the injection stretch blow molding
   process, where it is deliberately stretched to very large strains using
   extremely high pressures. However, the material is now also being used
   in much lower pressure processes such as thermoforming where its
   properties are often not fully exploited. In this work the change in
   structure and properties of aPET with strain is systematically
   investigated using a high speed biaxial stretching machine. The aim was
   to demonstrate how the properties of the material could be controlled by
   large strain, high temperature biaxial stretching processes such as
   thermoforming and blow molding. The results show that property changes
   in the material are driven by orientation and the onset of rapid strain
   hardening at large strains. This in turn is shown to vary strongly with
   process-induced parameters such as the strain rate and the mode and
   magnitude of biaxial deformation.}},

Abstract = {{Zirconium hydride platelet reorientation in fuel cladding during dry
   storage and transportation of spent nuclear fuel is an important
   technological issue. Using an in situ x-ray synchrotron diffraction
   technique, the detailed kinetics of hydride precipitation and
   reorientation can be directly determined while the specimen is under
   stress and at temperature. Hydrided Zircaloy-4 dogbone sheet samples
   were submitted to various thermo-mechanical schedules, while x-ray
   diffraction data was continuously recorded. Post-test metallography
   showed that nearly full hydride reorientation was achieved when the
   applied stress was above 210 MPa. In general, repeated thermal cycling
   above the terminal solid solubility temperature increased both the
   reoriented hydride fraction and the connectivity of the reoriented
   hydrides. The dissolution and precipitation temperatures were determined
   directly from the hydride diffraction signal. The diffraction signature
   of reoriented hydrides is different than that of in-plane hydrides.
   During cooling under stress, the precipitation of reoriented hydrides
   occurs at lower temperatures than the precipitation of in-plane
   hydrides, suggesting that applied stress suppresses the precipitation of
   in-plane hydrides. The analysis of the elastic strains determined by the
   shift in position of hydride and zirconium diffraction peaks allowed
   following of the early stages of hydride precipitation. Hydride
   particles were observed to start to nucleate with highly compressive
   strain. These compressive strains quickly relax to smaller compressive
   strains within 30 degrees C of the onset of precipitation. After about
   half of the overall hydride volume fraction is precipitated, hydride
   strains follow the thermal contraction of the zirconium matrix. In the
   case of hydrides precipitating under stress, the strains in the hydrides
   are different in direction and trend. Analyses performed on the
   broadening of hydride diffraction peaks yielded information on the
   distribution of strains in hydride population during precipitation and
   cooldown. These results are discussed in light of existing models and
   experiments on hydride reorientation.}},

   power transistors as the control FETs in the resonant converters in the
   range of multi-megahertz. In resonant converters with multi-MHz, ZVS

   The commercial gate drivers for the GaN transistors focus on high
   reliability to the precise gate drive voltage against the parasitic
   components. But they do not consider the high reverse conduct voltage of
   the GaN transistors as the control FETs under ZVS at high frequency. To
   reduce the high reverse conduction loss of the GaN power transistors due
   to the reverse conduction mechanism before ZVS turn-on, in the
   meanwhile, ensure the high stability and reliability, a new driving
   scheme with the mid-level voltage is proposed. In addition, the proposed

Abstract = {{It has been well documented that series compensation (SC) configuration
   can significantly reduce the total output capacitance of LED driver
   without sacrificing the power factor (PF), thus enabling the use of
   long-life film capacitors. Most importantly, SC provides the advantages
   over the parallel compensation (PC) methods in that it reduces the
   voltage stresses of the auxiliary stage components and thus can provide
   a higher efficiency, which is especially desirable for high-power LED
   drivers. However, with conventional series compensation, the auxiliary
   stage requires an auxiliary winding from the main stage. This increases
   the cost as well as the complexity of the circuit design. In this paper,
   a novel Full-Bridge Ripple Compensation Converter (FB RCC) using
   floating capacitor is proposed. By innovatively controlling the power
   flow of this auxiliary circuit, the auxiliary winding can be eliminated,
   thus making the input side of the auxiliary circuit floating and
   rendering a more cost effective and more flexible solution for both
   isolated and non-isolated LED driver applications. The new ripple
   compensation method retains the outstanding ripple-cancellation ability
   and high efficiency of the original SC method, and has been demonstrated
   in a 100W, 150V-0.7A experimental prototype.}},

Abstract = {{Two stage AC-DC converters consisting of front-end Power Factor
   Correction (PFC) AC-DC boost converter followed by an isolated DC-DC
   converter are the industry workhorse for powering network servers,
   telecom and other DC loads. Such converters are powered from
   single-phase ac utility mains. For proper operation of these loads the
   AC-DC converterprovides a regulated DC voltage that ranges from 12V to
   48V depending on the type of load. For safe uninterrupted operation
   during sudden intermittences in power supplied from the AC mains, the
   AC-DC power converter should be able to supply such loads with constant
   DC output voltage in order to prevent them from unwanted resetting. The
   maximum duration for which the AC-DC converter can supply the load with
   regulated DC output voltage at its maximum output power after input AC
   mains failure, is known as ``hold-up-time (HUT){''} of the converter.
   This paper proposes a novel DC-DC non-resonant full-bridge converter

Abstract = {{In many formulations of controller architectures for variable-speed
   vapor compression machines, evaporator superheat temperature is commonly
   selected as a regulated variable due to its correlation with cycle
   efficiency. Further, the superheat temperature setpoint is conveniently
   taken as a constant value over the wide range of operating conditions.
   However, direct measurement of superheat is not always available, and
   estimates of superheat have limited robustness. Therefore identifying
   alternate signals in the control of vapor compression machines that
   correlate to efficiency is desired.
   In this paper, we consider a model-free extremum seeking algorithm that
   adjusts compressor discharge temperature setpoints in order to optimize
   energy efficiency. While perturbation-based extremum seeking methods
   have been known for some time, they suffer from slow convergence rates-a
   problem emphasized in application by the long time constants associated
   with thermal systems. Our method uses a new algorithm (time-varying
   extremum seeking), which has dramatically faster and more reliable
   convergence properties. In particular, we regulate the compressor
   discharge temperature using setpoints selected from a model-free
   time-varying extremum seeking algorithm. We show that the relationship
   between compressor discharge temperature and power consumption is convex
   (a requirement for this class of realtime optimization), and use
   time-varying extremum seeking to drive these setpoints to values that
   minimize power. The results are compared to the traditional
   perturbation-based extremum seeking approach. Experiments are performed
   demonstrating discharge temperature optimization from 72 degrees C to 62
   degrees C for a particular set of experimental conditions where the
   power consumption is decreased from 525 W to 450 W, resulting in an
   increase in observed coefficient of performance (COP) of 14\%.}},

Abstract = {{Three mixes were provided namely normal weight self-compacting concrete
   with Portland cement as a control (NWSCC-PC), lightweight
   self-compacting concrete with ground granulated blast furnace slag
   concrete (LWSCC-GGBS) and lightweight self-compacting concrete with
   limestone powder concrete (LWSCC-LSP). There were three cubes of each
   mix for each testing age, which were cured at 20, 30, 40 and 50 degrees
   C to investigate the effect of curing temperature on strength
   development. They were tested at ages 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 7, 14
   and 28 days. The results showed that the strength development of self
   compacting concrete strongly affected by curing temperature as it does
   with normal concrete. At early ages, the strengths development of
   concrete cured at higher curing temperature, were faster than that of
   concrete cured at lower temperature. The strength development of
   concretes cured at lower temperature, however, have higher strength at
   later ages. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Abstract = {{Performance of the algorithms which process intracardiac electrograms
   (IEGMs) highly depends on the accuracy of estimating the times that
   electrical waves pass the area under the electrodes. Estimating these
   activation times (ATs) from IEGMs during atrial fibrillation (AF) is
   extremely challenging as electrical activities of atria are very
   complex, non-stationary, and irregular. In this paper, we propose a new
   activation detector which is based on the test of the equality of
   variance of two sets of data. At any time t, we consider two sets of
   IEGM data: 1) data in a bounded interval around t, 2) data in bounded
   intervals around the first interval. We show that the activation zone
   can be extracted by comparing the variance of these two sets, i.e., we
   introduce a new preprocessing approach and show that it can effectively
   highlight activation zones of IEGMs. Our simulation results on bipolar
   atrial IEGMs gathered during AF confirm the efficiency of the proposed
   preprocessing method.}},

Abstract = {{Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major global health issue as it is the
   most prevalent supraventricular arrhythmia. Multiple ectopic electrical
   sources in the atria are believed to sustain AF. Catheter-based ablation
   of these sources is considered an effective AF treatment. Based on the
   Hough transform (HT), we propose a general framework that processes the
   atrial intracardiac electrograms (IEGMs) to localize the tip of an
   ectopic source with a spiral wavefront shape. Using the locations of the
   catheter's electrodes and the activation times of the IEGMs, we provide
   a method that can estimate the location of the tip of a spiral wavefront
   to be eliminated by ablation. By providing various examples, it is shown
   that the proposed method can accurately localize the tip of the spiral
   rotor.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a solution for supporting dynamic RAM-base code
   with the Freescale MQX real-time operating system that would normally
   have all of its code in Flash EEPROM storage found in ColdFire- and
   ARM-based microcontroller chips. Dynamic RAM-based code can expedite
   development and refinement of embedded application code by reducing the
   need to repeatedly build a full code image and reprogram Flash EEPROM.
   The solution consists of two primary components: a compact addition to
   MQX on the target platform, and a standalone tool on a host computer to
   prepare application code in a form suitable for RAM-based use. The
   addition to MQX exploits the convenience of an existing telnet shell,
   but also involves custom code for managing data structures for a
   collection of dynamic programs in RAM. In addition to supporting the
   execution of finite-duration programs, continuously-executing programs
   can be dynamically initiated as background tasks in MQX. For a ColdFire
   microcontroller, the addition to MQX represents a modest increase of
   approximately 9 kbytes, which is less than 9\% of total image size for
   the MQX kernel with shell and networking code.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2510}},
Pages = {{7-14}},
Abstract = {{Transportation corridors are classified as critical infrastructure in
   the United States and Canada. Successfully maintaining these corridors
   in safe, operational condition requires strategies that address
   individual hazard classes and manage associated risks. Natural and
   constructed slopes along transportation corridors represent one such
   category of hazard; typical risk management strategies involve
   quantitative measurements and qualitative evaluations of their present
   condition and the hazards that they pose to infrastructure, people, and
   shipments along the route. At some sites, traditional field-based
   observations are supplemented by high-resolution remotely acquired
   three-dimensional (3-D) imaging data of the ground surface, generated
   from various sensors and platforms, including terrestrial lidar and
   photogrammetry, airborne lidar, and oblique aerial photogrammetry. The
   collection, processing, and implementation of 3-D data collection and
   analysis into a slope management system are complex and frequently
   result in poorly collected, poorly understood, and underused data.
   Furthermore, the intricacies of the applications and limitations of
   different technologies generally are well understood only by
   specialists. As a result, the industry is reluctant to implement these
   technologies in active slope management systems. Practical procedures
   for remote data collection are illustrated, and the applications and
   limitations of the previously mentioned technologies are explained. The
   current capabilities of these technologies are presented; because the
   field is advancing rapidly, innovation and development soon will enhance
   the applicability of these technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Necessary and sufficient conditions for choice functions to be rational
   have been intensively studied in the past. However, in these attempts, a
   choice function is completely specified. That is, given any subset of
   options, called an issue, the best option over that issue is always
   known, whilst in real-world scenarios, it is very often that only a few
   choices are known instead of all. In this paper, we study partial choice
   functions and investigate necessary and sufficient rationality
   conditions for situations where only a few choices are known. We prove
   that our necessary and sufficient condition for partial choice functions
   boils down to the necessary and sufficient conditions for complete
   choice functions proposed in the literature. Choice functions have been
   instrumental in belief revision theory. That is, in most approaches to
   belief revision, the problem studied can simply be described as the
   choice of possible worlds compatible with the input information, given
   an agent's prior belief state. The main effort has been to devise
   strategies in order to infer the agents revised belief state. Our study
   considers the converse problem: given a collection of input information
   items and their corresponding revision results (as provided by an
   agent), does there exist a rational revision operation used by the agent
   and a consistent belief state that may explain the observed results?}},

Abstract = {{Composites of linear-low density polyethylene (LLDPE) with multi-walled
   carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and thermally reduced 2raphene (TRGO) were
   produced by melt compounding. The composites were compatibilized by
   grafting aromatic pyridine groups onto the LLDPE backbone. The aromatic
   moieties established non-covalent pi-pi interactions with the carbon
   nanostructures, thus allowing for efficient dispersion, without
   compromizing their electrical properties. By using identical matrices,
   it was possible to investigate the effects of filler geometry on the
   electrical, mechanical and theological properties of the composites. The
   1-D nature and smaller surface area of the MWCNT facilitated their
   dispersion within the polymer matrix, whereas the graphene agglomerates
   appeared to breakup through an erosion mechanism. The resulting mixture
   of aggregates and individual graphene platelets favored lower electrical
   and rheological percolation thresholds. However the maximum electrical
   conductivity achieved in the TRGO/LLDPE was lower by about an order of
   magnitude compared to the MWCNT/LLDPE composites, probably due to
   residual oxygen in the graphene's structure. TRGO based composites
   presented higher moduli at the same filler loadings, while elongations
   at break were comparable. All composites exhibited time-dependent
   rheological properties, indicative of their tendency to aggregate. A
   more pronounced increase in viscoelastic properties was noted in the
   composites containing TRGO, presumably due to the higher surface area of
   the graphene platelets, and the presence of larger aggregates.}},

Abstract = {{High density polyethylene (HDPE)/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)
   composites containing 4 wt\% MWCNTs were prepared by melt mixing
   followed by compression moulding into sheet. Compression moulded sheets
   were heated to just below the melting temperature and biaxially
   stretched at ratios (SRs) of 2, 2.5 and 3.0. The effect of stretching on
   the thermal and mechanical properties of the sheet was studied by
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and tensile testing. DSC results
   show that the crystallinity of all the stretched samples increases by
   approximately 13\% due to strain induced crystallization. The melting
   temperature of the biaxially stretched samples increases only slightly
   while crystallization temperature is not affected. Tensile test results
   indicate that at a SR of 2.5 the elastic modulus of the stretched
   composites increases by 17.6\% relative to the virgin HDPE, but the
   breaking strength decreases by 33\%. While the elastic modulus and
   breaking strength of the HDPE/MWCNT samples continue to increase as SR
   increases they drop off after a SR of 2.5 for the virgin HDPE. This is
   probably due to the constraining influence of the nanotubes preventing
   the relaxation of polymer chains caused by adiabatic heating at high
   SRs. The addition of MWCNTs results in significant strain hardening
   during deformation. While this will lead to increased energy requirement
   in forming it will also result in a more stable process and the ability
   to produce deep draw containers with more uniform wall thickness.}},

Abstract = {{High density polyethylene (HDPE)/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)
   nanocomposites were prepared by melt mixing using twin-screw extrusion.
   The extruded pellets were compression moulded at 200 degrees C for 5min
   followed by cooling at different cooling rates (20 degrees C/min and 300
   degrees C/min respectively) to produce sheets for characterization.
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows that the MWCNTs are uniformly
   dispersed in the HDPE. At 4 wt\% addition of MWCNTs composite modulus
   increased by over 110\% compared with the unfilled HDPE (regardless of
   the cooling rate). The yield strength of both unfilled and filled HDPE
   decreased after rapid cooling by about 10\% due to a lower crystallinity
   and imperfect crystallites. The electrical percolation threshold of
   composites, irrespective of the cooling rate, is between a MWCNT
   concentration of 1 similar to 2 wt\%. interestingly, the electrical
   resistivity of the rapidly cooled composite with 2 wt\% MWCNTs is lower
   than that of the slowly cooled composites with the same MWCNT loading.
   This may be due to the lower crystallinity and smaller crystallites
   facilitating the formation of conductive pathways. This result may have
   significant implications for both process control and the tailoring of
   electrical conductivity in the manufacture of conductive HDPE/MWCNT
   nanocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical study of mixed natural and forced convective flow over a
   thin vertical flat plate which has a uniform surface heat flux has been
   undertaken. Attention has been restricted to the case where the buoyancy
   forces act in the opposite direction to the forced flow, i.e., to
   opposing mixed-convective flow. Laminar, transitional, and turbulent
   flow situations have been considered and the development of unsteady
   flow has been allowed for. The forced flow has been assumed to be steady
   and the Boussinesq approach has been used. The solution has been
   obtained by numerically solving the governing equations using the
   commercial CFD solver, ANSYS FLUENT (c). The k-epsilon turbulence model
   with the full effect of buoyancy forces accounted for and with standard
   wall functions has been used in obtaining the solutions. The
   heat-transfer rate from the surface of the plate has been expressed in
   terms of the mean Nusselt number based on the overall plate length and
   the difference between the overall mean plate temperature and the
   undisturbed fluid temperature. This Nusselt number depends on the values
   of the heat flux Rayleigh number based on the plate length, the Reynolds
   number based on the plate length, and the Prandtl number. Results have
   been obtained for a Prandtl number of 0.74, i.e., essentially for the
   value for air. The conditions under which the flow can be assumed to be
   purely forced convective and under which the flow can be assumed to be
   purely natural convective, in particular, have been investigated.}},

Abstract = {{The control of cracking due to shrinkage in reinforced concrete floor
   slabs has traditionally been achieved through various approaches
   including the use of closure strips. A closure strip is a gap that
   divides a concrete floor slab into smaller areas during the pouring of
   the concrete. This, in theory, allows each smaller area to undergo
   initial shrinkage of the concrete as an isolated region in an effort to
   control cracking and displacements of the whole structure. The closure
   strip is then filled with concrete at a later time creating a continuous
   floor slab. Because the closure strip has to be constructed separately
   at a later date, it adds to the overall cost and schedule of the
   project. The effectiveness of these strips in controlling shrinkage and
   the duration over which the majority of the shrinkage cracks actually
   occur is not clearly understood. To the knowledge of the authors, there
   has not been enough field data gathered regarding the behavior of
   closure strips. In this monitoring program, field measurements were
   obtained from closure strips on multiple floors of a reinforced concrete
   building during the construction process using wireless sensors.
   Displacement readings of the closure strips were taken every 10 minutes
   over a period of 6 days in order to capture initial effects of concrete
   shrinkage on the width of the closure strip. Temperature readings were
   also taken within the strips in order to perform thermal compensation on
   the displacement measurements. The field monitoring results from one of
   the building's three monitored floors are presented and discussed. The
   conclusions drawn from the study and the reliability of the results are
   discussed and suggestions for future research are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Much of North America's railroad infrastructure was constructed in the
   late 19th and early 20th century. A single unplanned bridge closure can
   cost millions of dollars, depending on the length of closure.
   Determining if and when a bridge will need to be retrofitted or replaced
   is of the upmost importance for railroad companies.
   As a result there is a need for monitoring technologies that can provide
   accurate quantitative data that can be used in the assessment of these
   structures. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is a new technology that
   does not require a fixed point of reference or contact with the
   structure. DIC can be used to track the movements of regions of interest
   through a series of images. High speed digital cameras can be used to
   capture bridge deformations as a train passes over them. Thus DIC can be
   used as a non-contact sensor to monitor bridge displacements,
   vibrations, and strains without disruption to the regular rail traffic.
   A field trial was conducted to assess the accuracy of DIC for monitoring
   rail bridges. The DIC measurements were compared to conventional
   monitoring technologies and the results were shown to be in good
   agreement. DIC was capable of measuring the variations in bridge
   displacements and frequency due to dynamic train loading. A
   finite-element model of the bridge was created and updated using the
   field DIC measurements.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL METHODS IN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Raman spectroscopy and nonisothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
   measurements have been reported for different rank coals (lignite,
   bituminous coal, and anthracite) and the relationship between the
   measurements was examined. It was found that the Raman spectra
   parameters can be used to characterize structure changes in the
   different rank coals, such as the band area ratios based on the
   curve-fitted results. Higher ranked coal was found to have higher values
   of I-GR/I-All and I(G+ GR)/I-All but lower values of I-D /I(G+GR),
   I-DL/I(G+GR), I ((S+SL))/.I(G+GR), and I(GL+GL')/I(G+GR). The oxidation
   properties of the coal samples were characterized by the reactivity
   indexes T-ig, T-20\%,T- and T-max from TGA data which were found to
   correlate well with the band area ratios of I-GR/I-All,I(G+GR)/I-All,
   and I(S+SL)/I(G+GR). Based on these correlations, the Raman band area
   ratios were found to correlate with the oxidation activity of coal
   providing additional structural information which can be used to
   understand the changes in the TGA measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and their predictions are widely used
   by the enterprises for informed decision making. Nevertheless, a very
   important factor, which is generally overlooked, is that the top level
   strategic KPIs are actually driven by the operational level business
   processes. These two domains are, however, mostly segregated and
   analysed in silos with different Business Intelligence solutions. In
   this paper, we are proposing an approach for advanced Business
   Simulations, which converges the two domains by utilising process
   execution \& business data, and concepts from Business Dynamics (BD) and
   Business Ontologies, to promote better system understanding and detailed
   KPI predictions. Our approach incorporates the automated creation of
   Causal Loop Diagrams, thus empowering the analyst to critically examine
   the complex dependencies hidden in the massive amounts of available
   enterprise data. We have further evaluated our proposed approach in the
   context of a retail use-case that involved verification of the
   automatically generated causal models by a domain expert.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous liquid mixtures, in particular, those involving amphiphilic
   species, play an important role in many physical, chemical and
   biological processes. Of particular interest are alcohol/water mixtures;
   however, the structural dynamics of such systems are still not fully
   understood. Herein, a combination of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy
   (THz-TDS) and NMR relaxation time analysis has been applied to
   investigate 2-propanol/water mixtures across the entire composition
   range; while neutron diffraction studies have been carried out at two
   specific concentrations. Excellent agreement is seen between the
   techniques with a maximum in both the relative absorption coefficient
   and the activation energy to molecular motion occurring at similar to 90
   mol\% H2O. Furthermore, this is the same value at which well-established
   excess thermodynamic functions exhibit a maximum/minimum. Additionally,
   both neutron diffraction and THz-TDS have been used to provide estimates
   of the size of the hydration shell around 2-propanol in solution. Both
   methods determine that between 4 and 5 H2O molecules per 2-propanol are
   found in the 2-propanol/water clusters at 90 mol\% H2O. Based on the
   acquired data, a description of the structure of 2-propanol/water across
   the composition range is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Learning Bayesian networks with bounded tree-width has attracted much
   attention recently, because low tree-width allows exact inference to be
   performed efficiently. Some existing methods {[}12,14] tackle the
   problem by using k-trees to learn the optimal Bayesian network with
   tree-width up to k. In this paper, we propose a sampling method to
   efficiently find representative k-trees by introducing an Informative
   score function to characterize the quality of a k-tree. The proposed
   algorithm can efficiently learn a Bayesian network with tree-width at
   most k. Experiment results indicate that our approach is comparable with
   exact methods, but is much more computationally efficient.}},

   in a solid oxide cell}},
Journal = {{FARADAY DISCUSSIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{182}},
Pages = {{97-111}},
Abstract = {{Co-electrolysis of carbon dioxide and steam has been shown to be an
   efficient way to produce syngas, however further optimisation requires
   detailed understanding of the complex reactions, transport processes and
   degradation mechanisms occurring in the solid oxide cell (SOC) during
   operation. Whilst electrochemical measurements are currently conducted
   in situ, many analytical techniques can only be used ex situ and may
   even be destructive to the cell (e.g. SEM imaging of the
   microstructure). In order to fully understand and characterise
   co-electrolysis, in situ monitoring of the reactants, products and SOC
   is necessary. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform
   Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) is ideal for in situ monitoring of co-electrolysis
   as both gaseous and adsorbed CO and CO2 species can be detected, however
   it has previously not been used for this purpose. The challenges of
   designing an experimental rig which allows optical access alongside
   electrochemical measurements at high temperature and operates in a dual
   atmosphere are discussed. The rig developed has thus far been used for
   symmetric cell testing at temperatures from 450 degrees C to 600 degrees
   C. Under a CO atmosphere, significant changes in spectra were observed
   even over a simple Au|10Sc1CeSZ|Au SOC. The changes relate to a
   combination of CO oxidation, the water gas shift reaction, carbonate
   formation and decomposition processes, with the dominant process being
   both potential and temperature dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Glibenclamide (GLIB), an oral antidiabetic medication of the
   sulphonylurea drug family, was stoichiometrically imprinted using
   tetrabutylammonium methacrylate as the functional monomer, for the first
   time in molecular imprinting, and utilising the sulphonylurea affinity
   for carboxylate anions. Solution association between the drug and the
   novel functional monomer was studied by H-1-NMR titrations, whereby
   evidence of sulphonylurea deprotonation followed by the formation of
   ``narcissistic'' GLIB dimers was found when tested in CDCl3, while an
   affinity constant in excess of 10(5) L mol(-1) was measured in
   DMSO-d(6). Detailed analysis of GLIB binding on the subsequently
   prepared imprinted and non-imprinted polymers confirmed the deactivation
   of binding sites by exchange of a proton between GLIB and methacrylate,
   followed by extraction of the tetrabutylammonium counterion from the
   polymer matrix, resulting in overall reduced binding capacities and
   affinities by the imprinted material under equilibrium conditions. An
   optimised MI-SPE protocol, which included a binding site re-activation
   step, was developed for the extraction of GLIB from blood serum, whereby
   recoveries of up to 92.4\% were obtained with an exceptional sample
   cleanup.}},

Abstract = {{The addition of carbon dioxide to four superbase ionic liquids,
   {[}P-3333]{[}Benzim], {[}P-3333]{[}124Triz], {[}P-3333]{[}123Triz] and
   {[}P-3333]{[}Bentriz] was studied using a molecular DFT approach
   involving anions alone and individual ion pairs. Intermolecular bonding
   within the individual ion pairs is characterised by a number of weak
   hydrogen bonds, with the superbase anion geometricay arranged so as to
   maximize interactions between the heterocyclic N atoms and the cation.
   The pairing energies show no correlation to the observed CO2 adsorption
   capacity. Addition of CO2 to the anion alone clearly resulted in the
   formation of a covalenty-bound carbamate function with the strength of
   binding correlated to experimental capacity. In the ion pair however the
   cation significanty afters the nature of the bonding such that the
   overall cohesive energy is reduced. Formation of a strong carbamate
   function occurs at the expense of weakening the interaction between
   anion and cation. In the more weakly absorbing ion pairs which contain
   {[}123Triz](-) and {[}Bentriz], the carbamate-functionalised systems are
   very dose in energy to adducts in which CO2 is more weakly bound,
   suggesting an equilibrium between the chemi- and physisorbed CO2.}},

Abstract = {{Die drool is an operational problem associated with polymer extrusion.
   Extrudate collects outside of the die, necessitating periodic
   disruptions for cleaning. There exists some debate as to the mechanism
   that produces die drool: stress induced fractionation or thermal
   degradation. This paper examines the latter. In cohesive failure, a slip
   discontinuity develops in the velocity profile, where heat is generated
   by friction. This slip heating can contribute to resin degradation,
   resulting in lower molecular weight fragments in the die drool. This
   paper examines the kinetics of this degradation, its influence on die
   drool rates, and on the resulting polymer concentration profiles in the
   drool layer and in the bulk.}},

Title = {{Ultimate Strength Testing of Two Deteriorated Metal Culverts Repaired
   with Spray-On Cementitious Liners}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2522}},
Pages = {{139-147}},
Abstract = {{Two deteriorated corrugated steel pipelines were buried in the west test
   pit at Queen's University and then repaired with spray-on cementitious
   liners with target liner thicknesses of 3 in. (76 mm) and 2 in. (51 mm),
   respectively. After service load testing described elsewhere, tandem
   axle loading was applied at the ground surface over each of the
   rehabilitated culverts; forces up to and beyond fully factored loads
   were used that brought the culverts to their ultimate limit states,
   evident by the development of both longitudinal cracks along the crown
   and invert of each structure, as well as circumferential (ring)
   fractures at various locations. The repaired pipes were then exhumed and
   measurements made to characterize the actual (as opposed to nominal)
   liner thicknesses achieved by the repairs. The level of composite
   interaction between the liners and steel pipes was also examined.
   Ultimate load testing at cover depth of 4 ft (1.2 m) induced the first
   signs of liner cracking at tandem loads of 180 kips (800 kN) and 145
   kips (650 kN) for Pipelines 1 and 2, respectively. Circumferential
   cracks were observed under the wheel pairs and near the midpoint of the
   axle. Mean liner thicknesses were found to be 2.5 in. (64 mm) for
   Pipeline 1 (84\% of the target thickness) and 1.7 in. (44 mm) for
   Pipeline 2 (87\% of the target). Higher thicknesses were observed at the
   pipe crowns, and lower thicknesses were seen at the invert. Assessment
   of composite interaction during flexure of the lined steel pipes
   indicated that although full interaction was observed at some locations,
   only partial interaction occurred at other positions. Therefore, liner
   design should not rely on an assumption of a bond between the two
   components.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of adequate information on glass fibre reinforced polymer
   (GFRP) material characteristics at high temperatures lowers the accuracy
   of analytical and design models developed to predict the behaviour of
   GFRP reinforced concrete members. This paper presents experimental
   results of a series of tensile tests on GFRP bars at elevated
   temperatures. These results are a part of ongoing comprehensive material
   tests on various GFRP products from different manufacturers. Up until
   now, material tests conducted on GFRP bars have been limited to bars of
   up to 12 mm in diameter. To represent real fire situations in typical
   FRP reinforced concrete structures, two novel features have been
   implemented in the experimental program: large and commonly used GFRP
   reinforcements (\#5 with nominal diameter of 16 mm), and tensile tests
   under transient temperature. Temperature ranges from 25 to 400 degrees C
   have been considered for steady state temperature tests. In transient
   condition tests, specimens are loaded before heat exposure. For the
   transient temperature tests, bars loaded to service levels (75 kN)
   failed at temperatures above 500 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Surface restructure for triangulation discrete data was the
   preconditions for discrete data to be widely applied in modern

   restructure for discrete data based on parallel undirected graph. This
   method played the characteristics of multi-core environment, used
   inherent storage relation between triangulation data and the independent
   character of traversal for undirected graph. In this method, build the
   relation model between triangles based on undirected graph structure,
   optimize the method for processing concurrent access, and improve the
   efficiency of calculation. The result of examples showed that the method
   would have concurrent access a better performance than the existing

Abstract = {{The dehumidifier is one of the main components in open-cycle liquid
   desiccant air-conditioning systems. An experimental study was carried
   out to evaluate the performance of a solar thermally driven, low-flow,
   falling-film, internally-cooled parallelplate liquid desiccant
   air-conditioner in Kingston, Ontario at Queen's University. A solution
   of LiC1 and water was used as the desiccant. Unlike high-flow devices,
   the low-flow of desiccant solution flowing across the unit's
   dehumidifier and regenerator sections produces large variations in
   solution concentration. In this study, a series of tests were undertaken
   to evaluate the performance of the dehumidifier section of the unit.
   Results presented are based on mass flow and energy transport
   measurements that allowed the moisture transport rate between the air
   and liquid desiccant solution to be determined. Based on these results,
   a relationship between the desiccant concentration and the rate of
   dehumidification rate was found and the effect of inlet-air humidity on
   the dehumidification effectiveness identified. The moisture removal rate
   of the system was found to range from 1.1 g/s to 3.5 g/s under the
   conditions evaluated. These result corresponded to an average
   dehumidification effectiveness of 0.55. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recently, digital stereo microscopes have been becoming increasingly
   popular in fields such as biomedicine and biotechnology. As such, being
   able to precisely match left/right feature pairs is critical, which is
   an important step in stereo matching. We hereby propose a dynamic
   interpolation method that combines two dimensional calibration and depth
   information to achieve stereo matching. In this experiment, we obtained
   the original scale-invariant feature transform feature point pairs and
   selected a pair of matching units. Based on the selected pair of
   matching elements and interpolated feature points shown in the left view
   of stereo microscope image, the dynamically interpolated feature points
   in the right view were developed to perform stereo measurements. The
   experimental results revealed that the proposed method can realize
   stereo microscopic measurements; results with high reliability can be
   achieved with a large quantity of matching elements.}},

Abstract = {{In exploration of low-cost electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel
   cells (DMFCs), Pt modified tungsten carbide (WC) materials are found to
   be great potential candidates for decreasing Pt usage whilst exhibiting
   satisfactory reactivity. In this work, the mechanisms, onset potentials
   and activity for electrooxidation of methanol were studied on a series
   of Pt-modified WC catalysts where the bare W-terminated WC(0001)
   substrate was employed. In the surface energy calculations of a series
   of Pt-modified WC models, we found that the feasible structures are
   mono-and bi-layer Pt-modified WCs. The tri-layer Pt-modified WC model is
   not thermodynamically stable where the top layer Pt atoms tend to
   accumulate and form particles or clusters rather than being dispersed as
   a layer. We further calculated the mechanisms of methanol oxidation on
   the feasible models via methanol dehydrogenation to CO involving C-H and
   O-H bonds dissociating subsequently, and further CO oxidation with the
   C-O bond association. The onset potentials for the oxidation reactions
   over the Pt-modified WC catalysts were determined thermodynamically by
   water dissociation to surface OH{*} species. The activities of these
   Pt-modified WC catalysts were estimated from the calculated kinetic
   data. It has been found that the bi-layer Pt-modified WC catalysts may
   provide a good reactivity and an onset oxidation potential comparable to
   pure Pt and serve as promising electrocatalysts for DMFCs with a
   significant decrease in Pt usage.}},

   statistical model to predict spontaneous combustion was developed by
   multi-nonlinear-regression analyses. The correlation coefficients were

Abstract = {{The UK's transport infrastructure is one of the most heavily used in the
   world. The performance of these networks is critically dependent on the
   performance of cutting and embankment slopes which make up 20B pound of
   the 60B pound asset value of major highway infrastructure alone. The
   rail network in particular is also one of the oldest in the world: many
   of these slopes are suffering high incidents of instability (increasing
   with time). This paper describes the development of a fundamental
   understanding of earthwork material and system behaviour, through the
   systematic integration of research across a range of spatial and
   temporal scales. Spatially these range from microscopic studies of soil
   fabric, through elemental materials behaviour to whole slope modelling
   and monitoring and scaling up to transport networks. Temporally,
   historical and current weather event sequences are being used to
   understand and model soil deterioration processes, and climate change
   scenarios to examine their potential effects on slope performance in
   futures up to and including the 2080s. The outputs of this research are
   being mapped onto the different spatial and temporal scales of
   infrastructure slope asset management to inform the design of new slopes
   through to changing the way in which investment is made into aging
   assets. The aim ultimately is to help create a more reliable, cost
   effective, safer and more resilient transport system.}},

Abstract = {{The tragic consequences of the March 2014 Oso landslide in Washington,
   USA were particularly high due to the mobility of the landslide debris.
   Confusingly, a landslide occurred at that exact same location a number
   of years earlier, but simply slumped into the river at the toe of the
   slope. Why did these two events differ so drastically in their mobility?
   Considerable questions remain regarding the conditions required to
   generate flow failures in loose soils. Geotechnical centrifuge testing,
   in combination with high-speed cameras and advanced image analysis has
   now provided the landslides research community with a powerful new tool
   to experimentally investigate the complex mechanics leading to high
   mobility landslides. This paper highlights recent advances in our
   understanding of the process of static liquefaction in loose granular
   soil slopes achieved through observations of highly-instrumented
   physical models. In particular, the paper summarises experimental
   results aimed to identify the point of initiation of the chain-reaction
   required to trigger liquefaction flow failures, to assess the effect of
   slope inclination on the likelihood of a flowslide being triggered, and
   to quantify the effect of antecedent groundwater levels on the distal
   reach of landslide debris with the objective of beginning to explain why
   neighbouring slopes can exhibit such a wide variation in landslide
   travel distance upon rainfall-triggering.}},

Abstract = {{The current theory of catalyst activity in heterogeneous catalysis is
   mainly obtained from the study of catalysts with mono-phases, while most
   catalysts in real systems consist of multi-phases, the understanding of
   which is far short of chemists' expectation. Density functional theory
   (DFT) and micro-kinetics simulations are used to investigate the
   activities of six mono-phase and nine bi-phase catalysts, using CO
   hydrogenation that is arguably the most typical reaction in
   heterogeneous catalysis. Excellent activities that are beyond the
   activity peak of traditional mono-phase volcano curves are found on some
   bi-phase surfaces. By analyzing these results, a new framework to
   understand the unexpected activities of bi-phase surfaces is proposed.
   Based on the framework, several principles for the design of multiphase
   catalysts are suggested. The theoretical framework extends the
   traditional catalysis theory to understand more complex systems.}},

Pages = {{1063-1078}},
Abstract = {{Good performance characterizes project success and value for money.
   However, performance problems are not uncommon in project management.
   Incentivization is generally recognized as a strategy of addressing
   performance problems. This chapter aims to explore incentive mechanisms
   and their impact on project performance. It is mainly based on the use
   of incentives in construction and engineering projects. The same
   principles apply to project management in other industry sectors.
   Incentivization can be used in such performance areas as time, cost,
   quality, safety and environment. A client has different ways of
   incentivizing his contractor's performance, e.g. (1) a single incentive
   or multiple incentives; and (2) incentives or disincentives or a
   combination of both. The establishment of incentive mechanisms proves to
   have a significant potential for relationship development, process
   enhancement and performance improvement. In order to ensure the success
   of incentive mechanisms, both contractors and clients need to make extra
   efforts. As a result, a link is developed among incentive mechanisms,
   project management system and project performance.}},

Abstract = {{Reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) of 2-hydroxyethyl

Abstract = {{Research conducted during the course of the Canadian Railway Ground
   Hazard Research Program has focused on applying new remote sensing
   techniques to the assessment of ground hazards. The work undertaken at
   the White Canyon, British Columbia, is reported in this paper include
   data on this actively moving slope that has been collected using
   terrestrial LiDAR scans and Gigapan photography. Analysis of the LiDAR
   data has permitted identification of the location, volume and mobility
   of rocks down the slope. The smallest volume of rock movement detected
   is far smaller than that observable by the human eye when observing the
   changes in the slope. Analysis of the Gigapan panoramas permits
   evaluation of the size of particles moving down slope. Particles as
   small as cobble sized rocks can be tracked in some of the slower moving,
   but active talus slopes. Ongoing data collection will provide a longer
   term rock slope observation data base, from which it should be possible
   to identify the conditioning and triggering events leading to rockfall
   or debris movement, and will permit comparison between data sets
   collected using these two remote sensing techniques.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{32}},
Pages = {{20830-20839}},
Abstract = {{Relative strengths of surface interaction for individual carbon atoms in
   acyclic and cyclic hydrocarbons adsorbed on alumina surfaces are
   determined using chemically resolved C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) T-1 relaxation times. The ratio of relaxation times for the
   adsorbed atoms T-1,T-ads to the bulk liquid relaxation time T-1,T-bulk
   provides an indication of the mobility of the atom. Hence a low
   T-1,T-ads/T-1,T-bulk ratio indicates a stronger surface interaction. The
   carbon atoms associated with unsaturated bonds in the molecules are seen
   to exhibit a larger reduction in T-1 on adsorption relative to the
   aliphatic carbons, consistent with adsorption occurring through the
   carbon-carbon multiple bonds. The relaxation data are interpreted in
   terms of proximity of individual carbon atoms to the alumina surface and
   adsorption conformations are inferred. Furthermore, variations of
   interaction strength and molecular configuration have been explored as a
   function of adsorbate coverage, temperature, surface pre-treatment, and
   in the presence of co-adsorbates. This relaxation time analysis is
   appropriate for studying the behaviour of hydrocarbons adsorbed on a
   wide range of catalyst support and supported-metal catalyst surfaces,
   and offers the potential to explore such systems under realistic
   operating conditions when multiple chemical components are present at
   the surface.}},

Abstract = {{Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) copolymers have been extensively
   used in cancer research. PLGA can be chemically engineered for
   conjugation or encapsulation of drugs in a particle formulation. We
   reported that oseltamivir phosphate (OP) treatment of human pancreatic
   tumor-bearing mice disrupted the tumor vasculature with daily
   injections. Here, the controlled release of OP from a biodegradable PLGA
   cylinder (PLGA-OP) implanted at tumor site was investigated for its role
   in limiting tumor neovascularization, growth, and metastasis. PLGA-OP
   cylinders over 30 days in vitro indicated 20\%-25\% release profiles
   within 48 hours followed by a continuous metronomic low dose release of
   30\%-50\% OP for an additional 16 days. All OP was released by day 30.
   Surgically implanted PLGA-OP containing 20 mg OP and blank PLGA
   cylinders at the tumor site of heterotopic xenografts of human
   pancreatic PANC1 tumors in RAGxC gamma double mutant mice impeded tumor
   neovascularization, growth rate, and spread to the liver and lungs
   compared with the untreated cohort. Xenograft tumors from PLGA and
   PLGA-OP-treated cohorts expressed significant higher levels of human
   E-cadherin with concomitant reduced N-cadherin and host CD31(+)
   endothelial cells compared with the untreated cohort. These results
   clearly indicate that OP delivered from PLGA cylinders surgically
   implanted at the site of the solid tumor show promise as an effective
   treatment therapy for cancer.}},

Title = {{Bleaching systems in domestic laundry detergents: a review}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{80}},
Pages = {{65365-65384}},
Abstract = {{Laundry detergent is an indispensable commodity which is used by
   consumers worldwide. The global market for laundry detergents is in the
   region of \$60.9 billion (2012, based on retail value), of which \$11.7
   billion comes from Western Europe. Non-chlorine bleach was incorporated
   in a detergent for the first time just over a century ago and it remains
   an important component of detergents, particularly powder detergents.
   Detergent development is mainly carried out in industrial laboratories
   and, as a result, relatively few papers have been published in this
   area. The aim of this review is to compile this information, along with
   that contained in the patent literature and other sources, to give
   future researchers a more comprehensive overview of this important
   topic. Specifically, oxygen-based bleaching systems have been examined,
   with focus on their development through the years. Current research
   targets as described by the available literature are also discussed,
   such as the development of better bleaching species, alternative bleach
   systems, and steps to incorporate a bleaching system in liquid laundry
   detergents (a key development which continues to elude researchers).}},

Title = {{Can the scaling behavior of electric conductivity be used to probe the
   self-organizational changes in solution with respect to the ionic liquid
   structure? The case of {[}C8MIM]{[}NTf2]}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Abstract = {{Electrical conductivity of the supercooled ionic liquid
   {[}C8MIM]{[}NTf2], determined as a function of temperature and pressure,
   highlights strong differences in its ionic transport behavior between
   low and high temperature regions. To date, the crossover effect which is
   very well known for low molecular van der Waals liquids has been rarely
   described for classical ionic liquids. This finding highlights that the
   thermal fluctuations could be dominant mechanisms driving the dramatic
   slowing down of ion motions near T-g. An alternative way to analyze
   separately low and high temperature dc-conductivity data using a density
   scaling approach was then proposed. Based on which a common value of the
   scaling exponent gamma = 2.4 was obtained, indicating that the applied
   density scaling is insensitive to the crossover effect. By comparing the
   scaling exponent g reported herein along with literature data for other
   ionic liquids, it appears that g decreases by increasing the alkyl chain
   length on the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium-based ionic liquids. This
   observation may be related to changes in the interaction between ions in
   solution driven by an increase in the van der Waals type interaction by
   increasing the alkyl chain length on the cation. This effect may be
   related to changes in the ionic liquid nanostructural organization with
   the alkyl chain length on the cation as previously reported in the
   literature based on molecular dynamic simulations. In other words, the
   calculated scaling exponent g may be then used as a key parameter to
   probe the interaction and/or self-organizational changes in solution
   with respect to the ionic liquid structure.}},

Title = {{Effects of Surface Inclination on the Vertical Loading Rates and Landing
   Pattern during the First Attempt of Barefoot Running in Habitual Shod
   Runners}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Barefoot running has been proposed to reduce vertical loading rates,
   which is a risk factor of running injuries. Most of the previous studies
   evaluated runners on level surfaces. This study examined the effect of
   surface inclination on vertical loading rates and landing pattern during
   the first attempt of barefoot running among habitual shod runners.
   Twenty habitual shod runners were asked to run on treadmill at 8.0 km/h
   at three inclination angles (0 degrees; +10 degrees; -10 degrees) with
   and without their usual running shoes. Vertical average rate (VALR) and
   instantaneous loading rate (VILR) were obtained by established methods.
   Landing pattern was decided using highspeed camera. VALR and VILR in
   shod condition were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in declined than in
   level or inclined treadmill running, but not in barefoot condition (p >
   0.382). There was no difference (p > 0.413) in the landing pattern among
   all surface inclinations. Only one runner demonstrated complete
   transition to non-heel strike landing in all slope conditions. Reducing
   heel strike ratio in barefoot running did not ensure a decrease in
   loading rates (p > 0.15). Conversely, non-heel strike landing,
   regardless of footwear condition, would result in a softer landing (p <
   0.011).}},

Title = {{Expanded graphite/phenolic resin-based carbon composite adsorbents for
   post-combustion CO2 capture}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{77}},
Pages = {{62604-62610}},
Abstract = {{Porous carbon composite adsorbents were prepared from a commercial
   phenolic resin mixed with a small proportion of thermally expanded
   graphite (EG) followed by carbonization and physical activation with
   CO2. The addition of EG dramatically hastens the CO2 activation and
   results in remarkably enhanced microporosity development in the EG
   composite compared to the activated phenolic resin alone. The resultant
   EG composite adsorbents exhibit high CO2 adsorption capacities at 298 K
   and excellent CO2/N-2 adsorption selectivity. In particular, the EG
   composite shows superior CO2 uptake at low CO2 pressures (47 mg g(-1) at
   298 K and 0.15 bar), which is more important to actual flue gas
   applications in post-combustion capture (PCC). Moreover, EG composite
   adsorbents are especially attractive as the EG component is inexpensive,
   available in very large amounts and easy to handle and is only required
   at a low addition level of around 2 wt\%. The rapid CO2 activation and
   the low burn-off for excellent CO2 adsorption performance at low
   pressures greatly reduce the energy required to produce the adsorbent
   and the waste generated in activation. This further enhances the cost
   and environmental advantages of physically activated EG composites over
   those PCC adsorbents prepared by chemical activation and
   functionalization of porous carbons. Hence, due to its superior CO2
   adsorption properties and favourable fabrication process, the newly
   developed EG carbon composite adsorbent holds great promise for
   large-scale deployment and commercial applications to PCC.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of elevated temperatures, particularly between 95 and 115
   degrees C as encountered in some geoenvironmental applications, on the
   physical and mechanical properties of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)
   geomembranes (GMBs) is examined. Four commercially available HDPE GMBs
   were incubated in air at temperatures >= 85 degrees C. Investigation of
   the thermograms by differential scanning calorimetry showed a
   significant change in the polymer morphology with an increase of the
   incubation temperature and duration, especially at 105 and 115 degrees
   C. The morphological changes due to annealing involve thickening of the
   lamella crystals of the polymer and a change in the tie molecules
   joining the lamella crystals. The effect of annealing was most evident
   in the stress crack resistance of the GMB incubated at 105 and 115
   degrees C prior to polymer degradation. In particular, an increase in
   stress crack resistance due to annealing could mask the effects of
   polymer degradation at temperatures above 95 degrees C. Changes in
   morphology did not affect melt index whose changes were largely
   attributed to polymer degradation.}},

   review of this technology. This contribution reviews microcapsule
   production by interfacial polymerisation from the chemical,

Abstract = {{The dislocation structure in dry-steam pipe steel has been determined by

   were taken in a conventional theta-2 theta powder diffractometer and in
   a special high resolution double crystal diffractometer dedicated for
   line profile analysis. The theta-2 theta powder diffractograms reveal
   narrower peaks in the low angle range than the peaks of the NIST
   SRM-660a LaB6 standard specimen. In the high angle range the peaks of
   the steel specimens are broader than the standard peaks indicating the
   presence of microstrain. Dislocation densities were evaluated in
   individual grains by using the convolutional multiple whole profile
   fitting procedure and were obtained to vary between 10(13) and 10(14)
   m(-2), decreasing towards the end of the service life of the tube. Data

Abstract = {{Within the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), the
   CONSORTIS project will design and fabricate a stand-off system for the
   detection of objects concealed on people. This system operating in the
   sub-millimetre wave part of the spectrum will scan people as they walk
   by the sensor. The aim of the project is to produce a system which has a
   high probability of detection, low false alarm rates, is non-invasive
   and respects privacy.
   The top level system design for CONSORTIS brings together both passive
   and active sensors and the simulation tools developed to evaluate the
   design are described. The passive system will operate in two or three
   bands between 100 and 600GHz and will be based on a cryogen free cooled
   focal plane array sensor whilst the active system will be a solid-state
   340GHz radar. This will maximize the probability of detection and reduce
   false alarms. A `systems engineering' approach was adopted with
   performance modeling being used to develop the system specifications. A
   modified version of OpenFx is used to model the passive system and
   SE-RAY-EM for the active system. Both of these tools are capable of
   rendering imagery which is electromagnetically correct and account for
   the properties of the sensor. Furthermore this imagery can be animated
   to give moving images similar to those observed in the real system.
   Targets can be embedded under clothing so that performance can be
   estimated. False alarms can be introduced in a similar way to understand
   if their signatures can be rejected.}},

Abstract = {{On-chip lysis is required in many lab-on-chip applications involving
   cell studies. In these applications, the complete disruption of the
   cellular membrane and a high lysis yield is essential. Here, we present
   a novel approach to lyse cells on-chip through the application of
   electric discharges from a corona handheld device. The method only
   requires a microfluidic chip and a low-cost corona device. We
   demonstrate the effective lysis of BHK and eGFP HCT 116 cells in the
   sub-second time range using an embedded microelectrode. We also show
   cell lysis of non-adherent K562 leukemia cells without the use of an
   electrode in the chip. Cell lysis has been assessed through the use of
   bright-field microscopy, high-speed imaging and cell-viability
   fluorescence probes. The experimental results show effective cell lysis
   without any bubble formation or significant heating. Due to the
   simplicity of both the components involved and the lysis procedure, this
   technique offers an inexpensive lysis option with the potential for
   integration into lab-on-a-chip devices.}},

Abstract = {{Energy efficiency presents enormous opportunities for industry -
   reducing costs, stimulating economic growth, increasing productivity,
   and offering a significant reduction in environmental impact.
   Unfortunately, many companies - especially SMEs (small and medium
   enterprises) - still shy away from the opportunities that are available
   to them from energy conservation, due to a lack of in-house expertise,
   inadequate resources, or positive reinforcement through industrial
   feedback on the use of such techniques. Energy consumption is often
   ignored, with many companies not tracking their consumption data or
   having a thorough understanding of their primary energy needs or
   prominent areas of inefficiency. By speaking directly with companies
   about energy efficiency and collecting hard data, case studies have been
   developed, successfully demonstrating the benefits of implementing
   various energy efficiency strategies and the need for better energy
   consumption monitoring to ensure these projects are achieving desired
   energy reduction results. These case studies will be discussed in this
   paper. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing demand for ultra-high speed precision machine tool
   spindles to create complex miniature devices and features, in consumer
   markets such as medical devices, electronics and communications. The key
   enabling drive technologies for spindle rotational speeds in the 100,000
   rpm range includes electric motors, both AC and DC powered, and air
   turbines. In particular for high speed micromachining, turbine spindles
   have advantages in terms of precision and cost. A widely considered
   drawback of pneumatic technology though is low energy efficiency, but to
   date there has been little in depth analysis of commercial/state-of-art
   turbo-spindle energy performance. This paper provides a holistic
   comparative analysis of electric motor and turbine powered spindle
   electrical power requirements, by including the power demand of
   supporting systems and infrastructure. The analysis indicates that at
   present the energy usage associated with turbine spindles is
   significantly higher than electric spindles. However, a number of
   technically feasible energy efficiency measures are identified for
   turbine spindles, which would make their energy performance comparable
   with electro-spindles. The analysis and results will contribute towards
   an overall life cycle assessment of high speed turbo-spindle technology,
   and provide impetus to further explore energy optimization approaches

Abstract = {{A high recovery of lithium from recycled lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is
   essential to ensure the growth and sustainability of the electrical
   vehicle market. Without recycling, lithium demand is predicted to
   outstrip supply in 2023. Current industrial processes are focused on
   recovering cobalt and other valuable metals because, given lithium's
   current low price, it is economically unfavorable to recover it. As part
   of our efforts to create a process where the recovery of lithium is
   economically viable we have analyzed the current industrial processes.
   We have determined that, when applied to recycling automotive LIBs, they
   are needlessly energy intensive and complicated. In these processes
   whole LIBs are incinerated, cryogenically cooled, or shredded under an
   inert atmosphere in order to make their cells safe to open. Instead of
   such extreme measures, LIBs can be disassembled by automated processes,
   which recovers valuable electronics for reuse, their cells can be
   discharged, which recovers residual energy, and then can be opened
   safely in air. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   (90\% capacity retention with a current density of 0.3 A g(-1) after 300

   target-induced fluorescence enhancements and input/output wavelengths.
   The handling of single targets takes up a major fraction of the review,
   but the extension to multiple targets is also illustrated. Conceptually
   new channels of investigation are opened up by the latter approach, e.g.
   `lab-on-a-molecule' systems and molecular keypad locks. The growing
   trends of theoretically-fortified design and intracellular application

   nanoplatelet composites}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{65}},
Pages = {{52395-52409}},
Abstract = {{Graphene, due to its outstanding properties, has become the topic of
   much research activity in recent years. Much of that work has been on a
   laboratory scale however, if we are to introduce graphene into real
   product applications it is necessary to examine how the material behaves
   under industrial processing conditions. In this paper the melt
   processing of polyamide 6/graphene nanoplatelet composites via twin
   screw extrusion is investigated and structure-property relationships are
   examined for mechanical and electrical properties. Graphene
   nanoplatelets (GNPs) with two aspect ratios (700 and 1000) were used in
   order to examine the influence of particle dimensions on composite
   properties. It was found that the introduction of GNPs had a nucleating
   effect on polyamide 6 (PA6) crystallization and substantially increased
   crystallinity by up to 120\% for a 20\% loading in PA6. A small increase
   in crystallinity was observed when extruder screw speed increased from
   50 rpm to 200 rpm which could be attributed to better dispersion and
   more nucleation sites for crystallization. A maximum enhancement of
   412\% in Young's modulus was achieved at 20 wt\% loading of GNPs. This
   is the highest reported enhancement in modulus achieved to date for a
   melt mixed thermoplastic/GNPs composite. A further result of importance
   here is that the modulus continued to increase as the loading of GNPs
   increased even at 20 wt\% loading and results are in excellent agreement
   with theoretical predictions for modulus enhancement. Electrical
   percolation was achieved between 10-15 wt\% loading for both aspect
   ratios of GNPs with an increase in conductivity of approximately 6
   orders of magnitude compared to the unfilled PA6.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium dioxide coatings have potential applications including
   photocatalysts for solar assisted hydrogen production, solar water
   disinfection and self-cleaning windows. Herein, we report the use of
   suspension plasma spraying (SPS) for the deposition of conformal
   titanium dioxide coatings. The process utilises a nanoparticle slurry of
   TiO2 (ca. 6 and 12 nm respectively) in water, which is fed into a high
   temperature plasma jet (ca. 7000-20 000 K). This facilitated the
   deposition of adherent coatings of nanostructured titanium dioxide with
   predominantly anatase crystal structure. In this study, suspensions of
   nano-titanium dioxide, made via continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis
   (CHFS), were used directly as a feedstock for the SPS process. Coatings
   were produced by varying the feedstock crystallite size, spray distance
   and plasma conditions. The coatings produced exhibited ca. 90-100\%
   anatase phase content with the remainder being rutile (demonstrated by
   XRD). Phase distribution was homogenous throughout the coatings as
   determined by micro-Raman spectroscopy. The coatings had a granular
   surface, with a high specific surface area and consisted of densely
   packed agglomerates interspersed with some melted material. All of the
   coatings were shown to be photoactive by means of a sacrificial hydrogen
   evolution test under UV radiation and compared favourably with reported
   values for CVD coatings and compressed discs of P25.}},

Title = {{Triaxial Accelerometer Error Coefficients Identification with a Novel
   Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) is one of the state-of-the-art
   swarm intelligence techniques, which is widely utilized for optimization
   purposes. Triaxial accelerometer error coefficients are relatively
   unstable with the environmental disturbances and aging of the
   instrument. Therefore, identifying triaxial accelerometer error
   coefficients accurately and being with lower costs are of great
   importance to improve the overall performance of triaxial
   accelerometer-based strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS). In this
   study, a novel artificial fish swarm algorithm (NAFSA) that eliminated
   the demerits (lack of using artificial fishes' previous experiences,
   lack of existing balance between exploration and exploitation, and high
   computational cost) of AFSA is introduced at first. In NAFSA, functional
   behaviors and overall procedure of AFSA have been improved with some
   parameters variations. Second, a hybrid accelerometer error coefficients
   identification algorithm has been proposed based on NAFSA and Monte
   Carlo simulation (MCS) approaches. This combination leads to maximum
   utilization of the involved approaches for triaxial accelerometer error
   coefficients identification. Furthermore, the NAFSA-identified
   coefficients are testified with 24-position verification experiment and
   triaxial accelerometer-based SINS navigation experiment. The priorities
   of MCS-NAFSA are compared with that of conventional calibration method
   and optimal AFSA. Finally, both experiments results demonstrate high
   efficiency of MCS-NAFSA on triaxial accelerometer error coefficients
   identification.}},

Abstract = {{Melt-mixed high density polyethylene (HDPE)/multi-walled carbon nanotube
   (MWCNT) nanocomposites with 1-10 wt\% MWCNTs were prepared by twin screw
   extrusion and compression moulded into sheet form. The compression
   moulded nanocomposites exhibit a 112\% increase in modulus at a MWCNT
   loading of 4 wt\%, and a low electrical percolation threshold of 1.9
   wt\%. Subsequently, uniaxial, sequential (seq-) biaxial and simultaneous
   (sim-) biaxial stretching of the virgin HDPE and nanocomposite sheets
   was conducted at different strain rates and stretching temperatures to
   investigate the processability of HDPE with the addition of nanotubes
   and the influence of deformation on the structure and final properties
   of nanocomposites. The results show that the processability of HDPE is
   improved under all the uniaxial and biaxial deformation conditions due
   to a strengthened strain hardening behaviour with the addition of
   MWCNTs. Extensional deformation is observed to disentangle nanotube
   agglomerates and the disentanglement degree is shown to depend on the
   stretching mode, strain rate and stretching temperatures applied. The
   disentanglement effectiveness is: uniaxial stretching < sim-biaxial
   stretching < seq-biaxial stretching, under the same deformation
   parameters. In sim-biaxial stretching, reducing the strain rate and
   stretching temperature can lead to more nanotube agglomerate breakup.
   Enhanced nanotube agglomerate disentanglement exhibits a positive effect
   on the mechanical properties and a negative effect on the electrical
   properties of the deformed nanocomposites. The ultimate stress of the
   composite containing 4 wt\% MWCNTs increased by similar to 492\% after
   seq-biaxial stretching, while the resistivity increased by similar to
   10(12) Omega cm.}},

Abstract = {{As many countries around the world face an aging infrastructure crisis,
   there is an increasing need to develop more accurate monitoring and
   assessment techniques for reinforced concrete structures. One of the
   challenges associated with assessing existing infrastructure is
   correlating externally measured parameters such as crack widths and
   surface strains with reinforcement stresses as this is dependent on a
   number of variables. The current research investigates how the use of
   distributed fiber optic sensors to measure reinforcement strain can be
   correlated with digital image correlation measurements of crack widths
   to relate external crack width measurements to reinforcement stresses.
   An initial set of experiments was undertaken involving a series of
   small-scale beam specimens tested in three-point bending with variable
   reinforcement properties. Relationships between crack widths and
   internal reinforcement strains were observed including that both the
   diameter and number of bars affected the measured maximum strain and
   crack width. A model that uses measured crack width to estimate
   reinforcement strain was presented and compared to the experimental
   results. The model was found to provide accurate estimates of load
   carrying capacity for a given crack width, however, the model was
   potentially less accurate when crack widths were used to estimate the
   experimental reinforcement strains. The need for more experimental data
   to validate the conclusions of this research was also highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Inspection of steam generator (SG) tubes by conventional eddy current
   may, in general, involve analysis of indications from volumetric wall
   loss, cracks, fouling and support-plate degradation; however, it may be
   difficult to size or quantify effects from support-to-tube gap and tube
   tilt, especially in the presence of support plates. Pulsed eddy current
   (PEC) technology is being developed to investigate such complex tube and
   flaw geometries. The present work employs finite element modeling to
   investigate the effectiveness of PEC in identifying and sizing the outer
   diameter wall-loss in SG tubes. The signals analyzed using a modified
   principal components analysis (PCA) method reveal the potential success
   of a PEC-PCA combination to produce scores that can be used to size the
   wall-loss in the presence of support plates. The modeling results are in
   good agreement with experimental observations.}},

Title = {{A novel recovery process for lipids from microalgae for biodiesel
   production using a hydrated phosphonium ionic liquid}},
Journal = {{GREEN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2813-2824}},
Abstract = {{The use of a hydrated phosphonium ionic liquid, {[}P(CH2OH)(4)]Cl, for
   the extraction of microalgae lipids for biodiesel production, was
   evaluated using two microalgae species, Chlorella vulgaris and
   Nannochloropsis oculata. The ionic liquid extraction was compared to the
   conventional Soxhlet, and Bligh \& Dyer, methods, giving the highest
   extraction efficiency in the case of C. vulgaris, at 8.1\%. The
   extraction from N. oculata achieved the highest lipid yield for Bligh \&
   Dyer (17.3\%), while the ionic liquid extracted 12.8\%. Nevertheless,
   the ionic liquid extraction showed high affinity to neutral/saponifiable
   lipids, resulting in the highest fatty acid methyl esters
   (FAMEs)-biodiesel yield (4.5\%) for C. vulgaris. For N. oculata, the
   FAMEs yield of the ionic liquid and Bligh \& Dyer extraction methods
   were similar (>8\%), and much higher than for Soxhlet (<5\%). The ionic
   liquid extraction proved especially suitable for lipid extraction from
   wet biomass, giving even higher extraction yields than from dry biomass,
   14.9\% and 12.8\%, respectively (N. oculata). Remarkably, the overall
   yield of FAMEs was almost unchanged, 8.1\% and 8.0\%, for dry and wet
   biomass. The ionic liquid extraction process was also studied at ambient
   temperature, varying the extraction time, giving 75\% of lipid and 93\%
   of FAMEs recovery after thirty minutes, as compared to the extraction at
   100 degrees C for one day. The recyclability study demonstrated that the
   ionic liquid was unchanged after treatment, and was successfully reused.
   The ionic liquid used is best described as {[}P(CH2OH)(4)]Cl center dot
   2H(2)O, where the water is not free, but strongly bound to the ions.}},

   range of supported ionic liquids({[} C(4)C(1)im]Cl, {[}C(4)C(1)im]NTf2],

   {[}C(4)C(1)pyrr]Cl) dispersed silica (SILP) operates as an efficient
   heterogeneous catalyst in oxidation of long chain linear primary amines
   to corresponding nitriles. This reaction follows a ``green{''} route
   using a cheap and easy to handles oxidant (oxygen or air). The
   conversion was found to be strongly influenced by the alkyl chain length
   of the amine substrate and the choice of oxidant. No condensation
   reaction was observed between the starting amines and the selectivity to
   nitrile is 100\%. Moving from a composition of 20 atm N-2/5 atm O-2 to 5
   atm N-2/20 atm O-2 led to enhancements in the conversion (n-alkylamines)
   and selectivity (benzonitrile) which have been correlated with an
   increase of the solubilized oxygen. This was further supported by using
   different inert gas (nitrogen, helium, argon)/oxygen mixtures indicating
   that the O2 solubility in the SILP system, has an important effect on
   conversions and TON in this reaction using SILP catalysts. Experiments
   performed in the presence of CO2 led to a different behaviour due to the
   formation of amine-CO2 adducts. The application of the Weisz-Prater
   criterion confirmed the absence of any diffusional constraints.}},

Journal = {{ANALYST}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2988-2994}},
Abstract = {{Modification of citrate and hydroxylamine reduced Ag colloids with
   thiocholine bromide, a thiol functionalized quaternary ammonium salt,
   creates particles where the zeta potential is switched from the normal
   values of ca. -50 mV to ca. + 50 mV. These colloids are stable but can
   be aggregated with metal salts in much the same way as the parent
   colloids. They are excellent SERS substrates for detection of anionic
   targets since their positive zeta potentials promote adsorption of
   negatively charged ions. This is important because the vast majority of
   published SERS studies involve cationic or neutral targets. Moreover,
   the fact that the modifier is a quaternary ammonium ion means that the
   negative surface charge is maintained even at alkaline pH. The modified
   colloids can be used to detect compounds which cannot be detected using
   conventional negatively-charged citrate or hydroxylamine reduced metal
   nanoparticles, for example the detection limit was 5.0 x 10(-5) M for
   perchlorate and <8.7 x 10(-7) M for tetraphenylporphine tetrasulfonic
   acid (TPPS). More importantly, picric acid (an explosive) and diclofenac
   (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) could also be analysed
   quantitatively at low concentrations, 2.5 x 10(-5) M and 1.9 x 10(-5) M,
   respectively. Interestingly, the correct choice of aggregating agent is
   important for achieving high sensitivity since the anion in the
   aggregating salt may compete with anionic targets for surface binding
   sites. Finally, since the modification procedure simply involves
   reaction of nanoparticles with a small alkyl thiol derivative, it can
   easily be adapted to other particle morphologies or metals.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of the various components of leuco crystal violet (LCV)
   micelle gels on dose sensitivity and initial colour are tested. Dose
   sensitivity and gel turbidity are influenced by tri-chloro acetic acid
   (TCAA) concentration, with the highest dose sensitivity obtained at
   similar to 21.5 mM. Increasing Triton x-100 (Tx100) concentration
   improved dose sensitivity but, unfortunately, increased initial colour
   of the gel. Using Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in place of
   Tx100 produces gels that are nearly colourless prior to irradiation, but
   reduces the dose sensitivity. The effects of chlorinated species on dose
   sensitivity are tested using 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (TCE), chloroform,
   and 1,1,1-trichloro-2-methyl-2-propanol hemihydrate (TCMPH). TCE gives
   the largest improvement in dose sensitivity and is recommended for use
   in micelle gel dosimeters because it is less volatile and safer to use
   than chloroform. A new gel containing CTAB as the surfactant and TCE
   gives improved dose sensitivity compared to previous LCV micelle gels.}},

Abstract = {{A wide range of room temperature ionic liquids based on the
   3-methylpiperdinium cation core were produced from 3-methylpiperidine,
   which is a derivative of DYTEKs (R) A amine. First, reaction with
   1-bromoalkanes or 1-bromoalkoxyalkanes generated the corresponding
   tertiary amines (Rm beta pip, R = alkyl or alkoxyalkyl); further
   quaternisation reactions with the appropriate methylating agents yielded
   the quaternary {[}Rmm(beta)pip]X salts (X-= I-, {[}CF3CO2]-or
   {[}OTf](-); Tf = -SO2CF3), and {[}Rmm(beta)pip]{[}NTf2] were prepared by
   anion metathesis from the corresponding iodides. All {[}NTf2]-salts are
   liquids at room temperature. {[}Rmm(beta)pip]X (X-= I-, {[}CF3CO2]-or
   {[}OTf](-)) are low-melting solids when R = alkyl, but room temperature
   liquids upon introduction of ether functionalities on R. Neither of the
   3-methylpiperdinium ionic liquids showed any signs of crystallisation,
   even well below 0 degrees C. Some related non-C-substituted piperidinium
   and pyrrolidinium analogues were prepared and studied for comparison.
   Crystal structures of 1-hexyl-1,3-dimethylpiperidinium
   tetraphenylborate, 1-butyl-3-methylpiperidinium bromide,
   1-(2-methoxyethyl)1- methylpiperidinium chloride and
   1-(2-methoxyethyl)-1-methylpyrrolidinium bromide are reported. Extensive
   structural and physical data are collected and compared to literature
   data, with special emphasis on the systematic study of the cation ring
   size and/or asymmetry effects on density, viscosity and ionic
   conductivity, allowing general trends to be outlined. Cyclic voltammetry
   shows that 3-methylpiperidinium ionic liquids, similarly to azepanium,
   piperidinium or pyrrolidinium counterparts, are extremely
   electrochemically stable; the portfolio of useful alternatives for safe
   and high-performing electrolytes is thus greatly extended.}},

Abstract = {{Low-velocity impact damage can drastically reduce the residual
   mechanical properties of the composite structure even when there is
   barely visible impact damage. The ability to computationally predict the
   extent of damage and compression after impact (CAI) strength of a
   composite structure can potentially lead to the exploration of a larger
   design space without incurring significant development time and cost
   penalties. A three-dimensional damage model, to predict both
   low-velocity impact damage and compression after impact CAI strength of
   composite laminates, has been developed and implemented as a user
   material subroutine in the commercial finite element package,
   ABAQUS/Explicit. The virtual tests were executed in two steps, one to
   capture the impact damage and the other to predict the CAI strength. The
   observed intra-laminar damage features, delamination damage area as well
   as residual strength are discussed. It is shown that the predicted
   results for impact damage and CAI strength correlated well with
   experimental testing.}},

Journal = {{GEOTECHNIQUE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{188-200}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, quantitative observations of dry granular flows subject
   to varying magnitude and direction of Coriolis acceleration are
   presented in order to assess the robustness of the Savage-Hutter shallow
   water approximation of granular flow for modelling landslides. Nine
   tests carried out at 70 degrees and 45 degrees slope inclinations are
   described for cases where no Coriolis acceleration was applied (i.e.
   tests performed at 1g), and where the Coriolis acceleration acted into
   or out of the slope (centrifuge tests). Given that the magnitude of the
   Coriolis term is velocity dependent, each point within a model landslide
   on the centrifuge experienced a unique time and space-varying magnitude
   of Coriolis acceleration, altering the flow displacement with time and
   final deposit characteristics. The resultant behaviour is compared to a
   depth-averaged flow model based on a frictional rheology. A single set
   of model parameters was found to be appropriate for all test conditions
   and directions/magnitudes of Coriolis acceleration, illustrating the
   robustness of the frictional depth-averaged approach to capture the
   mobility of dry granular flows, albeit as a `Class C' type of
   prediction. It is noted that the empirically derived basal interface
   friction was found to be lower than the static interface friction
   determined by conventional testing, suggesting that new methods are
   needed for the a priori determination of suitable rheological parameters
   for high-speed flows.}},

   concrete}},
Journal = {{GEOSYNTHETICS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{48-69}},
Abstract = {{The performance of four geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) used as a
   hydraulic barrier below concrete-lined sewage treatment lagoons was
   examined based on a series of laboratory tests aimed at measuring: (i)
   the lateral flow of synthetic wastewater through the interface between
   each GCL product and a 0.1 m thick cast-in-place concrete above the GCL
   over a 14-month period and, from this data, calculating the concrete/GCL
   interface transmissivity (theta); and (ii) the hydraulic conductivity
   (k) of the GCLs below poured concrete when exposed to (iia) synthetic
   wastewater under isothermal conditions, or (iib) a series of wet-dry
   and/or cool-heat cycles for up to 12 months. The four GCLs have either
   sodium or polymer-enhanced sodium bentonite, and either granular or
   powdered bentonite. When the wastewater head above the GCL was 1.0 m
   (stress on concrete, sigma = 10 kPa), L for the GCL with granular sodium
   bentonite was 4 X 10(-11) m(2)/s. For the same GCL, when the head
   increased to 2.5 m (sigma = 25 kPa), the value of L was reduced by about
   one order of magnitude to 2 X 10(-12) m(2)/s. For the GCL which has
   polymer-enhanced granular bentonite, the value of L was similar to (and
   possibly lower than) that for the GCL with untreated granular bentonite.
   For the GCL with powdered bentonite and cover geotextile impregnated
   with 1280 g/m(2) of bentonite, the values of L were 2 X 10(-12) and 4 X
   10(-13) m(2)/s at 1.0 and 2.5 m head, respectively. With a reduction in
   the amount of the impregnated powdered bentonite in the cover geotextile
   to 840 g/m(2), theta was 1 to 9 X 10(-12) m(2)/s. The lowest k (3.2 X
   10(-11) m/s) for a GCL below concrete and exposed to wastewater under
   isothermal conditions was measured for the GCL with polymer-enhanced
   granular bentonite, whereas the highest value of k (1.9 X 10(-10) m/s)
   was for the GCL with standard granular bentonite. Under 0.5 m head and 3
   kPa stress, the k of the GCL below concrete and exposed to wet-dry
   cycles was 1.2-2.6 times the k of the GCL exposed to wastewater under
   isothermal conditions. Analytical calculations for the leakage through
   concrete/GCL liners for the four GCLs showed that the leakage was below
   the allowable limits specified by the Australian, British, and American
   standards.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturers of geosynthetic liner materials recommend that composite
   geomembrane/geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) be covered in a timely
   fashion to avoid potential issues that may arise under the action of
   long-term solar exposure. In this paper, field evidence of a new, never
   before reported solar-exposure driven damage mechanism for GCLs covered
   only by a black geomembrane and left exposed for more than 3 years is
   presented. Solar exposure can give rise to a large daily variation in
   geomembrane temperature, which causes a moisture cycle within the
   interface between the geomembrane and GCL resulting in the formation and
   flow of condensed moisture beneath the geomembrane. All four of the GCL
   products investigated at the Queen's University Environmental Liner Test
   Site were shown to have experienced significant bentonite erosion after
   4.7 years of exposure. Erosion was identified in the field through a
   tactile survey of GCL panels in which the stiffness response of the GCL
   to touch was used to identify eroded zones. A change in the colour of
   the GCL, although useful to identify possibly eroded zones in some GCL
   products, proved ineffective in others. Erosion features were observed
   with widths up to and exceeding 200 mm across, making them unlikely to
   undergo self-healing upon hydration and application of normal stress. As
   a result, the observed erosion features would have severe adverse
   consequences for leakage rates through the GCL component of a composite
   liner barrier system. These observations provide yet another strong
   motivation for timely covering of composite landfill liner systems.}},

Abstract = {{A black 1.5 mm geomembrane (GMB) and geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) liner
   were placed on both a 3H: 1V (18.4 degrees) slope and a gently sloping
   (3\%) base (latitude 44 degrees 34'15 `' N) and left exposed for 4.7
   years. The observed solar radiation, ambient air temperature,
   temperature at the interface between the GMB and GCL, and temperature at
   various depths (to 600 mm) in the underlying silty sand soil are
   reported. The interface temperature was up to 40 degrees C higher than
   ambient temperature on a sunny day. The difference between interface
   temperature on the slope and base was minimal near summer solstice and
   increased significantly earlier and later in the year (except when
   covered in snow). There was significant variability in GMB and interface
   temperature depending on the contact conditions between the GMB and GCL.
   The interface temperatures at wrinkles could be 15 degrees C higher than
   other locations where there was intimate contact between GMB and GCL.
   Snow-cover insulated the liner from solar radiation and extreme
   temperature. These insulating effects were lost on the south-facing
   slope before the base, subjecting the GCL on the slope to more daily
   freeze-thaw cycles than on the base. A correlation between the interface
   temperature, ambient air temperature, and the solar radiation gave good
   agreement with the observed temperatures. The cycling of interface
   temperatures is considered to be central to the mechanism of moisture
   evaporation from the GCL that may cause GCL panel shrinkage and moisture
   condensation-driven downslope bentonite erosion. Covering the composite
   liner with a ballast layer as quickly as possible is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{To accurately estimate muscle forces using electromyogram (EMG) signals,
   precise EMG amplitude estimation, and a modeling scheme capable of
   coping with the nonlinearities and dynamics of the EMG-force
   relationship are needed. In this work, angle-based EMG amplitude
   calibration and parallel cascade identification (PCI) modeling are
   combined for EMG-based force estimation in dynamic contractions,
   including concentric and eccentric contractions of the biceps brachii
   and triceps brachii muscles. Angle-based calibration has been shown to
   improve surface EMG (SEMG) based force estimation during isometric
   contractions through minimization of the effects of joint angle related
   factors, and PCI modeling captures both the nonlinear and dynamic
   properties of the process. SEMG data recorded during constant force,
   constant velocity, and varying force, varying velocity flexion and
   extension trials are calibrated. The calibration values are obtained at
   specific elbow joint angles and interpolated to cover a continuous range
   of joint angles. The calibrated data are used in PCI models to estimate
   the force induced at the wrist. The experimental results show the
   effectiveness of the calibration scheme, combined with PCI modeling. For
   the constant force, constant velocity trials, minimum \% RMSE of 8.3\%
   is achieved for concentric contractions, 10.3\% for eccentric
   contractions and 33.3\% for fully dynamic contractions. Force estimation
   accuracy is superior in concentric contractions in comparison to
   eccentric contractions, which may be indicative of more nonlinearity in
   the eccentric SEMG-force relationship.}},

   WASTE HEAT RECOVERY SYSTEMS}},
Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE CANADIAN SOCIETY FOR MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{125-136}},
Abstract = {{Improving the energy efficiency of industrial processes and the
   facilities in which they are carried out is often considered to be one
   of the most promising ways to begin reducing global greenhouse gas
   emissions. One of the best ways for organizations to reduce their energy
   consumption without having to carry out extensive equipment and facility
   overhauls is waste heat recovery or energy recycling. Waste heat
   recovery involves tapping into previously discarded thermal energy
   streams and reusing it for various purposes within a facility (space
   heating or cooling) or within the process itself (pre-heating air and
   boiler makeup water). Despite the numerous social and economic benefits
   that are available through waste heat recovery, several economic and
   technical barriers still exist to its wide-scale implementation. This
   paper provides an overview of the current state of waste heat recovery
   systems available in industry, offers a discussion of the major barriers
   to their wide-spread implementation, and lastly concludes with new data
   with several new case studies from Canadian manufacturers which have
   successfully harnessed waste heat within their facilities.}},

Title = {{mer and fac isomerism in tris chelate diimine metal complexes}},
Journal = {{DALTON TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{4406-4422}},
Abstract = {{In this perspective, we highlight the issue of meridional (mer) and
   facial (fac) orientation of asymmetrical diimines in tris-chelate
   transition metal complexes. Diimine ligands have long been the workhorse
   of coordination chemistry, and whilst there are now good strategies to
   isolate materials where the inherent metal centered chirality is under
   almost complete control, and systematic methodologies to isolate
   heteroleptic complexes, the conceptually simple geometrical isomerism
   has not been widely investigated. In systems where the two donor atoms
   are significantly different in terms of the s-donor and p-accepting
   ability, the fac isomer is likely to be the thermodynamic product. For
   the diimine complexes with two trigonal planar nitrogen atoms there is
   much more subtlety to the system, and external factors such as the
   solvent, lattice packing and the various steric considerations play a
   delicate role in determining the observed and isolable product. In this
   article we discuss the possibilities to control the isomeric ratio in
   labile systems, consider the opportunities to separate inert complexes
   and discuss the observed differences in their spectroscopic properties.
   Finally we report on the ligand orientation in supramolecular systems
   where facial coordination leads to simple regular structures such as
   helicates and tetrahedra, but the ability of the ligand system to adopt
   a mer orientation enables self-assembled structures of considerable
   beauty and complexity.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{460-483}},
Abstract = {{Large eddy simulations of turbulent radial and plane wall jets were
   performed at different Reynolds numbers using the Lagrangian dynamic
   eddy viscosity subgrid-scale model. The results were validated with
   experimental data available in the literature. Compared to the plane
   ones, the radial wall jets have an extra direction for expansion, which
   causes faster decay rates. Thus, the resulting pressure gradient
   distributions are different. However, the comparison of the results with
   the turbulent boundary layers under adverse and favourable pressure
   gradients reveals that these pressure gradients are not strong enough to
   cause any fundamental physical difference between plane and radial wall
   jets. In both cases, the local Reynolds number is an important
   determining factor in characterisation of the flow. The joint
   probability density function analysis shows that the local Reynolds
   number determines the level of intrusion of the outer layer into the
   inner layer: the lower the local Reynolds number, the stronger is the
   interaction of the inner and outer layers. These results can be used to
   clarify the scatter of the reported log-law constants in the literature.}},

   r(MMA) = 0.057) made at 50 degrees C. For MMA-rich monomer mixtures
   (0.50 <= f(MMA) <= 0.97), overall propagation rate coefficients (k(p),
   cop) greater than twice the value for MMA homopolymerization (kp, MMA)
   are facilitated by the strongly alternating copolymerization kinetics,
   whereas the BCA propagation rate coefficient (k(p), BCA) is estimated to
   be only 336 +/- 20 L mol(-1) s(-1) at 50 degrees C, approximately half
   the value of k(p), MMA. These detailed results renew our understanding
   of the FRP kinetics for this class of monomer, important to adhesive and
   biomedical applications, and illustrate that an extensive and otherwise
   inaccessible (via anionic polymerization) level of control can be
   achieved over poly(ACA) final properties.}},

Title = {{Synthesis by extrusion: continuous, large-scale preparation of MOFs
   using little or no solvent}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1645-1649}},
Abstract = {{Grinding solid reagents under solvent-free or low-solvent conditions
   (mechanochemistry) is emerging as a general synthetic technique which is
   an alternative to conventional solvent-intensive methods. However, it is
   essential to find ways to scale-up this type of synthesis if its promise
   of cleaner manufacturing is to be realised. Here, we demonstrate the use
   of twin screw and single screw extruders for the continuous synthesis of
   various metal complexes, including Ni(salen), Ni(NCS)(2)(PPh3)(2) as
   well as the commercially important metal organic frameworks (MOFs)
   Cu-3(BTC)(2) (HKUST-1), Zn(2-methylimidazolate)(2) (ZIF-8, MAF-4) and
   Al(fumarate)(OH). Notably, Al(fumarate)(OH) has not previously been
   synthesised mechanochemically. Quantitative conversions occur to give
   products at kg h(-1) rates which, after activation, exhibit surface
   areas and pore volumes equivalent to those of materials produced by
   conventional solvent-based methods. Some reactions can be performed
   either under completely solvent-free conditions whereas others require
   the addition of small amounts of solvent (typically 3-4 mol
   equivalents). Continuous neat melt phase synthesis is also successfully
   demonstrated by both twin screw and single screw extrusion for ZIF-8.
   The latter technique provided ZIF-8 at 4 kg h(-1). The space time yields
   (STYs) for these methods of up to 144 x 10(3) kg per m(3) per day are
   orders of magnitude greater than STYs for other methods of making MOFs.
   Extrusion methods clearly enable scaling of mechanochemical and melt
   phase synthesis under solvent-free or low-solvent conditions, and may
   also be applied in synthesis more generally.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal gas aphron dispersions (CGAs) can be described as a system of
   microbubbles suspended homogenously in a liquid matrix. This work
   examines the performance of CGAs in comparison to surfactant solutions
   for washing low levels of arsenic from an iron rich soil. Sodium Dodecyl
   Sulfate (SDS) and saponin, a biodegradable surfactant, obtained from
   Sapindus mukorossi or soapnut fruit were used for generating CGAs and
   solutions for soil washing. Column washing experiments were performed in
   down-flow and up flow modes at a soil pH of 5 and 6 using varying
   concentration of SDS and soapnut solutions as well as CGAs. Soapnut CGAs
   removed more than 70\% arsenic while SDS CGAs removed up to 55\% arsenic
   from the soil columns in the soil pH range of 5-6. CGAs and solutions
   showed comparable performances in all the cases. CGAs were more
   economical since it contains 35\% of air by volume, thereby requiring
   less surfactant. Micellar solubilization and low pH of soapnut
   facilitated arsenic desorption from soil column. FT-IR analysis of
   effluent suggested that soapnut solution did not interact chemically
   with arsenic thereby facilitating the recovery of soapnut solution by
   precipitating the arsenic. Damage to soil was minimal arsenic confirmed
   by metal dissolution from soil surface and SEM micrograph. (C) 2014

Journal = {{LASERS IN ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{247-265}},
Abstract = {{A preliminary study was conducted to find out the initial parameter
   window to obtain the full-penetrated NiTi weldment. A L27 Taguchi
   experiment was then carried out to statistically study the effects of
   the welding parameters and their possible interactions on the weld bead
   aspect ratio (or penetration over fuse-zone width ratio), and to
   determine the optimized parameter settings to produce the
   full-penetrated weldment with desirable aspect ratio. From the
   statistical results in the Taguchi experiment, the laser mode was found
   to be the most important factor that substantially affects the aspect
   ratio. Strong interaction between the power and focus position was found
   in the Taguchi experiment. The optimized weldment was mainly of columnar
   dendritic structure in the weld zone (WZ), while the heat affected zone
   (HAZ) exhibited equiaxed grain structure. The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) results showed that the WZ
   remained the B2 austenite structure without any precipitates, but with a
   significant decrease of phase transformation temperatures. The results
   in the microhardness and tensile tests indicated that the mechanical
   properties of NiTi were decreased to a certain extent after fibre laser
   welding.}},

Journal = {{ECONOMIC GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{209-240}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{The Beaverlodge area in Saskatchewan, Canada, hosts numerous
   fault-controlled uranium deposits that are geochemically and
   structurally complex because of multiple deformation events. Field,
   petrographic, and geo-chemical data indicate there are six distinct
   styles of uraninite mineralization, with five temporally distinct
   mineralization events. The earliest two styles of mineralization are
   hosted in cataclasite and veins that formed at ca. 2.29 Ga from 300
   degrees C fluids derived from retrograde metamorphic processes during
   late stages of the early Paleoproterozoic Arrowsmith orogen. The second
   style of mineralization is restricted to the albitized granite of the
   Gunnar deposit and formed between ca. 2.3 and 1.9 Ga from reducing
   magmatic-hydrothermal fluids near 300 degrees C. However, uranium
   associated with this metasomatic style of mineralization is overprinted
   by the more significant breccia-vein and minor volcanic-type
   mineralization, thus the Gunnar deposit contains three styles of
   mineralization. Reactivation of major fault zones resulted in
   breccia-type mineralization, the dominant mineralizing event, at ca.
   1.85 Ga, from Ca-Na-F-rich fluids at about 330 degrees C during the
   postpeak Thelon-Taltson orogen and early stages of the Trans-Hudson
   orogen. Inversion followed by subsidence resulted in formation of the
   Martin Lake basin, a successor basin filled with ca. 5 km of arkose,
   conglomerates, siltstone, and alkaline mafic flows and sills that formed
   during back-arc extension following peak Trans-Hudson orogeny.
   Volcanic-style mineralization at 1.82 Ga. resulted from late exsolution
   of magmatic fluids from the alkaline mafic dikes. Overlying the Martin
   Lake basin are outliers of the Athabasca Formation associated with the
   last stage of uranium mineralization, at ca. 1.62 Ga, from oxidizing
   basinal brines near 230 degrees C. Subsequent erosion of the Athabasca
   and Martin Lake basin rocks and weathering of the deposits resulted in
   secondary uranium minerals and late veins.
   Multiple stages of deformation and fluid overprinting suggest that
   uranium mineralization record progressively higher levels in the crust.
   Each successive event overprinted to varying degrees the previous
   events. Although the Beaverlodge area represents several distinct
   mineralizing events, the major event is the breccia-type that occurred
   at 1.85 Ga. The other styles of mineralization are minor, and their
   presence complicates both exploration and our understanding of ore
   deposit genesis in the area.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are two-terminal,
   solid state devices with a mixed ionic/electronic conductor as the
   active layer. Once activated by a DC voltage or current, a
   doping-induced homojunction dictates the electrical and optical response
   of the LEC, making it highly unique and attractive among organic
   devices. However, the depletion width, a fundamental parameter of any
   semiconductor homojunction, has never been determined experimentally for
   a static LEC junction. In this study, we apply spatially resolved
   photocurrent and photoluminescence (PL) scanning to an extremely large
   planar LEC that had been turned on to emit strongly then subsequently
   frozen. These concerted scanning and imaging studies depict a p-i-n
   junction structure in which the peak built-in electric field lies at the
   interface between the intrinsic region and the p-doped region. The
   corresponding 18 m depletion width is very small compared to the 700 m
   interelectrode spacing. A 700 m planar polymer light-emitting
   electrochemical cell has been turned on, frozen and probed optically.
   Scanning PL and photocurrent imaging reveals a p-i-n doping profile.
   Photocurrent is only detected over a region of 18 m centered at the i/p
   junction. Peak PL occurs near the center of the intrinsic region. ((c)

   immiscibility caused hydro-fracturing and generation of various kinds of
   quartz-sulfide veinlets. Almost all quartz crystals within these
   veinlets are fluid inclusion-rich. The entrapped fluids are of four main
   compositional types: mono-phase vapor-rich, two-phase liquid-rich,
   two-phase vapor-rich, and multiphase (L+V+S). Based on microthermometric
   studies of fluid inclusions, the salinity ranges from 1.4 to 70 wt\%
   NaCl equivalent, while most of the values cluster between 35 and 70 wt\%
   NaCl equiv. The T-H values of two-phase inclusions homogenizing into
   liquid and vapor states range between 180-440 and 360-540 degrees C,
   respectively. Most of the multiphase inclusions homogenize by halite
   dissolution with T-m(NaCl) varying from 360 to 600 degrees C, while some
   of them homogenize by simultaneous disappearance of halite and vapor
   which show a wider range of T-H (300-600 degrees C). Inclusions with
   T-m(NaCl)>> TH(L-V) and higher salinity values may have suffered necking
   down and/or liquid loss or trapped solid halite crystals. The
   approximate depth of mineralization and entrapment of the studied
   inclusions is estimated about >1.0 to 2 km. The principal process
   responsible for mineralization was liquid-vapor immiscibility and
   consequent supersaturation of the hydrothermal fluids. Based on stable
   isotope analyses carried out on quartz-sulfide veinlets, delta O-18
   (5.4-5.8\%) and delta D (-77 to -61\%) values of the ore-bearing fluids,
   as well as the delta S-34 value of a representative pyrite sample (1.3
   \%) are consistent with a predominantly magmatic source.}},

Title = {{The Use of PAT and Off-line Methods for Monitoring of Roller Compacted

Abstract = {{Real-time process monitoring using process analytical technology (PAT)
   tools can augment process understanding, enable improved process
   control, and hence facilitate the production of high-quality
   pharmaceutical products. While beneficial for batch processes, the
   availability of PAT tools to monitor continuous processes in real time
   is required to ensure product quality. This paper presents the
   application of novel process analytical technology (PAT) tools in
   combination with off-line analytical techniques for the study of a
   laboratory-scale roller compaction dry granulation process. An
   experiment whereby roll pressure was linearly increased and the effects
   thereof on roller compacted ribbon and granule properties of a placebo
   formulation is described. Analysis of the ribbons and granules was
   performed using both in-line and off-line techniques. Ribbon envelope
   density was measured using the GeoPyc, and the results were compared to
   off-line near-infrared (NIR) measurements and a novel in-line NIR tool,
   the Multieye. Particle size analysis of roller compacted granules was
   assessed with traditional sieve analysis, Camsizer and a novel
   technique, the Eyecon. Both Camsizer and Eyecon have the potential of
   being used as PAT tools in-line. Additionally the compressibility of the
   granules was determined using in-die Heckle analysis and the hardness of
   the resultant compacts was assessed. The compacts were subsequently
   analysed using off-line Raman spectroscopy to investigate the surface
   smoothness which was shown to indicate crushing strength for compacts
   prepared. The results of this initial study demonstrate a good
   relationship between in-line and off-line measurement of key in-process
   material attributes. The findings thus support the further exploitation
   of these new in-line PAT methods in monitoring of continuous unit
   operations at a commercial scale.}},

Title = {{A long-term analysis of pumped hydro storage to firm wind power}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{638-648}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Although pumped hydro storage is seen as a strategic key asset by grid
   operators, financing it is complicated in new liberalised markets. It
   could be argued that the optimum generation portfolio is now determined
   by the economic viability of generators based on a short to medium term
   return on investment. This has meant that capital intensive projects
   such as pumped hydro storage are less attractive for wholesale
   electricity companies because the payback periods are too long. In
   tandem a significant amount of wind power has entered the generation
   mix, which has resulted in operating and planning integration issues due
   to wind's inherent uncertain, varying spatial and temporal nature. These
   integration issues can be overcome using fast acting gas peaking plant
   or energy storage. Most analysis of wind power integration using storage
   to date has used stochastic optimisation for power system balancing or
   arbitrage modelling to examine techno-economic viability. In this
   research a deterministic dynamic programming long term generation
   expansion model is employed to optimise the generation mix, total system
   costs and total carbon dioxide emissions, and unlike other studies
   calculates reserve to firm wind power. The key finding of this study is
   that the incentive to build capital-intensive pumped hydro storage to
   firm wind power is limited unless exogenous market costs come very
   strongly into play. Furthermore it was demonstrated that reserve
   increases with increasing wind power showing the importance of ancillary
   services in future power systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   extremum-seeking problem as a time-varying estimation problem. The
   proposed approach is shown to avoid the need for averaging results which
   minimizes the impact of the choice of dither signal on the performance

Abstract = {{With the increasing number of constructed wetlands being built, the
   modelling of wetland function and performance is valuable. This work
   examines the efficacy of applying a numeric model (SubWet 2.0)
   originally designed for horizontal subsurface flow wetlands to model
   wastewater treatment within vertical subsurface flow constructed
   wetlands (VSSF-CWs). The treatment efficiencies of two VSSF-CWs with
   substantially different influent characteristics, one in Canada and one
   in China, were modelled with SubWet 2.0 and simulated values were then
   compared to observed values to determine how closely SubWet 2.0 reflects
   the actual observed performance of these wetlands. The model was
   calibrated to each wetland with observed data that had been collected
   prior to the simulations. The correlation coefficient (R) and
   Nash-Sutcliff coefficient of efficiency (NSE) were used to evaluate the
   modelling performance for 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5),
   ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and total phosphorous (TP). The
   results showed that the modelling performance for TP and BOD5 was better
   for these parameters than that observed for ammonium nitrogen and
   nitrate nitrogen for either of the two wetlands. For TP and BOD5, the
   correlation coefficient R achieved a value of 0.79 for the wetland
   receiving stormwater and exceeded this value for the Canadian wetland
   receiving domestic wastewaters. For nitrate nitrogen, the wetland
   treating domestic waste showed a correlation coefficient R as high as
   0.97, while the wetland treating stormwater runoff had a correlation
   coefficient R of 0.48. For ammonium nitrogen, both wetlands showed low
   correlation coefficients with values of 0.70 and 0.60 for domestic
   wastewater and for stormwater runoff, respectively. This study
   demonstrated that SubWet 2.0 is suitable for the modelling of VSSF-CWs.
   The two case studies, with substantial differences in the characteristcs
   of the influents, demonstrated that Subwet 2.0 is a versatile and robust
   tool for modelling of constructed wetlands. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{MARINE POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Transboundary cooperation is viewed as an essential element of Marine
   Spatial Planning (MSP). While much of the MSP literature focuses on the
   need for, and benefits of, transboundary MSP, this paper explores the
   political and institutional factors that may facilitate the effective
   transition to such an approach. Drawing on transboundary planning theory
   and practice, key contextual factors that are likely to expedite the
   transition to transboundary MSP are reviewed. These include: policy
   convergence in neighbouring jurisdictions; prior experience of
   transboundary planning; and good working relations amongst key actors.
   Based on this review, an assessment of the conditions for transboundary
   MSP in the adjoining waters of Northern Ireland and the Republic of
   Ireland is undertaken. A number of recommendations are then advanced for
   transboundary MSP on the island of Ireland, including, the need to
   address the role of formal transboundary institutions and the lack of an
   agreed legal maritime boundary. The paper concludes with some commentary
   on the political realities of implementing transboundary MSP. (C) 2014

Title = {{Performance evaluation of a hybrid-passive landfill leachate treatment
   system using multivariate statistical techniques}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{159-169}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A pilot-scale hybrid-passive treatment system operated at the Merrick
   Landfill in North Bay, Ontario, Canada, treats municipal landfill
   leachate and provides for subsequent natural attenuation. Collected
   leachate is directed to a hybrid-passive treatment system, followed by
   controlled release to a natural attenuation zone before entering the
   nearby Little Sturgeon River. The study presents a comprehensive
   evaluation of the performance of the system using multivariate
   statistical techniques to determine the interactions between parameters,
   major pollutants in the leachate, and the biological and chemical
   processes occurring in the system. Five parameters (ammonia, alkalinity,
   chemical oxygen demand (COD), ``heavy{''} metals of interest, with
   atomic weights above calcium, and iron) were set as criteria for the
   evaluation of system performance based on their toxicity to aquatic
   ecosystems and importance in treatment with respect to discharge
   regulations. System data for a full range of water quality parameters
   over a 21-month period were analyzed using principal components analysis
   (PCA), as well as principal components (PC) and partial least squares
   (PLS) regressions. PCA indicated a high degree of association for most
   parameters with the first PC, which explained a high percentage (>40\%)
   of the variation in the data, suggesting strong statistical
   relationships among most of the parameters in the system. Regression
   analyses identified 8 parameters (set as independent variables) that
   were most frequently retained for modeling the five criteria parameters
   (set as dependent variables), on a statistically significant level:
   conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrite (NO2-), organic nitrogen
   (N), oxidation reduction potential (ORP), pH, sulfate and total volatile
   solids (TVS). The criteria parameters and the significant explanatory
   parameters were most important in modeling the dynamics of the passive
   treatment system during the study period. Such techniques and procedures
   were found to be highly valuable and could be applied to other sites to
   determine parameters of interest in similar naturalized engineered
   systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{AD HOC NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Recently, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) emerged as a powerful and
   cost-efficient solution for unattended Outdoor Environment Monitoring
   (OEM) applications. These applications impose certain challenges on WSN
   deployment, including 3-Dimensional (3-D) settings, harsh operational
   conditions, and limited energy resources. To prolong lifetime of the
   deployed WSN, while mitigating the effects of these challenges, we
   propose the use of Relay Nodes (RNs) in addition to Sensor Nodes (SNs)
   in a distributed manner. While RNs facilitate reaching distant
   destinations, SNs can reserve their limited energy resources for sensing
   and data gathering. In addition, Mobile RNs (MRNs), which is a set of
   RNs capable of being reallocated (i.e. mobilized) at any point within
   the network lifetime, can be used to overcome possible link/node failure
   caused by the harsh conditions. It can also guarantee minimal energy
   consumption through imposing a balanced traffic distribution. This
   article proposes a 3-D grid-based deployment for heterogeneous WSNs
   (consisting of SNs, RNs, and MRNs). The problem is cast as a Mixed
   Integer Linear Program (MILP) optimization problem with the objective of
   maximizing the network lifetime while maintaining certain levels of
   fault-tolerance and cost-efficiency. Moreover, an Upper Bound (UB) on
   the deployed WSN lifetime, given that there are no unexpected node/ link
   failures, has been driven. Based on practical/harsh experimental
   settings in OEM, intensive simulations show that the proposed grid-based
   deployment scheme can achieve an average of the expected UB. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Surface patterning in three dimensions is of great importance in
   biomaterials design for controlling cell behavior. A facile one-step
   functionalization of biodegradable PDLLA fibers using amphiphilic
   diblock copolymers is demonstrated here to systematically vary the fiber
   surface composition. The copolymers comprise a hydrophilic
   poly{[}oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate] (POEGMA),
   poly{[}(2-methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine] (PMPC), or
   poly{[}2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)] (PDMAEMA) block and a
   hydrophobic poly(l-lactide) (PLA) block. The block copolymer-modified
   fibers have increased surface hydrophilicity compared to that of PDLLA
   fibers. Mixtures of PLAPMPC and PLAPOEGMA copolymers are utilized to
   exploit microphase separation of the incompatible hydrophilic PMPC and
   POEGMA blocks at the fiber surface. Conjugation of an RGD cell-adhesive
   peptide to one hydrophilic block (POEGMA) using thiol-ene chemistry
   produces fibers with domains of cell-adhesive (POEGMA) and cell-inert
   (PMPC) sites, mimicking the adhesive properties of the extracellular
   matrix (ECM). Human mesenchymal progenitor cells (hES-MPs) showed much
   better adhesion to the fibers with surface-adhesive heterogeneity
   compared to that to fibers with only adhesive or only inert surface

Abstract = {{The granular product being designed in this work required the use of two

   carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) as the binder. The effect of amount of
   binder added, relative composition of the powder, and type of teawaste
   on the product yield was studied. The results show that the optimum
   product yield was a function of both relative powder composition and the
   amount of binder used; increasing the composition of teawaste in the
   powder increased the amount of binder required for successful
   granulation. An increase in the mass fraction of teawaste in the powder
   mix must be accompanied by an increase in the amount of binder to
   maintain the desired product yield. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A strong synergism between Au and Mn substantially increased the
   catalytic activity of the Au-Mn/TOS catalyst for the complete propane
   oxidation as compared to the activity of mono metal Au/TOS and Mn/TOS
   catalysts. The high activity of Au-Mn/TOS catalyst is a result of the
   formation of Au2Mn or Au5Mn2 phases and enhanced mobility of the oxygen
   in the support oxides. XPS, TPR, TEM and XRD studies were used to
   characterise the catalysts. Based on the results, a possible mechanism
   for the participation of the non-stoichiometric and lattice oxygen is
   also proposed. It is suggested that a joint effect of the Au and Mn
   increased the non-stoichiometric and lattice oxygen mobility of the
   Au-Mn/TOS catalyst, potentially being dominated by Mn. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Assessment of the effectiveness of the guard ring in obtaining a

Abstract = {{The non-destructive evaluation of the water permeability of concrete
   structures is a long standing challenge, principally due to the
   difficulty of achieving a uni-direction flow for computing the water
   permeability coefficient. The use of a guard ring (GR) was originally
   proposed for the in situ sorptivity test, but little information can be
   found for the water permeability test. In this study, the effect of a GR
   was carefully examined through the flow simulation, which was verified
   by carrying out experiments. It was observed that the GR can confine the
   flow near the surface, but cannot achieve a uni-directional flow across
   the whole depth of flow. To achieve a better performance, it is
   essential to consider the effects of the size of the inner seal and the
   GR and the significant interaction between these two. The analysis of
   the experimental data has indicated that the GR influences the flow for
   porous concretes, but there is no significant effect for dense
   concretes. Further investigation, validated using the flow-net theory,
   has shown a strong correlation between the water permeability
   coefficients obtained with the GR (K (w-GR)) and without it (K (w-No
   GR)), suggesting that one dimensional flow is not essential for
   interpreting data for site tests. Another practical issue was that more
   than 30 \% of the tests with GR failed due to the difficulty of
   achieving a good seal between the inner and the outer chambers. Based on
   the work reported in this paper, a new water permeability test is
   proposed.}},

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{94-99}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to model defect
   creation in alpha zirconium with tensile strains comparable to the
   elastic strains near the interfaces between zirconium and hydrides.
   Irradiation-induced vacancy clusters under the strain field could be
   initiation sites for dislocation nucleation, and the gliding of these
   dislocations provides channels for transporting atoms from the cascade
   core, significantly accelerating the growth of vacancy clusters to form
   a void. The critical number of vacancies in a cluster that is enhanced
   to grow by the external stress is estimated. The present results provide
   an atomic-level mechanism to explain the stress-enhanced void growth
   under irradiation in zirconium, as observed in experiments. The
   acceleration of delayed hydride cracking under irradiation might be
   partially attributed to the formation of these voids. (C) 2014 Acta

Title = {{3D modelling of dreissenid mussel impacts on phytoplankton in a large
   lake supports the nearshore shunt hypothesis and the importance of
   wind-driven hydrodynamics}},
Journal = {{AQUATIC SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{95-114}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (ELCOM) coupled with a biological
   model (CAEDYM) was calibrated with field data from Lake Simcoe (2008)
   and used to examine the expected impact of dreissenid mussels on the
   distribution of phytoplankton and nutrients, mussel energetic, and the
   interactions with hydrodynamic conditions. In accordance with the
   near-shore shunt hypothesis and the actual distribution of mussels, the
   model predicted a considerable impact of mussels on phytoplankton in
   nearshore areas (< 15 m depth; -38 \% phytoplankton). Horizontal
   advection could account for the lower (-15 \% phytoplankton) offshore
   impact despite the absence of mussels within this region of the lake.
   These predictions were similar to observed long-term changes in
   phytoplankton biomass after the dreissenid mussel invasion. Simulated
   decreases in the initial mussel biomass by 50 \% led to increased
   phytoplankton nearshore, increased mussel growth and decreased
   phosphorus excretion relative to ingestion. In contrast, increases in
   initial mussel biomass by 50 \% resulted in minor changes in
   phytoplankton, since near-bottom depletion of phytoplankton caused
   growth and energy-limitation of mussels. The model, which was the first
   to capture metabolically-driven variations of mussel-mediated nutrient
   cycling, predicted a partial uncoupling of carbon and phosphorus cycling
   by mussels, driven by varying controls on mussel growth. A 60 \%
   increase in the intensity of three storms during the summer had little
   net-effect on phytoplankton biomass, but reduced energy-limitation of
   mussels and increased mussel growth due to increased supply of
   phytoplankton. Our model demonstrates that near-bottom depletion of
   phytoplankton is an important process limiting the impact of mussels,
   and indicates that it affects the mussels' cycling of energy and
   nutrients. It further suggests that stronger storm events could lead to
   further increase of flux of organic matter from the pelagic zone to the
   benthos, further altering energy pathways in the lake.}},

Pages = {{131-164}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has enhanced our understanding about
   ductile-regime machining of brittle materials such as silicon and
   germanium. In particular, MD simulation has helped understand the
   occurrence of brittle-ductile transition due to the high-pressure phase
   transformation (HPPT), which induces Herzfeld-Mott transition. In this
   paper, relevant MD simulation studies in conjunction with experimental
   studies are reviewed with a focus on (i) the importance of machining
   variables: undeformed chip thickness, feed rate, depth of cut, geometry
   of the cutting tool in influencing the state of the deviatoric stresses
   to cause HPPT in silicon, (ii) the influence of material properties:
   role of fracture toughness and hardness, crystal structure and
   anisotropy of the material, and (iii) phenomenological understanding of
   the wear of diamond cutting tools, which are all non-trivial for
   cost-effective manufacturing of silicon. The ongoing developmental work
   on potential energy functions is reviewed to identify opportunities for
   overcoming the current limitations of MD simulations. Potential research
   areas relating to how MD simulation might help improve existing
   manufacturing technologies are identified which may be of particular
   interest to early stage researchers. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published

Abstract = {{Traditional proportional integral (PI) control has been extensively used
   for power control of voltage source converters in microgrid systems.
   Previous studies show that fixed-gain PI controllers cannot easily adapt
   to power changes, disturbances, and parameters variation, especially in
   large microgrids; hence the need for continuous algorithms to adjust the
   controller gains over the transients cannot be neglected. In this paper,
   a novel online tuning algorithm for PI controllers is proposed and
   implemented in a microgrid system. In this algorithm, which is based on
   the neuro-dynamic programming concept, a fuzzy critic is employed to
   evaluate the credibility of the control system performance and provide
   an evaluation signal, which is then used in the gain-tuning process. The
   PI controller gains are updated in an optimization process based on
   steepest decent rule so that the evaluation signal produced by the
   critic is minimized. The developed control structure, which is named
   critic-based self-tuning PI controller, is tested in a microgrid system
   with different penetrations of distributed generators and operational
   scenarios. The simulation results verify that implementation of a
   heuristic gain-tuning algorithm results in a model-independent
   controller with increased adaptivity compared with conventional PI
   control. Furthermore, due to simple learning rules, the convergence time
   is significantly reduced and the transient response is improved. The
   proposed gain-tuning algorithm can also be applied to PI controllers in
   other applications of controllable systems.}},

Abstract = {{Manipulator motion planning is a classic problem in robotics, with a
   number of complete solutions available for their motion in controlled
   (industrial) environments. Owing to recent technological advances in the
   field of robotics, there has been a significant development of more
   complex robots with high-fidelity sensors and more computational power.
   One such example has been a rise in the production of humanoid robots
   equipped with dual-arm manipulators which require complex motion
   planning algorithms. Also, the technological advances have resulted in a
   shift from using manipulators in strictly controlled environments, to
   investigating the deployment of manipulators in dynamic or unknown
   environments. As a result, a greater emphasis has been put on the
   development of local motion planners, which can provide real-time
   solutions to these problems. Artificial Potential Fields (APFs) is one
   such popular local motion planning technique, which can be applied to
   manipulator motion planning, however, the basic algorithm is severely
   prone to local minima problems. Here, two modified APF-based strategies
   for solving the dual-arm motion planning task in unknown environments
   are proposed. Both techniques make use of configuration sampling and
   subgoal selection to assist the APFs in avoiding these local minima
   scenarios. Extensive simulation results are presented to validate the
   efficacy of the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study on the bond behaviour of FRP-concrete bonded
   joints under static and dynamic loadings, by developing a meso-scale
   finite element model using the K\&C concrete damage model in LS-DYNA. A
   significant number of single shear experiments under static pull-off
   loading were modelled with an extensive parametric study covering key
   factors in the K\&C model, including the crack band width, the
   compressive fracture energy and the shear dilatation factor. It is
   demonstrated that the developed model can satisfactorily simulate the
   static debonding behaviour, in terms of mesh objectivity, the
   load-carrying capacity and the local bond-slip behaviour, provided that
   proper consideration is given to the selection of crack band width and
   shear dilatation factor. A preliminary study of the effect of the
   dynamic loading rate on the debonding behaviour was also conducted by
   considering a dynamic increase factor (DIF) for the concrete strength as
   a function of strain rate. It is shown that a higher loading rate leads
   to a higher load-carrying capacity, a longer effective bond length, and
   a larger damaged area of concrete in the single shear loading scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Seepage flow under hydraulic structures provided with intermediate
   filters has been investigated. The flow through the banks of the canal
   has been included in the model. Different combinations of intermediate
   filter and canal width were studied. Different lengths of the floor,
   differential heads, and depths of the sheet pile driven beneath the
   floor were also investigated. The introduction of an intermediate filter
   to the floor of hydraulic structures reduced the uplift force acting on
   the downstream floor by up to 72\%. The maximum uplift reduction
   occurred when the ratio of the distance of filter location downstream
   from the cutoff to the differential head was 1. Introducing a second
   filter in the downstream side resulted in a further reduction in the
   exit hydraulic gradient and in the uplift force, which reached 90\%. The
   optimum locations of the two filters occurred when the first filter was
   placed just downstream of the cutoff wall and the second filter was
   placed nearly at the middistance between the cutoff and the end toe of
   the floor. The results showed significant differences between the

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests prolonged bouts of sitting are unhealthy, and some
   public health messages have recently recommended replacing sitting with
   more standing. However, the relative benefits of replacing sitting with
   standing compared to locomotion are not known. Specifically, the
   biomechanical consequences of standing compared to other
   sitting-alternatives like walking and running are not well known and are
   usually not considered in studies on sitting. We compared the total knee
   joint load accumulated (TKJLA) and the total energy expended (TEE) when
   performing either walking, running, or standing for a common exercise
   bout duration (30 min). Walking and running both (unsurprisingly) had
   much more TEE than standing (+300\% and +1100\%, respectively). TKJLA
   was similar between walking and standing and 74\% greater in running.
   The results suggest that standing is a poor replacement for walking and
   running if one wishes to increases energy expenditure, and may be
   particularly questionable for use in individuals at-risk for knee
   osteoarthritis due to its surprisingly high TKJLA (just as high as

Abstract = {{Conventional power management schemes for standalone wind systems
   typically use maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods to extract
   maximum power from the wind even when the energy storage has reached its
   capacity. By doing so, the dummy load suffers from unnecessary stress
   when the load and energy storage element cannot absorb the excess power.
   This paper proposes an intelligent sensor-less fuzzy-logic based power
   management supervisory control scheme that autonomously transitions
   between an adaptive MPPT control mode and a power limiting control mode
   to regulate the wind turbine energy extraction. The proposed power
   management scheme is intended for off-grid applications such as remote
   telecom base stations. The adaptive MPPT and power regulator (PR)
   algorithms use a derived pseudo tip speed ratio (pTSR) parameter that
   correlates the measured power and the output voltage of the rectifier to
   the system's tip speed ratio (TSR). To enable the algorithm to
   effectively adapt to the wind system despite parameter shifts due to
   machine aging, a fuzzy-logic controller is used to drive the system to
   the voltage references generated by the MPPT and PR algorithms. The
   operating principles of the proposed control technique will be provided
   in this paper. Performance results for the proposed algorithm are
   provided in this paper for a 2kW wind system to highlight the merits of
   the control algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel control scheme to control the flow of active
   and reactive power through a single-phase bi-directional AC/DC
   converters used for telecom backup systems. The proposed controller
   enables the telecom facilities to control the power flow in both
   directions from grid to telecom and telecom to grid. In this paper the
   fuel cell system coupled with ultra-capacitors has been used as telecom
   backup system. By using 10\% of the backup storage capacity, not only
   telecom companies can ensure their high standard reliability, but they
   can also benefit from their assets, as well as participating in
   ancillary services market. The main purpose of this paper is to achieve
   this feature by using the proposed converter configuration and its
   control scheme. So the proposed control scheme is implemented in D-Q
   rotating frame. Due to the lack of freedom degrees in single phase
   converters using the D-Q frame is challenging. In this paper, to cope
   with this problem the all-pas-filter has been used to generate the
   orthogonal system required for D-Q frame. Also A hybrid estimator has
   been used in this paper to estimate the real-time amount of
   active/reactive power. This estimator can estimate realtime power values
   very fast and reliable, which can improve the dynamic abilities of the
   proposed controller. The performance of the proposed controller is
   evaluated by using simulation and experimental results. Also the
   application of the proposed controller in implementation of energy
   management strategies in a typical telecommunication backup system has
   been proved by simulation results.}},

   integrates a bridgeless boost converter and a half-bridge three level
   resonant converter. Voltage stresses on the switches are reduced to half
   of the DC bus voltage. Conduction losses and switching losses are
   reduced by eliminating the rectifier bridge diode and achieving ZVS
   operation over a wide load range. The converter is operated in DCM mode
   with the combination control of PWM and frequency. The symmetrical
   operation keeps the voltage balance of two DC bus capacitor without the
   auxiliary circuit. In the paper, the operation and steady state of the
   proposed converter is explained and analyzed in detail.}},

   decentralized LBMPC in solving the problem of formation for a group of
   cooperative UAVs tracking an aerial target in the presence of unmodeled

Abstract = {{This paper outlines a means of improving the employability skills of
   first-year university students through a closely integrated model of
   employer engagement within computer science modules. The outlined
   approach illustrates how employability skills, including communication,
   teamwork and time management skills, can be contextualised in a manner
   that directly relates to student learning but can still be linked
   forward into employment. The paper tests the premise that developing
   employability skills early within the curriculum will result in improved
   student engagement and learning within later modules. The paper
   concludes that embedding employer participation within first-year models
   can help relate a distant notion of employability into something of more
   immediate relevance in terms of how students can best approach learning.
   Further, by enhancing employability skills early within the curriculum,
   it becomes possible to improve academic attainment within later modules.}},

Abstract = {{This paper responds to demands for greater academic investigation into
   environmental protection, specifically the practical and structural
   problems which underpin regulatory compliance in the planning system. It
   critiques traditional theories of regulation and answers calls for the
   development of a thematic lens to facilitate the scrutiny of not only
   operational practice, but also the broader institutional regime. An
   empirical investigation builds upon the construct of really responsive
   regulation to study planning control and it becomes apparent that not
   only are there significant procedural planning difficulties facing
   regulatory compliance, but also that a much wider raft of issues must be
   considered if the complex equation is to be solved. The findings
   demonstrate how theory can be applied to enrich our rudimentary
   understanding of deep-seated problems and foster insights into areas of
   structural importance which are relevant to both planning and the wider

Abstract = {{This paper describes the results of non-linear elasto-plastic implicit
   dynamic finite element analyses that are used to predict the collapse
   behaviour of cold-formed steel portal frames at elevated temperatures.
   The collapse behaviour of a simple rigid-jointed beam idealisation and a
   more accurate semi-rigid jointed shell element idealisation are compared
   for two different fire scenarios. For the case of the shell element
   idealisation, the semi-rigidity of the cold-formed steel joints is
   explicitly taken into account through modelling of the bolt-hole
   elongation stiffness. In addition, the shell element idealisation is
   able to capture buckling of the cold-formed steel sections in the
   vicinity of the joints. The shell element idealisation is validated at
   ambient temperature against the results of full-scale tests reported in
   the literature. The behaviour at elevated temperatures is then
   considered for both the semi-rigid jointed shell and rigid-jointed beam
   idealisations. The inclusion of accurate joint rigidity and geometric
   non-linearity (second order analysis) are shown to affect the collapse
   behaviour at elevated temperatures. For each fire scenario considered,
   the importance of base fixity in preventing an undesirable outwards
   collapse mechanism is demonstrated. The results demonstrate that joint
   rigidity and varying fire scenarios should be considered in order to
   allow for conservative design.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we use a high-resolution numerical model to examine the
   tidal flooding and draining of muddy channels and vegetated salt marsh
   flats in Minas Basin, Bay of Fundy, by comparison with field
   observations. The Delft3D model is used to simulate the hydrodynamics
   and sediment transport using a horizontal domain composed of three grids
   that achieve the highest resolution in the salt marsh. The model uses a
   flexible-stem vegetation sub-model that parameterizes low marsh
   (Spartina alterniflora) and high marsh (Spartina patens) plants based on
   a force balance according to the stem diameter, stem height and plant
   density with spatial variability based on Lidar topographic surveys. The
   results indicate that strong shallow flows occur in the drainage
   channels at the onset of flooding and at the end of ebb that transport
   high concentrations of suspended sediment of 0.2-0.4 gL(-1). Including
   vegetation in the model causes flow over the marsh to be significantly
   dampened, re-directed into channels, and results in higher correlation
   with observations especially at higher marsh elevations. This work
   indicates the importance vegetation in controlling the hydrodynamics and
   sediment exchanges between salt marshes and tidal flats via tidal
   channel networks.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal morphological changes occur at different scales and at different
   rates that depend on the surface wave forcing conditions and mean water
   level elevations. Storms deliver both energetic waves and elevated mean
   water levels, and can cause large volumes of sediment to erode and
   induce major changes over a short time. The present study uses a sand
   beach-dune system in the laboratory to understand wave-driven
   morphological evolution at high water levels. In a 35.5 m long, 0.9 m
   wide and 1.2 m deep wave flume with regular (monochromatic) waves that
   have a significant wave height of 0.15 m and propagate toward a 0.65 m
   high sand dune, erosion under two different water level regimes that
   represent high storm surges is investigated. The water levels correspond
   to the overwash and inundation regimes on the Sallenger (2000) storm
   impact scale for barrier islands. The work is intended as an extension
   of previous work focusing primarily on the swash, collision and overwash
   regimes. Waves are measured using six capacitance wave probes located
   along the flume, and morphological evolution of the beach-dune system is
   monitored throughout the experiments using a laser scanner. The final
   beach profiles are very different for the overwash and inundation
   experiments, with morphological equilibrium occuring after 1110 and 362
   minutes of testing respectively. Landward recession of the dune crest is
   balanced in both cases by seaward advance of the beach toe and is
   variable in time due to the development and migration of sand bars. The
   observations indicate that severe erosion occurs in the inundation
   regime over a time scale that is much shorter than in the overwash
   regime, suggesting catastrophic destruction of barrier islands under
   extreme storm conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns the coupling between flow, sediment transport and
   morphological changes of dunes. Its objective is to investigate
   intrinsic differences between the flow over equilibrium and
   non-equilibrium dunes that might explain their different behavior. The
   study is based on a dune development experiment previously carried out
   at Queen's University, in which equilibrium dunes were subjected to a
   sudden decrease in flow depth. For the present purposes, the equilibrium
   dunes in the experiment under consideration were recreated and
   immobilized, to enable the study of the flow field at equilibrium state,
   and just after the flow depth was suddenly decreased. It was found that
   the near bed time-averaged flow characteristics, as well as the near bed
   streamwise Reynolds stresses do not correlate well with the observed
   dune morphological changes. This study further suggests that the local
   bed-load rates and the local bed shear stress are not as strongly
   correlated as in the case of uniform flows.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the time-growth of meander loops is considered in the
   light of regime development. It is shown that this has the following
   implications: 1- the slope of a meandering stream must, at any stage of
   its development, be larger than the regime slope; 2- streams remain
   straight if the valley slope is smaller than the regime slope; and 3-
   not all meandering streams are destined to evolve to cut-off. The
   validity of these implications is largely confirmed in this paper on the
   basis of natural stream data of sand and gravel streams. For the present
   purposes, use is made of all straight and meandering river data
   available to the writers. The regime channel geometry, and consequently,
   the regime slope, is determined with the aid of the thermodynamic based
   regime method of Yalin and da Silva. The paper is used also as an
   opportunity to illustrate how substantial insight can be gained on
   meandering planimetric adjustments of equilibrium after changes in flow
   rate (induced by climatic changes or other reasons) by considering
   regime development principles.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide facilities management
   (FM) practitioners and researchers with a better understanding of the FM
   industry sector by analyzing the trend of its development.
   Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interview is adopted in
   this research as the main methodology. In total, 30 FM professionals in
   the UK were interviewed to explore the past, present and future of FM.
   The analysis of interview results helps to identify the key areas in
   which FM has changed, is changing and will change. It also helps to
   explain the implications of FM development in each key area.
   Findings - FM evolves and matures continuously. It is important for FM
   organizations and practitioners to recognize the dynamic nature of this
   industry sector, based on which they can develop appropriate strategies
   to adapt to changing circumstances. This is probably the only way for
   them to keep pace with the times.
   Originality/value - Both backward looking and forward looking are
   crucial to the development of an industry sector. However, existing
   studies on FM development are conducted through either review or
   outlook. On the other hand, most of these studies focus on one
   particular management area or one particular industry sector. Based on
   30 expert interviews, this research attempts to bridge the knowledge gap
   and analyze the trend of FM development in a systematic way. A better
   understanding of the trend provides a possibility and a guide for FM
   organizations and practitioners to pursue best practice.}},

Title = {{An investigation of indoor air quality, thermal comfort and sick

Journal = {{SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{329-348}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Concern of the deterioration of indoor environmental quality
   as a result of energy efficient building design strategies is growing.
   Apprehensions of the effect of airtight, super insulated envelopes, the
   reduction of infiltration, and the reliance on mechanical systems to
   provide adequate ventilation (air supply) is promoting emerging new
   research in this field. The purpose of this paper is to present the
   results of an indoor air quality (IAQ) and thermal comfort investigation
   in UK energy efficient homes, through a case study investigation.
   Design/methodology/approach - The case study dwellings consisted of a
   row of six new-build homes which utilize mechanical ventilation with
   heat recovery (MVHR) systems, are built to an average airtightness of
   2m(3)/m(2)/hr at 50 Pascal's, and constructed without a central heating
   system. Physical IAQ measurements and occupant interviews were conducted
   during the summer and winter months over a 24-hour period, to gain
   information on occupant activities, perception of the interior
   environment, building-related health and building use.
   Findings - The results suggest inadequate IAQ and perceived thermal
   comfort, insufficient use of purge ventilation, presence of fungal
   growth, significant variances in heating patterns, occurrence of sick
   building syndrome symptoms and issues with the MVHR system.
   Practical implications - The findings will provide relevant data on the
   applicability of airtight, mechanically ventilated homes in a UK
   climate, with particular reference to IAQ.
   Originality/value - IAQ data of this nature is essentially lacking,
   particularly in the UK context. The findings will aid the development of
   effective sustainable design strategies that are appropriate to
   localized climatic conditions and sensitive to the health of building
   occupants.}},

Abstract = {{This paper draws upon an analysis of operational planning to highlight
   the centrality of ethics in praxis. In this context, political
   liberalism is particularly helpful in developing a deeper understanding
   of the activities of those engaged in planning decision making. At the
   most basic level, it demonstrates the importance of not only using
   shared liberal values as the foundation for public discourses, but also
   achieving consensus through the development of an inclusive evidence
   base, derived from both lay and professional knowledge. Though it has
   limitations, political liberalism provides a practical critique,
   enabling judgements to be made on problems which pervade operational
   planning practice and an evaluation to be conducted of the dynamic
   between, and actions of, participants.}},

Abstract = {{Water reuse is an increasingly popular consideration for municipalities,
   developers, and businesses. Currently, the majority of water reuse
   applications originate from Australia, Southeast Asian nations, and the
   Middle East. Stresses posed by population growth and/or water scarcity
   seem to be the primary drivers for the prevalence of reuse applications
   in these regions. However, an increasing number of regions in North
   America are in the process of implementing or have already implemented
   some form of water reuse. As a result, this paper aims to present an
   overview of the history and current state of reuse in North America,
   with the objective of defining past and current challenges, gaps in
   current research, and necessary steps for more robust reuse
   applications. Ultimately, the paper critically assesses the trajectory
   of reuse projects in North America from the 1970s onwards; highlighting
   the gradual shift in focus from technological feasibility to public
   perception studies associated with water reuse.}},

Abstract = {{Municipalities are experiencing a growing water management challenge as
   a result of population growth in water-dependent communities. Population
   growth and stricter regulations on enhanced stormwater management have
   motivated some municipalities to reuse stormwater. Stormwater reuse can
   reduce potable water demand and encourage water conservation,
   alleviating the burden on existing drinking water and stormwater
   infrastructure and potentially delay their future expansion. Although
   stormwater reuse is a relatively new and unregulated practice within
   Canada, the rising cost of potable water, in addition to limits placed
   on stormwater discharges, provide opportunities for its adoption. The
   aim of the paper is to present a novel decision-making framework to
   identify design factors and approaches which may aid municipalities in
   the implementation of stormwater reuse. The decision-making framework
   includes the following factors: quantity of reused water; treatment of
   reused water; water reuse pricing; site constraints in reuse
   implementation; policy considerations in reuse implementation. Potential
   subcategories and methods of structuring the framework are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In Canada, increases in rural development has led to a growing need to
   effectively manage the resulting municipal and city sewage without the
   addition of significant cost-and energy-expending infrastructure.
   Stoning Septic Service Limited is a family-owned, licensed wastewater
   treatment facility located in eastern Ontario; it makes use of a passive
   waste stabilization pond system to treat and dispose of waste and
   wastewater in an environmentally responsible manner Stoning Septic, like
   many other similar wastewater treatment facilities across Canada, has
   the potential to act as an eco-friendly facility that municipalities and
   service providers can utilize to manage and dispose of their wastewater
   emissions. However, it is of concern that the substantial incursion of
   third party material may be detrimental to the pond system. In order to
   augment the current facility into a self-sustaining system with the
   capacity to safely accept septage from other sewage haulers, it was
   hypothesized that pond effluent may be further treated by three
   different technology solutions to reduce wastewater quality parameters
   to quantities below the limits set by the MOE. Two of these solutions
   make use of biofilm technology and bacterial organisms in order to
   improve wastewater parameters, and the third utilizes the natural water
   filtration capabilities of zebra mussels. Pilot scale testing involved
   monitoring and analyzing the effects on water effluent quality by each
   of these three technologies in both cold and warm weather. This paper
   analyzes and compares the results of applying each technology, and aims
   to understand the important mechanisms behind biological filtration
   methods in order to choose and optimize the best treatment strategy. In
   doing so, a recommendation matrix is provided with the potential to be
   used as a universal implementation strategy for wastewater treatment
   facilities located in environments of similar climate and ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Energy efficient building design strategies are growing in
   popularity, promoted through increased awareness of climate change,
   rising energy prices, global consciousness and a demand for energy
   security. To aid this design process, assessment tools such as Code for
   Sustainable Homes (CSHs) and Passivhaus were introduced in the UK.
   However, it is suggested that these tools prioritise energy efficiency
   over occupant health through a fundamental lack of attention to indoor
   air quality (IAQ). The purpose of this paper is to investigate IAQ in
   selected dwellings built using CSHs level 6, level 3 and Passivhaus
   homes in the UK.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a case study approach, the
   investigation consisted of IAQ measurements during summer and winter
   months, occupant diaries and occupant interviews.
   Findings - The results from the IAQ measurements show the recommended
   maximum level of 1,000 ppm was breached in all three Code 6 and two Code
   3 homes, with levels slightly below this limit in the two Passivhaus
   homes. Measurements found high levels of formaldehyde, carbon dioxide
   and low levels of relative humidity.
   Practical implications - There is a need for the adequate consideration
   of IAQ in sustainable assessment methods, including the use of mandatory
   credits to ensure occupant health is not disregarded in the drive
   towards zero carbon.
   Originality/value - These results can be used to recognise areas of
   improvement in the CSHs and Passivhaus standard, and the design of
   energy efficient homes in general. Research of this nature is essential
   to ensure occupant health is not sacrificed through the drive towards
   zero carbon.}},

Abstract = {{The development and application of decellularized extracellular matrices
   (ECM) has grown rapidly in the fields of cell biology, tissue
   engineering and regenerative medicine in recent years. Similar to
   decellularized tissues and whole organs, cell-derived matrices (CDM)
   represent bioactive, biocompatible materials consisting of a complex
   assembly of fibrillar proteins, matrix macromolecules and associated
   growth factors that often recapitulate, at least to some extent, the
   composition and organization of native ECM microenvironments. The unique
   ability to engineer CDM de novo based on cell source and culture methods
   makes them an attractive alternative to conventional allogeneic and
   xenogeneic tissue-derived matrices that are currently harvested from
   cadaveric sources, suffer from inherent heterogeneity, and have limited
   ability for customization. Although CDM have been investigated for a
   number of biomedical applications, including adhesive cell culture
   substrates, synthetic scaffold coatings, and tissue engineered products,
   such as heart valves and vascular grafts, the state of the field is
   still at a relatively nascent stage of development. In this review, we
   provide an overview of the various applications of CDM and discuss
   successes to date, current limitations and future directions.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetometers are sensors that can sense the earth magnetic field from
   which heading can be determined. Gyroscopes can provide the angular rate
   from which the heading can be calculated, they can be available in low
   cost and light weight. Nevertheless, the problem of using gyroscopes as
   a sole source of heading is that gyroscopes readings are drifting with
   time in addition to the accumulated errors due to mathematical
   integration operation. Magnetometer is available in low cost, it does
   not suffer from mathematical integration errors, and it can provide an
   absolute heading from magnetic north. Magnetometer readings are usually
   affected by magnetic fields, other than the earth's field, and by other
   error sources. Therefore, magnetometer calibration is required to use
   magnetometer as a reliable source of heading. In this paper, two
   techniques are proposed for fast automatic 3D-space magnetometer
   calibration requiring small space coverage. There is no user involvement
   during calibration and there are no required specific movements. The
   proposed techniques perform 3D-space magnetometer calibration by
   calibrating the three magnetometer readings in the device frame, which
   makes the magnetometer useful for determining heading in untethered
   devices, especially in pedestrian navigation, in which, portable
   navigation devices (such as smartphones) are always moving freely
   between the user's hands, belt, pocket, or placed on the ear during
   phone calls. The two proposed magnetometer calibration techniques are
   also capable of calibrating magnetometers in tethered devices, given
   that the platform to which the device is tethered is capable of
   performing 3D motion.}},

Abstract = {{New isobutylene-rich elastomers bearing multiple pendant styrenic,
   acrylic, maleimidic, vinylic, and allylic functional groups have been
   prepared and examined in the context of peroxide-initiated crosslinking.
   Halide displacement from brominated poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene) (BIIR)
   by the requisite carboxylate nucleophiles in homogeneous toluene
   solutions provide the desired esters in quantitative yield without
   complications from dehydrohalogenation or premature crosslinking.
   Heating the resulting macromonomers with dicumyl peroxide to 160 degrees
   C under solvent-free conditions gives thermoset derivatives, with
   reaction rates and yields depending markedly on functional group
   structure. In general, high cure extents can only be achieved using
   highly reactive pendant functional groups, owing to the competitive
   balance between crosslinking through CC oligomerization, and degradation
   through -scission of backbone macroradical intermediates. Independent
   control of crosslinking rates and cure extents is gained through the use
   of nitroxyl radical traps bearing acrylate functionality. (c) 2014 Wiley

Title = {{Arsenic(III,V) adsorption onto charred dolomite: Charring optimization
   and batch studies}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{259}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{In this work, the removal of arsenic from aqueous solutions onto
   thermally processed dolomite is investigated. The dolomite was thermally
   processed (charred) at temperatures of 600, 700 and 800 degrees C for 1,
   2, 4 and 8 h. Isotherm experiments were carried out on these samples
   over a wide pH range. A complete arsenic removal was achieved over the
   pH range studied when using the 800 degrees C charred dolomite. However,
   at this temperature, thermal degradation of the dolomite weakens its
   structure due to the decomposition of the magnesium carbonate, leading
   to a partial dissolution. For this reason, the dolomitic sorbent chosen
   for further investigations was the 8 h at 700 degrees C material.
   Isotherm studies indicated that the Langmuir model was successful in
   describing the process to a better extent than the Freundlich model for
   the As(V) adsorption on the selected charred dolomite. However, for the
   As(III) adsorption, the Freundlich model was more successful in
   describing the process. The maximum adsorption capacities of charred
   dolomite for arsenite and arsenate ions are 1.846 and 2.157 mg/g,
   respectively. It was found that both the pseudo first- and second-order
   kinetic models are able to describe the experimental data (R-2 > 0.980).
   The data suggest the charring process allows dissociation of the
   dolomite to calcium carbonate and magnesium oxide, which accelerates the
   process of arsenic oxide and arsenic carbonate precipitation. (C) 2014

Pages = {{44-66}},
Abstract = {{We have carried out large-eddy simulations of an impinging jet with
   embedded azimuthal vortices, a model of the wake of a helicopter
   hovering in ground effect. The azimuthal vortices are generated by
   sinusoidal forcing of the velocity at the jet exit. They strengthen
   while they are advected towards the ground; when they are close to the
   solid surface, a layer of opposite-sign vorticity is formed at the wall,
   and lifted up to form a secondary vortex that interacts with the primary
   one. Regions of reversed flow are caused by the strong, localised,
   adverse pressure gradient. After this interaction, the primary vortices
   begin to decay, mostly due to the Reynolds shear stresses, which
   contribute to the turbulent diffusion of vorticity term in the budget of
   the phase-averaged azimuthal vorticity. This mechanism is extremely
   robust, and plays the most important role in the vortex decay even if no
   turbulence is initially present in the jet, or if the no-slip condition
   is removed. A three-dimensional instability also plays a role: removing
   it leads to slower decay. Our results also point out some challenges for
   turbulence models for the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
   equations.}},

Title = {{Investigation of the process energy demand in polymer extrusion: A brief

Abstract = {{Extrusion is one of the fundamental production methods in the polymer
   processing industry and is used in the production of a large number of
   commodities in a diverse industrial sector. Being an energy intensive
   production method, process energy efficiency is one of the major
   concerns and the selection of the most energy efficient processing
   conditions is a key to reducing operating costs. Usually, extruders
   consume energy through the drive motor, barrel heaters, cooling fans,
   cooling water pumps, gear pumps, etc. Typically the drive motor is the
   largest energy consuming device in an extruder while barrel/die heaters
   are responsible for the second largest energy demand. This study is
   focused on investigating the total energy demand of an extrusion plant
   under various processing conditions while identifying ways to optimise
   the energy efficiency. Initially, a review was carried out on the
   monitoring and modelling of the energy consumption in polymer extrusion.
   Also, the power factor, energy demand and losses of a typical extrusion
   plant were discussed in detail. The mass throughput, total energy
   consumption and power factor of an extruder were experimentally observed
   over different processing conditions and the total extruder energy
   demand was modelled empirically and also using a commercially available
   extrusion simulation software. The experimental results show that
   extruder energy demand is heavily coupled between the machine, material
   and process parameters. The total power predicted by the simulation
   software exhibits a lagging offset compared with the experimental
   measurements. Empirical models are in good agreement with the
   experimental measurements and hence these can be used in studying
   process energy behaviour in detail and to identify ways to optimise the
   process energy efficiency. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper describes a series of four-point bending tests that were
   conducted, under service loads and to failure, on unreinforced,
   reinforced and post-tensioned glulam timber beams, where the reinforcing
   tendon used was 12 mm diameter toughened steel bar. The research was
   designed to evaluate the benefits offered by including an active
   reinforcement in contrast to the passive reinforcement typically used
   within timber strengthening works, in addition to establishing the
   effect that bonding the reinforcing tendon has on the materials
   performance.
   The laboratory investigations established that the flexural strength and
   stiffness increased for both the reinforced and post-tensioned timbers
   compared to the unreinforced beams. The flexural strength of the
   reinforced timber increased by 29.4\%, while the stiffness increased by
   28.1\%. Timber that was post-tensioned with an unbonded steel tendon
   showed a flexural strength increase of 17.6\% and an increase in
   stiffness of 8.1\%. Post-tensioned beams with a bonded steel tendon
   showed increases in flexural strength and stiffness of 40.1\% and 30\%

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},

Abstract = {{Biomass combustion produces renewable energy, but generates hazardous
   ash that must be disposed. High-volume of fine ash from the biomass
   combustion could be a harmful pollutant which causes lung cancer.
   Recycling the ash in cement is an environmentally-friendly solution
   especially for the cement industry. The objectives of this paper were to
   (1) characterize the ash from switchgrass combustion in a lab-designed
   furnace and (2) evaluate the material properties of cement containing
   switchgrass combustion ash. Cement-ash blends tested in this study
   contained 10\% and 20\% of ground ash (by weight) and chemical
   accelerators (5\% Na2SO4 or 5\% CaCl2 center dot 2H(2)O). Switchgrass
   combusted at 411 degrees C generated 5\% ash by weight. After grinding
   for 30 s, ground ash had a porous structure with 65.0 mu m of mean
   particle size and 41.2 m(2)/g of BET surface area. Ground ash consisted
   of 67.2\% of SiO2 and its structure contained 72.2\% of amorphous
   crystal. This ash was a good pozzolan in blended cement, and its
   pozzolanic activity was improved by adding chemical accelerators (5\%
   Na2SO4 and 5\% CaCl2 center dot 2H(2)O were equally effective). Blended
   cement with 10\% ash and either 5\% Na2SO4 or 5\% CaCl2 center dot
   2H(2)O had similar material properties (strength and expansion
   resistance) as conventional Portland cement. Hence, recycling the
   switchgrass ash in the cement proved to be technically applicable. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, niobium doping is evaluated as a means of enhancing the
   electrochemical performance of a Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-delta (SFM) perovskite
   structure cathode material for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel
   cells (IT-SOFCs) applications. As the radius of Nb approximates that of

   improve material performance. A series of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5-xNb5O6-delta (x
   = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) cathode materials are prepared and the phase
   structure, chemical compatibility, microstructure, electrical
   conductivity, polarization resistance and power generation are
   systematically characterized. Among the series of samples,
   Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.4Nb0.10O6-delta (SFMNb0.10) exhibits the highest
   conductivity value of 30 S cm(-1) at 550 degrees C, and the lowest area
   specific resistance of 0.068 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C. Furthermore,
   an anode-supported single cell incorporating a SFMNb0.10 cathode
   presents a maximum power density of 1102 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C.
   Furthermore no obvious performance degradation is observed over 15 h at
   750 degrees C with wet H-2 (3\% H2O) as fuel and ambient air as the
   oxidant. These results demonstrate that SFMNb shows great promise as a
   novel cathode material for IT-SOFCs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Thermal stability is of major importance in polymer extrusion, where
   product quality is dependent upon the level of melt homogeneity achieved
   by the extruder screw. Extrusion is an energy intensive process and
   optimisation of process energy usage while maintaining melt stability is
   necessary in order to produce good quality product at low unit cost.
   Optimisation of process energy usage is timely as world energy prices
   have increased rapidly over the last few years. In the first part of
   this study, a general discussion was made on the efficiency of an
   extruder. Then, an attempt was made to explore correlations between melt
   thermal stability and energy demand in polymer extrusion under different
   process settings and screw geometries. A commodity grade of polystyrene
   was extruded using a highly instrumented single screw extruder, equipped
   with energy consumption and melt temperature field measurement.
   Moreover, the melt viscosity of the experimental material was observed
   by using an off-line rheometer. Results showed that specific energy
   demand of the extruder (i.e. energy for processing of unit mass of
   polymer) decreased with increasing throughput whilst fluctuation in
   energy demand also reduced. However, the relationship between melt
   temperature and extruder throughput was found to be complex, with
   temperature varying with radial position across the melt flow. Moreover,
   the melt thermal stability deteriorated as throughput was increased,
   meaning that a greater efficiency was achieved at the detriment of melt
   consistency. Extruder screw design also had a significant effect on the
   relationship between energy consumption and melt consistency. Overall,
   the relationship between the process energy demand and thermal stability
   seemed to be negatively correlated and also it was shown to be highly
   complex in nature. Moreover, the level of process understanding achieved
   here can help to inform selection of equipment and setting of operating
   conditions to optimise both energy and thermal efficiencies in parallel.

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{355-361}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Mesoporous materials were used as adsorbents for dye removal in
   different media: non-ionic, buffered and saline. The mesoporous
   materials used were commercial (silica gel) as well as as-synthesised
   materials (SBA-15 and a novel mesoporous carbon). Dye adsorption onto
   all the materials was very fast and the equilibrium was reached before 1
   h. The pH has a significant influence on the adsorption capacity for the
   siliceous materials since the electrostatic interactions are the driving
   forces. However, the influence of the pH on the adsorption capacity of
   the carbonaceous material was lower, since the van der Waals
   interactions are the driving forces. The ionic strength has a great
   impact on the siliceous materials adsorption capacity, being their
   adsorption capacity in a buffered medium six times higher than the
   corresponding to a non-ionic medium. Nevertheless, ionic strength does
   not influence on the dye adsorption on the mesoporous carbon. Overall,
   the as-synthesised carbon material presents a clear potential to treat
   dye effluents, showing high adsorption capacity (q(e) approximate to 200
   mg/g) in all the pH range studied (from 3 to 11); even at low
   concentrations (C-e approximate to 10 mg/L) and at short contact times
   (t(e) < 30 min). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Novel composite ionic liquid and polyimide membranes with dissolved
   RuCI3 catalyst for H-2/CO reactive separation were fabricated to combine
   gas diffusive separation and water-gas shift reaction. The CO
   concentration in the membranes is reduced via its reaction with H2O to
   form CO2 and H-2, catalysed by the Ru carbonyl complex which forms in
   the reaction between dissolved RuCI3 and CO. In order to optimize the
   membrane configurations and operating conditions, water-gas shift
   reaction turnover frequencies (TOFs) of the membranes with various
   concentrations of ionic liquid and RuCI3 were determined at different
   pressures, temperatures and times-on-stream on a purpose-built test rig.
   The results show that the ionic liquid, {[}C(4)mim]{[}OTf] improves TOFs
   by increasing the solubilities of H2O and the gases solubilities within
   the membrane. TOFs were found to increase initially, but reduce as
   time-on-stream increased, due to the formation and subsequent
   evaporation of a Ru carbonyl complex. Lower temperature and lower
   concentration of {[}C(4)mim]{[}OTf] were found to minimize the loss of
   the catalyst. It is suggested that the 2 wt\% RuCl3 center dot XH2O + 20
   wt\% {[}C(4)mim]{[}OTf] + Pl membrane operated at 140 degrees C and 2
   bar has the best combination of reactivity and durability. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Total suspended matter (TSM) concentrations were derived from ocean
   colour imagery (MERIS satellite data) in Minas Basin. Analysis of time
   series of TSM in 1-km(2) pixel boxes revealed an annual cycle in TSM in
   most parts of the Basin. Higher TSM of up to 85 g/m(3) was observed in
   late-winter (February-March), and lower TSM of 5-10 g/m(3) characterized
   late-summer (July-August). The largest annual variation occurred in the
   centre of Basin, and the smallest variation occurred in shallow areas.
   Satellite-derived TSM, supported by in situ observations, were compared
   to predictions using the Delft3D model. Increasing model erosion rate in
   winter relative to summer improved agreement between model and
   satellite-derived TSM. In comparison with the satellite-derived
   estimates, the model underestimated TSM in. shallow areas in summer and
   overestimated it in winter. This discrepancy is likely due to inaccurate
   satellite-derived TSM in shallow, high-concentration areas of the Basin.

Abstract = {{In this study, contributions of both local steric and remote baroclinic
   effects (i.e., steric variations external to the region of interest) to
   the inter-annual variability of winter sea level in the North Sea, with
   respect to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), for the period of
   1953-2010 are investigated. On inter-annual time scales in this period,
   the NAO is significantly correlated to sea level variations in the North
   Sea only in the winter months (December-March), while its correlation to
   sea temperature over much of the North Sea is only significant in
   January and February. The discrepancy in sea level between observations
   and barotropic tide and surge models forced by tides and local
   atmospheric forcing, i.e., local atmospheric pressure effects and winds,
   in the present study are found to be consistent with previous studies.
   In the North Sea, local thermosteric effects caused by thermal expansion
   play a minor role on winter-mean NAO related sea level variability
   compared with atmospheric forcing. This is particularly true in the
   southeastern North Sea where water depths are mostly less. than 25 m.
   Our calculations demonstrate that the discrepancy can be mostly
   explained by remote baroclinic effects, which appear as water mass
   exchanges on the continental shelf and are therefore only apparent in
   ocean bottom pressure. In the North Sea, NAO related sea level
   variations seem to be a hybrid of barotropic and baroclinic processes.
   Hence, they can only be adequately modelled with three-dimensional
   baroclinic ocean models that include contributions of baroclinic effects
   and large-scale atmospheric forcing external to the region of interest.

Abstract = {{Economic and environmental load dispatch aims to determine the amount of
   electricity generated from power plants to meet load demand while
   minimizing fossil fuel costs and air pollution emissions subject to
   operational and licensing requirements. These two scheduling problems
   are commonly formulated with non-smooth cost functions respectively
   considering various effects and constraints, such as the valve point
   effect, power balance and ramprate limits. The expected increase in
   plug-in electric vehicles is likely to see a significant impact on the
   power system due to high charging power consumption and significant
   uncertainty in charging times. In this paper, multiple electric vehicle
   charging profiles are comparatively integrated into a 24-hour load
   demand in an economic and environment dispatch model. Self-learning
   teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) is employed to solve the
   non-convex non-linear dispatch problems. Numerical results onwell-known
   benchmark functions, as well as test systems with different scales of
   generation units show the significance of the new scheduling method.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented to phase-modulate RF pulses through an
   injection-locking technique. The modulator can produce either binary
   phase-shift keying or quadrature phase-shift keying modulated wave
   packets (pulses). The RF pulses are produced using a fast on/off
   switching technique to power up and power down a tunable ring oscillator
   whose free-running frequency can be tuned from 3 to 10 GHz. Experiments
   show that the modulator's minimum energy consumption is 13 pJ/pulse for
   a carrier frequency of 3 GHz, while its maximum consumption is 18
   pJ/pulse when the carrier frequency is 10 GHz. The energy consumption
   figures are for 2-ns-long pulses with amplitudes of 300 mV at 3 GHz and
   200 mV at 10 GHz. The pulse repetition rate is 250 MHz. The measured
   root-mean-square jitter of the oscillator, integrated from 100 Hz to 1
   MHz, is below 3.6 ps. The chip was fabricated in 130-nm CMOS and it
   occupies a total area of 0.85 mm(2) including bonding pads while the
   active circuit area is 0.05 mm(2).}},

Journal = {{OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{102}},

Abstract = {{Marine spatial planning (MSP) is an important aspect of the current
   European, UK and Scottish environmental agenda. The European
   Commission's recently published draft directive to create a common
   framework for MSP and integrated coastal management in EU waters and
   coastal areas is an indication that the sustainable management of marine
   and coastal waters is a pressing issue. The development of the Shetland
   Islands' Marine Spatial Plan (SMSP) was initiated by the Scottish
   Government in 2006 and is an example of a progressive regional marine
   spatial plan. The SMSP has successfully provided a policy framework and
   baseline spatial data to guide the placement of marine developments.
   Through policy, it provides suggestions, proposes directions and
   highlights opportunity for development. A model which maps cumulative
   pressures around the Shetland Islands, based on an ecosystem-based risk
   assessment and extensive knowledge of existing marine activities and
   uses, is the next step in identifying areas for action and marine policy
   formulation. This model may be used in comparable marine plan regions
   with access to comprehensive mapped activity data and local expertise to
   develop their own methodologies in addressing cumulative impacts. This
   research also aligns with the Marine Strategy Framework Directive which
   requires an analysis of the predominant pressures and impacts, including
   human activity, on the environmental status of marine waters which inter
   alia covers the main cumulative and synergetic effects. (c) 2014

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1145-1158}},

Abstract = {{Granular anchors (GAs) can resist pullout/uplift forces, compression
   forces and also provide ground improvement. Under pullout loading, a
   centrally located tendon transtmits the applied surface load to the base
   of the granular column via a base plate attachment, which compresses the
   column causing significant dilation of the granular material to occur,
   thereby forming the anchor. This paper describes a program of field
   testing and numerical modelling of the pullout resistance of GA
   installations in overconsolidated clay for the undrained (short term)
   condition. Pertinent modes of failure are identified for different
   column length to diameter (LID) ratios. The applied pullout load is
   resisted in shaft capacity for short GAs or in end-bulging of the
   granular column for long GAs. In other words, the failure mode is
   dependent on the column L/D ratio. A novel modification in which the
   conventional flat base-plate is replaced by a suction cup was shown to
   significantly improve the undrained ultimate pullout capacity of short
   GAs. (C) 2014 The Japanese Geotechnical Society. Production and hosting

Abstract = {{An ODS 316 austenitic steel was fabricated and irradiated using dual ion
   beams (1 MeV Kr+ and 15 keV He+) with in-situ transmission electron
   microscope (TEM) observation. Cavities formed at a low dose in samples
   irradiated with simultaneous helium injection. It was found that Y-Ti-O
   particles acted as strong traps for cavity formation at low doses.
   Helium exhibited a significant effect on cavity development. Cavities
   were also preferentially nucleated along grain boundaries, phase
   boundaries and twin boundaries. Irradiation induced lattice defects
   mainly consisted of small 1/2 < 110 > perfect loops and 1/3 < 111 >
   Frank loops. An increment of helium injection rate also greatly enhanced
   the Frank loop growth. Small (<10 nm) Y-Ti-O particles were found to be
   unstable after irradiation to high doses. M23C6 precipitates were
   observed after irradiation and helium might play a major role in their
   formation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for semiblind
   channel estimation in amplify-and-forward two-way relay networks
   employing square QAM, assuming flat-fading channel conditions. The
   derived bound is exact as it is based on the true likelihood function
   that takes into account the statistics of the transmitted data symbols.
   Using the new bound, we show that exploiting even a limited number of
   transmitted data symbols in addition to the pilot symbols leads to
   substantial estimation accuracy improvements over conventional
   pilot-based estimation. We also propose a semiblind
   expectation-maximization-based estimation algorithm that performs very
   close to the exact CRB at an affordable computational cost. The superior
   accuracy of the semiblind approach makes it possible to significantly
   reduce the training overhead for channel estimation, thus offering a
   higher throughput and a better tradeoff between accuracy and spectral
   efficiency. We also derive the modified CRB, which approximates the
   exact CRB at high SNR for low modulation orders.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},

Abstract = {{Distributed fiber optic sensors have the potential to be used to detect
   three critical deterioration mechanisms in steel structures: (1) fatigue
   cracking, (2) localized damage or deterioration, and (3) distributed
   damage or deterioration, such as corrosion. This study investigated the
   strain and spatial resolution of distributed fiber optic sensors and
   explored the potential benefits and challenges of using distributed
   fiber optic strain sensors for damage/deterioration detection. The
   experimental program consisted of a series of axial tension tests
   performed on steel plate specimens with three types of simulated
   damage/deterioration: cracking, local cross section reduction, and
   distributed cross section reduction. The results indicate that similar
   accuracy to strain gauges can be achieved and distributed fiber optic
   strain sensors can provide much more detailed information about specimen
   behavior. The results of a finite-element analysis for each specimen
   were compared with the experimental measurements. There was good
   correlation between the two if the boundary conditions were modeled
   properly. However, care must be taken when selecting the sensing fiber
   to be used and when interpreting the results. (C) 2014 American Society

   Decks with FRP Stay-in-Place Forms Using the Theory of Plates}},

Abstract = {{A robust analytical model for predicting full response and ultimate load
   of concrete bridge decks constructed with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP)
   stay-in-place (SIP) structural forms is presented. It adopts the plate
   theory to establish surface deflections, while incorporating concrete
   nonlinearity in compression and cracking in tension, as well as the
   degree of bond between the FRP SIP form and the concrete. The model
   accounts for various boundary conditions at the edges of the deck in
   both directions, including both finite and infinite width in the
   direction of traffic, and either fixed or hinged conditions in the other
   direction, depending on the connection to the support girders. A
   punching shear failure criterion was incorporated to predict the
   ultimate load. The model was validated against a large experimental
   database, and reasonable agreement was observed. The average percent
   difference in ultimate loads was 5.5\%. The model was then used in a
   parametric study to assess the FRP reinforcement ratio in terms of the
   FRP plate thickness, the width of the deck parallel to traffic, and the
   span of the deck, which is the girder spacing. It was shown that
   reducing the FRP reinforcement ratio from 10.7 to 2.7\% results in about
   a 20\% reduction in punching shear ultimate load. The ultimate loads
   obtained for decks with (width/span) aspect ratios of 2.73, 1.33, 0.87,
   and 0.55 were 100, 94, 83, and 73\%, respectively, of the ultimate load
   of the real condition of infinite width. Finally, the punching shear
   load decreased by about 18\% as the deck span-to-depth ratio increased
   from 10 to 16.5. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Photovoltaic (PV) solar power generation is proven to be effective and
   sustainable but is currently hampered by relatively high costs and low
   conversion efficiency. This paper addresses both issues by presenting a
   low-cost and efficient temperature distribution analysis for identifying
   PV module mismatch faults by thermography. Mismatch faults reduce the
   power output and cause potential damage to PV cells. This paper first
   defines three fault categories in terms of fault levels, which lead to
   different terminal characteristics of the PV modules. The investigation
   of three faults is also conducted analytically and experimentally, and
   maintenance suggestions are also provided for different fault types. The
   proposed methodology is developed to combine the electrical and thermal
   characteristics of PV cells subjected to different fault mechanisms
   through simulation and experimental tests. Furthermore, the fault
   diagnosis method can be incorporated into the maximum power point
   tracking schemes to shift the operating point of the PV string. The
   developed technology has improved over the existing ones in locating the
   faulty cell by a thermal camera, providing a remedial measure, and
   maximizing the power output under faulty conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The process of ATP production is one of the most vital processes in
   living cells which happens with a high efficiency. Thermodynamic
   evaluation of this process and the factors involved in oxidative

   transduction has been studied qualitatively in several researches, there
   are only few brief reviews based on mathematical models on this subject.
   In our previous work, we suggested a mathematical model for ATP
   production based on non-equilibrium thermodynamic principles. In the
   present study, based on the new discoveries on the respiratory chain of
   animal mitochondria, Golfar's model has been used to generate improved
   results for the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation and the rate of
   energy loss. The results calculated from the modified coefficients for
   the proton pumps of the respiratory chain enzymes are closer to the
   experimental results and validate the model.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed-laser polymerization with subsequent analysis of the polymer
   molar mass distribution by size-exclusion chromatography, PLP-SEC, is
   used to measure the propagation rate coefficient, k(p), of
   N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) in a series of organic solvents, varying the
   NVP concentration from 5 to 100 wt\% and varying the temperature
   between-5 and +80 degrees C. In contrast to the 20-fold increase
   observed in aqueous solution upon decreasing the NVP concentration from
   bulk to dilute conditions, the k(p) values of NVP in butyl acetate,
   iso-propyl acetate, N-ethylpyrrolidone, and N-ethylformamide stay within
   20\% of the bulk value and exhibit no significant dependence on monomer
   concentration. The k(p) behavior of NVP in methanol and n-butanol is
   intermediate between the one in water and in the other organic solvents,
   with k(p) increasing by about a factor of 2 upon lowering the monomer
   concentration from bulk to 5 wt\% NVP. The activation energies for
   propagation in organic solvents agree within experimental uncertainty
   with the value reported for bulk NVP. The data demonstrate that hydrogen
   bonding is responsible for the increase in k(p) upon dilution, with this
   effect being much stronger in an aqueous environment than in a solution
   of alcohol.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is chemically modified by radical mediated
   solvent-free, peroxide-initiated grafting of triallyl trimesate (TAM)
   coagent in the melt state. When compared with the parent material and
   with PLA samples treated with peroxide alone, coagent-modified materials
   demonstrate higher molar mass and improved melt rheological properties,
   including substantial improvements in melt elasticity and strain
   hardening under uniaxial extension. Although similar rheological
   modifications are obtained by PLA chain extension using a
   multi-functional epoxide oligomeric chain extender, the coagent-modified
   material demonstrates significantly enhanced crystallinity and
   crystallization rates. The appearance of a distinct crystallization
   exothermic peak and the disappearance of the cold crystallization
   temperature point to a nucleation effect in the coagent modified PLA,
   which together with the rheological enhancements can promote the
   processability of this material in conventional thermoplastics
   operations.}},

Abstract = {{Photo-induced behavior of polymethacrylate polymer, with cyano
   azobenzene side group, was studied. The photoisomerization process
   occurs in cyano azo polymer, by illumination of a film with polarized
   and unpolarized light. The illumination of the polymer film with light
   results in color change, the color of film gets darker. This is in
   opposition to common azo polymers in which the result of illumination is
   a photo-bleaching. Study of spectrum changes of a dilute polymer
   solution shows that the color change under pump beam illumination is not
   due to interaction between dye molecules. Time evaluation of probe beam
   absorption induced by Ar+ laser pump beam shows the fast change in
   population of isomers at higher light powers. Light induced
   birefringence (LIB) experiments with high power pump beams shows
   uncommon new features. A high long-term stability of LIB is demonstrated
   when the polymer film is kept in the dark. Not only a circular polarized
   light cannot erase the birefringence but it also induces anisotropy in
   polymer film. It appears that this is relevant of a phase transition in
   the polymer film. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A companion paper described the partial-interaction localised properties
   that require the development of pseudo properties. If the quantification
   through experimental testing of these pseudo properties could be removed
   by the use of mechanics-based models, which is the subject of this
   paper, then this would: (a) substantially reduce the cost of developing
   new reinforced concrete products by reducing the amount of testing; (b)
   increase the accuracy of designing existing and novel reinforced
   concrete members and structures, bearing in mind that experimentally
   derived pseudo properties are only applicable within the range of the
   testing from which they were derived; and (c) reduce the cost and
   increase the accuracy of developing reinforced concrete design rules.
   This paper deals with the development of pseudo properties and
   behaviours directly through mechanics, as opposed to experimental
   testing, and their incorporation into member global simulations. It also
   addresses the need for a fundamental shift to displacement-based
   analyses as opposed to strain-based analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Infiltration is a vadose zone process of interest to a wide range of
   research communities including agriculture, soil physics, and
   geotechnical engineering. In geotechnical engineering, transient
   infiltration is important to moisture balance problems such as cover
   systems, capillary breaks, and landslide triggering. Design of cover
   systems, capillary breaks, and landslide analysis applications depend on
   accurate models for the transient pore pressure and moisture migration
   response under a wide range of environmental conditions. Infiltration is
   typically modeled using Richards' equation, which assumes no impedance
   from the pore-air phase. However, if this assumption is invalid, the
   ground response during infiltration is significantly affected. An
   optically matched pore fluid - transparent soil, which allows for high
   temporal and resolution measurements of degree of saturation, was used
   to examine the effect of air entrapment on infiltration. Homogeneous and
   layered profiles were subjected to closed and open infiltration
   conditions. Following the completion of the experimental program, the
   results were simulated using a finite element program that allows for
   consideration of the air phase during infiltration. The results show the
   impact of ignoring the effect of air entrapment is to significantly
   underpredict the time to saturation and overpredict the pore pressure
   response.}},

Abstract = {{Geogenic nickel (Ni), vanadium (V) and chromium (Cr) are present at
   elevated levels in soils in Northern Ireland. Whilst Ni, V and Cr total
   soil concentrations share common geological origins, their respective
   levels of oral bioaccessibility are influenced by different
   soil-geochemical factors. Oral bioaccessibility extractions were carried
   out on 145 soil samples overlying 9 different bedrock types to measure
   the bioaccessible portions of Ni, V and Cr. Principal component analysis
   identified two components (PC1 and PC2) accounting for 69\% of variance
   across 13 variables from the Northern Ireland Tellus Survey geochemical
   data. PC1 was associated with underlying basalt bedrock, higher
   bioaccessible Cr concentrations and lower Ni bioaccessibility. PC2 was
   associated with regional variance in soil chemistry and hosted factors
   accounting for higher Ni and V bioaccessibility. Eight percent of total
   V was solubilised by gastric extraction on average across the study
   area. High median proportions of bioaccessible Ni were observed in soils
   overlying sedimentary rock types. Whilst Cr bioaccessible fractions were
   low (max = 5.4\%), the highest measured bioaccessible Cr concentration
   reached 10.0 mg kg (1), explained by factors linked to PC1 including
   high total Cr concentrations in soils overlying basalt bedrock. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Skin is a dynamic and complex organ that relies on the interaction of
   different cell types, biomacromolecules and signaling molecules. Injury
   triggers a cascade of events designed to quickly restore skin integrity.
   Depending on the size and severity of the wound, extensive physiological
   and metabolic changes can occur, resulting in impaired wound healing and
   increased morbidity resulting in higher rates of death. While wound
   dressings provide a temporary barrier, they are inherently incapable of
   significantly restoring metabolic upsets, post-burn insulin resistance,
   and impaired wound healing in patients with extensive burns. Exogenous
   insulin application has therefore been investigated as a potential
   therapeutic intervention for nearly a century to improve wound recovery.
   This review will highlight the important achievements that demonstrate
   insulin's ability to stimulate cellular migration and burn wound

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problems of effective in situ measurement of
   the real-time strain for bridge weigh in motion in reinforced concrete
   bridge structures through the use of optical fiber sensor systems. By
   undertaking a series of tests, coupled with dynamic loading, the
   performance of fiber Bragg grating-based sensor systems with various
   amplification techniques were investigated. In recent years, structural
   health monitoring (SHM) systems have been developed to monitor bridge
   deterioration, to assess load levels and hence extend bridge life and
   safety. Conventional SHM systems, based on measuring strain, can be used
   to improve knowledge of the bridge's capacity to resist loads but
   generally give no information on the causes of any increase in stresses.
   Therefore, it is necessary to find accurate sensors capable of capturing
   peak strains under dynamic load and suitable methods for attaching these
   strain sensors to existing and new bridge structures. Additionally, it
   is important to ensure accurate strain transfer between concrete and
   steel, adhesives layer, and strain sensor. The results show the benefits
   in the use of optical fiber networks under these circumstances and their
   ability to deliver data when conventional sensors cannot capture
   accurate strains and/or peak strains.}},

   phenomena that may contribute to compromise the integrity of the vessels
   in accident scenarios. Heat transfer through vessel lading results in
   the heat-up of the internal fluid and the increase of vessel internal
   pressure. However, local temperature gradients in the liquid phase cause
   liquid stratification phenomena that result in a more rapid vaporization
   and pressure build-up in the liquid phase. These fundamental phenomena
   were analyzed by a computational fluid dynamic model. The model was
   specifically focused on the early steps of vessel heat-up, when liquid
   stratification plays a relevant role in determining the vessel internal
   pressure. A two-dimensional transient simulation was set up using ANSYS
   FLUENT in order to predict the evolution of the liquid and vapor phases
   during the tank heat up. The model was validated against large scale
   experimental data available for liquefied petroleum gas vessels exposed
   to hydrocarbon fires, and was applied to case studies derived from
   recent accidental events in order to assess the expected time of
   pressure build-up in different fire scenarios. (c) 2014 American

Abstract = {{The co-occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy
   metals (HMs) is very common in contaminated environments. It is of
   paramount importance and great challenge to exploit a bioremediation to
   remove PAHs in these environments with combined pollution. We approached
   this question by probing the influence of HMs coexisting with PAHs on
   the removal of PAHs by Acremonium sp. P0997 possessing metal resistance.
   A removal capability for naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene,
   anthracene, and fluoranthenepresentalone (98.6, 99.3, 89.9, 60.4, and 70
   \%, respectively) and in a mixture (96.9, 71.8, 67.0, 85.0, and 87.9 \%,
   respectively) was achieved in mineral culture inoculated with Acremonium
   sp. P0997, and this strain also displayed high resistance to the
   individual HMs (Mn2+, Fe2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Al3+, and Pb2+). The removal of
   individual PAHs existing in a mixture was differently affected by the
   separately tested HMs. Cu(2+)enhanced the partition process of
   anthracene to dead or alive mycelia and the contribution of the
   biosorption by this strain but imposed a little negative influence on
   the contribution of biodegradation to the total removal of anthracene
   individually in a culture. However, Mn2+ had an inhibitory effect on the
   partition process of anthracene to dead or alive mycelia and decreased
   the contributions of both biosorption and biodegradation to the total
   anthracene removal. This work showcased the value of fungi in
   bioremediation for the environments with combined pollution, and the
   findings have major implications for the bioremediation of organic
   pollutants in metal-organic mixed contaminated sites.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided
   vertebroplasty at 1.5 Tesla using augmented reality image overlay
   navigation.
   Twenty-five unilateral vertebroplasties {[}5 of 25 (20 \%) thoracic, 20
   of 25 (80 \%) lumbar] were prospectively planned in 5 human cadavers. A
   clinical 1.5-Teslan MRI system was used. An augmented reality image
   overlay navigation system and 3D Slicer visualization software were used
   for MRI display, planning, and needle navigation. Intermittent MRI was
   used to monitor placement of the MRI-compatible vertebroplasty needle.
   Cement injections (3 ml of polymethylmethacrylate) were performed
   outside the bore. The cement deposits were assessed on
   intermediate-weighted MR images. Outcome variables included type of
   vertebral body access, number of required intermittent MRI control
   steps, location of final needle tip position, cement deposit location,
   and vertebroplasty time.
   All planned procedures (25 of 25, 100 \%) were performed. Sixteen of 25
   (64 \%) transpedicular and 9 of 25 (36 \%) parapedicular access routes
   were used. Six (range 3-9) MRI control steps were required for needle
   placement. No inadvertent punctures were visualized. Final needle tip
   position and cement location were adequate in all cases (25 of 25, 100
   \%) with a target error of the final needle tip position of 6.1 +/- A
   1.9 mm (range 0.3-8.7 mm) and a distance between the planned needle tip
   position and the center of the cement deposit of 4.3 mm (range 0.8-6.8
   mm). Time requirement for one level was 16 (range 11-21) min.
   MRI-guided vertebroplasty using image overlay navigation is feasible
   allowing for accurate vertebral body access and cement deposition in
   cadaveric thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies.}},

Title = {{Variations in the uranium isotopic compositions of uranium ores from
   different types of uranium deposits}},
Journal = {{GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{1-17}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Variations in U-238/U-235 and U-234/U-238 ratios were measured in
   uranium minerals from a spectrum of uranium deposit types, as well as
   diagenetic phosphates in uranium-rich basins and peraluminous rhyolites
   and associated autunite mineralisation from Macusani Meseta, Peru. Mean
   delta U-238 values of uranium minerals relative to NBL CRM 112-A are
   0.02 parts per thousand for metasomatic deposits, 0.16 parts per
   thousand for intrusive, 0.18 parts per thousand for calcrete, 0.18 parts
   per thousand for volcanic, 0.29 parts per thousand for quartz-pebble
   conglomerate, 0.29 parts per thousand for sandstone-hosted, 0.44 parts
   per thousand for unconformity-type, and 0.56 parts per thousand for
   vein, with a total range in delta U-238 values from -0.30 parts per
   thousand to 1.52 parts per thousand. Uranium mineralisation associated
   with igneous systems, including low-temperature calcretes that are
   sourced from U-rich minerals in igneous systems, have low delta U-238
   values of ca. 0.1 parts per thousand, near those of their igneous
   sources, whereas uranium minerals in basin-hosted deposits have higher
   and more variable values. High-grade unconformity-related deposits have
   delta U-238 values around 0.2 parts per thousand, whereas lower grade
   unconformity-type deposits in the Athabasca, Kombolgie and Otish basins
   have higher delta U-238 values. The delta U-234 values for most samples
   are around 0 parts per thousand, in secular equilibrium, but some
   samples have delta U-234 values much lower or higher than 0 parts per
   thousand associated with addition or removal of U-234 during the past
   2.5 Ma.
   These delta U-238 and delta U-234 values suggest that there are at least
   two different mechanisms responsible for U-238/U-235 and U-234/U-238
   variations. The U-234/U-238 disequilibria ratios indicate recent fluid
   interaction with the uranium minerals and preferential migration of
   U-234. Fractionation between U-235 and U-238 is a result of
   nuclear-field effects with enrichment of U-238 in the reduced insoluble
   species (mostly UO2) and U-235 in oxidised mobile species as uranyl ion,
   UO22+, and its complexes. Therefore, isotopic fractionation effects
   should be reflected in U-238/U-235 ratios in uranium ore minerals formed
   either by reduction of uranium to UO2 or chemical precipitation in the
   form of U6+ minerals. The delta U-238 values of uranium ore minerals
   from a variety of deposits are controlled by the isotopic signature of
   the uranium source, the efficiency of uranium reduction in the case of
   UO2 systems, and the degree to which uranium was previously removed from
   the fluid, with less influence from temperature of ore formation and
   later alteration of the ore. Uranium isotopes are potentially superb
   tracers of redox in natural systems. Crown copyright (C) 2014 Published

Abstract = {{In coral islands, groundwater is a crucial freshwater resource for
   terrestrial life, including human water supply. Response of the
   freshwater lens to expected climate changes and subsequent vegetation
   alterations is quantified for Grande Glorieuse, a low-lying coral island
   in the Western Indian Ocean. Distributed models of recharge,
   evapotranspiration and saltwater phytotoxicity are integrated into a
   variable-density groundwater model to simulate the evolution of
   groundwater salinity. Model results are assessed against field
   observations including groundwater and geophysical measurements.
   Simulations show the major control currently exerted by the vegetation
   with regards to the lens morphology and the high sensitivity of the lens
   to climate alterations, impacting both quantity and salinity. Long-term
   changes in mean sea level and climatic conditions (rainfall and
   evapotranspiration) are predicted to be responsible for an average
   increase in salinity approaching 140 \% (+8 kg m(-3)) when combined. In
   low-lying areas with high vegetation density, these changes top +300 \%
   (+10 kg m(-3)). However, due to salinity increase and its phytotoxicity,
   it is shown that a corollary drop in vegetation activity can buffer the
   alteration of fresh groundwater. This illustrates the importance of
   accounting for vegetation dynamics to study groundwater in coral
   islands.}},

Abstract = {{Very limited studies exist on the durability of green biocomposites,
   particularly resins, in the context of structural engineering
   applications. This paper investigates the durability of concrete
   cylinders wrapped with glass fiber reinforced bioresin made from
   furfuryl alcohol extracted from renewable sources such as corncobs and
   sugar cane. Conditioning was achieved by immersion of various groups of
   glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP)-wrapped 153x305mm cylinders in
   saline solutions with 3\% salt concentration, at 23, 40, and 55 degrees
   C, for up to 300days. The groups included control specimens fabricated
   with conventional epoxy resin for comparison and plain concrete
   cylinders. Specimens were then tested in axial compression,
   periodically, at 29, 97, 182, and 300days. It was shown that control
   unconditioned epoxy-GFRP and bioresin-GFRP wrapped cylinders had the
   same strengthening ratio. (f `(cc)/f `(c) After conditioning for
   300days, the ratio retentions for the bioresin-GFRP was 73\% at all
   temperatures, and were 81, 76, and 76\% for the epoxy-GFRP at the 23,

Title = {{Roughness effects on the Reynolds stress budgets in near-wall turbulence}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{760}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The physics of the roughness sublayer are studied by direct numerical
   simulations (DNS) of an open-channel flow with sandgrain roughness. A
   double-averaging (DA) approach is used to separate the spatial
   variations of the time-averaged quantities and the turbulent
   fluctuations. The spatial inhomogeneity of velocity and Reynolds
   stresses results in an additional production term for the turbulent
   kinetic energy (TKE) - the `wake production'; it is the excess wake
   kinetic energy (WKE), generated from the work of mean flow against the
   form drag, that is not directly dissipated into heat, but instead
   converted into turbulence. The wake production promotes wall-normal
   turbulent fluctuations and increases the pressure work, which ultimately
   leads to more homogeneous turbulence in the roughness sublayer, and to
   the increase of Reynolds shear stress and the drag on the rough wall. In
   the fully rough regime, roughness directly affects the generation of the
   wall-normal fluctuations, while in the transitionally rough regime, the
   region affected by roughness is separated from the region of intense
   generation of these fluctuations. The budget of the WKE and the
   connection between the wake and the turbulence suggest strong
   interactions between the roughness sublayer and the outer layer that are
   insensitive to the variation of the outer-layer conditions. Furthermore,
   the present results may have implications for the relationship between
   the roughness geometry and the flow dynamics in the region directly
   affected by roughness.}},

Abstract = {{Bayesian games can handle the incomplete information about players'
   types. However, in real life, the information could be not only
   incomplete but also ambiguous for lack of sufficient evidence, i.e., a
   player cannot have a precise probability about each type of the other
   players. To address this issue, this paper firstly extends the Bayesian
   games to ambiguous Bayesian games. Then, we introduce the concept of a
   solution to this kind of games and discuss their properties, especially
   about solution existence, how the ambiguity degree and players'
   ambiguity attitude influence the outcomes of an ambiguous Bayesian game,
   the case of lower boundary probability, and the missing situation. We
   also illustrate our game model, especially in the public security

Abstract = {{The thermoforming industry has been relatively slow to embrace modern
   measurement technologies. As a result researchers have struggled to
   develop accurate thermoforming simulations as some of the key aspects of
   the process remain poorly understood. For the first time, this work
   reports the development of a prototype multivariable instrumentation
   system for use in thermoforming. The system contains sensors for plug
   force, plug displacement, air pressure and temperature, plug
   temperature, and sheet temperature. Initially, it was developed to fit
   the tooling on a laboratory thermoforming machine, but later its
   performance was validated by installing it on a similar industrial tool.
   Throughout its development, providing access for the various sensors and
   their cabling was the most challenging task. In testing, all of the
   sensors performed well and the data collected has given a powerful
   insight into the operation of the process. In particular, it has shown
   that both the air and plug temperatures stabilize at more than 80
   degrees C during the continuous thermoforming of amorphous polyethylene
   terephthalate (aPET) sheet at 110 degrees C. The work also highlighted
   significant differences in the timing and magnitude of the cavity
   pressures reached in the two thermoforming machines. The prototype
   system has considerable potential for further development. POLYM. ENG.

Abstract = {{While source code clone detection is a well-established research area,
   finding similar code fragments in binary and other intermediate code
   representations has been not yet that widely studied. In this paper, we
   introduce SeByte, a bytecode clone detection and search model that
   applies semantic-enabled token matching. It is developed based on the
   idea of relaxation on the code fingerprints. This approach separates the
   input content based on the types of tokens into different dimensions,
   with each dimension representing the input content from a specific point
   of view. Following this approach, SeByte compares each dimension
   separately and independently which we refer to as multi-dimensional
   comparison in our research. As the similarity search function we use a
   well-known measure that supports our multi-dimensional comparison
   heuristic, the Jaccard similarity coefficient. Our preliminary study
   shows that SeByte can detect clones that are missed by existing
   approaches due to the differences in the input data and the search
   algorithm. We then further exploit the model to build a scalable
   bytecode clone search engine. This extension meets the requirements of a
   classical search engine including the ranking of result sets. Our
   evaluation with a large dataset of 500,000 compiled Java classes, which
   we extracted from the six most recent versions of the Eclipse IDE,
   showed that our SeByte search is not only scalable but also capable of
   providing a reliable ranking. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We consider the uplink of multicell multipleinput-multiple-output
   systems, where the base stations (BSs), which are equipped with massive
   arrays, simultaneously serve several terminals in the same frequency
   band. We assume that the BS estimates the channel from uplink training
   and then uses the maximum ratio combining technique to detect the
   signals transmitted from all terminals in its own cell. We propose an
   optimal resource allocation scheme that jointly selects the training
   duration, the training signal power, and the data signal power in order
   to maximize the sum spectral efficiency for a given total energy budget
   spent in a coherence interval. Numerical results verify the benefits of
   the optimal resource allocation scheme. Furthermore, we show that more
   training signal power should be used at low signal-to-noise ratios
   (SNRs) and vice versa at high SNRs. Interestingly, for the entire SNR
   regime, the optimal training duration is equal to the number of
   terminals.}},

Abstract = {{Power factor correction (PFC) is an essential part of ac/dc converters
   in order to improve the quality of the current drawn from the utility
   grid. The PFC closed-loop control system requires a precise measurement
   of the boost inductor current in order to tightly shape the input
   current. Current sensors are widely used in the PFC closed-loop control
   system to measure the boost inductor current. Current sensors introduce
   delay and noise to the control circuitry. Also, they significantly
   contribute to the overall cost of the converter. Therefore, they make
   the implementation of the PFC converter complicated and costly. Current
   sensorless control techniques can offer a cost-effective solution for
   various applications. The unique structure of the boost PFC converter
   makes it challenging to robustly estimate the inductor current due to
   the nonlinear structure of the converter. Also, it is shown in this
   paper that the system loses observability at some singular operating
   points, which makes the observer design more challenging. In addition,
   the load value is unknown in most applications. Thus, the observer
   should be able to estimate the inductor current in the presence of
   uncertainties in the load and other parameters. This paper presents an
   adaptive nonlinear observer for the boost PFC, which is able to
   accurately estimate the inductor current. The adaptive structure of the
   converter allows the robust and reliable performance of the observer in
   the presence of parameter uncertainties, particularly load variations.
   Also, an auxiliary compensation is integrated into the observer to
   circumvent the singular operating points and provide a precise
   estimation for the entire range of operation. Experimental results are
   presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed sensorless control
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{The methane solubility in five pure electrolyte solvents and one binary
   solvent mixture for lithium ion batteries - such as ethylene carbonate
   (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethyl methyl
   carbonate (EMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC) and the (50:50 wt\%) mixture of
   EC:DMC was studied experimentally at pressures close to atmospheric and
   as a function of temperature between (280 and 343) K by using an
   isochoric saturation technique. The effect of the selected anions of a
   lithium salt LiX (X = hexafluorophosphate, PF6-; tris(pentafluoroethane)
   trifluorurophosphate, FAP ; bis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl)imide, TFSI )
   on the methane solubility in electrolytes for lithium ion batteries was
   then investigated using a model electrolyte based on the binary mixture
   of EC:DMC (50:50 wt\%) + 1 mol . dm (3) of lithium salt in the same
   temperature and pressure ranges. Based on experimental solubility data,
   the Henry's law constant of the methane in these solutions were then
   deduced and compared together and with those predicted by using COSMO-RS
   methodology within COSMOthermX software. From this study, it appears
   that the methane solubility in each pure solvent decreases with the
   temperature and increases in the following order: EC < PC < EC:EMC
   (50:50 wt\%) < DMC < EMC < DEC, showing that this increases with the van
   der Walls force in solution. Additionally, in all investigated EC:DMC
   (50:50 wt\%) + 1 mol . dm (3) of lithium salt electrolytes, the methane
   solubility decreases also with the temperature and the methane
   solubility is higher in the electrolyte containing the LiFAP salt,
   followed by that based on the LiTFSI one. From the variation of the
   Henry's law constants with the temperature, the partial molar
   thermodynamic functions of solvation, such as the standard Gibbs free
   energy, the enthalpy, and the entropy where then calculated, as well as
   the mixing enthalpy of the solvent with methane in its hypothetical
   liquid state. Finally, the effect of the gas structure on their
   solubility in selected solutions was discussed by comparing methane
   solubility data reported in the present work with carbon dioxide
   solubility data available in the same solvents or mixtures to discern
   the more harmful gas generated during the degradation of the
   electrolyte, which limits the battery lifetime. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper, a dual-channel current source driver is presented as an
   efficient means of driving complementary switches. The driver transfers
   charge between the gates of the power devices through a single magnetic
   core with a discontinuous current. This promotes lower conduction loss
   than continuous current resonant gate drivers (RGDs), and lower
   component count or conduction loss than existing discontinuous current
   RGD applied to complementary switches. In addition, controlled switching
   speed is achieved through nonzero inductor current resulting in lower
   current stress, and faster switching compared to some pulse RGD
   circuits. There is good correlation between the analysis and
   experimental results of a 1.8-MHz prototype.}},

Abstract = {{The sol-gel autocombustion method has been used to synthesize the Ce-Zn
   substituted with composition Sr2-xCexNi2Fe28-yZnyO46 (x=0.02, 0.04,
   0.06, 0.08, 0.010 and y=0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) X-type hexagonal
   ferrites. The XRD analysis confirms the single phase of the material.
   The variation in lattice parameters can be observed with addition of
   Ce-Zn dopant. The ferrites substituted with Ce-Zn contents have low
   value of grain size than the unsubstituted ferrites. The crystallite
   size measured from TEM and HRTEM analysis was found in the range of
   40-45 nm which is in good agreement with the theoretically measured by
   Scherer formula. The room temperature electrical resistivity lies in the
   range of similar to 10(9) Omega-cm, so the investigated sample can be
   considered good material for reducing the eddy current losses. The
   enhancement in magnetic properties (saturation magnetization,
   retentivity and coercivity) has been observed with the substitution of
   Ce-Zn contents in pure ferrites. The increment in resistivity and
   magnetic properties with the substitution of Ce-Zn dopant makes it
   important candidate to be used in the formation of multilayer chip
   inductors (MLCIs). The maximum reflection loss of -23.4 dB at 12.858 GHz
   is obtained by Ce-Zn doped ferrites and attenuation constant agrees well
   with the reflection loss. The microwave absorption properties of this
   substituted material reflect its applications in super high frequency
   (SHF) devices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,}},

Title = {{Compressive behavior of steel fiber reinforced recycled aggregate
   concrete after exposure to elevated temperatures}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{For sustainability considerations, the use of recycled aggregate in
   concrete has attracted many interests in the research community. One of
   the main concerns for using such concrete in buildings is its spalling
   in fire. This may be alleviated by adding steel fibers to form steel
   fiber reinforced recycled aggreeate concrete (SFRAC). This paper
   presents an experimental investigation into the compressive properties
   of SFRAC cylinders after exposure to elevated temperatures, including
   the compressive strength, Young's modulus (stiffness), stress-strain
   curve and energy absorption capacity (toughness). The effects of two
   parameters, namely steel fiber volume content (0\%, 0.5\%, 1\%, 1.5\%)
   and temperature (room temperature, 200 degrees C, 400 degrees C and 600
   degrees C) on the compressive mechanical properties of concrete were
   investigated. The test results show that both compressive strength and
   stiffness of the concrete are significantly reduced after exposure to
   high temperatures. The addition of steel fibers is helpful in preventing
   spalling, and significantly improves the ductility and the cracking
   behavior of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) after exposure to high
   temperatures, which is favorable for the application of RAC in building
   construction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) has shown potential as a
   regenerative scaffold for plastic and reconstructive surgery to augment
   or replace damaged or missing adipose tissue (e.g. following lumpectomy
   or mastectomy). The mechanical properties of soft tissue substitutes are
   of paramount importance in restoring the natural shape and appearance of
   the affected tissues, and mechanical mismatching can lead to
   unpredictable scar tissue formation and poor implant integration. The
   goal of this work was to assess the linear elastic and hyperelastic
   properties of decellularized human adipose tissue and compare them to
   those of normal breast adipose tissue. To assess the influence of the
   adipose depot source on the mechanical properties of the resultant
   decellularized scaffolds, we performed indentation tests on DAT samples
   sourced from adipose tissue isolated from the breast, subcutaneous
   abdominal region, omentum, pericardial depot and thymic remnant, and
   their corresponding force-displacement data were acquired. Elastic and
   hyperelastic parameters were estimated using inverse finite element
   algorithms. Subsequently, a simulation was conducted in which the
   estimated hyperelastic parameters were tested in a real human breast
   model under gravity loading in order to assess the suitability of the
   scaffolds for implantation. Results of these tests showed that in the
   human breast, the DAT would show similar deformability to that of native
   normal tissue. Using the measured hyperelastic parameters, we were able
   to assess whether DAT derived from different depots exhibited different
   intrinsic nonlinearities. Results showed that DAT sourced from varying
   regions of the body exhibited little intrinsic nonlinearity, with no
   statistically significant differences between the groups. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Story understanding involves many perceptual and cognitive subprocesses,
   from perceiving individual words, to parsing sentences, to understanding
   the relationships among the story characters. We present an integrated
   computational model of reading that incorporates these and additional
   subprocesses, simultaneously discovering their fMRI signatures. Our
   model predicts the fMRI activity associated with reading arbitrary text
   passages, well enough to distinguish which of two story segments is
   being read with 74\% accuracy. This approach is the first to
   simultaneously track diverse reading subprocesses during complex story
   processing and predict the detailed neural representation of diverse
   story features, ranging from visual word properties to the mention of
   different story characters and different actions they perform. We
   construct brain representation maps that replicate many results from a
   wide range of classical studies that focus each on one aspect of
   language processing and offer new insights on which type of information
   is processed by different areas involved in language processing.
   Additionally, this approach is promising for studying individual
   differences: it can be used to create single subject maps that may
   potentially be used to measure reading comprehension and diagnose
   reading disorders.}},

Abstract = {{For the first time, a kinetic model considering four-dimensional
   SmithEwart equations is presented to simultaneously calculate the time
   evolution of the conversion, number-average chain length, dispersity,
   end-group functionality (EGF), and short chain branching (SCB) content
   for the miniemulsion NMP of n-butyl acrylate (nBuA), initiated by
   poly(nBuA)-(N-tert-butyl-N-(1-diethylphosphono-2,2-dimethylpropyl) at
   393 K ({[}nBuA](0):{[}poly(nBuA)-SG1](0) = 300). On the basis of
   literature kinetic and diffusion parameters, model analysis reveals that
   backbiting cannot be neglected for an accurate description of the NMP
   characteristics, despite the low number of SCBs formed per chain (ca. 2)
   and that the small loss of EGF at low conversions is mainly caused by
   chain transfer to monomer. SG1 partitioning (partitioning coefficient G
   = 50) between the organic and aqueous phase increases the dispersity and
   polymerization rate at low particle diameters (dp < ca. 50 nm) with a
   limited effect on the EGF profile. However, the extent of these
   increases is very sensitive to the G value, highlighting the relevance
   of its accurate experimental determination in future studies.}},

Title = {{Quasinormal mode approach to modelling light-emission and propagation in
   nanoplasmonics}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{We describe a powerful and intuitive theoretical technique for modeling
   light-matter interactions in classical and quantum nanoplasmonics. Our
   approach uses a quasinormal mode (QNM) expansion of the photon Green
   function within a metal nanoresonator of arbitrary shape, together with
   a Dyson equation, to derive an expression for the spontaneous decay rate
   and far field propagator from dipole oscillators outside resonators. For
   a single QNM, at field positions outside the quasi-static coupling
   regime, we give a closed form solution for the Purcell factor and
   generalized effective mode volume. We augment this with an analytic
   expression for the divergent local density of optical states very near
   the metal surface, which allows us to derive a simple and highly
   accurate expression for the electric field outside the metal resonator
   at distances from a few nanometers to infinity. This intuitive formalism
   provides an enormous simplification over full numerical calculations and
   fixes several pending problems in QNM theory.}},

Title = {{Performance Evaluation of Two-Stage Electrokinetic Washing as Soil
   Remediation Method for Lead Removal using Different Wash Solutions}},
Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{9-18}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{The study explores the application of a two-stage electrokinetic washing
   system on remediation of lead (Pb) contaminated soil. The process
   involved an initial soil washing, followed by an electrokinetic process.
   The use of electrokinetic process in soil washing not only provided
   additional driving force for transporting the desorbed Pb away from the
   soil but also reduced the high usage of wash solution. In this study,
   the effect of NaNO3, HNO3, citric acid and EDTA as wash solutions on
   two-stage electrokinetic washing system were evaluated. The results
   revealed that a two-stage electrokinetic washing process enhanced Pb
   removal efficiency by 2.52-9.08\% and 4.98-20.45\% in comparison to a
   normal electrokinetic process and normal washing process, respectively.
   Low pH and adequate current were the most important criteria in the
   removal process as they provided superior desorption and transport
   properties. The effect of chelating by EDTA was less dominant as it
   delayed the removal process by forming a transport loop in anode region
   between Pb ion and complexes. HNO3 was not suitable as wash solution in
   electrokinetic washing in spite of offering highest removal efficiency
   as it caused pH fluctuation in the cathode chamber, corroded graphite
   anode and showed high power consumption. In contrast, citric acid not
   only yielded high Pb removal efficiency with low power consumption but
   also maintained a low soil: solution ratio of 1 g: <1 mL, stable pH and
   electrode integrity. Possible transport mechanisms for Pb under each
   wash solution are also discussed in this work. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Ionic liquids (ILs) are popular designer green chemicals with great
   potential for use in diverse energy-related applications. Apart from the
   well-known low vapor pressure, the physical properties of ILs, such as
   hydrogen-bond-forming capacity, physical state, shape, and size, can be
   fine-tuned for specific applications. Natural gas hydrates are easily
   formed in gas pipelines and pose potential problems to the oil and
   natural gas industry, particularly during deep-sea exploration and
   production. This review summarizes the recent advances in IL research as
   dual-function gas hydrate inhibitors. Almost all of the available
   thermodynamic and kinetic inhibition data in the presence of ILs have
   been systematically reviewed to evaluate the efficiency of ILs in gas
   hydrate inhibition, compared to other conventional thermodynamic and
   kinetic gas hydrate inhibitors. The principles of natural gas hydrate
   formation, types of gas hydrates and their inhibitors, apparatuses and
   methods used, reported experimental data, and theoretical methods are
   thoroughly and critically discussed. The studies in this field will
   facilitate the design of advanced ILs for energy savings through the
   development of efficient low-dosage gas hydrate inhibitors.}},

Abstract = {{A novel series of polymerisable squaramides has been synthesised in high
   yields using simple chemical reactions, and evaluated in the binding of
   anionic species. These vinyl monomers can be used as functional building
   blocks in co-polymerisations with a plethora of co-monomers or
   cross-linkers, grace to their compatibility with free-radical
   polymerisation reactions. Aromatic substituted squaramides were found to
   be the strongest receptors, while binding of certain anions was
   accompanied by a strong colour change, attributed to the de-protonation
   of the squaramide. The best performing squaramide monomers were
   incorporated in molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) targeting a model
   anion and their capacities and selectivity were evaluated by rebinding
   experiments. Polymers prepared using the new squaramide monomers were
   compared to urea based co-polymers, and were found to contain up to 80\%
   of the theoretical maximum number of binding sites, an exceptionally
   high value compared to previous reports. Strong polymer colour changes
   were observed upon rebinding of certain anions, equivalent to those
   witnessed in solution, paving the way for application of such materials
   in anion sensing devices.}},

Abstract = {{A series of new elastomeric ionomers is prepared through halide
   displacement from brominated poly(isobutylene-co-para-methylstyrene)
   (BIMS) by a range of N-substituted imidazoles. Studies of the dynamics
   of solvent-borne and solvent-free reactions demonstrate the influence of
   N-substituent structure on nucleophilicity, with alkyl and allyl groups
   providing greater reactivity than vinyl functionality. Ionomers bearing
   pendant styrenic, methacrylic, vinylic, and allylic functionality are
   cross-linked by standard peroxide initiators to give thermoset
   derivatives, with reaction rates and yields depending markedly on
   functional group structure. The discovery of a benzylic
   N-allylimidazolium ionomer is particularly important, as this material
   is amenable to solvent-free preparations, and provides a unique
   combination of moderate cross-linking rates and high cure extents, owing
   to a balance of radical addition and H-atom transfer reactivity.
   Physical properties of the resulting thermosets are a product of their
   hybrid ionic/covalent network, as the material response to deformation
   is affected by a stable covalent network as well as a labile network of
   aggregated ion pairs.}},

   stable in a dry environment in air for several hours. A similar
   photoirradiation experiment in the presence of a mask showed that charge
   transfer across the heterojunction occurred approximately normal to the
   TiO2 surface, with little smearing out of the mask image. As a result of
   the highly efficient vectorial charge separation, the photodiodes showed

Abstract = {{An yttrium aluminum (YAl2) intermetallic compound ingot was prepared in
   an induction furnace under vacuum. The microstructure of YAl2 ingot was
   characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and
   X-ray diffraction. The load bearing response of YAl2 intermetallic was
   investigated and compared with SiC ceramic by indentation combined with
   optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, the
   tensile properties of the Mg-Li matrix composites reinforced with
   ultrafine YAl2 particles fabricated by planet ball milling were tested.
   The results show that the intermetallic compound ingot in this
   experiment is composed of a main face-centered-cubic structure YAl2
   phase, a small amount of YAl phase, and minor Y and Al-rich phases. YAl2
   intermetallic compound has excellent stability and shows better
   capability in crack resistance than SiC ceramic. The YAl2 intermetallic
   compound has better deformation compatibility with the Mg-14Li-3Al
   matrix than SiC reinforcement with the matrix, which leads to the
   superior resistance to crack for YAl2p/Mg-14Li-3Al composite compared to
   SiCp/Mg-14Li-3Al composite. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Linking Population Declines with Diet Quality in Vaux's Swifts}},
Journal = {{NORTHWEST SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{305-313}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Over the past 50 years, a range of environmental stressors has resulted
   in aerial insectivores throughout North America experiencing sharp
   population declines. Vaux's swifts (Chaetura vauxi) are small,
   long-distance migratory birds that are currently experiencing range-wide
   population declines, especially at the their northern range limit. Many
   studies attribute the Vaux's swift's population decline to a loss in
   nesting habitat; however, other potentially exacerbating factors, such
   as changes in insect composition and diet, remain unstudied. Here, we
   examine a similar to 26 year dietary archive of Vaux's swift guano to
   ask whether diet composition has changed over time. Vaux's swifts roost
   communally at the same roost sites each year when migrating, often
   within decommissioned brick chimneys. As a result, guano accumulates at
   the base of these roost sites, providing a chronostratified snapshot of
   the bird's historic diet. We obtained a vertical core sample from a
   Vaux's swift guano deposit in a chimney on Vancouver Island, BC, Canada.
   We symmetrically stratified the guano and assessed diet composition by
   visually analyzing egested arthropod exoskeletons, identifying them to
   order, and measuring delta N-15 signatures at each layer. Our 26-year
   data set revealed an increase in the ratio of Hemiptera to Coleoptera
   corresponding with an increase in delta N-15, suggesting a possible
   decline in diet quality through time because Hemipterans tend towards
   higher trophic status than Coleopterans, but are of less caloric value
   per capita. In addition, delta N-15 was significantly negatively
   correlated with an annual population index (Breeding Bird Survey). We
   suggest a reduction in diet quality may be contributing to the decline
   of Vaux's swift populations, and could be contributing to more declines
   in other aerial insectivore species.}},

Abstract = {{The self-heating and heat transfer characteristics of creosote-treated
   wooden railway tie dust and roofing asphalt shingle particles, which are
   considered as low carbon fuels, are investigated. Self-heating was
   measured with isothermal calorimetry and thermal conductivity was
   measured using a guarded hot plate. The self-heating of petroleum coke
   and poplar wood pellets were also measured as reference materials.
   Self-heating models and heat transfer parameters were then defined
   assuming constant moisture content. The self-heating of petroleum coke
   was found to be similar to coal, while both poplar pellets and railway
   tie dust were found to be more reactive compared to oven test results of
   similar materials. As both poplar pellets and railway ties both had
   significant water content, the higher reactivity was attributed to the
   effect of moisture. Furthermore, critical conditions for spontaneous
   combustion were evaluated with the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter, assuming
   an ambient temperature of 40 degrees C. It was found that cubic volumes
   of railway tie dust and asphalt particles, 1.6 m and 58 m to a side,
   respectively, would spontaneously combust; however, compaction effects
   associated with asphalt softening may invalidate the assumptions of the
   Frank-Kamenetskii spontaneous combustion theory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The present research investigates the uptake of phosphate ions from
   aqueous solutions using acidified laterite (ALS), a by-product from the
   production of ferric aluminium sulfate using laterite. Phosphate
   adsorption experiments were performed in batch systems to determine the
   amount of phosphate adsorbed as a function of solution pH, adsorbent
   dosage and thermodynamic parameters per fixed P concentration. Kinetic
   studies were also carried out to study the effect of adsorbent particle
   sizes. The maximum removal capacity of ALS observed at pH5 was 3.68mg
   Pg(-1). It was found that as the adsorbent dosage increases, the
   equilibrium pH decreases, so an adsorbent dosage of 1.0gL(-1) of ALS was
   selected. Adsorption capacity (q(m)) calculated from the Langmuir
   isotherm was found to be 2.73mgg(-1). Kinetic experimental data were
   mathematically well described using the pseudo first-order model over
   the full range of the adsorbent particle size. The adsorption reactions
   were endothermic, and the process of adsorption was favoured at high
   temperature; the G and H values implied that the main adsorption
   mechanism of P onto ALS is physisorption. The desorption studies
   indicated the need to consider a NaOH 0.1M solution as an optimal
   solution for practical regeneration applications. (c) 2014 Curtin

Abstract = {{Reinforced concrete members are extremely complex under loading because
   of localised deformations in the concrete (cracks, sliding planes) and
   between the reinforcement and concrete (slip). An ideal model for
   simulating behaviour of reinforced concrete members should incorporate
   both global behaviour and the localised behaviours that are seen and
   measured in practice; these localised behaviours directly affect the
   global behaviour. Most commonly used models do not directly simulate
   these localised behaviours that can be seen or measured in real members;
   instead, they overcome these limitations by using empirically or
   semi-empirically derived strain-based pseudo properties such as the use
   of effective flexural rigidities for deflection; plastic hinge lengths
   for strength and ductility; and energy-based approaches for both
   concrete softening in compression and concrete softening after tensile
   cracking to allow for tension stiffening. Most reinforced concrete
   member experimental testing is associated with deriving these pseudo
   properties for use in design and analysis, and this component of
   development is thus costly. The aim of the present research is to reduce
   this cost substantially. In this paper, localised material behaviours
   and the mechanisms they induce are described. Their incorporation into

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider robust system identification of FIR systems
   when both sparse outliers and random noises are present. We reduce this
   problem of system identification to a sparse error correcting problem
   using a Toeplitz structured real-numbered coding matrix and prove the
   performance guarantee. Thresholds on the percentage of correctable
   errors for Toeplitz structured matrices are established. When both
   outliers and observation noise are present, we have shown that the
   estimation error goes to 0 asymptotically as long as the probability
   density function for observation noise is not ``vanishing{''} around
   origin. No probabilistic assumptions are imposed on the outliers. (C)

Abstract = {{In this work, a highly instrumented single screw extruder has been used
   to study the effect of polymer rheology on the thermal efficiency of the
   extrusion process. Three different molecular weight grades of high
   density polyethylene (HDPE) were extruded at a range of conditions.
   Three geometries of extruder screws were used at several set
   temperatures and screw rotation speeds. The extruder was equipped with
   real-time quantification of energy consumption; thermal dynamics of the
   process were examined using thermocouple grid sensors at the entrance to
   the die. Results showed that polymer rheology had a significant effect
   on process energy consumption and thermal homogeneity of the melt.
   Highest specific energy consumption and poorest homogeneity was observed
   for the highest viscosity grade of HDPE. Extruder screw geometry, set
   extrusion temperature and screw rotation speed were also found to have a
   direct effect on energy consumption and melt consistency. In particular,
   specific energy consumption was lower using a barrier flighted screw
   compared to single flighted screws at the same set conditions. These
   results highlight the complex nature of extrusion thermal dynamics and
   provide evidence that rheological properties of the polymer can
   significantly influence the thermal efficiency of the process. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We report nonlinear terahertz (THz) effects in monolayer graphene,
   giving rise to transmission enhancement of a single-cycle THz pulse when
   the incident THz peak electric field is increased. This transmission
   enhancement is attributed to reduced photoconductivity, due to
   saturation effects in the field-induced current and increased intraband
   scattering rates arising from transient heating of electrons. We have
   developed a tight-binding model of the response using the length gauge
   interaction Hamiltonian that provides good qualitative agreement. The
   model fully accounts for the nonlinear response arising from the linear
   dispersion energy spectrum in graphene. The results reveal a strong
   dependence of the scattering time on the THz field, which is at the
   heart of the observed nonlinear response. (C) 2014 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of sending a Gaussian source over a fading
   channel with Gaussian interference known to the transmitter. We study
   joint source-channel coding schemes for the case of unequal bandwidth
   between the source and the channel and when the source and the
   interference are correlated. An outer bound on the system's distortion
   is first derived by assuming additional information at the decoder side.
   We then propose layered coding schemes based on proper combination of
   power splitting, bandwidth splitting, Wyner-Ziv and hybrid coding. More
   precisely, a hybrid layer, that uses the source and the interference, is
   concatenated (superimposed) with a purely digital layer to achieve
   bandwidth expansion (reduction). The achievable (square error)
   distortion region of these schemes under matched and mismatched noise
   levels is then analyzed. Numerical results show that the proposed
   schemes perform close to the best derived bound and to be resilient to
   channel noise mismatch. As an application of the proposed schemes, we
   derive both inner and outer bounds on the source-channel-state
   distortion region for the fading channel with correlated interference;
   the receiver, in this case, aims to jointly estimate both the source
   signal as well as the channel-state (interference).}},

Abstract = {{Reliable and energy-efficient reading of Radio Frequency IDentification
   (RFID) tags is of utmost importance, especially in mobile and dense tag

   reader's energy. We propose modulation silencing (MS), a reader-tag
   interaction framework to limit the effect of tag collisions. Utilizing
   relatively simple circuitry at the tag, MS enhances the performance of
   existing anti-collision protocols by allowing readers to terminate
   collision slots once a decoding violation is detected. With shorter
   collision slots, we revisit the performance metrics and introduce a new
   generalized time efficiency metric and an optimal frame selection
   formula that takes into consideration the MS effects. Through analytical
   solutions and extensive simulations, we show that the use of MS results
   in significant performance gains under various scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Developers might follow different file editing patterns when handling
   change requests. Existing research has warned the community about the
   potential negative impacts of some file editing patterns on software
   quality. However, very few studies have provided quantitative evidence
   to support these claims. In this paper, we propose four metrics to
   identify four file editing patterns: concurrent editing pattern,
   parallel editing pattern, extended editing pattern, and interrupted
   editing pattern. Our empirical study on three open source projects shows
   that 90\% (i.e. 1935 out of 2140) of files exhibit at least one file
   editing pattern. More specifically (1) files that are edited
   concurrently by many developers are 1.8 times more likely to experience
   future bugs than files that are not concurrently edited; (2) files
   edited in parallel with too many other files by the same developer are
   2.9 times more likely to exhibit future bugs than files individually
   edited; (3) files edited over an extended period of time are 1.9 times
   more likely to experience future bugs than other files; and (4) files
   edited with long interruptions have 2.0 times more future bugs than
   other files. We also observe that the likelihood of future bugs in files
   experiencing all the four file editing patterns is 3.9 times higher than
   in files that are never involved in any of the four patterns. We further
   investigate factors impacting the occurrence of these file editing
   patterns along three dimensions: the ownership of files, the type of
   change requests in which the files were involved, and the initial code
   quality of the files. Results show that a file with a major owner is 0.6
   times less likely to exhibit the concurrent editing pattern than files
   without major owners. Files with bad code quality (e.g. high McCabe's
   complexity, high coupling between objects, and lack of cohesion) are
   more likely to experience the four editing patterns. By ensuring a clear
   ownership and improving code quality, the negative impact of the four
   patterns could be reduced. Overall, our findings could be used by
   software development teams to warn developers about risky file editing
   patterns. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A new scale-up concept for microwave assisted flow processing is
   presented where modular scale-up is achieved by implementing microwave
   cavities in series. The scale-up concept is demonstrated for case
   studies of a packed-bed reactor and a wall-coated tubular reactor. With
   known kinetics and reaction temperature, a packed-bed reactor gave a
   conversion of 99\% with the highest production rate of 170
   kg(prod)/kg(cat)center dot h for esterification of acetic acid and
   ethanol catalyzed by ion-exchange resin in 18 cavities. A similar
   approach for a multicomponent reaction of benzaldehyde, piperidine, and
   phenylacetylene catalyzed by a thin Cu film in a wall-coated tubular
   reactor gave 99\% conversion with the highest production rate of 7740
   kg(prod)/kg(cat)center dot h in 28 cavities. In both cases, the pseudo
   first order reaction rate with respect to the limiting reactant yielded
   a typical rise in conversion and production rate. In a packed-bed
   reactor-heat exchanger operated at a temperature between 343 and 348 K,
   the conversion in the esterification reaction increased from 22\% to
   88\% when the number of cavities was increased from one to eight. The
   experimental conversions matched the predictions of a packed bed reactor
   model within 5\%. The production capacity in flow reactors, restricted
   to smaller sizes due to a limited microwave penetration depth and
   dominated mainly by the reaction kinetics, was increased by modular
   scale-up with implementation of the microwave multicavity assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental tracers continue to provide an important tool for
   understanding the source, flow and mixing dynamics of water resource
   systems through their imprint on the system or their sensitivity to

   tracer studies were applied to hydrology, the use of isotopes and other
   environmental tracers are still not routinely necessarily applied in
   hydrogeological and water resources investigations where appropriate.
   There is therefore a continuing need to promote their use for developing
   sustainable management policies for the protection of water resources
   and the aquatic environment. This Special Issue focuses on the
   robustness or fitness-for-purpose of the application and use of
   environmental tracers in addressing problems and opportunities

Abstract = {{This article describes the results of a modeling study performed to
   understand the microwave heating process in continuous-flow reactors. It
   demonstrates the influence of liquid velocity profiles on temperature
   and microwave energy dissipation in a microwave integrated milli
   reactor-heat exchanger. Horizontal cocurrent flow of a strong microwave
   absorbing reaction mixture (ethanol + acetic acid, molar ratio 5: 1) and
   a microwave transparent coolant (toluene) was established in a Teflon
   supported quartz tube (i.d.: 3 x 10(-3) m and o.d.: 4 x 10(-3) m) and
   shell (i.d.: 7 x 10(-3) m and o.d.: 9 x 10(-3) m), respectively.
   Modeling showed that the temperature rise of the highly microwave
   absorbing reaction mixture was up to four times higher in the almost
   stagnant liquid at the reactor walls than in the bulk liquid. The
   coolant flow was ineffective in controlling the outlet reaction mixture
   temperature. However, at high flow rates it limits the overheating of
   the stagnant liquid film of the reaction mixture at the reactor walls.
   It was also found that the stagnant layer around a fiber optic
   temperature probe, when inserted from the direction of the flow,
   resulted in much higher temperatures than the bulk liquid. This was not
   the case when the probe was inserted from the opposite direction. The
   experimental validations of these modeling results proved that the
   temperature profiles depend more on the reaction mixture velocity
   profiles than on the microwave energy dissipation/electric field
   intensity. Thus, in flow synthesis, particularly where a focused
   microwave field is applied over a small tubular flow reactor, it is very
   important to understand the large (direct/indirect) influence of reactor
   internals on the microwave heating process. (C) 2014 American Institute

   communication among nodes to allow efficient parallel allocation in a
   global address space; (b) it takes advantage of bulk deallocation and
   good locality with pointer-based data structures; (c) it supports
   ownership semantics of regions by nodes akin to reader-writer locks,
   which makes for a high-level, intuitive synchronization tool in MPI

Abstract = {{In order to meet the recycling and recovery targets set forth by the
   European Union's (EU) Waste and Landfill Directives, both the Irish and
   Czech governments' policy on waste management is changing to meet these
   pressures, with major emphasis being placed upon the management of
   biodegradable municipal waste (BMW). In particular, the EU Landfill
   Directive requires reductions in the rate of BMW going to landfill to
   35\% of 1995 values by 2016 and 2020 for Ireland and the Czech Republic,
   respectively. In this paper, the strategies of how Ireland and the Czech
   Republic plan to meet this challenge are compared. Ireland either
   landfills or exports its waste for recovery, while the Czech Republic
   has a relatively new waste management infrastructure. While Ireland met
   the first target of 75\% diversion of BMW from landfill by 2010 and
   preliminary 2012 data indicate that Ireland is on track to meet the 2013
   target, the achievement of the 2016 target remains at risk. Indicators
   that were developed to monitor the Czech Republic's path to meeting the
   targets demonstrate that it did not meet the first target that was set
   for 2010 and will probably not meet its 2013 target either. The
   evaluation reports on the implementation of Waste Management Plan of
   Czech Republic suggest that the currently applied strategy to divert
   biodegradable waste from landfill is not effective enough. For both
   countries, the EU Waste Framework and Landfill Directives will be a
   significant influence and driver of change in waste management practices
   and governance over the coming decade. This means that both countries
   will not only have to invest in infrastructure to achieve the targets,
   but will also have to increase awareness among the public in diverting
   this waste at the household level. Improving environmental education is
   part of increased awareness as it is imperative for citizens to
   understand the consequences of their actions as affluence continues to
   grow producing increased levels of waste. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper summarises an investigation into the potential advantages to
   the precast concrete industry of using a new `seeding' type of chemical
   admixture in Portland cement (PC) based concrete mixes. Results
   indicated that the addition of 2-4\% nanocrystal seeding chemical (NCS)
   admixture by weight of PC can provide a doubling of early strength,
   particularly at 6 and 12 h. This strength gain could lead to the
   turnover of moulds in precast concrete plants being completed twice in
   24 h, thus increasing production capacity. Isothermal conduction
   calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis techniques
   were used to investigate the reasons for the improvement in compressive
   strength development. Results indicated that the increase in early
   compressive strength is due to an acceleration of early hydration of PC
   in presence of the NCS. Indeed, after 6 h, the degree of hydration was
   more than 50\% greater when NCS was used. This paper also highlights the
   possibility of the NCS chemical admixture being used in conjunction with
   supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) in PC blended concrete
   mixes. 2\% NCS was added to a blend containing 70\% PC and 30\% ground
   granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS). Results indicated that early
   strength values were greater compared to the blend without NCS and
   comparable to the 100\% PC mix.}},
