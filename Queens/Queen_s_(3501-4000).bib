Abstract = {{A robust nonlinear modeling technique based on Fast Orthogonal Search
   (FOS) is introduced to remove MEMS-based inertial sensor stochastic
   errors inside smart mobile phones that are used for several purposes
   including location based services and device usage classification. The
   proposed method is applied to MEMS-based gyroscopes and accelerometers.
   Results show that the proposed method models low-cost MEMS sensors
   errors with no need for de-noising techniques and, using smaller model
   order and less computation, outperforms traditional methods by two
   orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of joint centre during total hip arthroplasty is critical.
   While computer-aided navigation can improve accuracy during total hip
   arthroplasty, its expense makes it inaccessible to the majority of
   surgeons. This article evaluates the use, in the laboratory, of a
   calliper with a simple computer application to measure changes in
   femoral head centres during total hip arthroplasty. The computer
   application was designed using Microsoft Excel and used calliper
   measurements taken pre- and post-femoral head resection to predict the
   change in head centre in terms of offset and vertical height between the
   femoral head and newly inserted prosthesis. Its accuracy was assessed
   using a coordinate measuring machine to compare changes in preoperative
   and post-operative head centre when simulating stem insertion on 10
   saw-bone femurs. A femoral stem with a modular neck was used, which
   meant nine possible head centre configurations were available for each
   femur, giving 90 results. The results show that using this technique
   during a simulated total hip arthroplasty, it was possible to restore
   femoral head centre to within 6 mm for offset (mean 1.67 +/- 1.16 mm)
   and vertical height (mean 2.14 +/- 1.51 mm). It is intended that this
   low-cost technique be extended to inform the surgeon of a best-fit
   solution in terms of neck length and neck type for a specific
   prosthesis.}},

Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we investigate the limiting spectral distribution of
   the sample covariance matrix (SCM) of weighted/windowed complex data. We
   use recent advances in random matrix theory and describe the
   distribution of eigenvalues of the doubly correlated Wishart matrices.
   We obtain an approximation for the spectral distribution of the SCM
   obtained from windowed data. We also determine a condition on the
   coefficients of the window, under which the fragmentation of the support
   of noise eigenvalues can be avoided, in the noise-only data case. For
   the commonly used exponential window, we derive an explicit expression
   for the l.s.d of the noise-only data. In addition, we present a method
   to identify the support of eigenvalues in the general case of
   signal-plus-noise. Simulations are performed to support our theoretical
   claims. The results of this article can be directly employed in many
   applications working with windowed array data such as source enumeration
   and subspace tracking algorithms.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the ability of the doubly fed induction generator
   (DFIG) to deliver multiple reactive power objectives during variable
   wind conditions. The reactive power requirement is decomposed based on
   various control objectives (e.g. power factor control, voltage control,
   loss minimisation, and flicker mitigation) defined around different time
   frames (i.e. seconds, minutes, and hourly), and the control reference is
   generated by aggregating the individual reactive power requirement for
   each control strategy. A novel coordinated controller is implemented for
   the rotor-side converter and the grid-side converter considering their
   capability curves and illustrating that it can effectively utilise the
   aggregated DFIG reactive power capability for system performance
   enhancement. The performance of the multi-objective strategy is examined
   for a range of wind and network conditions, and it is shown that for the
   majority of the scenarios, more than 92\% of the main control objective
   can be achieved while introducing the integrated flicker control scheme
   with the main reactive power control scheme. Therefore, optimal control
   coordination across the different control strategies can maximise the
   availability of ancillary services from DFIG-based wind farms without
   additional dynamic reactive power devices being installed in power
   networks. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{357-376}},
Abstract = {{Urban land development in India is changing under the auspices of
   economic liberalisation. Kolkata has been in the forefront of this
   transformation through development of new townships in the urban
   peripheries based on a distinctive state-led land development model.
   Within this context New Town, Kolkata (also known as Rajarhat) provides
   a highly illuminative case to articulate the ways in which the state is
   implementing its neoliberal agenda in land development. It rides on
   political and ideological high ground by seeking to create a `model
   development' of state-market partnership for dual goals of fostering
   capitalist interest while fulfilling welfarist principles. Interesting
   insights have emerged that point to a policy paradox. On one hand, the
   process follows market principles of efficacy and efficiency; on the
   other hand, state's keenness to extend control persists, thereby
   creating a highly uneven terrain for state-market interaction. New Town
   reflects a typical quasi-market condition shaped by the monopolistic
   state, the poorly structured role of the private sector, an absence of
   civic bodies, and minimal land and housing provision for the poor. In
   India, as internationally, the economic liberalisation market ideology
   is increasingly construed as good governance. In this context New Town
   is a step in the right direction, but the progress is patchy, uneven,
   and still evolving.}},

Abstract = {{A downlink multiuser amplify-and-forward (AF) relay system is considered
   in which the source is equipped with multiple antennas, whereas the
   relay and each of multiple destinations have a single antenna.
   Orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC) is employed to achieve
   spatial diversity, and normalized SNR-based scheduling is used to obtain
   multiuser diversity while maintaining fairness among users. New exact
   expressions for outage probability and average symbol error rate (SER)
   in independent but nonidentically distributed (i.n.i.d) Rayleigh fading
   multiuser environments are derived for adaptive-gain and fixed-gain
   relaying methods. Asymptotic expressions for outage probability and
   average SER at a high SNR are presented and used to determine the
   diversity order of the two relaying systems. The combined effect of
   spatial and multiuser diversity is quantified for the proposed system.
   Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the accuracy of the analyses
   presented. Comparisons between the two relaying methods and that with
   multiuser point-to-point systems are made, and some insights are
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution three-dimensional numerical modeling and field
   observations were used to describe the nonlinear response of Cayuga Lake
   to surface wind forcing. The degeneration of the basin-scale internal
   wave field was characterized according to the composite Froude number
   (G(2)), Wedderburn number (W-N), and Lake number (L-N), which are
   measures of hydraulic control and bulk and integral wind disturbance
   force to the baroclinic restoring force, respectively. The typical
   Cayuga Lake response was a nonlinear surge when similar to 1 < W-N (or
   L-N) < similar to 2-12 and a surge with emergent nonlinear internal
   waves when W-N or L-N < similar to 2, in agreement with published
   laboratory studies. An observed shock front was simulated to be an
   internal hydraulic jump, occurring at midbasin during strong winds when
   W-N < 0.8. To our knowledge, this is the first simulation of a midbasin
   seiche-induced hydraulic jump (supported by field data) due to
   supercritical conditions (G(2) > 1) in a lake. The occurrence of the
   hydraulic jump was correctly predicted using scaling parameters. It was
   also shown that topographically induced internal hydraulic jumps form
   when the nonlinear surges interact with a sill-contraction topographic
   feature. In contrast to published literature, the observed
   high-frequency nonlinear internal waves were preferentially associated
   with internal jumps, as opposed to steepened internal surges. Computed
   vertical diffusivities showed mixing was enhanced by two orders of
   magnitude within both the surges and hydraulic jumps as they propagated
   through the basin and interacted with topography. Our results can be
   generalized to other lakes and fjords with similar long-narrow geometry
   and topographically separate side basins.}},

Abstract = {{We present a mass model for the Milky Way, which is fitted to

   from a wide range of photometric and kinematic data. The model comprises
   a Sersic bulge, an exponential disc and an Einasto halo. Our Bayesian
   analysis is accomplished using an affine-invariant Markov chain Monte
   Carlo algorithm. We find that the best-fitting dark matter halo is
   triaxial with axis ratios of 3.3 +/- 0.7 and 2.7 +/- 0.4 and with the
   short axis approximately aligned with the Sun-Galactic Centre line. Our
   results are consistent with those presented in Law \& Majewski. Such a
   strongly aspherical halo is disfavoured by the standard cold dark matter
   scenario for structure formation.}},

Abstract = {{Bone models derived from patient imaging and fabricated using additive
   manufacturing technology have many potential uses including surgical
   planning, training, and research. This study evaluated the accuracy of
   bone surface reconstruction of two diarthrodial joints, the hip and
   shoulder, from computed tomography. Image segmentation of the
   tomographic series was used to develop a three-dimensional virtual
   model, which was fabricated using fused deposition modelling. Laser
   scanning was used to compare cadaver bones, printed models, and
   intermediate segmentations. The overall bone reconstruction process had
   a reproducibility of 0.3 +/- 0.4 mm. Production of the model had an
   accuracy of 0.1 +/- 0.1 mm, while the segmentation had an accuracy of
   0.3 +/- 0.4 mm, indicating that segmentation accuracy was the key factor
   in reconstruction. Generally, the shape of the articular surfaces was
   reproduced accurately, with poorer accuracy near the periphery of the
   articular surfaces, particularly in regions with periosteum covering and
   where osteophytes were apparent.}},

Title = {{Distributed recycling of waste polymer into RepRap feedstock}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{118-125}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - A low-cost, open source, self-replicating rapid prototyper
   (RepRap) has been developed, which greatly expands the potential user
   base of rapid prototypers. The operating cost of the Rep Rap can be
   further reduced using waste polymers as feedstock. Centralized recycling
   of polymers is often uneconomic and energy intensive due to
   transportation embodied energy. The purpose of this paper is to provide
   a proof of concept for high-value recycling of waste polymers at
   distributed creation sites.
   Design/methodology/approach - Previous designs of waste plastic
   extruders (also known as RecycleBots) were evaluated using a weighted
   evaluation matrix. An updated design was completed and the description
   and analysis of the design is presented including component summary,
   testing procedures, a basic life cycle analysis and extrusion results.
   The filament was tested for consistency of density and diameter while
   quantifying electricity consumption.
   Findings - Filament was successfully extruded at an average rate of 90
   mm/min and used to print parts. The filament averaged 2.805 mm diameter
   with 87 per cent of samples between 2.540 mm and 3.081 mm. The average
   mass was 0.564 g/100 mm length. Energy use was 0.06 kWh/m.
   Practical implications - The success of the RecycleBot further reduces
   RepRap operating costs, which enables distributed in-home, value added,
   plastic recycling. This has implications for municipal waste management
   programs, as in-home recycling could reduce cost and greenhouse gas
   emissions associated with waste collection and transportation, as well
   as the environmental impact of manufacturing custom plastic parts.
   Originality/value - This paper reports on the first technical evaluation
   of a feedstock filament for the RepRap from waste plastic material made
   in a distributed recycling device.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the detailed description and validation of a fully
   automated, computer controlled analytical method to spatially probe the
   gas composition and thermal characteristics in packed bed systems. As an
   exemplar, we have examined a heterogeneously catalysed gas phase
   reaction within the bed of a powdered oxide supported metal catalyst.
   The design of the gas sampling and the temperature recording systems are
   disclosed. A stationary capillary with holes drilled in its wall and a
   moveable reactor coupled with a mass spectrometer are used to enable
   sampling and analysis. This method has been designed to limit the
   invasiveness of the probe on the reactor by using the smallest
   combination of thermocouple and capillary which can be employed
   practically. An 80 mu m (O.D.) thermocouple has been inserted in a 250
   mu m (O.D.) capillary. The thermocouple is aligned with the sampling
   holes to enable both the gas composition and temperature profiles to be
   simultaneously measured at equivalent spatially resolved positions. This
   analysis technique has been validated by studying CO oxidation over a
   1\% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and the spatial resolution profiles of chemical
   species concentrations and temperature as a function of the axial
   position within the catalyst bed are reported.}},

Abstract = {{Nano-beam electron diffraction has been used to quantify the elastic
   strain field associated with delta-hydride needles embedded in an
   alpha-Zr matrix. It has been found that the volume misfit associated
   with precipitation results in elastic strains that are similar to 4x
   greater in the matrix than the hydride. Electron energy loss
   spectroscopy was used to detect hydrogen enrichment at the
   matrix-hydride interface by a shift in the zirconium plasmon peak. This
   work highlights that gamma-hydride is metastable and acts as a precursor
   to equilibrium delta-hydride and that compositional variations within
   the hydride can be detected using electron energy loss spectroscopy. (C)

Abstract = {{X-ray based techniques have been adopted as a diagnostic tool for both
   ex-situ and in-situ material characterization techniques in PEMFC.
   Possible damage of Nafion due to X-ray irradiation is a concern
   especially for thin films. To investigate the X-ray irradiation effect
   on ultra-thin Nafion film structure and properties, supported 10 am
   films were prepared on SiO2/Si substrate with inter-digitated gold
   arrays (IDA) and exposed to X-ray radiation at three X-ray power
   sources: 300, 200 and 100 W for 45 mins. Proton conductivity of each
   film was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy before and
   after X-ray exposure. We determine that X-ray radiation damages the
   polymer by preferential removal of sulfur species from the film that
   results in a clear loss of proton conductivity. Damage by 300, 200, and
   100 W radiation over 45 minutes removes 78, 74 and 54\% of the sulfur
   present, respectively, yielding a loss of 99, 97 and 95\% in the proton
   conductivity of the film. It is suggested that Nafion degradation takes
   place by not only the removal of the sulfonic group, but also by the
   removal of a fraction of fluorine consistent with cleavage at the ether
   group of its side chain. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{We report the combined studies of density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations and electrochemical in situ FTIR spectroscopy on surface
   oxidants and mechanisms of CO oxidation at the Ru(0001) electrodes. It
   is shown that CO can co-adsorb with both O and OH species at lower
   potential region where a low coverage of the (2 x 2)-O/OH adlayer
   formed; the oxidation of CO adsorbates takes place at higher potentials
   where a high coverage of the (1 x 1)-O/OH adlayer formed. Surface O
   species are not the active oxidants under all coverages studied, due to
   the high reaction barriers between CO and O (>1 eV). However, surface OH
   species with higher coverage are identified as the active oxidants, and
   CO oxidation takes place via a two-steps' mechanism of CO + 3OH -> COOH
   + 2OH -> CO2 + H2O + OH, in which three nearby OH species are involved
   in the CO2 formation: CO reacts with OH, forming COOH; COOH then
   transfers the H to a nearby OH to form H2O and CO2, at the same time,
   another H in the H2O transfers to a nearby OH to form a weak adsorbed
   H2O and a new OH. The reaction barrier of these processes is reduced
   significantly to around 0.50 eV. These new results not only provide an
   insight into surface active oxidants on Ru, which is directly relevant
   to fuel cell catalysis, but also reveals the extra complexity of
   catalytic reactions taking place at solid/liquid electrochemical
   interface in comparison to the relatively simpler ones at solid/gas
   phase. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Political support for renewable energy development, especially offshore
   renewables, is particularly conspicuous in Scotland and is a centrepiece
   of SNP policy. However, this is built on something of a paradox because,
   put simply, without the subsidies paid by electricity consumers in the
   rest of the UK, the Scottish Government's ambitious targets for
   renewable energy would be politically unachievable. We argue in this
   paper that if Scotland does move towards independence, then there could
   be little reason for the UK to continue paying (much) of the subsidies
   since the resulting renewable generation would no longer contribute
   towards UK renewable energy targets. We suggest that the potential
   scenarios, and their implications, needs to be far better considered in
   the arguments around the Scottish constitutional position and the
   broader aims of UK energy policy.}},

Abstract = {{Percutaneous fixation of scaphoid fractures offers potential advantages
   to cast treatment but can be difficult to perform with conventional
   two-dimensional imaging. This study aimed to evaluate the use of a novel
   navigation technique using volume-rendered images derived from
   intraoperative cone-beam computed tomography imaging, without the need
   for typical patient-based registration. Randomized in vitro trials in
   which a guidewire was inserted into a scaphoid model were conducted to
   compare volumetric navigation to conventional fluoroscopic C-arm (n =
   24). Central wire placement, surface breach, procedure time, drilling
   attempts, and radiation exposure were compared between groups. Compared
   to conventional percutaneous insertion, navigation achieved equal or
   significantly better placement of the guidewire with fewer drilling
   attempts and less radiation exposure. On average, navigation took 74 s
   longer to perform than the conventional method, which was statistically
   significant but clinically irrelevant. This evaluation suggests that the
   technology is promising and may have many clinical benefits including
   improved fixation placement, fewer complications, and less radiation
   exposure. The intraoperative workflow is more efficient and eliminates
   the need for preoperative computed tomography, image segmentation, and
   patient-based registration typical of traditional navigated procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Composites of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and a poly(ethylene
   terephthalate)(PET), prepared by melt mixing, were uniaxially and
   biaxially deformed at 100 degrees C using a strain rate of 2 s(-1) and
   at stretch ratios (SR) up to 2. A hierarchical organization of randomly
   well dispersed and distributed agglomerates, smaller bundles and
   individual MWCNTs was identified in the as extruded composite from
   extensive microscopic examination across the length scales using
   polarised optical microscopy (POM), field emission scanning electron
   microscopy (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy
   (HRTEM). Evidence from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) confirmed the MWCNTs induced crystallization via a
   heterogeneous mechanism and altered the crystallization behaviour of
   PET. Uniaxial deformation of the composite materials resulted in
   orientation of the MWCNTs in the direction parallel to the applied
   strain and for biaxial deformation at an angle approaching 45 degrees to
   the vertical axis (extrusion direction), evidence for the latter
   obtained by HRTEM and from small angle X-ray scattering experiments
   (SAXS). In both instances, XRD and DSC confirmed the occurrence of
   significant strain induced crystallization resulting in large increases
   in tensile mechanical properties. Evidence from wide angle X-ray
   scattering experiments (WAXS), supported by XRD and DSC showed the
   overall crystalline content and degree of long-range ordering increased
   with MWCNT addition. The decrease in diffraction (SAXS) associated with
   lamella spacing implies the MWCNTs disrupt formation of lamella and
   reside in the inter-lamellar spacing. Annealing the composites,
   particularly at T-m -50 degrees C, results in an increase in PET
   crystalline content. Prior to deformation the MWCNTs formed an
   electrically conducting interconnected network throughout the PET
   matrix, however, this was partially destroyed when the composite was
   uniaxially or biaxially deformed, as the probability of
   conductor-conductor contacts decreased. It was possible to restore a
   MWCNT conducting network similar to that achieved prior to uniaxial
   deformation only by annealing the sample at T-m -50 degrees C.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{Recent work has proposed that hybridization of residential-scale
   cogeneration with roof-mounted solar PV (photovoltaic) arrays can
   increase the PV penetration level in ideal situations by a factor of
   five. In regions where there is a significant cooling load PV-cogen
   hybrid systems could be coupled to an absorption chiller to utilize
   waste heat from the cogen unit. In order to investigate realistic
   (non-ideal) loads that such a hybrid system would need to service, a new
   numerical simulation called PVTOM (PV-trigeneration optimization model)
   was created and coupled to the results of the established CHREM
   (Canadian Hybrid Residential End-Use Energy and Emissions Model). In
   this paper, PVTOM is applied to representative houses in select Canadian
   regions, which experience cooling loads, to assess the fuel utilization
   efficiency and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from hybrid
   PV-cogen and trigen systems in comparison with conventional systems.
   Results of the optimization runs are provided and the efficacy of
   PV-cogen and PV-trigen systems is discussed. Both PV-trigen and PV-cogen
   systems have demonstrated to be more effective at reducing emissions
   when compared to the current combination of centralized power plants and
   household heating technologies in some regions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The use of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste crops has
   received considerable attention as a sustainable feedstock that can
   replace fossil fuels for the production of renewable energy. Therefore,
   municipal bin-waste in the form of hay was investigated as a potential
   energy crop for fermentable sugars production. Hydrolysis of hay by
   dilute phosphoric acid was carried out in autoclave parr reactor, where
   reactor temperature (135-200 degrees c) and acid concentration (2.5-10\%
   (w/w)) were examined. Analysis of the decomposition rate of
   hemicellulosic biomass was undertaken using HPLC of the reaction
   products. Xylose production reached a maximum value of 13.5 g/100 g dry
   mass corresponding to a yield of 67\% at the best identified conditions
   of 2.5 wt\% H3PO4, 175 degrees C, 10 min reaction time, and at 5 wt\%
   H3PO4, 150 degrees C, and 5 min reaction time. For glucose, an average
   yield of 25\% was obtained at 5 wt\% H3PO4, 175 degrees C and 30 min.
   Glucose degradation to HMF was achieved at 10 wt\% H3PO4 and 200 degrees
   C. The maximum yield for produced arabinose was an average of 3 g/100 g
   dry. mass corresponding to 100\% of the total possible arabinose. The
   kinetic study of the acid hydrolysis was also carried out using the
   Saeman and the Two-fraction models. It was found for both models that
   the kinetic constants (k) depend on the acid concentration and
   temperature. For xylose and arabinose it was found that the rate of
   formation was more favoured than the rate of degradation. By contrast,
   for glucose it was found that glucose degradation was occurring faster
   than glucose formation. It can be concluded that dilute phosphoric acid
   hydrolysis of hay crop is feasible for the production of fermentable
   sugars which are essential for bioethanol synthesis. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{A Cross-Layer Framework for Network Management in Wireless Sensor
   Networks Using Weighted Cognitive Maps}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Achieving the end-to-end goals and objectives of Wireless Sensor
   Networks (WSN) is a highly challenging task. Such objectives include
   maximizing network lifetime, guaranteeing connectivity and coverage, and
   maximizing throughput. In addition, some of these goals are in conflict
   such as network lifetime and throughput. Cross-layer design can be
   efficient in proposing network management techniques that can consider
   different network objectives and conflicting constraints. This can be
   highly valuable in challenging applications where multiple Quality of
   Service (QoS) requirements may be demanded. In this paper, a novel
   cross-layer framework for network management is proposed that
   particularly targets WSN with challenging applications. The proposed
   framework is designed using the tool known as Weighted Cognitive Map
   (WCM). The inference properties of WCMs allow the system to consider
   multiple objectives and constraints while maintaining low complexity.
   Methods for achieving different objectives using WCMs are illustrated,
   as well as how system processes can operate coherently to achieve common
   end-to-end goals. Using extensive computer simulations, the proposed
   system is evaluated. The results show that it achieves good performance
   results in metrics of network lifetime, throughput, and Packet Loss
   Ratio (PLR).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Three novel linewidth-tolerant, low-complexity, two-stage feed-forward
   carrier phase estimation algorithms are introduced for dual-polarization
   16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (DP 16-QAM) with coherent
   detection. The first stage employs either the quadrature phase-shift
   keying (QPSK) partitioning algorithm, simplified QPSK partitioning
   algorithm, or blind phase search (BPS) algorithm. The second stage
   employs a novel modified QPSK partitioning algorithm. Based on
   experimental data, all three algorithms achieve comparable performance
   for DP 16-QAM back to back and transmission systems. The linewidth
   tolerance for the three algorithms is numerically studied. A linewidth
   symbol duration product of 1.3 X 10(-4) is demonstrated for a 1 dB
   optical signal-to-noise-ratio penalty at a bit error ratio of 10(-3) for
   all the proposed algorithms, which is comparable to the single-stage BPS
   algorithm with a large number of test phases. Reductions in the hardware
   complexity by factors of about 1.7-5.3 are achieved in comparison to the
   single-stage BPS algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we seek to understand the nature of the relationship
   between increasing alkoxyamine initiator concentration and increasing
   particle size for the SG1-mediated, two stage emulsion polymerization of
   n-butyl acrylate. Using a difunctional alkoxyamine, based upon the
   commercially available BlocBuilder MA, we studied the impact of various
   factors on the particle size in the 1st stage (particle nucleation) of
   the polymerization; these include ionic strength, pH, buffer (type and
   concentration) and surfactant concentration. The results suggest that
   superswelling of the particles during nucleation has significant
   influence on the behaviour of the system. In applying these strategies,
   we demonstrate that colloidally stable latexes can be created at 45 wt\%
   solids with molecular weight >70 kg mol(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Confronted with articular cartilage's limited capacity for self-repair,
   joint resurfacing techniques offer an attractive treatment for damaged
   or diseased tissue. Although tissue engineered cartilage constructs can
   be created, a substantial number of cells are required to generate
   sufficient quantities of tissue for the repair of large defects. As
   routine cell expansion methods tend to elicit negative effects on
   chondrocyte function, we have developed an approach to generate
   phenotypically stable, large-sized engineered constructs (3 cm2)
   directly from a small amount of donor tissue or cells (as little as
   20,000 cells to generate a 3 cm2 tissue construct). Using rabbit donor
   tissue, the bioreactor-cultivated constructs were hyaline-like in
   appearance and possessed a biochemical composition similar to native
   articular cartilage. Longer bioreactor cultivation times resulted in
   increased matrix deposition and improved mechanical properties
   determined over a 4 week period. Additionally, as the anatomy of the
   joint will need to be taken in account to effectively resurface large
   affected areas, we have also explored the possibility of generating
   constructs matched to the shape and surface geometry of a defect site
   through the use of rapid-prototyped defect tissue culture molds. Similar
   hyaline-like tissue constructs were developed that also possessed a high
   degree of shape correlation to the original defect mold. Future studies
   will be aimed at determining the effectiveness of this approach to the
   repair of cartilage defects in an animal model and the creation of
   large-sized osteochondral constructs. (c) 2012 American Institute of

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A numerical model ``BioClog- 2D{''} is used to examine the service life
   and clogging of leachate collection systems with granular drainage
   material of different grain sizes. The modelling shows that the leachate
   characteristics at the end of the drainage pipe are significantly
   different from those in the leachate entering the leachate collection
   system and this reduction in leachate strength corresponds to an
   accumulation of clog mass within the saturated drainage layer. The
   calculated clog mass within the saturated drainage layer is dominated by
   the inorganic material, which is in encouraging agreement with
   field-observed data. The service life of leachate collection systems is
   increased with an increase in the grain size of the drainage material
   and decreased with an increase in the length of the drainage path. The
   service life of the drainage layer is shown to vary from a few years to
   over 100 years depending on the design of the system. The results
   indicate that in addition to the particle size of the granular material,
   the infiltration rate and leachate strength history greatly affect the
   estimated service life of leachate collection systems.}},

Abstract = {{Maximizing network connectivity while maintaining a useful lifetime
   period without exceeding cost constraints is a challenging design
   objective for wireless sensor networks. Satisfying such objective
   becomes even a more intricate task with 3-D setups and harsh operational
   conditions found in typical large scale environment monitoring
   applications. While much work has been performed in environment
   monitoring, only few have addressed the unique characteristics of such
   applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3-D deployment
   strategy, called Optimized 3-D deployment with Lifetime Constraint
   (03DwLC), for relay nodes in environmental applications. The strategy
   optimizes network connectivity, while guarantying specific network
   lifetime and limited cost. Key to our contribution is a very limited
   search space for the optimization problem, in addition to a revised
   definition for network lifetime that is more appropriate in environment
   monitoring. The effectiveness of our strategy is validated through
   extensive simulations and comparisons, assuming practical considerations
   of signal propagation and connectivity. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Power transformer is one of the most complex parts of power converters.
   The complicated behavior of the transformer is usually neglected in the
   power converter analysis and a simple model is mostly used to analyze
   the converter. This paper presents a precise analysis of a fifth-order
   resonant converter which has incorporated the resonant circuit into the
   transformer. The derived model, which is based on the accurate model of
   the power transformer, can fully predict the behavior of the fifth-order
   resonant converter. The proposed fifth-order resonant converter is able
   to effectively reduce the range of phase-shift angle from no load to
   full load for a fixed-frequency phase-shift control approach. Therefore,
   the converter is able to operate under zero voltage switching during
   entire load range with a fixed-frequency control method. Also, the
   proposed converter offers a high gain which leads to a lower transformer
   turns ratio. A 10-kVDC, 1.1-kW prototype has been prepared to evaluate
   the performance of the proposed converter. The experimental results
   exhibit the excellent accuracy of the proposed model and the superiority
   of the performance compared to the lower order resonant converters,
   especially for high-voltage applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for controlling the exchange of power
   between a single-phase distributed generation system and the grid.
   Rather than controlling the active and reactive powers separately and
   through the media of current signal as is done by the conventional
   techniques, the proposed controller acts directly on the instantaneous
   power. This eliminates the conventional need for calculating the active
   and reactive powers; a calculation that involves
   filtering/phase-shifting and slows down the system responses and adds to
   computational complexity. This paper first formulates a nonlinear
   structure from a purely mathematical approach based on minimizing a cost
   function. The minimization procedure generates a reference for the
   current signal which is subsequently used in the current control loop.
   This paper then derives an equivalent linear counterpart for the
   nonlinear structure. Moreover, it is also shown that the idea of
   controlling the instantaneous power does not require a separate loop for
   the current. Having replaced the nonlinear part with its linear
   equivalent, a control loop that comprises linear time-varying elements
   is obtained. This paper further develops a linear time-invariant model
   of the loop for stability and design purposes. The proposed control
   system is successfully applied to a photovoltaic system and performance
   evaluation results (using computer simulations and a laboratory
   experimental setup) are presented. Desired performance and robustness of
   the proposed method is verified by testing it within different operating
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Rangea is the type genus of the Rangeomorpha, an extinct clade near the
   base of the evolutionary tree of large, complex organisms which
   prospered during the late Neoproterozoic. It represents an iconic
   Ediacaran taxon, but the relatively few specimens previously known
   significantly hindered an accurate reconstruction: Discovery of more
   than 100 specimens of Rangea in two gutter casts recovered from Farm Aar
   in southern Namibia significantly expands this data set, and the well
   preserved internal and external features on these specimens permit new
   interpretations of Rangea morphology and lifestyle. Internal structures
   of Rangea consist of a hexaradial axial bulb that passes into an axial
   stalk extending the length of the fossil. The axial bulb is typically
   filled with sediment, which becomes increasingly loosely packed and
   porous distally, with the end of the stalk typically preserved as an
   empty, cylindrical cone. This length of the axial structure forms the
   structural foundation for six vanes arranged radially around the axis,
   with each vane consisting of a bilaminar sheet composed of a repetitive
   pattern of elements exhibiting at least three orders of self-similar
   branching. Rangea was probably an epibenthic frond that rested upright
   on the sea bottom, and all known fossil specimens were transported prior
   to their final burial in storm deposits.}},

Title = {{A Novel Sparse Least Squares Support Vector Machines}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{The solution of a Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) suffers
   from the problem of nonsparseness. The Forward Least Squares
   Approximation (FLSA) is a greedy approximation algorithm with a
   least-squares loss function. This paper proposes a new Support Vector
   Machine for which the FLSA is the training algorithm-the Forward Least
   Squares Approximation SVM (FLSA-SVM). A major novelty of this new
   FLSA-SVM is that the number of support vectors is the regularization
   parameter for tuning the tradeoff between the generalization ability and
   the training cost. The FLSA-SVMs can also detect the linear dependencies
   in vectors of the input Gramian matrix. These attributes together
   contribute to its extreme sparseness. Experiments on benchmark datasets
   are presented which show that, compared to various SVM algorithms, the
   FLSA-SVM is extremely compact, while maintaining a competitive
   generalization ability.}},

Abstract = {{The solid-state polymorphism of the ionic liquid
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, {[}bmim]{[}PF6], has
   been investigated via low-temperature and high-pressure crystallisation
   experiments. The samples have been characterised by single-crystal X-ray
   diffraction, optical microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The solid-state
   phase behaviour of the compound is confirmed and clarified with respect
   to previous phase diagrams. The structures of the previously reported
   gamma-form, which essentially exhibits a G'T cation conformation, as
   well as those of the elusive beta- and alpha-forms, are reported.
   Crystals of the beta-phase are twinned and the structure is heavily
   disordered; the cation conformation in this form is predominantly TT,
   though significant contributions from other less frequently encountered
   conformers are also observed at low temperature and high pressure. The
   cation conformation in the alpha-form is GT; the presence of the G'T
   conformer at 193 K in this phase can be eliminated on cooling to 100 K.
   Whilst X-ray structural data are overall in good agreement with previous
   interpretations based on Raman and NMR studies, they also reveal a more
   subtle interplay of intermolecular interactions, which give rise to a
   wider range of conformers than previously considered.}},

Title = {{Tuning structural parameters of polyethylene brushes on silica
   nanoparticles in surface-initiated ethylene ``living{''} polymerization
   and effects on silica dispersion in a polyolefin matrix}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{1381-1395}},
Abstract = {{Surface-initiated ethylene ``living{''} polymerization with covalently
   tethered Pd-diimine catalysts represents a novel technique for covalent
   surface functionalization of silica nanoparticles with polyethylene (PE)
   brushes. In this paper, we report on the successful tuning of various
   structural parameters of PE brushes in this surface-initiated
   polymerization technique, including brush length, density, and topology.
   To control/reduce the brush density, the density of the surface-tethered
   acryloyl groups for catalyst immobilization is adjusted by using mixed
   silane agents comprised of effective 3-acryloxypropyltrichlorosilane and
   inert ethyltrichlorosilane at different compositions in the surface
   functionalization step, which in turn adjusts the density of immobilized
   catalysts for rendering PE brushes. This approach gives rise to
   low-polydispersity PE brushes of controllable densities at the
   polymerization condition of 27 atm/5 degrees C: 0.022-0.055 chains per
   nm(2) on a precipitated silica (Silica-I) and 0.07-0.17 chains per nm(2)
   on a fumed silica (Silica-II). The length of PE brushes is controlled by
   adjusting the polymerization time, with the highest brush length of
   about 45 kg mol(-1) achieved at 6 h of polymerization at 27 atm/5
   degrees C. Unlike the linear brushes with short branch structures
   obtained at 27 atm/5 degrees C, hyperbranched PE brushes with compact
   topology are obtained at 1 atm/25 degrees C, benefiting from the chain
   walking mechanism of the Pd-diimine catalyst. The PE-grafted silicas of
   varying brush density and length are subsequently used as nanofillers to
   construct polymer nanocomposites with an ethylene-alpha-olefin copolymer
   as the matrix polymer. The effects of brush length and density on the
   nanofiller dispersion and physical properties of the composites are
   examined. This represents the first study on polyolefin composites
   containing silica nanoparticles grafted with polyolefin brushes as
   nanofillers.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to optimise the rheological
   parameters, hardened properties, and setting times of cement grouts
   containing metakaolin (MTK), viscosity-modifying agent (VMA) and
   superplasticiser (SP). All mixes were made with water-to-binder ratio
   (W/B) of 0.40. The replacement of cement by MTK was varied from 6\% to
   20\% (by mass), and dosages of SP and VMA were varied from 0.3\% to
   1.4\%, and 0.01\% and 0.06\% (by mass of binder), respectively.
   Increased SP led to an increase in fluidity, reduction in flow time,
   plate cohesion, rheological parameters, and an increase in the setting
   times. Increased VMA demonstrated a reduction in fluidity, an increase
   in Marsh cone time, plate cohesion, yield stress, and plastic viscosity.
   Results indicate that the use of MTK increased yield stress, plastic
   viscosity, cohesion plate, and flow time due to the higher surface area
   associated with an increase in the water demand. MTK reduced mini-slump
   and setting times, and improved compressive strength. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The behaviour of Basalt Fibre Reinforced Polymer (BFRP) loaded

   that pull-out load increased approximately linearly with the bonded
   length up to maximum which occurred at a bonded length of 250 mm
   (similar to 15 times the hole diameter) and did not increase beyond this
   bonded length. Failure mode of the samples was mostly shear fracture
   which was located at the cylindrical zone at the timber/adhesive
   interface. Increased bonded lengths resulted in corresponding decrease
   in interfacial bond stress. At 250 mm bonded length, the pull-out
   capacity of the proposed design model was about 2\% lower than that of
   the tests. The results also showed that the bond stress of the
   theoretical model (at the ascending and descending branches) of the
   stress-slip curve was approximately 5-10\% of that of the experiment.

Abstract = {{The method of derivative superposition is enhanced with digital
   techniques to cancel the intermodulation distortion generated by a 2-W
   power amplifier (PA) RF integrated circuit over a broad band of 6 GHz.
   Two amplifiers were fabricated and tested: a baseline PA without
   distortion cancellation and a PA with digitally assisted distortion
   cancellation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new technique. The
   PAs are biased in class-A mode and have an OP1dB of 31 dBm and a P-SAT
   of 33 dBm. Measurements reveal that the output third-order intercept
   point (OIP3) of the PA with digitally assisted distortion cancellation
   can be increased to 50.25+/-3.75 dBm between 1-6 GHz relative to the
   OIP3 of the baseline PA, which is 40.25+/-2.75 dBm over the same
   frequency span. The level of distortion cancellation is not only
   dependent on the frequency of the incident signal, but also on its power
   level. Data is presented that shows how the proposed digitally assisted
   distortion cancellation method also improves the OIP3 of the PA when the
   RF input power level is taken into account.}},

Abstract = {{Both development and progression of knee osteoarthritis have been
   associated with the loading of the knee joint during walking. We are,
   therefore, interested in developing strategies for changing walking
   biomechanics to offload the knee joint without resorting to surgery. In
   this study, simulations of human walking were performed using a 2D
   bipedal forward dynamics model. A simulation generated by minimizing the
   metabolic cost of transport (CoT) resembled data measured from normal
   human walking. Three simulations targeted at minimizing the peak axial
   knee joint contact force instead of the CoT reduced the peak force by
   12-25\% and increased the CoT by 11-14\%. The strategies used by the
   simulations were (1) reduction in gastrocnemius muscle force, (2)
   avoidance of knee flexion during stance, and (3) reduced stride length.
   Reduced gastrocnemius force resulted from a combination of changes in
   activation and changes in the gastrocnemius contractile component
   kinematics. The simulations that reduced the peak contact force avoided
   flexing the knee during stance when knee motion was unrestricted and
   adopted a shorter stride length when the simulated knee motion was
   penalized if it deviated from the measured human knee motion. A higher
   metabolic cost in an offloading gait would be detrimental for covering a
   long distance without fatigue but beneficial for exercise and weight
   loss. The predicted changes in the peak axial knee joint contact force
   from the simulations were consistent with estimates of the joint contact
   force in a human subject who emulated the predicted kinematics. The
   results demonstrate the potential of using muscle-actuated forward
   dynamics simulations to predict novel joint offloading interventions.

Abstract = {{The regioselective methylation of a ruthenium polypyridyl complex
   bearing both a 1,2,4-triazolato and a pyrazine moiety is reported. In
   contrast to previous studies in which methylation of the
   1,2,4-triazolato ring was observed, in the present system methylation
   takes place exclusively at the non-coordinated nitrogen of the pyrazine
   ring. The monomethylation is confirmed by H-1 NMR spectroscopy and
   ESI-MS and the electronic properties of the methylated complexes are
   studied by UV/vis absorption, emission, surface enhanced, resonance and
   transient resonance Raman spectroscopy. Ligand deuteriation is used to
   simplify the H-1 NMR spectra and to assign definitively the Raman
   spectra. Acid-base studies show that the triazolato ring of the
   N-methylated complexes can be protonated at low pH and that at high pH
   the N-methyl group can be deprotonated reversibly. Furthermore it is
   shown that under conditions where the methyl group is deprotonated,
   demethylation occurs to recover the initial complex.}},

Volume = {{46}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The measurement of strain has always been central to developments in
   structural engineering. As structures around the world reach the end of
   their intended service life, there is a need for more robust field
   monitoring techniques to determine, in conjunction with numerical
   models, if these structures are still fit for purpose. Current strain
   gage technologies are only able to offer a limited number of discrete
   measurements, which often is not enough data to assess complex
   structures. This paper presents an alternative technique for measuring
   strain using digital images called Digital Image Correlation (DIC) that
   allows for the measurement of 2-D strain fields. The accuracy that can
   be achieved in physical experiments where sources of error such as
   lighting and camera quality are present is investigated. A series of
   tension tests on steel plates are conducted allowing measurements from
   the DIC technique to be compared to measurements from conventional foil
   strain gages. Out-of-plane motion is identified as one of the most
   significant potential sources of strain measurement error when using
   DIC. Five solutions for significantly reducing the effects of
   out-of-plane motion are presented and three of these solutions are
   applied to the steel plate experiment. Using these solutions it is
   possible to achieve mean strain errors of less than 5 mu epsilon when
   comparing DIC to foil strain gage measurements, which suggests that the
   DIC technique has the potential to replace conventional strain gages.
   Areas of future research are also introduced. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Representing one of the largest known (estimated > 5 Gt at 1 \% Cu and

   centres, extending for about 5 km from the Rio Blanco and Los Bronces
   mines in the north, through the Don Luis mine, to the Sur Sur mine, La
   Americana and Los Sulfatos in the south. The new geochronology data,
   which now include data on different molybdenite vein types, confirm the
   U-Pb ages of the pre-mineralisation intrusions but slightly increase
   their age range from 8.8 to 8.2 Ma. The distinct magmatic pulses of the
   mineralisation-associated porphyritic intrusives (Late Porphyries)
   indicate an age interval instead of the previously suggested individual
   ages: the quartz monzonite porphyry ranges from 7.7 to 6.1 Ma (Sur Sur
   5.74 +/- 0.13 Ma), the feldspar porphyry shows an interval from 5.8 to
   5.2 Ma and the Don Luis porphyry from 5.2 to 5.0 Ma. The new Re-Os data
   on distinct molybdenite vein types confirm the protracted history of
   Cu(-Mo) mineralisation, inferred previously. The vein development
   occurred at least from 5.94 to 4.50 Ma, indicating a time-span of 1.5 Ma
   for the hydrothermal activity. Hydrothermal minerals dated by the
   Ar-40/Ar-39 method are generally too young to record the age of early,
   high-temperature mineralisation. The majority of the Ar-40/Ar-39 data in
   the Rio Blanco porphyry cluster record reheating by either the youngest
   member of the Late Porphyry suite or the post-mineralisation dacite or
   rhyolite plug formations at around 4.9-4.7 Ma.}},

Title = {{Chiral thiouronium salts: synthesis, characterisation and application in
   NMR enantio-discrimination of chiral oxoanions}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Chiral thioureas and functionalised chiral thiouronium salts were
   synthesised starting from the relatively cheap and easily available
   chiral amines: (S)-methylbenzylamine and rosin-derived
   (+)-dehydroabietylamine. The introduction of a delocalised positive
   charge to the thiourea functionality, by an alkylation reaction at the
   sulfur atom, enables dynamic rotameric processes: hindered rotations
   about the delocalised CN and CS bonds. Hence, four different
   rotamers/isomers may be recognised: syn-syn, syn-anti, anti-syn and
   anti-anti. Extensive H-1 and C-13 NMR studies have shown that in
   hydrogen-bond acceptor solvents, such as perdeuteriated dimethyl
   sulfoxide, the syn-syn conformation is preferable. On the other hand,
   when using non-polar solvents, such as CDCl3, the mixture of syn-syn and
   syn-anti isomers is detectable, with an excess of the latter. Apart from
   this, in the case of S-butyl-N,N'-bis(dehydroabietyl)thiouronium
   ethanoate in CDCl3, the H-1 NMR spectrum revealed that strong bifurcated
   hydrogen bonding between the anion and the cation causes global rigidity
   without signs of hindered rotamerism observable on the NMR time scale.
   This suggested that these new salts might be used as NMR discriminating
   agents for chiral oxoanions, and are indeed more effective than their
   archetypal guanidinium analogues or the neutral thioureas. The best
   results in recognition of a model substrate, mandelate, were obtained
   with S-butyl-N,N'-bis(dehydroabietyl) thiouronium bistriflamide. It was
   confirmed that the chiral recognition occurred not only for carboxylates
   but also for sulfonates and phosphonates. Further H-1 NMR studies
   confirmed a 1 : 1 recognition mode between the chiral agent (host) and
   the substrate (guest); binding constants were determined by H-1 NMR
   titrations in solutions of DMSO-d(6) in CDCl3. It was also found that
   the anion of the thiouronium salt had a significant influence on the
   recognition process: anions with poor hydrogen-bond acceptor abilities
   led to the best discrimination. The presence of host-guest hydrogen
   bonding was confirmed in the X-ray crystal structure of
   S-butyl-N,N'-bis(dehydroabietyl)thiouronium bromide and by computational
   studies (density functional theory).}},

Title = {{Tectonic history of the North American shield recorded in uranium
   deposits in the Beaverlodge area, northern Saskatchewan, Canada}},
Journal = {{PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{224}},
Pages = {{316-340}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Paragenetic and structural relationships and geochronology of minerals
   in uranium deposits in the Beaverlodge area, Northwestern Saskatchewan,
   Canada, reveal six periods of uranium mineralization associated with
   multi-stage deformation during the Proterozoic. The Saint Louis fault
   and the Main Ore shear zone are northeast striking, southeast-dipping,
   oblique-normal and dextral fault systems that have mylonite-dominated
   footwalls. These faults display evidence of exhumation and episodic
   structural reactivation at progressively shallower crustal levels,
   accompanied by fluid flow, hydrothermal alteration, and uranium
   mineralization.
   New geochronologic data on uranium mineralization and alteration events
   record over 2.3 Gyr of protracted tectonic evolution of the North
   American shield. Pb-207/Pb-206 ages of 2293 +/- 17 Ma and 2289 +/- 20 Ma
   date two minor uranium mineralization stages associated with cataclasite
   rocks and early tensional veins, respectively, coincident with late
   Arrowsmith orogenic exhumation. Following emplacement of the Gunnar
   granite at 2321 +/- 3 Ma, albite metasomatic alteration of the granite
   is associated with a third moderate uranium mineralizing event. During
   the late Paleoproterozoic, exhumation along major faults caused the
   deformation style to change from dominantly brittle-ductile to brittle
   at shallower structural levels. Massive brecciation of pre-existing
   rocks is associated with the fourth and most significant
   uranium-mineralizing event at 1848 +/- 5 Ma, coincident with fault
   reactivation during tectonic shortening and regional metamorphism
   related to the Trans-Hudson Orogen or more likely post-peak
   compressional uplift during terminal collision of the Taltson-Thelon
   Orogen. Subsequently, formation of the Martin Lake Basin and intrusion
   of mafic dikes are related to the fifth minor uranium mineralizing event
   at 1812 +/- 15 Ma reflecting rifting related to late stage Trans-Hudson
   Orogen. Late mineralized veins during the Mesoproterozoic crustal growth
   of the Nuna supercontinent are associated with the sixth mineralizing
   event at 1620 +/- 4 Ma, coincident with the Mazatzal Orogen and the
   formation of the unconformity-related uranium mineralization in the
   proximal Athabasca Basin. Post-mineralization alteration and resetting
   events of uraninite further record various major orogenic events that
   have affected the North American shield. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Negative buoyant plume model for solar domestic hot water tank systems
   incorporating a vertical inlet}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{53-63}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Thermal stratification in solar energy storage tanks plays an important
   role in enhancing the performance of solar domestic hot water systems.
   The mixing that occurs when hot fluid from the solar collector enters
   the top of the tank is detrimental to the stratification. Mathematical
   models that are used for system analysis must therefore be able to
   capture the effects of this inlet jet mixing in order to accurately
   predict system performance. This paper presents a computational study of
   the heat transfer and fluid flow in a thermal storage tank of a solar
   domestic hot water system with a vertical inlet under negative buoyant
   plume conditions. The effects of parameters such as the fluid inlet
   velocity and temperature as well as inlet pipe diameter on the thermal
   mixing were considered. The work culminated in the development of a
   one-dimensional empirical model capable of predicting the transient
   axial temperature distribution inside the thermal storage tank.
   Predictions from the new model were in good agreement with both
   experimental data and detailed computational fluid dynamics predictions.

Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{190-199}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Near surface mounted (NSM) fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement
   is an effective technology for strengthening concrete structures in both
   flexure and shear, and has numerous advantages over externally bonded
   FRP. Available research on NSM systems for concrete has focused
   predominantly on overall member behaviour and/or parameters affecting
   NSM bond performance; relatively little research has been performed to
   study the response of NSM systems at elevated temperatures, as would be
   experienced during a fire. All FRP strengthening systems are susceptible
   to deterioration of mechanical and bond properties at elevated
   temperatures due to the comparatively high sensitivity of polymer
   adhesives and matrices to temperatures in the range of their glass
   transition temperature (T-g). It has been suggested in the literature
   that, thanks to superior bond performance and thermal protection from
   embedment within the concrete cover, NSM systems may outperform
   externally bonded FRP systems at elevated temperatures, particularly if
   inorganic adhesives are used; little research is available to support
   these claims. Experiments were performed to investigate and compare the
   performance of NSM and externally bonded FRP flexurally strengthened
   concrete beams under sustained load at temperatures exceeding the
   matrix/adhesive polymers' T-g. Results suggest that both NSM and
   externally bonded FRP strengthening systems are susceptible to elevated
   temperature, but that their performance can be considerably better than
   is commonly believed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL METHODS FOR HEAT \& FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{108-123}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss some fundamental
   aspects regarding the anomalies in the passive scalar field advected by
   forced homogenous and isotropic turbulence, by inspection of the
   analytical properties of the governing equations and with the aid of
   direct numerical simulation (DNS) data.
   Design/methodology/approach - Results from a pseudo-spectral DNS of a
   unitary-Schmidtnumber passive scalar advected by a low Reynolds number
   flow field, R-e lambda = 50 and 70 (based on the Taylor microscale
   lambda) allow for a preliminary assessment of the developed numerical
   model.
   Findings - Manipulation of the governing equations for the scalar field
   (which are monotonic) reveals that the unboundedness of the scalar
   gradient magnitude is not ruled out by the mathematical properties of
   the correspondent conservation equation. Classic intermittency effects
   in the passive scalar field have been reproduced, such as non-Gaussian
   behavior of the passive scalar statistics, loss of local isotropy, and
   multi-fractal scaling of scalar structure functions. Moreover, Taylor
   and Richardson theories are, surprisingly, not confirmed only in the
   dissipation range (small-scales anomalies).
   Originality/value - The authors suggest that the origin of intermittency
   (qualitatively pictured here as violent burst in spatial gradient
   quantities) should be sought in the loss of monotonicity of the
   evolution equation of the scalar gradient.}},

Abstract = {{The surface properties of a family of elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs),
   differing in molecular weight and sequence length, were investigated to
   understand how the nature of the polypeptide film might contribute to
   their thrombogenic profile. Physical adsorption of the ELPs onto Mylar
   increased surface wettability as the sequence length decreased while
   X-ray spectroscopy analysis showed an increasing amide content with
   sequence length. Chemical force microscopy analysis revealed that the
   ELP-coated surfaces displayed purely hydrophilic adhesion forces that
   increased as the ELP sequence length decreased. Adsorption isotherms
   performed using the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, showed
   that the surface coverage increased with ELP sequence length. The longer
   polypeptides (ELP2 and ELP4) also displayed higher specific dissipation
   values indicating that they established films with greater structural
   flexibility and associated water content than the shorter polypeptide,
   ELP1. Additionally, the stability of the ELP coating was lower with the
   shorter polypeptides. This study highlights the different surface
   properties of the ELP coatings as well as the dynamic nature of the ELP
   adsorbed layer wherein the conformational state may be an important
   factor contributing to their blood response.}},

Abstract = {{High-solid-content low-viscosity bimodal latexes with very small

   minimize their growth during the growth of the large mode. These
   particles are shown to grow at a volumetric rate that is 25 times lower

   viscosities <1400 mPa.s at 20 s(-1) are produced. The second approach is
   based on the re-nucleation of the small particles by addition of a shot
   of surfactant in the presence of large particles to produce bimodal
   latexes. Latexes with 60 wt\% solid content with viscosity of 490 mPa.s

Abstract = {{The importance of bacterial adherence has been acknowledged in microbial
   lignocellulose conversion studies; however, few reports have described
   the function and structure of biofilms supported by cellulosic
   substrates. We investigated the organization, dynamic formation, and
   carbon flow associated with biofilms of the obligately anaerobic
   cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum 27405. Using
   noninvasive, in situ fluorescence imaging, we showed biofilms capable of
   near complete substrate conversion with a characteristic monolayered
   cell structure without an extracellular polymeric matrix typically seen
   in biofilms. Cell division at the interface and terminal endospores
   appeared throughout all stages of biofilm growth. Using continuous-flow
   reactors with a rate of dilution (2 h(-1)) 12-fold higher than the
   bacterium's maximum growth rate, we compared biofilm activity under low
   (44 g/liter) and high (202 g/liter) initial cellulose loading. The
   average hydrolysis rate was over 3-fold higher in the latter case, while
   the proportions of oligomeric cellulose hydrolysis products lost from
   the biofilm were 13.7\% and 29.1\% of the total substrate carbon
   hydrolyzed, respectively. Fermentative catabolism was comparable between
   the two cellulose loadings, with ca. 4\% of metabolized sugar carbon
   being utilized for cell production, while 75.4\% and 66.7\% of the two
   cellulose loadings, respectively, were converted to primary carbon
   metabolites (ethanol, acetic acid, lactic acid, carbon dioxide).
   However, there was a notable difference in the ethanol-to-acetic acid
   ratio (g/g), measured to be 0.91 for the low cellulose loading and 0.41
   for the high cellulose loading. The results suggest that substrate
   availability for cell attachment rather than biofilm colonization rates
   govern the efficiency of cellulose conversion.}},

Abstract = {{The Irish government set a target in 2008 that 10\% of all vehicles in
   the transport fleet be powered by electricity by 2020. Similar electric
   vehicle targets have been introduced in other countries. In this study
   the effects of 213,561 electric vehicles on the operation of the single
   wholesale electricity market for the Republic of Ireland and Northern
   Ireland is investigated. A model of Ireland's electricity market in 2020
   is developed using the power systems market model called PLEXOS for
   power systems. The amount of CO2 emissions associated with charging the
   EVs and the impacts with respect to Ireland's target for renewable
   energy in transport is also quantified. A single generation portfolio
   and two different charging scenarios, arising from a peak and off-peak
   charging profile are considered. Results from the study confirm that
   off-peak charging is more beneficial than peak charging and that
   charging EVs will contribute 1.45\% energy supply to the 10\% renewable
   energy in transport target. The net CO2 reductions are 147 and 210 kt
   CO2 respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Non-torrefied biomass pellets produced using extrusion methods are
   mechanically weak and therefore produce fines/dust during handling and
   transportation, readily absorb moisture, remain biologically active,
   have low specific energy content together with poor flow and handling
   characteristics. A new spherical, torrefied biomass pellet is introduced
   that uses a compression method. The resulting pellet addresses the above
   noted shortcomings of extruded pellets. Designs of Experiments were
   constructed to examine the responses of these new pellets. Tests of
   tensile strength, ultimate and proximate analysis, abrasion resistance,
   moisture sensitivity, and mass and dimensional characteristics are
   considered. Pellets were found to have tensile strengths between 855 and
   2161 N, absorbed between 11.0 and 29.4 mass\% water, but returned to
   near ambient conditions in less than 24 h, and had a range of gross
   calorific values between 17.5 and 21.1 MJ/kg and had 100\% abrasion
   resistance. The Designs of Experiments were able to produce models with
   a 95\% confidence level for torrefaction, tensile strength, gross
   calorific value, pellet size, density, and moisture absorption and
   evaporation. Torrefaction temperature was found to be a dominant
   influence on the outcome of most pellet characteristics, yet the process
   is non-optimised in this work and in general is not well understood. (C)

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The motivation for this paper is to present an approach for rating the
   quality of the parameters in a computer-aided design model for use as
   optimization variables. Parametric Effectiveness is computed as the
   ratio of change in performance achieved by perturbing the parameters in
   the optimum way, to the change in performance that would be achieved by
   allowing the boundary of the model to move without the constraint on
   shape change enforced by the CAD parameterization. The approach is
   applied in this paper to optimization based on adjoint shape sensitivity
   analyses. The derivation of parametric effectiveness is presented for
   optimization both with and without the constraint of constant volume. In
   both cases, the movement of the boundary is normalized with respect to a
   small root mean squared movement of the boundary. The approach can be
   used to select an initial search direction in parameter space, or to
   select sets of model parameters which have the greatest ability to
   improve model performance. The approach is applied to a number of
   example 2D and 3D FEA and CFD problems.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{58-65}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Semianalytical transient solutions have been developed to evaluate what
   level of fractured porous media (e.g., bedrock or clay) matrix cleanup
   must be achieved in order to achieve compliance of fracture pore water
   concentrations within a specified time at specified locations of
   interest. The developed mathematical solutions account for forward and
   backward diffusion in a fractured porous medium where the initial
   condition comprises a spatially uniform, nonzero matrix concentration
   throughout the domain. Illustrative simulations incorporating the
   properties of mudstone fractured bedrock demonstrate that the time
   required to reach a desired fracture pore water concentration is a
   function of the distance between the point of compliance and the
   upgradient face of the domain where clean groundwater is inflowing.
   Shorter distances correspond to reduced times required to reach
   compliance, implying that shorter treatment zones will respond more
   favorably to remediation than longer treatment zones in which
   back-diffusion dominates the fracture pore water response. For a
   specified matrix cleanup goal, compliance of fracture pore water
   concentrations will be reached sooner for decreased fracture spacing,
   increased fracture aperture, higher matrix fraction organic carbon,
   lower matrix porosity, shorter aqueous phase decay half-life, and a
   higher hydraulic gradient. The parameters dominating the response of the
   system can be measured using standard field and laboratory techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Many scientific applications are programmed using hybrid programming
   models that use both message passing and shared memory, due to the
   increasing prevalence of large-scale systems with multicore, multisocket
   nodes. Previous work has shown that energy efficiency can be improved
   using software-controlled execution schemes that consider both the
   programming model and the power-aware execution capabilities of the
   system. However, such approaches have focused on identifying optimal
   resource utilization for one programming model, either shared memory or
   message passing, in isolation. The potential solution space, thus the
   challenge, increases substantially when optimizing hybrid models since
   the possible resource configurations increase exponentially.
   Nonetheless, with the accelerating adoption of hybrid programming
   models, we increasingly need improved energy efficiency in hybrid
   parallel applications on large-scale systems. In this work, we present
   new software-controlled execution schemes that consider the effects of
   dynamic concurrency throttling (DCT) and dynamic voltage and frequency
   scaling (DVFS) in the context of hybrid programming models.
   Specifically, we present predictive models and novel algorithms based on
   statistical analysis that anticipate application power and time
   requirements under different concurrency and frequency configurations.
   We apply our models and methods to the NPB MZ benchmarks and selected
   applications from the ASC Sequoia codes. Overall, we achieve substantial
   energy savings (8.74 percent on average and up to 13.8 percent) with
   some performance gain (up to 7.5 percent) or negligible performance
   loss.}},

Title = {{From inconsistency handling to non-canonical requirements management: A

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{As a class of defects in software requirements specification,
   inconsistency has been widely studied in both requirements engineering
   and software engineering. It has been increasingly recognized that
   maintaining consistency alone often results in some other types of
   non-canonical requirements, including incompleteness of a requirements
   specification, vague requirements statements, and redundant requirements
   statements. It is therefore desirable for inconsistency handling to take
   into account the related non-canonical requirements in requirements
   engineering. To address this issue, we propose an intuitive
   generalization of logical techniques for handling inconsistency to those
   that are suitable for managing non-canonical requirements, which deals
   with incompleteness and redundancy, in addition to inconsistency. We
   first argue that measuring non-canonical requirements plays a crucial
   role in handling them effectively. We then present a measure-driven
   logic framework for managing non-canonical requirements. The framework
   consists of five main parts, identifying non-canonical requirements,
   measuring them, generating candidate proposals for handling them,
   choosing commonly acceptable proposals, and revising them according to
   the chosen proposals. This generalization can be considered as an
   attempt to handle non-canonical requirements along with logic-based
   inconsistency handling in requirements engineering. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Measuring network connectivity under grid-based deployment in 3D space
   is a challenging problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Solving
   such a problem becomes an even more intricate task with realistic
   deployment factors such as placement uncertainty and hindrances to
   wireless communication channels. While much work has been published on
   optimizing connectivity, only a few papers have addressed such realistic
   aspects which cause severe connectivity problems in practice. In this
   paper, we introduce a novel grid-based deployment metric, called Average
   Connectivity Percentage in order to characterize the deployed network
   connectivity when sensor placements are subject to random errors around
   their corresponding grid locations. A generic approach is proposed to
   assess and evaluate the proposed metric. This generic approach is
   independent of the grid-shape, random error distributions, and different
   environment-based channel characteristics. We apply the generic approach
   in two practical deployment scenarios: the grid-based deployment with
   bounded uniform errors and with unbounded normal errors. In both cases,
   the average connectivity percentage is computed numerically and verified
   via extensive simulations. Based on the numerical results, quantified
   effects of positioning errors and grid edge length on the average
   connectivity percentage are outlined. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To prospectively assess the technical performance of an augmented
   reality system for MR-guided spinal injection procedures.
   The augmented reality system was used with a clinical 1.5-T MRI system.
   A total of 187 lumbosacral spinal injection procedures (epidural
   injection, spinal nerve root injection, facet joint injection, medial
   branch block, discography) were performed in 12 human cadavers. Needle
   paths were planned with the Perk Station module of 3D Slicer software on
   high-resolution MR images. Needles were placed under augmented reality
   MRI navigation. MRI was used to confirm needle locations. T1-weighted
   fat-suppressed MRI was used to visualise the injectant. Outcome
   variables assessed were needle adjustment rate, inadvertent puncture of
   non-targeted structures, successful injection rate and procedure time.
   Needle access was achieved in 176/187 (94.1 \%) targets, whereas 11/187
   (5.9 \%) were inaccessible. Six of 11 (54.5 \%) L5-S1 disks were
   inaccessible, because of an axial obliquity of 30Ee (27Ee-34Ee); 5/11
   (45.5 \%) facet joints were inaccessible because of osteoarthritis or
   fusion. All accessible targets (176/187, 94.1 \%) were successfully
   injected, requiring 47/176 (26.7 \%) needle adjustments. There were no
   inadvertent punctures of vulnerable structures. Median procedure time
   was 10.2 min (5-19 min).
   Image overlay navigated MR-guided spinal injections were technically
   accurate. Disks with an obliquity a parts per thousand yen27Ee may be
   inaccessible.}},

Abstract = {{It is often believed that both ionic liquids and surfactants generally
   behave as non-specific denaturants of proteins. In this paper, it is
   shown that amphiphilic ionic liquids bearing a long alkyl chain and a
   target molecule, where the target molecule is appended via a carboxylic
   ester functionality, can represent super-substrates that enable the
   catalytic activity of an enzyme, even at high concentrations in
   solution. Menthol has been chosen as the target molecule for slow and
   controlled fragrance delivery, and it was found that the rate of the
   menthol release can be controlled by the chemical structure of the ionic
   liquid. At a more fundamental level, this study offers an insight into
   the complex hydrophobic, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions

Abstract = {{The echo effect due to late reverberation can severely degrade speech
   quality and intelligibility. Prior attempts to reduce this degradation
   in the modulation domain used time-invariant filtering. In this paper,
   we show that performing minimum mean squared error spectral estimation
   in the modulation domain (MDMMSE) can significantly reduce the severity
   of audible reverberation and enhance the listening speech quality.
   Moreover, MDMMSE outperforms modulation domain spectral subtraction (SS)
   as well as performing MMSE spectral estimation or SS in the acoustic
   domain. In informal subjective listening tests, MDMMSE exhibits less
   residual echoes and artifacts than the other three methods.}},

Abstract = {{The future European power system will have a hierarchical structure
   created by layers of system control from a Supergrid via regional
   high-voltage transmission through to medium and low-voltage
   distribution. Each level will have generation sources such as
   large-scale offshore wind, wave, solar thermal, nuclear directly
   connected to this Supergrid and high levels of embedded generation,
   connected to the medium-voltage distribution system. It is expected that
   the fuel portfolio will be dominated by offshore wind in Northern Europe
   and PV in Southern Europe. The strategies required to manage the
   coordination of supply-side variability with demand-side variability
   will include large scale interconnection, demand side management, load
   aggregation and storage in the context of the Supergrid combined with
   the Smart Grid. The design challenge associated with this will not only
   include control topology, data acquisition, analysis and communications
   technologies, but also the selection of fuel portfolio at a macro level.
   This paper quantifies the amount of demand side management, storage and
   so-called `back-up generation' needed to support an 80\% renewable
   energy portfolio in Europe by 2050.}},

Abstract = {{Currently wind power is dominated by onshore wind farms in the British
   Isles, but both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland have high
   renewable energy targets, expected to come mostly from wind power.
   However, as the demand for wind power grows to ensure security of energy
   supply, as a potentially cheaper alternative to fossil fuels and to meet
   greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets offshore wind power will grow
   rapidly as the availability of suitable onshore sites decrease. However,
   wind is variable and stochastic by nature and thus difficult to
   schedule. In order to plan for these uncertainties market operators use
   wind forecasting tools, reserve plant and ancillary service agreements.
   Onshore wind power forecasting techniques have improved dramatically and
   continue to advance, but offshore wind power forecasting is more
   difficult due to limited datasets and knowledge. So as the amount of
   offshore wind power increases in the British Isles robust forecasting
   and planning techniques are even more critical. This paper presents a
   methodology to investigate the impacts of better offshore wind
   forecasting on the operation and management of the single wholesale
   electricity market in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland using
   PLEXOS for Power Systems.}},

   creating an offshore interconnected transmission network and subsea

   based on the invariant set. The MPC controller is determined by solving
   a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem. Numerical example

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the stability and stabilizability problems
   of networked control systems (NCSs) with partly quantized information.
   More precisely, the remote state variables transported from other
   sub-systems experience quantization errors, while the local state
   variables do not. This consideration is much more natural in NCSs due to
   the distributive nature of subsystems. Quantization errors are
   represented as convex poly-topic uncertainties. Based on the
   Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional approach, sufficient conditions for
   the existence of a quantized robust H infinity state feedback controller
   for NCSs are presented. Such conditions are obtained in terms of
   bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). Furthermore, a cone complementarity
   algorithm is utilized to convert these BMIs into a convex optimization
   problem. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the
   efficiency of proposed theorems.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there were proposed few stochastic gradient algorithms which
   are based on cost functions that have exponential dependence on the
   chosen error. However, in certain framework the convergence of the cost
   function based on exponential of the squared error is not always
   satisfactorily. Thus this cost function has been modified and the
   Exponentiated Convex Variable Step-Size (ECVSS) algorithm has been
   obtained. It has been shown that with an optimal selection of one tuning
   parameter the ECVSS algorithm provides attractive results. In this brief
   we present some performances of the ECVSS stochastic gradient algorithm
   (time constants, misadjustment, computational complexity) in data echo
   cancellation framework when the tuning parameter has different values.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a portion of a study on how model eliciting
   activities (MEAs) impact critical thinking development in first year

   benchmarked and assessed by pre- and post-testing using the Cornell
   Level-Z and the International Critical Thinking Essay Test. In addition
   to these tests, think-aloud protocols were conducted and coded to assess
   CTS development between experimental and control group volunteers.
   Preliminary analysis of the coding illustrates a potential difference in
   CTS between the experimental and control groups, which the authors
   believe may be attributed to MEA instruction. Further analysis of the
   pre- and post-tests, student experience and background surveys, and the
   remaining units of analysis in the think-aloud protocols is required

Abstract = {{Recent technological advances have allowed the development of
   force-dependent, intelligently controlled smart walkers that are able to
   provide users with enhanced mobility, support and gait assistance. The
   purpose of this study was to develop an intelligent rule-based
   controller for a smart walker to achieve a smooth interaction between
   the user and the walker. This study developed a rule-based mapping
   between the interaction force, measured by a load cell attached to the
   walker handle, and the acceleration of the walker. Ten young, healthy
   subjects were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed
   controller compared to a well-known admittance-based control system.
   There were no significant differences between the two control systems
   concerning their user experience, velocity profiles or average cost of
   transportation. However, the admittance-based control system required a
   1.2N lower average interaction force to maintain the 1m/s target speed
   (p = 0.002). Metabolic data also indicated that smart walker-assisted
   gait could considerably reduce the metabolic demand of walking with a
   four-legged walker.}},

Abstract = {{In walking like an inverted pendulum, the step-to-step transition period
   requires a substantial amount of simultaneous positive and negative
   mechanical work to redirect the center of mass between steps and it was
   considered as a major determinant of gait in terms of metabolic
   expenditure. In the current study, we developed a passive inter-limb
   device that transfers energy between the legs during the step-to-step
   transition period. By effectively transferring the energy dissipated at
   heel-strike from the leading leg to the trailing leg which is performing
   push-off, we hypothesize that the mechanical cost of transport (COT)
   will be reduced. Consequently, the lower limb muscles are required to do
   less positive and negative work, resulting in a reduced metabolic COT.
   Data from five subjects walking at 1.2m/s on an instrumented treadmill
   with the device active and passive was collected. It was found that the
   mechanical COT during the step-to-step transition period was reduced
   when walking with the device active. However, contrary to our hypothesis
   the metabolic COT increased when walking with the device active.}},

Abstract = {{The extrusion process is one of the main methods of processing polymeric
   materials and thermal homogeneity of the process output presents a major
   challenge for high quality extruded products. Therefore, accurate
   process thermal monitoring and control are highly desirable. However,
   most of the industrial extruders use conventional single point
   thermocouples for thermal monitoring although their measurements are
   highly affected by barrel metal wall temperature. Moreover, it has been
   shown that the melt temperature changes considerably with the die radial
   position and point based measurements are not sufficient to determine
   the actual process thermal stability and hence to control the thermal
   homogeneity of melt output. Conversely, the majority of process thermal
   control methods are based on linear models and are not capable of
   dealing with process nonlinearities. In this work, a die melt
   temperature profile was monitored by a thermocouple mesh technique and
   the data obtained was used to formulate a new nonlinear dynamic model to
   predict the die melt temperature profile in a single screw extruder. The
   model is in good agreement with the measured data and offers a promising
   thermal monitoring technique which can be used in real-time for a
   thermal profile based control framework in polymer extrusion.}},

   control affine system as a structured potential-driven system and to
   exploit the obtained representation for stability analysis and state
   feedback controller design. To recover the advantages of those
   representations for the stabilization of general nonlinear systems, the
   present note proposes a geometric decomposition technique, based on the
   Hodge decomposition theorem, to re-express a given vector field into a
   potential-driven form. Using the proposed decomposition technique,
   stability conditions are developed based on the convexity of the
   computed potentials. Finally, damping feedback stabilization is studied
   in the context of the proposed decomposition by using damping feedback
   to reshape the Hessian matrix of the obtained potential. Examples are
   given throughout the paper to illustrate the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the construction of models for a class of
   nonlinear systems that can be represented by linear in parameter models.
   This is not a trivial problem, as there are many possible combinations
   of model terms and exhaustive search is not an option when the number of
   possible model terms is large. Most existing fast approaches such as
   orthogonal least squares (OLS), fast recursive algorithm (FRA) and their
   variants serve the purpose of fast selection. However, these stepwise
   forward methods are greedy approaches in general and the resultant
   models are not optimal. Further, they do not control the model
   complexity (i.e. automatically stop the model selection). The two stage
   algorithm may improve the compactness of models obtained from forward
   algorithms, again, it does not determine how many model terms are
   necessary. Recently, some cross validation based methods have been
   proposed for automatic model construction, based on leave-one-out (LOO)
   criteria and OLS or FRA, however the issues related to the forward
   selection algorithms still exist. Further, LOO based methods are
   computationally expensive as the model often has to be trained N times
   (N is the number of samples) for just only one evaluation of the LOO
   criterion. In this paper, a novel and fast two stage algorithm is
   proposed for automatic construction of linear in parameter models for a
   class of nonlinear systems using LOO criterion, overcoming the
   disadvantages of stepwise model selection algorithms and reducing the
   computational complexity in applying the LOO criteria. Two numerical
   examples are presented to confirm its effectiveness.}},

   of the scatter to noise ratio does not have a closed form, hence we

   multiple users access a base station (BS) through a multi-antenna relay.
   For a fixed relay beamformer, the optimal user beamformers are
   determined. Then when user beamformers are fixed, the optimal relay
   beamformer is derived. An iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes the
   user and relay beamformers is then proposed and proven to converge to a
   fixed point. Numerical results reveal that (i) convergence typically
   requires about three iterations, and (ii) performance of the iterative
   algorithm is very close to that of the userrelay MIMO-MAC channel and
   relay-BS MIMO upper bounds. An extension is proposed where multiple
   relays, serving as access points, co-exist with directly accessing
   users. While not guaranteeing a globally optimum solution to this
   non-convex problem, numerical results show that the performance of this
   extended iterative algorithm is very close to the MIMO MAC upper bound.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses training-based channel estimation in distributed
   amplift-and-forward (AF) multi-input multi-output (MAIO) multi-relay
   networks. To reduce channel estimation overhead and delay, a training
   algorithm that allows for simultaneous estimation of the entire MIN()
   cooperative network's channel parameters at the destination node is
   proposed. The exact CramerRao lower bound (CRLB) for the problem is
   presented in closedform. Channel estimators that are capable of
   estimating the overall source-relay-destination channel parameters at
   the destination are also derived. Numerical results show that while
   reducing delay, the proposed channel estimators are close to the derived
   CRLB over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio values and outperform
   existing channel estimation methods. Finally, extensive simulations
   demonstrate that the proposed training method and channel estimators can
   be effectively deployed in combination with cooperative optimization
   algorithms to significantly enhance the performance of AF relaying MIMO
   systems in terms of average-bit-error-rate.}},

   needed between nodes. In this paper, we propose a network coding based
   scheme to ratelessly distribute data without any coordination between
   network nodes. To overcome the cubic decoding complexity of network
   coding, we follow a generation-based strategy, which groups the source
   packets into subsets called generations and only permits coding among
   packets belonging to the same generation. A maximum local potential
   innovativeness strategy is proposed to schedule transmissions of
   generations at intermediate nodes, where only local buffer information
   is needed. The transmission overhead at sink nodes, which is defined as
   the number of extra packets required for successful decoding caused by
   the non-optimal scheduling, is reduced by using overlapping generations
   where one source packet may be present in multiple generations. The
   and-or tree analysis technique is applied to analyze the performance of
   the overlapping generation-based network coding scheme and used to
   determine the optimal amount of overlap needed when constructing
   generations. The overall design is shown to achieve promising throughput
   rate while maintaining low decoding complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Human interest input could greatly enhance the efficiency of the
   multi-robot exploration. However, most of the previous work did not take
   the intention of the operator into account. In this paper, a human
   interest oriented multi-robot exploration system is designed. The system
   is composed of a mobile base station and several robot explorers. A
   human interest oriented task allocation method is developed to enable
   these robot explorers to coordinate based on the operator's intention.
   Furthermore, an optimization index is proposed to balance the obedience,
   connectivity and explorability of the system; and the optimization
   problem is solved to generate the movements of the mobile base station
   and the robot explorers. Simulations and real-world experiments have
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the system and the efficiency of the
   exploration process.}},

Abstract = {{Haptic interfaces have been applied as controllers in many areas
   especially tele-operation and distributed virtual environments. They are
   used to manipulate objects in both physical and virtual environments.
   Haptics enhance force interactions and provides a better immersive user
   experience. Moreover haptic devices inherently function in close
   proximity to humans. In the case of network-based haptic control, the
   network criteria for stability in haptic interactions are much more
   sophisticated than that for tethered devices and the kinematic and force
   data are required to be transferred over communication link within a
   stringent time. Otherwise, users may feel unexpected vibration or abrupt
   force even when the device is in free motion. This is mainly due to
   position desynchronization between local and remote environments. This
   paper addresses position synchronization which is the essential problem
   to lose stability of haptic experience under the influence of network
   and system impairments. A novel encoder referencing position
   synchronization algorithm is proposed in order to compensate the network
   latency and packet loss over network. This has been successfully tested
   under influence of the network impairment and low transmission rates.}},

Abstract = {{The derivative superposition (DS) technique is used to cancel the
   third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD) produced in a downconverter
   mixer. By providing separate bias currents to the mixer core and the
   distortion-cancelling circuitry, the IMD is reduced but the conversion
   gain remains nearly the same in the distortion-cancelling mixer compared
   to the baseline mixer without linearization. Measurements show that the
   distortion-cancelling mixer has an IIP3 that is 14 dB above the IIP3 of
   the baseline mixer while the conversion gain drops by only -0.7 dB. The
   distortion-cancelling mixer only needs an additional 2.4 mW of dc power
   relative to the baseline mixer's power draw. The test chip was
   fabricated in a standard 130 nm CMOS process and occupies an active area
   of 0.1 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{Fibre-Reinforced Plastics (FRPs) have been used in civil aerospace
   vehicles for decades. The current state-of-the-art in airframe design
   and manufacture results in approximately half the airframe mass
   attributable to FRP materials. The continual increase in the use of FRP
   materials over metallic alloys is attributable to the material's
   superior specific strength and stiffness, fatigue perfomrance and
   corrosion resistance. However, the full potential of these materials has
   yet to be exploited as analysis methods to predict physical failure with
   equal accuracy and robustness are not yet available. The result is a
   conservative approach to design, but one that can bring benefit via
   increased inspection intervals and reduced cost over the vehicle life.
   The challenge is that the methods used in practice are based on
   empirical tests and real relationships and drivers are difficult to see
   in this complex process and so the trade-off decision is challenging and
   uncertain. The aim of this feasibility study was to scope a viable
   process which could help develop some rules and relationships based on
   the fundamental mechanics of composite material and the economics of
   production and operation, which would enhance understanding of the role
   and impact of design allowables across the life of a composite

   competitions among these conglomerates lead to the convergence to a

   expert rules for heavy constraints handling not only in the
   pre-scheduling process and in the THMCA process as well, ensuring that
   the positions of all companies are feasible and near-optimal solutions
   to the UC problem. The algorithm is shown to have a fast execution speed

Abstract = {{The existence of loose particle left inside the space-borne electronic

   principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to reselect the nine
   features extracted from time and frequency domains, leading to six less
   correlated principal components. The reselected principal components are
   used for material identification using support vector machines (SVM).
   The experimental results show that this new method can effectively
   distinguish the type of materials including wire, aluminum and tin
   particles.}},

Abstract = {{A new formation control methodology is presented in this paper. The
   proposed technique is modelled by using the concept of cross-tensegrity
   structures. The main task is to regulate the desired formation of a
   group of vehicles and to perform point-to-point manoeuvring in the
   plane. The position of the controlled vehicles in the formation changes
   with respect to the admissible tendon forces by varying the lengths of
   bars in the dynamic tensegrity structure modelling. This change of bars'
   dimensions for geometric transformation is not possible in the
   application of tensegrity concept in the physical structural
   engineering. It has been demonstrated that this control method allows
   more flexibility over a wide range of different shape switching tasks
   using the predictable tendon control forces under the limited
   communication's range. The proposed approach is also scalable to any
   number of pairs of autonomous vehicles in the formation.}},

Abstract = {{Particle Impact Noise Detection (PIND) is an important method for
   detecting remainders within space relays. During the PIND process of
   sealed relays, the movement of remainders often cannot be observed
   directly. A new method to analyze the movement of remainders based on
   high-speed video technology is therefore proposed in this paper. The
   PIND process in special transparent cavities is studied, and the
   parameters to describe the kinetic movements of remainders are
   calculated based on image processing and data analysis. Then the PIND
   test conditions are explored with this method. Experimental results show
   that this method can capture the motion state of remainders in real time
   and calculate the remainder motion parameters effectively. This method
   offers an intuitive and reliable means of verifying the PIND test
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer extrusion is regarded as an energy intensive production process,
   the real-time monitoring of both thermal energy and motor drive energy
   consumption becomes necessary for the development of energy efficient
   management system. The use of power meter is a simple and easy way to
   achieve this, however the cost sometimes can be high. Mathematical
   models based on the process settings provide an affordable alternative,
   but the resultant models cannot be easily extended to other extruders
   with different geometry. In this paper, simple and accurate energy
   real-time monitoring methods are developed for the analysis of energy
   consumption of the thermal heating and motor drive respectively. This is
   achieved by looking inside the controller, and use the control variables
   to calculate the power consumption. The developed methods are then
   adopted to study the effects of operating settings on the energy
   efficiency. These include the barrel heating temperature, water cooling
   temperature, and screw speed. The experimental results on Killion
   KTS-100 extruder show that the barrel heating temperature has a negative
   effect on energy efficiency, while the water cooling setting affects the
   energy efficiency positively but insignificantly. Undoubtedly, screw
   speed has the most significant effect on energy efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Recently there has been considerable interest in the development of
   Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) due to the increasing demand in a
   number of maritime applications. One of the main challenges for unmanned
   (and even manned) vessels is detecting and avoiding the (static and
   dynamic) obstacles that may appear during a mission. This paper presents
   a practical solution for obstacle detection and avoidance mainly for
   USVs. More importantly, an integrated decision support framework is
   proposed which provides risk assessment as an integrated feature to the
   path planner. The hardware platform consists of a high definition video
   camera and a laser range sensor mounted on a pan and tilt device to
   detect obstacles in the vicinity of the ship. The performance of the
   proposed system is extensively investigated in a number of virtual
   maritime environment scenarios. The results reveal that the proposed
   system is able to detect multiple dynamic obstacles. Additionally, the
   proposed system provides a real-time visual interface (similar to radar
   screen) for the captain which includes recommended actions to avoid the
   obstacles in accordance with marine rules of the road.}},

Abstract = {{Translations of the femoral head with respect to the acetabular cup, in
   non-impinging zones, was investigated using surgical navigation methods.
   An ex-vivo study was conducted on five fresh-frozen human cadaver
   pelvises in distinct dissection states. Each specimen underwent a series
   of motions that included combinations of abduction/adduction,
   flexion/extension and internal/external rotations, repeated in four
   soft-tissue states: soft tissues intact; partially dissected with
   capsule intact; Z-shaped capsulotomy; and fully dissected and
   disarticulated. The data showed significant increases of excursions
   (p<0.05) between the first three soft tissue states. The findings
   supported the recently proposed model of aspherical hip motion, and
   imply that the femoral head translated before and after impingement. The
   results bring into question many accepted ideas in hip morphology,
   kinematics and surgical planning.}},

Abstract = {{In RFID tag identification, tag-to-tag collisions pose a challenging
   problem to protocol designers. Currently the modulation silencing
   mechanism (MSM) has been proposed to overcome the time and power wasted
   on collision slots during tag identification. In MSM, the time of
   collision slots is reduced by the assistance of the continuous wave
   absence detection (CWAD) circuit. CWAD allows the tags to sense the
   reader's RF signal cutoff and terminate data modulation. In this paper,
   we propose an enhanced CWAD (ECWAD) design to reduce the time required
   for RF cutoff detection. The ECWAD circuit mitigates the tag-to-tag
   collision effects on both identification efficiency and throughput.
   ECWAD is a fast and low power sensing circuit that allows having shorter
   collision slots, faster tag identification, and limited voltage drop at
   the tag. When compared to the existing CWAD design, the proposed design
   detects the RF signal cutoff by the reader in less than 20\% of that in
   CWAD and reduces the collision slot time by more than 32\%.}},

Abstract = {{Wearable computing devices, appcessories, or even portable devices, such
   as the latest smartphones or tablets, all include low-cost MEMS sensors.
   This means very high noise and high random drift rates. In addition to
   this, the mobility of the devices creates freely changing orientation
   with respect to the hosting platform (such as person or vehicle) at any
   time. All these facts explain why obtaining reliable navigation solution
   using this kind of devices is a real challenge.
   This paper proposes a multiple sensors' triads solution and the
   underlying techniques to benefit from this redundancy of sensors to
   enhance the navigation solution, given the fact that it is likely that a
   user will carry multiple devices most of the time, whether wearable
   computing devices, portable devices, and/or appcessories which are
   wirelessly connected together. Benefiting from the multiple triads and
   integrating them boosts the final results outstandingly and results in a
   higher accuracy navigation solution in the different environments
   indoors or outdoors, in open sky, urban canyon, or GNSS outages, whether
   on foot or driving.}},

Abstract = {{Carrier phase measurements require resolution of integer ambiguities
   before precise positioning can be achieved. The GPS receiver can keep
   track of the integer number of cycles as long as the receiver maintains
   lock to the satellite signal. However, in reality, the GPS signal could
   be interrupted momentary by some disturbing factors leading to a
   discontinuity of an integer number of cycles in the measured carrier
   phase. This interruption in the counting of cycles in the carrier phase
   measurements is known as a cycle slip. After a cycle slip, ambiguities
   need to be resolved again or cycle slips need to be corrected to resume
   the precise positioning/navigation process. These cycle slips can, to
   some extent, be detected and fixed to avoid delay and computation
   complexity attributed to the process of integer ambiguity resolution.
   Capitalizing on the complementary characteristics of INS and GPS, INS is
   used to provide external information to detect and correct cycle slips.
   Lately, MEMS grade inertial sensors are being used for low cost
   navigation applications. Moreover, recent research is geared towards the
   use of fewer numbers of sensors avoiding their complex errors and
   reducing the cost. This paper introduces integration of GPS and reduced
   inertial sensor system (RISS) to address the problem of cycle slips. The
   performance of proposed method is examined on several real-life land
   vehicle trajectories which included various challenging driving
   scenarios including high and slow speeds, sudden accelerations and
   decelerations, sharp turns and steep slopes etc. Results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in these severe conditions which
   cause intensive and variable-sized cycle slips. This research has a
   direct influence on navigation in challenging environments where
   frequent cycle slips occur and resolving integer ambiguities is not
   affordable because of time and computational constraints. An additional
   consequence of this research is the significant reduction in the cost of
   an integrated system due to the use of fewer MEMS inertial sensors.}},

Abstract = {{The process of self-formation of alluvial streams is considered in the
   light of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and the Gibb's
   equation. The stream is treated as an isolated and irreversible system.
   The related energy-analysis of a self-forming alluvium stream suggests
   that river self-formation is derived from the need of a stream to
   progressively decrease its average flow velocity to accommodate the
   increase in the entropy of the system with the passage of time. The
   regime development thus appears as the process in which the river alters
   its configuration (cross-sectional geometry, slope and effective
   roughness) so that the smallest possible value of average flow velocity
   (or, equivalently, of the Froude number) is reached. A method for the
   computation of regime flow width, depth and slope, based on the channel
   formation criterion resulting from this work, is presented. The regime
   channels computed from this method are compared with field and
   laboratory data from various sources.}},

Abstract = {{An equation for the bed development time of alluvial meandering streams
   is introduced. In agreement with the prevailing approach, it is assumed
   that the stream centreline follows a sine-generated curve; the banks are
   rigid; the flow is turbulent and subcritical; and the width-to-depth
   ratio is ``large{''}. The bed is flat at the beginning of an
   ``experiment{''} (i.e., at time t = 0). The bed development consists of
   the formation of large-scale, laterally adjacent pool-bar complexes
   strictly induced by the stream curvature. The derivation of the present
   equation rests on dimensional and physical considerations. It is found
   that the bed development time is proportional to the square of the flow
   width and inversely proportional to the specific volumetric bed-load
   corresponding to the channel-averaged flow. The proportionality factor
   is a not yet known function of the stream initial deflection angle. To
   bring the present equation into a form suitable for practical
   applications, the form of this function is revealed on the basis of a
   series of experiments carried out by the authors in three sine-generated
   meandering streams of varying sinuosity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method to immobilize sand in laboratory
   channels. The motivation for the present work was to develop a method
   that would: 1-not involve the use of harsh chemicals; and 2-ensure that
   the granular roughness of the original bed would not be appreciably
   changed. The resulting method involves coating the surface with a
   mixture of sand and a small amount of Portland cement. The first part of
   this paper is intended as a report of the laboratory tests carried out
   at Queen's University to develop the method, and more specifically to
   determine the optimal amount of cement and effect on roughness, as well
   as gain insights into the shear strength and durability of the hardened
   layer. On the basis of these tests, it was found that the method can be
   used to fix both flat and deformed beds, with the hardened layer being
   strong enough to withstand a wide range of typical laboratory shear
   stresses. The method was found to be particularly effective for sands up
   to 1.1 mm, when it is possible to ensure that the granular roughness of
   the fixed bed is comparable to that of the movable bed by merely using
   in the coating mixture a coarser sand than the original one. In the
   second part of the paper, additional experience with the method acquired
   through a recent research application, involving the immobilization of a
   train of dunes in a flume, is reported.}},

Abstract = {{It has been known that bottom hinged Oscillating Wave Surge Converters
   (OWSCs) are an efficient way of extracting power from ocean waves
   (Whittaker et al. 2007). OWSCs are in general large buoyant flaps,
   hinged at the bottom of the ocean and oscillating back and forth under
   the action of incoming incident waves (Schmitt et al. 2012, Renzi and
   Dias 2012). The oscillating motion is then converted into energy by
   pumping high-pressure water to drive a hydro electric turbine.
   This paper deals with numerical studies of wave loading on an OWSC using
   the FLUENT software. In numerical simulation of wave loading on an OWSC
   using mesh-based methods, the mesh around the flap is required to be
   updated frequently. This is due to the large amplitude rotation of the
   OWSC around the hinge. In this work, the remeshing was achieved by using
   the so-called dynamic mesh approach built in FLUENT. Furthermore, the
   motion of the OWSC is updated in time using a fourth order multi point
   time integration scheme coupled with the flow solver. The results for
   the flap motion and the excited torque on the hinged position were
   compared with experimental data obtained in a wave tank at Queen's
   University of Belfast. The results showed the capability of the
   numerical model with a dynamic mesh approach in modeling large amplitude
   motions of the flap. In addition, the pressures at various locations on
   the flap were compared with the experimental measurements in order to
   demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model in capturing local
   features of the flow as well as the global features.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper, an experimental investigation of the performance
   of a low mach number round straight air-air ejector with a 4-ring
   entraining diffuser is reported. The ejector system was mounted on an
   annular flow wind tunnel. Based on the hydraulic diameter and average
   velocity and temperature at the nozzle exit, the tunnel provides cold
   flow at Mach 0.2 with a Reynolds number of 5.2x10(5) and hot flow at
   Mach 0.27 with a Reynolds number of 2.6x10(5).
   The end shape of the annulus' center body has major effects on the core
   separation size and shape that strongly affects the ejector performance.
   The effects of the annulus' center body with elliptical and square ends
   on the ejector pumping, wall static pressure distribution and back
   pressure were investigated under different flow temperatures and swirl
   angles: 0 degrees, 10 degrees, 20 degrees, and 30 degrees. These
   measurements were conducted at 129 mm standoff distance using two
   different nozzle exit diameters.
   It was found that for both nozzle exit diameters, using the annulus'
   center body with a square end improved the total pumping ratio over its
   ratio with an elliptical end due to the flatness of the core separation
   at the nozzle exits. For all configurations tested, the maximum
   entrainment ratio was observed with 20 swirl angle and the back pressure
   coefficient decreased as swirl angle increased. Removing the elliptical
   end, creating the square shape, the flow has more space to spread after
   the annulus' center body to give the higher centerline velocity which
   enhances the flow uniformity at the nozzle and diffuser exits.}},

Abstract = {{The core flow separation in air-air ejectors is significantly affected
   by the length of the exhaust nozzle. This length was changed by moving
   the annulus' center body end 4, 7, and 12 cm upstream and 1 cm
   downstream of the nozzle inlet. The velocity profiles at the nozzle exit
   were measured at different mass flow rates and at 10, 20 and 30 degree
   swirl angles. These measurements were also conducted at two annulus'
   center body end positions with elliptical and square shapes, 12 and 7 cm
   upstream of the nozzle inlet, using two nozzle exit diameters. At 4, 7,
   and 12 cm upstream and 1 cm downstream of the nozzle inlet, the ejector
   performance was also measured at ambient temperature and at different
   flow swirl angles. It was found that the square shape of the annulus'
   center body decreased the size of the core flow separation behind the
   annulus center body compared with the elliptical shape by improving the
   flatness of the flow velocity at the nozzle exit under different mass
   flow rates, swirl angles, positions of the annulus' center body, and
   nozzle exit diameters. It was seen that moving the end of the annular
   center body upstream has considerable effects on the size and nature of
   the core separation behind the annulus' center body and consequently on
   the ejector performance.
   At a zero swirl angle, the ejector pumping ratio slightly increased,
   decreased, and then increased again by moving the annulus' center body
   from 12 cm to 7 cm upstream, from 7 cm to 4 cm upstream, and from 4 cm
   upstream to 1 cm downstream of the nozzle inlet respectively. These
   changes in the annulus' center body position caused the back pressure
   coefficient to decrease, increase, and then increase again. The same
   trend in pumping ratio and back pressure was observed for both 10 and 20
   degree flow swirl angle conditions when the annulus' center body was
   moved as described.}},

Abstract = {{A coarse grid CFD methodology was employed to simulate internal flow
   passages with full coverage effusion cooling by imposing momentum sinks
   on effusion cooled surfaces based on a perforated plate pressure loss
   analogy The methodology was implemented by specifying 1D Porous Jump
   boundary conditions (available in ANSYS FLUENT) on the effusion cooled
   surfaces.
   Numerical simulations were conducted based on the experimental data of
   an S-duct diffusing passage where ambient air was passively drawn into
   the sub-atmospheric passage along the different effusion surfaces with 1
   mm diameter holes spaced 4 mm apart. The porous wall simulations were
   also compared to an alternative CFD approach with mass inlet boundary
   specified on the effusion surfaces.
   The proposed porous wall model is promising for practical design
   applications with the reasonable simulations of the S-duct flow fields
   with effusion injections. A reasonable accuracy in the results of
   injection mass flow rates was also obtained for the different effusion
   configurations. Discrepancies in the simulations of flow momentum
   components were mainly contributed to the diminishing effects of
   discrete injections at the aft-section of cooling surface due to the
   development of a shear layer across the free surfaces (porous jump
   boundaries) between the main flow and coolant flow.}},

   numbers of 0.8-3.5 x 10(5) on several annular diffuser designs to

   The procedure involved in attaching the outer duct wall caused a maximum
   5\% axis shift with respect to the outlet diameter at the diffuser
   outlet relative to the centre body axis and translated to an approximate
   inlet variation in height of 2\%. This shift was sufficient to distort
   the flow whereby the quadrant with the greater area at the annular
   diffuser inlet corresponded to higher total pressure at the outlet.
   Results showed that static pressure coefficient never varied by more

Abstract = {{Short annular diffuser systems consisting of a conical expansion section
   with negative wall angles and a solid diffusing section were tested
   experimentally and numerically. Three centre bodies with different wall
   angles and three outer walls with area ratios with respect to the
   annular diffuser inlet of 1.65, 1.91, and 2.74 were manufactured. The
   designs were selected from a set of ideal solutions determined by a
   numerical multiobjective optimization study completed by Cerantola and
   Birk (2012). Results presented in this paper are Reynolds number
   independent and are based on tests completed with an inlet Reynolds
   number of Re-t approximate to 1.4 x 10(5) and Mach number M-t
   approximate to 0.16. Through considering the various centre body and
   outer wall configurations, an initial flow angle of 14 degrees provides
   the best performance and the larger diameter outer wall generates more
   static pressure recovery at the expense of a reduction in outlet
   velocity uniformity and greater total pressure loss. The three selected
   designs were found to be in agreement with their optimum design
   qualities. When compared to computational solutions, the realizable
   k-epsilon turbulence model on coarse grids delivered the best relative
   comparison whereas the SST turbulence model predicted the best absolute
   agreement.}},

   the capability of RANS based CFD in modeling such complex flow passages

   studies were conducted to examine the effects of inlet turbulence
   properties in conjunction with the use of various turbulence models
   (k-epsilon, realizable k-epsilon and SST k-omega). Improvements in
   prediction accuracies using detailed computational domains were also
   examined including (i) lengthened inlet section to simulate upstream
   flow development, and (ii) addition of downstream flow domain to better
   simulate flow diffusion to an ambient outlet. Altering model geometry
   and inlet boundary conditions along with the use of different turbulence
   models had minimal improvements in the simulation results. The CFD
   results demonstrated that the S-bend flow features and the increasing
   trends of pressure magnitudes with higher Reynolds numbers were
   reasonably simulated. Limitations in predicting the diffusing flow
   fields were evident with the over predictions of pressure recovery. The

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation of flame acceleration in a narrow
   rectangular cross-section channel with various lower boundary conditions
   is presented. The boundary conditions investigated include a smooth
   surface and a rough surface with and without porosity. Tests were
   performed with a mixture of nitrogen diluted stoichiometric
   methane-oxygen, i.e., CH4 + 2(O-2 + 2/3N(2)), at initial pressures in
   the range of 9-15 kPa. The explosion front velocity was measured via
   ionization probes and pressure transducers and the explosion wave front
   structure was visualized by high-speed shadowgraph video. For tests
   performed with a porous rough surface the flame achieves a velocity that
   approaches the speed of sound of the combustion products. In the case of
   the rough surface without porosity, a globally quasi-steady high-speed
   flame is produced with a velocity between the combustion products speed
   of sound and the Chapman-Jouguet detonation velocity. It is proposed
   that flame acceleration beyond the speed of sound of the combustion
   products is possible due to enhanced burning that is driven by
   chemical-acoustic interactions. Such interactions occur as the turbulent
   flame brush is traversed by transverse pressure waves produced by the
   passage of the explosion front shock wave over the rough surface. It is
   also observed that under certain conditions a smooth transition from a
   diffusion driven flame to a shock ignition detonation is possible. (C)

   Carboniferous-Permian continental magmatic arc on the western Pangaean
   margin. The 15 km x 5 km pluton is bounded by two N-S Permian dextral
   faults, an E-W thrust to the south, and an E-W normal fault to the
   north. Thermobarometric data indicate that the main, ca. 289-287 Ma,
   part of the pluton was emplaced at <= 20 km depth and <= 700 degrees C
   and was exhumed to 11 km and 400 degrees C in 4 +/- 2 million years. We
   have documented the following intrusive sequence: (1) the 306 Ma
   northern marginal mafic phase; (2) the 287 Ma main trondhjemitic phase;
   and (3) ca. 289-283 Ma sub-vertical dikes that vary from (a) N39E,
   undeformed with crystal growth perpendicular to the margins, through (b)
   ca. N50-73E, foliated and folded with sinistral shear indicators, to (c)
   N73-140E and boudinaged. The obliquity of the boundary between the
   folded and stretched dikes relative to the N-S dextral faults suggests
   sequential emplacement in a transtensional regime (with 20\% E-W
   extension), followed by different degrees of clockwise rotation passing
   through a shortening field accompanied by sinistral shear into an
   extensional field. The ca. 289-287 Ma intrusion also contains a steep
   ENE-striking foliation and hornblende lineations varying from
   sub-horizontal to steeply plunging, probably the result of emplacement
   in a triclinic strain regime. We infer that magmatism ceased when some
   of the dextral motion was transferred from the western to the eastern
   bounding fault, causing thrusting to take place along the southern
   boundary of the pluton. This mechanism is also invoked for the rapid
   uplift and exhumation of the pluton between ca. 287 Ma and 283 Ma. The
   distinctive characteristics of the Totoltepec pluton should prove useful
   in identifying similar tectonic settings within continental arcs.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the effects of prestrain magnitude on 3 mm AA5754
   sheet in bending at nominal applied strain rates of 0.001/s and 0.1/s.
   The necessity of incorporating prestrain and strain rate effects into
   numerical simulations of bending is also evaluated. A series of
   experimental bend tests using axial compression in the longitudinal
   material direction were performed following plane strain prestrain in
   the transverse material direction. An inelastic buckling mode of
   deformation was produced with the peak buckling load increasing and the
   minimum load decreasing with larger magnitudes of prestrain. A
   semi-empirical material model, referred to as the Voce-MA model, was
   developed which incorporates strain rate-sensitivity of the flow stress,
   the prestrain magnitude and their interaction. Simulations of the bend
   tests using this material model were then performed in LS-DYNA at
   nominal applied strain rates of 0.001/s and 0.1/s for samples with 0, 3,
   6 and 12\% plane strain prestrain. It was shown that for AA5754 sheet in
   bending, prestrain effects must be considered in terms of current sheet
   thickness and material hardening. While the peak and minimum loads are
   not strain rate sensitive at the low rates used in this study, a
   rate-dependant material model is still necessary in order to account for
   the deviations in local strain rate from the applied strain rate. The
   Voce-MA material model was capable of representing prestrain and strain
   rate effects for all cases of AA5754 sheet in bending considered in this
   study. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   digestion liquor and limestone powder: High Shear wet granulation}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{233}},
Pages = {{245-254}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Generally, the solid and liquid fractions (digestate) from Anaerobic
   Digestion (AD) energy production are considered as waste. This has a
   negative impact on the sustainability of AD processes because of the
   financial outlay required to treat digestate before being discharged
   into municipal water treatment plants or natural water bodies. The main
   aim of this research was to investigate feasibility of producing an
   organic fertiliser using anaerobic digestate and limestone powders as
   the raw materials employing a high shear granulation process. Two-level
   factorial experimental design was used to determine the influence of
   granulation process variables on, the strength, resistance to attrition
   and yield of the granules. It was concluded from the study that it is
   technically feasible to produce organic fertiliser granules of
   acceptable strength and product yield. Increasing the liquid-to-solid
   ratio during granulation leads to increased granule strength and better
   product yield. Although the strength of the granules produced was lower
   than typical strength of commercial synthetic fertiliser granules (about
   5 to 7 MPa), this could be improved by mixing the digestate with a
   polymeric binder or coating the particles post granulation. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We present here the analysis of about 19,500 new star hours of low
   ecliptic latitude observations (vertical bar b vertical bar <= 20
   degrees) obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope's Fine Guidance Sensors
   over a time span of more than nine years, which is in addition to the
   similar to 12,000 star hours previously analyzed by Schlichting et al.
   Our search for stellar occultations by small Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs)
   yielded one new candidate event corresponding to a body with a 530 +/-
   70 m radius at a distance of about 40 AU. Using bootstrap simulations,
   we estimate a probability of approximate to 5\% that this event is due
   to random statistical fluctuations within the new data set. Combining
   this new event with the single KBO occultation reported by Schlichting
   et al. we arrive at the following results: (1) the ecliptic latitudes of
   6 degrees.6 and 14 degrees.4 of the two events are consistent with the
   observed inclination distribution of larger, 100-km-sized KBOs. (2)
   Assuming that small, sub-kilometer-sized KBOs have the same ecliptic
   latitude distribution as their larger counterparts, we find an ecliptic
   surface density of KBOs with radii larger than 250 m of N(r > 250 m) =
   1.1(-0.7)(+1.5) x 10(7) deg(-2); if sub-kilometer-sized KBOs have
   instead a uniform ecliptic latitude distribution for -20 degrees < b <
   20 degrees then N(r > 250 m) = 4.4(-2.8)(+5.8) x 10(6) deg(-2). This is
   the best measurement of the surface density of sub-kilometer-sized KBOs
   to date. (3) Assuming the KBO size distribution can be well described by
   a single power law given by N(>r) proportional to r(1-q), where N(>r) is
   the number of KBOs with radii greater than r, and q is the power-law
   index, we find q = 3.8 +/- 0.2 and q = 3.6 +/- 0.2 for a KBO ecliptic
   latitude distribution that follows the observed distribution for larger,
   100-km-sized KBOs and a uniform KBO ecliptic latitude distribution for
   -20 degrees < b < 20 degrees, respectively. (4) Regardless of the exact
   power law, our results suggest that small KBOs are numerous enough to
   satisfy the required supply rate for the Jupiter family comets. (5) We
   can rule out a single power law below the break with q > 4.0 at 2 sigma,
   confirming a strong deficit of sub-kilometer-sized KBOs compared to a
   population extrapolated from objects with r > 45 km. This suggests that
   small KBOs are undergoing collisional erosion and that the Kuiper Belt
   is a true analog to the dust producing debris disks observed around
   other stars.}},

   photoluminescence intensity undergoes a sharp transition between the p-
   and n-doped regions. The OBIC photocurrent is only observed in the
   transition region that is narrower than the width of the excitation
   beam, which is about 35 mu m. The results depict a static planar polymer

Abstract = {{For 112 Gb/s dual-polarization 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation
   systems, the performance and complexity of the low-pass filter
   (LPF)-assisted digital back-propagation (DBP) algorithm for mitigating
   intrachannel fiber nonlinearity are investigated. Comparison is made
   with both linear equalization and the standard DBP algorithm for
   single-channel transmission (simulation and experiment) and for
   wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) transmission with channel spacings
   of 50 and 35 GHz (simulation). With optimized values for the algorithm
   parameters, the simulation results show that, compared to linear
   equalization, the 0.2 steps/span LPF-assisted DBP algorithm can increase
   the transmission distance by 84\%, 40\%, and 17\% for a single-channel,
   50 GHz channel-spaced WDM, and 35 GHz channel-spaced WDM transmission,
   respectively. These improvements in the transmission distance are 54\%,
   75\%, and 77\% of those achieved with the 4 steps/span standard DBP
   algorithm but at considerably lower complexity. Single-channel
   experimental results show that the 0.25 steps/span LPF-assisted DBP
   algorithm can increase the transmission distance by 43\%, which is 68\%
   of the improvement achieved with the 4 steps/span standard DBP
   algorithm. Compared to the standard DBP algorithm, the LPF-assisted DBP
   algorithm can allow a reduction in the number of steps/span, but with an
   increased computational complexity for each step. The two DBP algorithms
   are compared in terms of the number of real multiplications per bit,

Abstract = {{Two novel linewidth-tolerant, low-complexity feedforward carrier phase
   estimation algorithms are described for dual-polarization 16-ary

   stage employs either a simplified quadrature-phase-shift-keying (QPSK)

   second stage employs a novel QPSK constellation transformation
   algorithm. The performance and linewidth tolerance of both algorithms
   are evaluated using experimental and simulation data, and the hardware
   complexity is assessed. For both proposed two-stage algorithms, the
   linewidth symbol duration product is 1.3 x 10(-4) for a 1 dB penalty in
   optical signal-to-noise ratio at a bit error ratio of 10(-3). This
   performance is comparable to a single-stage BPS algorithm with a large
   number of test phases, but with a reduction of the hardware complexity

Abstract = {{This paper investigates automatic construction of radial basis function
   (RBF) neural models for nonlinear dynamic systems. The main objective is
   to automatically and effectively produce a parsimonious RBF neural model
   that generalizes well. This is achieved by proposing a locally
   regularized automatic construction (LRAC) method which combines a
   recently proposed fast recursive algorithm (FRA) with the leave-one-out
   (LOU) cross-validation criterion. The new method offers distinctive
   advantages over existing approaches. Firstly, it uses an error criterion
   where the original model parameters are regularized, in contrast to
   orthogonal least square (OLS) based approaches where transformed model
   parameters are regularized. This enables the determination of the
   significance of each original candidate center and produces a compact
   neural model. Further, it can automatically determine the network size
   by the iteratively minimizing a LOU mean-square-error (MSE) without the
   need to specify any additional termination criterion. Finally, by
   defining a proper regression context, the whole network construction
   process can be concisely formulated and easily implemented with
   significantly reduced computation. An analysis of computational
   complexity confirms the efficiency of the proposed method, and
   simulation results reveal its effectiveness in comparison with
   alternative approaches for producing sparse RBF neural models. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Heterogeneity is an important factor controlling fracture initiation,
   accumulation, and propagation within polycrystalline rock. Internal
   spatial variability in terms of mineralogy, grain size, and anisotropy
   affect the yielding process. To investigate these factors, a
   texture-generating algorithm integrated within a numerical model was
   developed to create realistic rock analogs and provide user control over
   geological characteristics including mineral type, grain size, and
   anisotropic crystal shape. A mineral-specific constitutive model was
   created and calibrated using published values and real laboratory
   strength values. Brazilian tensile strength and unconfined compressive
   strength (UCS) model tests were developed using the finite-difference
   modeling software FLAC to perform parametric analysis of a series of
   geological characteristics. The results show that the methodology is
   capable of realistically reproducing damage propagation and failure
   behavior similar to that observed during laboratory testing. The
   strength results show trends similar to those found during laboratory
   testing. This methodology was applied to the simulation of tunnel-boring

Abstract = {{Latent semantic indexing (LSI) is a technique used for intelligent
   information retrieval (IR). It can be used as an alternative to
   traditional keyword matching IR and is attractive in this respect
   because of its ability to overcome problems with synonymy and polysemy.
   This study investigates various aspects of LSI: the effect of the Haar
   wavelet transform (HWT) as a preprocessing step for the singular value
   decomposition (SVD) in the key stage of the LSI process; and the effect
   of different threshold types in the HWT on the search results. The
   developed method allows the visualisation and processing of the term
   document matrix, generated in the LSI process, using HWT. The results
   have shown that precision can be increased by applying the HWT as a
   preprocessing step, with better results for hard thresholding than soft
   thresholding, whereas standard SVD-based LSI remains the most effective
   way of searching in terms of recall value.}},

   experiments, the authors assume that the LEVs have gamma distributions.
   This is equivalent to the unconditional heavy-tailed local Bessel K-form
   prior densities given LEVs. This model is able to more accurately model
   the intrascale dependency between adjacent wavelet coefficients. The
   authors employ both maximum a posteriori and minimum mean-squared error
   MMSE estimators of the unconditional distributions, to reduce the noise
   in the 3D DCWT domain. The authors examine their spatially adaptive
   algorithm for reduction of various types of noise including additive
   white Gaussian noise, non-stationary noise, Poisson noise and speckle
   noise. The proposed method results in an impressive video enhancement
   without any explicit use of motion estimation. This is because, the 3D
   DCWT is a motion selective transform and isolates the motions and
   directions in its sub-bands.}},

Abstract = {{It is important to accurately measure and predict the laser light
   transmission through unreinforced and reinforced thermoplastics if
   candidate materials are to be assessed for laser transmission welding
   (LTW) applications. This paper presents the results of laser
   transmission measurements through unreinforced polyamide 6 (PA6) and
   10\% glass fiber reinforced polycarbonate of various thicknesses and
   corresponding to various laser incidence angles (angle between the
   incident laser beam and the normal to the transparent part). A novel
   transmission measurement method, developed by the authors, was employed.
   A model, utilizing the Fresnel specular surface reflection conditions as
   well as accounting for refraction, absorption and reflection of the
   laser light through the bulk material, was used to predict transmission
   as a function of thickness and laser incidence angle. Results of
   transmission tests on both materials showed that, for a given thickness,
   the transmission decreases as the laser angle of incidence increases. In
   addition, at any given laser incidence angle, the transmission decreases
   as the thickness increases. The advantage of the model is that it
   requires only one experimentally determined constant for a given
   material. Good agreement existed between the experimentally measured
   transmission and the model prediction for the range of thicknesses and
   laser incidence angles studied. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007619]}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Dwindling fossil fuel resources and pressures to reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions will result in a more diverse range of generation portfolios
   for future electricity systems. Irrespective of the portfolio mix the
   overarching requirement for all electricity suppliers and system
   operators is to instantaneously meet demand, to operate to standards and
   reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore all electricity market
   participants will ultimately need to use a variety of tools to balance
   the power system. Thus the role of demand side management with energy
   storage will be paramount to integrate future diverse generation
   portfolios. Electric water heating has been studied previously,
   particularly at the domestic level to provide load control, peak shave
   and to benefit end-users financially with lower bills, particularly in
   vertically integrated monopolies. In this paper a number of continuous
   direct load control demand response based electric water heating
   algorithms are modelled to test the effectiveness of wholesale
   electricity market signals to study the system benefits. The results are
   compared and contrasted to determine which control algorithm showed the
   best potential for energy savings, system marginal price savings and
   wind integration. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sustained-release matrix tablets based on Eudragit RL and RS were
   manufactured by injection moulding. The influence of process
   temperature; matrix composition; drug load, plasticizer level; and salt
   form of metoprolol: tartrate (MPT), fumarate (MPF) and succinate (MPS)
   on ease of processing and drug release were evaluated. Formulations
   composed of 70/30\% Eudragit RL/MPT showed the fastest drug release,
   substituting part of Eudragit RL by RS resulted in slower drug release,
   all following first-order release kinetics. Drug load only affected drug
   release of matrices composed of Eudragit RS: a higher MPT concentration
   yielded faster release rates. Adding triethyl citrate enhanced the
   processability, but was detrimental to long-term stability. The process
   temperature and plasticizer level had no effect on drug release, whereas
   metoprolol salt form significantly influenced release properties. The
   moulded tablets had a low porosity and a smooth surface morphology. A
   plasticizing effect of MPT, MPS and MPF on Eudragit RS and Eudragit RL
   was observed via DSC and DMA. Solubility parameter assessment, thermal
   analysis and X-ray diffraction demonstrated the formation of a solid
   solution immediately after production, in which H-bonds were formed
   between metoprolol and Eudragit as evidenced by near-infrared
   spectroscopy. However, high drug loadings of MPS and MPF showed a
   tendency to recrystallise during storage. The in vivo performance of
   injection-moulded tablets was strongly dependent upon drug loading.}},

   ball milling. The initial product of the mechanochemical synthesis is a
   novel acetic acid solvate of Alq(3), and the alpha polymorph of Alq(3)
   is obtained on subsequent heating/desolvation of this phase. The
   structure of the mechanochemically prepared acetic acid solvate of
   Alq(3) has been determined directly from powder X-ray diffraction data
   and is shown to be a different polymorph from the corresponding acetic
   acid solvate prepared by solution-state crystallization of Alq(3) from
   acetic acid. Significantly, the mechanochemical synthesis of Alq(3) is
   shown to be fully scalable across two orders of magnitude from 0.5 to 50

Abstract = {{A numerical model `BioClog' is used to examine clogging of granular
   drainage material within finger drains at the base of landfills. The
   reduction in porosity of drainage material is evaluated as the
   accumulation of clog mass reduces the pore spaces of granular media. The
   leachate mounding within the landfills caused by the reduction in
   hydraulic conductivity of finger drain is modeled. The effect of
   overburden pressure on the engineering properties of waste material and
   consequent leachate mounding is considered. The calculated rates of
   leachate mound development for two landfills with finger drain leachate
   collection are shown to be in encouraging agreement with the observed
   data at the times when data were available. It is demonstrated that a
   significant leachate mound can be expected to develop over time when the
   leachate collection system is comprised of finger drains; however the
   rate of increase and the magnitude at a given time will depend on a
   number of factors including the grainsize, thickness and spacing of the
   finger drains, and the thickness of waste as well as the leachate
   generation rate. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   photocatalytic reaction largely depends on the photocatalysts and the
   methods of preparation the photocatalysts. The doping of Fe, Mn, and
   humic acid at 1.0 M\% via sol-gel methods were detrimental for phenol
   degradation. The inhibitory effect of initial phenol concentration on
   initial phenol degradation rate reveals that photocatalytic
   decomposition of phenol follows pseudo zero order reaction kinetics. A
   concentration of > 1 g/L TiO2 and Cu doped TiO2 is required for the
   effective degradation of 50 mg/L of phenol at neutral pH. The rise in
   OH- at a higher pH values provides more hydroxyl radicals which are
   beneficial of phenol degradation. However, the competition among
   phenoxide ion. Cl- and OH- for the limited number of reactive sites on
   TiO2 will be a negative influence in the generation of hydroxyl radical.
   The dependence of phenol degradation rate on the light intensity was
   observed, which also implies that direct sunlight can be a substitute
   for the UV lamps and that photocatalytic treatment of organic pollutants
   using this technique shows some promise. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Background. Thigh musculature strength assessment in individuals with
   knee osteoarthritis is routinely performed in rehabilitative settings. A
   factor that may influence results is pain experienced during testing.
   Aim. To assess whether pain experienced during isokinetic testing in
   individuals with knee osteoarthritis is dependent on the angular
   velocity prescribed.
   Design. Experimental, repeated measures.
   Setting. University laboratory.
   Population. Thirty-five individuals (19 women, 16 men) with tibiofemoral
   osteoarthritis.
   Methods. Participants performed three randomized sets of five maximal
   concentric extension-flexion repetitions at 60 degrees/s, 90 degrees/s
   and 120 degrees/s. Pain intensity was measured immediately after the
   completion of each set. Strength outcomes for each set were the average
   peak moment.
   Results. Across gender, pain level was not significantly affected by
   testing velocity (P=0.18, eta(2)(p) =0.05). There was a trend of women
   reporting more pain than men across all testing velocities, however this
   comparison did not reach statistical significance (P=0.18,
   eta(2)(p)=0.05).There was a significant main effect of testing velocity
   on strength, with the highest level attained at 60 degrees/s. However,
   no difference in strength was noted when testing was performed at 90
   degrees/s or 120 degrees/s.
   Conclusion. A large variation in pain scores within and across
   conditions and gender was noted, suggesting that at the current stage:
   1) isokinetic angular velocity prescription be performed on an
   individual patient basis; and 2) improvements in the manner pain is
   recorded are needed in order to reduce the variations in pain scores.
   Clinical rehabilitation impact. Individual prescription of angular
   velocity may be necessary for optimal strength output and reduction of
   pain during effort exertion in this patient population.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents studies on the properties of fresh and hardened
   semilightweight self-consolidating concrete (SLWSCC) mixtures, produced
   with two types of manufactured coarse lightweight aggregates (LWA) and
   normal weight sand. The first type, a sintered pulverized fuel ash, was
   made from an industrial by-product, fly ash, whereas the second one, an
   expanded clay, was produced from a naturally sourced clay. For all
   mixtures, normal weight sand was used as a fine fraction of aggregates,
   and the portland cement was partially replaced with a limestone powder.
   The SLWSCC was produced with different water presaturation regimes of
   the LWAs. The desired initial slump-flow spread was set between 700 and
   800 mm. The effect of three superplasticizers was evaluated by testing
   properties of SLWSCC, normal weight SCC, and paste mixtures. Three SCC
   fresh properties were measured: the slump-flow, the V-funnel flow time,
   and the J-ring blocking step. Moreover, the slump-flow loss was
   evaluated. The degree of segregation was assessed in both fresh and
   hardened states. Additionally, the hardened density and the compressive
   strengths were tested. All SLWSCC mixtures were produced with a desired
   range of slump-flow spread and with satisfactory passing ability
   assessed with the J-ring test. SLWSCCs prepared with the expanded clay
   LWA were less sensitive to the variation of water presaturation levels
   and showed lower viscosity than those made with the sintered pulverized
   fuel ash LWA. Only mixtures containing SP-3 superplasticizer showed
   acceptable workability loss resistance. The saturated surface-dry
   density of all of the mixtures varied in a range of 2,025-2,125 kg/m(3).
   Mixtures containing 29\% of coarse LWAs and 71\% of sand (by mass) had
   24-h and 28-day compressive strengths above 20 and 40 MPa, respectively,
   but the mixtures made with the expanded clay were slightly weaker. DOI:

Abstract = {{Background: Analyses of the biomechanical characteristics of gait of
   women with mild and moderate knee osteoarthritis may identify parameters
   that could be targeted by physical therapy interventions. Therefore, the
   purpose of the present study was to compare the joint power profiles
   during gait between a group of elderly women with mild and moderate
   levels of knee osteoarthritis and a group of age-matched asymptomatic
   women.
   Methods: Thirty-nine women diagnosed with osteoarthritis at the medial
   compartment of the knee and 39 healthy women with no diagnosis of knee
   osteoarthritis participated in the study. Joint power profiles of the
   hip, knee and ankle joints in the sagittal plane during gait were
   performed using video and force data obtained using Qualisys ProReflex
   System synchronized with two force plates. Principal component analysis
   was applied to extract features from the joint power waveforms
   characterizing their main modes of temporal variation. The extracted
   features were compared between groups.
   Findings: Women with knee osteoarthritis absorbed and generated less
   energy at the hip and ankle joints, and absorbed less energy at the knee
   when compared to the asymptomatic group.
   Interpretation: The observed power pattern in women with knee
   osteoarthritis may be related to their reduced gait speed, a suboptimal
   strategy possibly used to reduce reaction forces at the knee. Clinical
   studies should investigate whether interventions designed to improve
   muscular resources, as a means to control the flow of forces at the
   knee, would optimize power patterns and gait performance in women with
   knee osteoarthritis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{8, SI}},
Pages = {{1527-1538}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits typically contain
   significant proportions of magma-derived chalcophile (Cu affinity) and
   siderophile (Fe affinity) elements such as Au, Cu, V, Zn, Mo, Bi, Sb,
   and As that relate to the composition of associated (host) magmatic
   rocks. Here, we combine new and published trace element data for lavas
   recovered from 15 volcanic centers along the Kermadec arc. The data show
   that malic back-arc and arc-front lavas are enriched in most of the
   chalcophile and siderophile elements when compared with mid-ocean ridge
   basalts (MORB). Elevated (Cu, Zn, V, Mo, Pb)/Yb, Ba/La, As/Ce, and Sb/Pr
   ratios indicate that the chalcophile and siderophile elements are either
   transported into the mantle wedge via hydrous fluids derived from the
   subducting slab, or are liberated from residual wedge sulfides that are
   oxidized by hydrous fluids. Lower ratios of (Cu, Zn, Mo, Sb, and
   Pb)/(MREE, HREE) in basalts from the Kermadec back arc (Havre Trough)
   when compared to the arc front suggests decreasing slab-related input
   into the mantle source away from the arc front. Unusually high contents
   of LILE, Ag, Sn, Mo, Th, LREE, MREE, Nb, Zr, Hf, and positive trends in
   (Ag, Sn)/Yb with Th/Yb, Hf/Y, (La/Sm)(N), but low Sr/Y, in dacites from
   the Brothers volcanic center, southern Kermadec arc, indicate the
   additional transport of Ag and Sn via a solute-rich super-critical
   fluid, or via a sediment-derived melt. Magmas generated through partial
   melting of a sub-arc mantle metasomatized by hydrous melts thus appear
   to play an important role in the formation of Cu-Au-Ag-rich arc-type VMS
   deposits.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and then designing efficient catalysts for CO oxidation at
   low temperature is one of the hottest topics in heterogeneous catalysis.
   Among the existing catalysts. Co3O4 is one of the most interesting
   systems: Morphology-controlled Co3O4 exhibits exceedingly high activity.
   In this study, by virtue of extensive density functional theory (OFT)
   calculations, the favored reaction mechanism in the system is
   identified. Through careful analyses on the energetics of elementary
   reactions on Co3O4(1 1 0)-A, Co3O4(1 1 0)-B, Co3O4(1 1 1) and Co3O4(1 0
   0), which are the commonly exposed surfaces of Co3O4, we find the
   following regarding the relation between the activity and structure: (i)
   Co3+ is the active site rather than Co2+: and (ii) the three-coordinated
   surface oxygen bonded with three Co3+ may be slightly more reactive than
   the other two kinds of lattice oxygen, that is, the two-coordinated 0
   bonded with one Co2+ and one Co3+ and the three-coordinated 0 bonded
   with one Co2+ and two Co3+. Following the results from Co3O4, we also
   extend the investigation to MnO2(1 1 0), Fe3O4(1 1 0), CuO(1 1 0) and
   CuO(1 1 1), which are the common metal oxide surfaces, aiming to
   understand the oxides in general. Three properties, such as the CO
   adsorption strength, the barrier of CO reacting with lattice 0 and the
   redox capacity, are identified to be the determining factors that can
   significantly affect the activity of oxides. Among these oxides, Co3O4
   is found to be the most active one, stratifying all the three
   requirements. A new scheme to decompose barriers is introduced to
   understand the activity difference between lattice O-3c and O-2c on (1 1
   0)-B surface. By utilizing the scheme, we demonstrate that the origin of
   activity variance lies in the geometric structures. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In recent years unmanned vehicles have grown in popularity, with an ever
   increasing number of applications in industry, the military and research
   within air, ground and marine domains. In particular, the challenges
   posed by unmanned marine vehicles in order to increase the level of
   autonomy include automatic obstacle avoidance and conformance with the
   Rules of the Road when navigating in the presence of other maritime
   traffic. The USV Master Plan which has been established for the US Navy
   outlines a list of objectives for improving autonomy in order to
   increase mission diversity and reduce the amount of supervisory
   intervention. This paper addresses the specific development needs based
   on notable research carried out to date, primarily with regard to
   navigation, guidance, control and motion planning. The integration of
   the International Regulations for Avoiding Collisions at Sea within the
   obstacle avoidance protocols seeks to prevent maritime accidents
   attributed to human error. The addition of these critical safety
   measures may be key to a future growth in demand for USVs, as they serve
   to pave the way for establishing legal policies for unmanned vessels.

Abstract = {{Groundwater flow in hard-rock aquifers is strongly controlled by the
   characteristics and distribution of structural heterogeneity. A
   methodology for catchment-scale characterisation is presented, based on
   the integration of complementary, multi-scale hydrogeological,
   geophysical and geological approaches. This was applied to three
   contrasting catchments underlain by metamorphic rocks in the northern
   parts of Ireland (Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, UK).
   Cross-validated surface and borehole geophysical investigations confirm
   the discontinuous overburden, lithological compartmentalisation of the
   bedrock and important spatial variations of the weathered bedrock
   profiles at macro-scale. Fracture analysis suggests that the recent
   (Alpine) tectonic fabric exerts strong control on the internal aquifer
   structure at meso-scale, which is likely to impact on the anisotropy of
   aquifer properties. The combination of the interpretation of
   depth-specific hydraulic-test data with the structural information
   provided by geophysical tests allows characterisation of the
   hydrodynamic properties of the identified aquifer units. Regionally, the
   distribution of hydraulic conductivities can be described by inverse
   power laws specific to the aquifer litho-type. Observed groundwater flow
   directions reflect this multi-scale structure. The proposed integrated
   approach applies widely available investigative tools to identify key
   dominant structures controlling groundwater flow, characterising the
   aquifer type for each catchment and resolving the spatial distribution
   of relevant aquifer units and associated hydrodynamic parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Image-guided needle placement, including ultrasound (US)-guided
   techniques, have become commonplace in modern medical diagnosis and
   therapy. To ensure that the next generations of physicians are competent
   using this technology, efficient and effective educational programs need

   open-source training platform for US-guided needle insertions. The Perk
   Tutor was successfully tested in three different configurations to
   demonstrate its adaptability to different procedures and learning
   objectives. 1) The Targeting Tutor, designed to develop US-guided needle
   targeting skills, 2) the Lumbar Tutor, designed for practicing US-guided
   lumbar spinal procedures, and (3) the Prostate Biopsy Tutor, configured
   for US-guided prostate biopsies. The Perk Tutor provides the trainee
   with quantitative feedback on progress toward the specific learning
   objectives of each configuration. Configurations were implemented
   through simple rearrangement of hardware and software components,
   attesting to the modularity and ease of configuration. The Perk Tutor is
   provided as a free resource to enable research and development of

Abstract = {{This paper investigates dc voltage control strategies for output power
   smoothing of a fully rated converter-based wind turbine with energy
   storage device connected to the common dc link via a bidirectional dc/dc

   coordinated dc voltage control schemes are used for the ac network side
   converter and energy storage system to ensure that generated
   high-frequency power fluctuation is absorbed by the energy storage
   system, whereas the low-frequency components are transmitted to the
   connected ac network. Two methods have been proposed: one is based on
   proportional-integral (PI) voltage controller and low-pass filter with
   large time constant, and the other is based on PI with low natural
   frequency and droop controller with large droop gain. The detailed
   controller designs are described and system stability is assessed and
   shown to be stable. Both the MATLAB/Simulink simulations and
   experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed methods for power smoothing.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy-neural-network-based inference systems are well-known universal
   approximators which can produce linguistically interpretable results.
   Unfortunately, their dimensionality can be extremely high due to an
   excessive number of inputs and rules, which raises the need for overall
   structure optimization. In the literature, various input selection
   methods are available, but they are applied separately from rule
   selection, often without considering the fuzzy structure. This paper
   proposes an integrated framework to optimize the number of inputs and
   the number of rules simultaneously. First, a method is developed to
   select the most significant rules, along with a refinement stage to
   remove unnecessary correlations. An improved information criterion is
   then proposed to find an appropriate number of inputs and rules to
   include in the model, leading to a balanced tradeoff between
   interpretability and accuracy. Simulation results confirm the efficacy
   of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{A design methodology to significantly enhance peak values of two key
   analogue/RF performance metrics-gm(2)/I-ds and g(m)f(T)/I-ds-without
   degrading linearity metric (VIP3) in moderately inverted MOSFETs is
   demonstrated. An impressive improvement of 22\% in gm(2)/I-ds and more
   than twice in g(m)f(T)/I-ds can be achieved by adopting optimal underlap
   source/drain (S/D) architecture instead of a conventional abrupt S/D
   design. Apart from the well-known reduction in the voltage gain
   (g(m)/g(ds)), it is demonstrated that linearity degradation is expected
   to be a major bottleneck for scaling low-power and energy efficient
   devices into the nanometre regime. The optimal range of S/D profile
   parameters is identified by evaluating process and performance
   trade-offs associated with the underlap doping profile. A parameter
   sensitivity analysis shows that an optimally designed underlap S/D
   MOSFET exhibits greater tolerance to the variation of parameters as
   compared to conventional abrupt S/D devices. The results are significant

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles were designed to promote insulin intestinal absorption via
   the oral route, to increase portal insulin levels to better mimic the
   physiological pathway, providing enhanced glucose control through
   glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Nanoparticles were formulated with
   insulin encapsulated in the core material consisting of alginate and
   dextran sulfate, associated with poloxamer and subsequently coated with
   chitosan then albumin. A spherical and slightly rough core was observed
   in electron micrographs with the appearance of a concentration gradient
   of the polysaccharide structure toward the periphery of the
   nanoparticle. Atomic force microscopy showed that the fully formed
   nanoparticles are about 200 nm in diameter with smooth and spherical
   morphology. Histopathological analysis of organs and tissues of diabetic
   rats dosed daily for 15 days with insulin nanoparticles was used to
   evaluate toxicological issues. No morphological or pathological
   alterations were observed in rat liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney or
   intestinal sections. Following, the effect of nanoencapsulated insulin
   on inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis was evaluated after a single
   insulin administration and oral glucose tolerance test, which represents
   a significant metabolic challenge to the liver. Alterations in the
   hepatic glucose metabolism of fasted streptozotocin-diabetic rats were
   determined by the percent contribution of glycogenolysis and
   gluconeogenesis, measured by using metabolic tracers, however similar
   gluconeogenesis contribution to the hepatic metabolism was observed
   between diabetic rats receiving nanoencapsulated insulin or insulin
   solution. The metabolic results may be explained by the inability of a
   single dose in shifting the gluconeogenesis/glycogenolysis
   contributions, sampling time, fasting period or by influence of the
   kidney enzymes and impairment in insulin signaling observed in
   stz-diabetic rats.}},

Abstract = {{Networks of discrete, genipin-crosslinked gelatin microfibers enveloping
   pancreatic islets were incorporated within barium alginate
   microcapsules. This novel technique enabled encapsulation of cellular
   aggregates in a spherical fibrous matrix <300 mu m in diameter.
   Microfibers were produced by vortex-drawn extrusion within an alginate
   support matrix. Optimization culminated in a hydrated fiber diameter of
   22.3 +/- 0.4 mu m, a significant reduction relative to that available
   through current gelatin microfiber spinning techniques, while making the
   process more reliable and less labor intensive. Microfibers were
   encapsulated at 40 vol \% within 294 +/- 4 mu m 1.6\% barium alginate
   microparticles by electrostatic-mediated dropwise extrusion. Pancreatic
   islets extracted from Sprague Dawley rats were encapsulated within the
   microparticles and analyzed over 21 days. Acridine orange and propidium
   iodide fluorescent viability staining and light microscopy indicated a
   significant increase in viability for islets within the fiber-embedded
   particles relative to fiber-free controls at days 7, 14, and 21. The
   fiber-embedded system also promoted cellular aggregate cohesion,
   reducing the incidence of dispersed islet morphologies within the
   capsules from 31 to 8\% at day 21. Further enquiry into benefits of
   islet encapsulation within a protein fiber network will be the subject
   of future investigation. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater

Abstract = {{Germanium is an attractive channel material for MOSFETs because of its
   higher mobility than silicon. In this paper, GeO2 has been investigated
   as an interfacial layer for high-kappa gate stacks on germanium.
   Thermally grown GeO2 layers have been prepared at 550 degrees C to
   minimise GeO volatilisation. GeO2 growth has been performed in both pure
   O-2 ambient and O-2 diluted with N-2. GeO2 thickness has been scaled
   down to approximately 3 nm. MOS capacitors have been fabricated using
   different GeO2 thicknesses with a standard high-kappa dielectric on top.
   Electrical properties and thermal stability have been tested up to at
   least 350 degrees C. The K value of GeO2 was experimentally determined
   to be 4.5. Interface state densities (D-it) of less than 10(12) CM-2
   eV(-1) have been extracted for all devices using the conductance method.

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Chlorination of wheat flour in the EU countries has been replaced in
   recent years, to some extent, by heat treated flour which is used to
   produce high ratio cakes. Heat treated flour allows high ratio recipes
   to be developed which generate products with longer shelf life, finer
   texture, moist crumb and sweeter taste. The mechanism by which heat
   treatment improves the flour is not fully understood, but it is known
   that during the heat treatment process, protein denaturation and partial
   gelatinisation of the starch granules occurs, as well as an increase in
   batter viscosity. Therefore, it is important to optimize the flour heat
   treatment process, in order to enhance baking quality. Laboratory
   preparation of heat treated base wheat flour (culinary, soft, low
   protein) was carried out in a fluidised bed drier using a range of
   temperatures and times. The gluten was extracted from the final product
   and its quality was tested, to obtain objective and comparative
   information on the extent of protein denaturation. The results indicated
   that heat treatment of flour decreases gluten extensibility and partial
   gelatinisation of the starch granules occurred. After heat treatment the
   gluten appeared to retain moisture. The optimum time/temperature for the
   heat treatment of base flour was 120-130 degrees C for 30 min with
   moisture content of approximate to 12.5\%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The main features are described of the ISO published standard:
   10678:2010, namely the `Determination of photocatalytic activity of
   surfaces in an aqueous medium by degradation of methylene blue'. The
   main underlying assumptions of the standard are considered, namely: (i)
   dye purity, (ii) adsorption and pH, (iii) light source, (iv) stirring
   and diffusion, (v) reaction mechanism and (vi) kinetics. Possible
   sources of errors arising form these assumptions are identified and
   changes to the standard's protocol suggested. The major suggested
   changes are: (i) a source of MB+ of known and proven on site high purity
   (>90\%) should be used to make up the standard test solution, which
   should have a referenced absorbance, 0.74, at 665 nm; (ii) the
   conditioning solution should be the same concentration as the standard
   test solution, (iii) the initial pH of the reaction solution should lie
   in the range: 5.5-6.0; (iv) a BLB UVA light with a europium-doped
   strontium fluoroborate or borate phosphor should be used; (v) the
   reaction solution should be vigorously and continuously stirred if
   possible: (vi) the solution height should be the minimum recommended
   value of 2 cm, and the photoreactor cylinder id., 4.7 cm; (vii) after
   the 3 h irradiation the reaction solution should be left stirring
   overnight to check that no dye photoreductive bleaching has occurred.
   Application of most of these suggestions should improve considerably the
   standard's reported current poor percentage errors for repeatability
   within a lab (9.2\%) and reproducibility between labs (30.6\%). (C) 2012

Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{A forensic modeling study examines the potential causes of gas and water
   venting observed during the excavation of a landfill in a 40 m thick
   clayey till deposit in southwestern Ontario, Canada. The clayey till is
   known to be underlain by permeable, natural gas bearing, rock and gas
   has been diffusing through the clayey deposit over about the last
   13,000-15,000 years. Attention is focused on 2D modeling of
   hydrofracturing as well as gassy soil behavior. The model examines the
   predicted location of venting with and without the presence of gassy
   sand lenses and a discontinuous layer of basal till between the bedrock
   and the low permeability till. The modeling shows that hydrofracturing
   alone can explain the occurrence and location of the observed venting in
   one of the sub-cells. In the other sub-cell, hydrofracturing explains
   the occurrence but not the location of the observed venting or the
   presence of the sand in the venting water at this location. Modeling of
   appropriately placed gassy sand lenses is shown to explain the
   occurrence and location of the observed venting as well as the presence
   of both waters with different geochemistry from the bedrock and the till
   in the venting waters. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were functionalized with a
   hyperbranched polyethylene (HBPE) using a non-covalent, non-specific
   functionalization approach. The adsorption behavior of HBPE on MWCNTs
   was characterized by means of an adsorption isotherm. HBPE adsorption
   reached a plateau value of 0.3:1.0 (w/w) HBPE:MWCNT, corresponding to a
   surface coverage of approximately 30\%. The functionalized MWCNTs were
   better dispersed in tetrahydrofuran (THF), forming smaller aggregates
   compared to their unmodified counterparts. Pristine and
   HBPE-functionalized MWCNTs were melt compounded with a low-viscosity
   ethylene-octene copolymer (EOC) matrix. Electrical and rheological
   percolation thresholds were observed at nanotube loadings of less than 1
   wt\%. Functionalization did not affect significantly the electrical
   conductivity and rheological properties. The improved dispersion of the
   functionalized MWCNTs within the EOC matrix resulted in improved
   ductility over the non-functionalized counterpart. This study
   demonstrates that this method of functionalization results in partial

Abstract = {{The applicability of a sequencing batch two phase partitioning
   bioreactor (TPPB) to the biodegradation of a highly toxic compound,
   2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) (EC50 = 2.3-40 mg L-1) was investigated. A
   kinetic study of the individual process steps (DCP absorption into the
   polymer, desorption and biodegradation) was performed and, based on
   favourable absorption/desorption characteristics (DCP diffusivity of 6.6
   x 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1)), the commercial polymer Tone P787 (Dow Chemical),
   was utilized as the sequestering phase for TPPB operation. Batch kinetic
   biodegradation tests were performed in both single-and two-phase modes,
   and the Haldane equation kinetic parameters were estimated (k = 1.3 x
   10(-2) mgDCP mgVSS(-1) h(-1), K-I = 35 mgDCP L-1 and K-s = 18 mgDCP
   L-1), confirming the highly toxic nature of DCP. Consistent with these
   findings, operation of the single-phase system showed that for an
   initial DCP concentration of 130 mg L-1 the biomass was completely
   inhibited and DCP was not degraded, while the two-phase system achieved
   near-complete DCP removal. In sequencing batch mode the TPPB had a
   removal efficiency of 91\% within 500 min for a feed of 320 mg L-1,
   which exceeds the highest concentration previously degraded. These
   results have confirmed the effectiveness of the use of small amounts
   (5\%, v/v) of inexpensive commercial polymers as the partitioning phase
   in TPPB reactors for the treatment of a highly toxic substrate at
   influent loads that are prohibitive for conventional single-phase
   operation, and suggest that similar detoxification of wastewater
   influents is achievable for other target cytotoxic substrates.}},

Abstract = {{The productivity of microwave-assisted continuous specialty chemical
   synthesis has been brought to a commercially interesting scale of 1
   kg/day. To that end, a counter-current multitubular millireactor/heat
   exchanger (MTMR) assembly has been developed with the reactant flow
   through millitubular reactors, while the coolant flows in the shell
   side. The efficiency of microwave absorption under continuous operation
   in a single mode microwave cavity has been improved with the deposition
   of a thin (350 +/- 40 nm) Cu film on the inner walls of the reactor
   tubes. This design ultimately resulted in an enhanced product
   (1,3-diphenyl-2-propynyl piperidine) yield of a multicomponent reaction
   (of piperidine, benzaldehyde, and phenylacetylene). The Cu film also
   improved the uniformity of microwave energy absorption in the reactor
   tubes along the radial direction. A near-isothermal operation was
   achieved by cooling with a counter-current flow of a microwave
   transparent coolant in the outer shell of the MTMR A production rate of
   333 +/- 11 kg(prod)/(kg(cat).h) was achieved in a single microwave
   cavity at 373 +/- 5 K and at a total reactant flow rate of 1.66 x 10(-9)
   m(3)/s. The average production rate of 1,3-diphenyl-2-propynyl
   piperidine in the MTMR assembly (six parallel tubes in a shell and tube
   reactor/heat exchanger) was 93\% of the production rate in a single tube
   due to a slightly uneven flow and temperature distribution. Kinetically
   determined mean Cu film temperature was 477 +/- 10 K. Although the
   reactor tubes were placed at an equal distance from axial symmetry (six
   parallel tubes in a hexagonal arrangement), a maximum temperature
   deviation of 8.0 +/- 0.5 K was observed over the reactor tubes. The
   parallelization approach was demonstrated to be successful for scale up
   of continuously operated microwave reactors.}},

Abstract = {{We present a theoretical investigation of the influence of domain

   simulations and an analytical model. It is shown that different boundary
   types modify the atomic and electronic structure of the adjoining 5 x 5

   describes the energy interaction J between the boundaries and the 5 x 5
   phase, is presented and the interaction energy decay J(x) approximate to
   x(-n) for different domain boundaries is estimated. Additionally, the
   influence of the boundaries on the atomic and electronic structure of
   adatoms in the parental 5 x 5 phase is analyzed and it is argued that
   the presence of domain boundaries may strongly affect not only the
   physical but also the chemical properties of the Ge/Si(111)-5 x 5 phase.}},

Title = {{The dynamics of internal wave resonance in periodically forced narrow
   basins}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the steady state
   internal wave response of a periodically forced, density-stratified,
   basin characterized by both horizontal and vertical length scales and a
   known seiche period. The system was two-layer stratified and was
   subjected to periodic forcing over a wide frequency range. The forcing
   amplitude and ratio of the forcing frequency (sigma(f)) to horizontal
   mode one (H1) internal seiche frequency (sigma(1)) governed the system
   response. For sigma(f) > sigma(1), higher-mode internal seiches were
   observed; for sigma(f) < sigma(1), a nonresonant forced H1 internal
   seiche was observed; and for sigma(f) -> sigma(1), a resonant H1
   internal seiche was observed. For this resonant regime, progressive
   nonlinear internal waves (NLIWs) formed upon the H1 seiche. When the
   NLIWs amplitudes were large, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities grew within
   the wave troughs, leading to significant diapycnal mixing within the
   basin interior. Resonant amplification was most pronounced for small
   forcing amplitudes because weakly forced waves have the most potential
   for growth prior to energy flux to NLIWs and ultimate turbulent
   dissipation and mixing. This observation suggests that each mode has a
   maximum energy density that, when exceeded, leads to a nonlinear energy
   cascade. The resonant wave response was modeled as a driven underdamped
   harmonic oscillator, where the damping coefficient was interpreted as
   the sum of the effects of mixing and dissipation.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to measure acetabular cup orientation accurately during
   total hip arthroplasty represents a significant challenge. The aim of
   this research was to develop and evaluate a novel low cost mechanical
   device for measuring operative acetabular inclination. Cup implantation
   was simulated in two trials using the novel device: firstly involving
   surgeons and engineers orientating acetabular cups with sawbone pelves
   at a range of inclination angles (20 degrees-55 degrees in 5 degrees
   increments); secondly in a simulated intra-operative scenario with
   surgeons. Target angles were compared with achieved angles and
   deviations from desired angles were recorded. In addition, all
   participants orientated cups under the same conditions using two other
   techniques: freehand and with a propriatory Mechanical Alignment Guide.
   In the first trial, the mean errors (deviations) using freehand
   technique, the mechanical alignment guide and the new device were 5.2
   degrees+/-4.3 degrees (range 0.1-22.0), 3.6 degrees+/-3.9 degrees (range
   0.1 degrees-33.6 degrees) and 0.5 degrees+/-0.4 degrees (range 0.0-1.9)
   respectively. In the second trial, the mean error for freehand
   technique, mechanical alignment guide and the new device were 6.2
   degrees+/-4.2 degrees (range 0.2-18.2), 3.8 degrees+/-3.3 degrees (range
   0.0-19.1) and 0.6 degrees+/-0.5 degrees(range 0.0-1.8) respectively. The
   new device has the potential to allow the surgeon to choose and record
   operative inclination accurately during total hip arthroplasty in the
   lateral decubitus position.}},

Abstract = {{Constantly increasing hardware parallelism poses more and more
   challenges to programmers and language designers. One approach to
   harness the massive parallelism is to move to task-based programming
   models that rely on runtime systems for dependency analysis and
   scheduling. Such models generally benefit from the existence of a global
   address space. This paper presents the parallel memory allocator of the
   Myrmics runtime system, in which multiple allocator instances organized
   in a tree hierarchy cooperate to implement a global address space with
   dynamic region support on distributed memory machines. The Myrmics
   hierarchical memory allocator is step towards improved productivity and
   performance in parallel programming. Productivity is improved through
   the use of dynamic regions in a global address space, which provide a
   convenient shared memory abstraction for dynamic and irregular data
   structures. Performance is improved through scaling on many-core systems
   without system-wide cache coherency. We evaluate the stand-alone
   allocator on an MPI-based x86 cluster and find that it scales well for
   up to 512 worker cores, while it can outperform Unified Parallel C by a
   factor of 3.7-10.7x.}},

Abstract = {{Foil and vibrating wire strain gauges have an optimum strain measurement
   accuracy of one microstrain. However, they can only provide discrete
   strain readings over a single fixed-gauge length. Digital image
   correlation (DIC) offers an alternative to conventional strain gauges
   because a two-dimensional (2D) surface strain field can be obtained from
   a single sensor (camera). However, the benefits of 2D strain
   measurements are only worthwhile if a similar level of measurement
   accuracy to conventional strain gauges can be achieved. This paper
   presents the results of an investigation into the optimum strain
   measurement accuracy that can be achieved by using the 2D technique on
   artificial images (which eliminate errors associated with cameras and
   lighting). The principle of the 2D DIC technique and its historical
   development will be introduced. Then, three potential techniques for
   taking strain measurements will be presented and compared: single
   readings, averaged linear readings, and an approach on the basis of
   Mohr's circle. The Mohr's circle approach was found to be the most
   accurate and was not susceptible to image misalignment. Strain
   measurement accuracy was also found to be affected by the bias error of
   the subpixel interpolation scheme, but the use of an 8 coefficient
   B-spline was found to produce satisfactory results within the error of
   conventional strain gauges. Gauge length was also found to have a
   significant effect on strain measurement accuracy, indicating that
   measuring strains in a material in which there are variations across the
   strain field could result in a loss of measurement accuracy. However,
   overall it was found that 2D DIC offers the same strain measurement
   accuracy as conventional strain gauges when used under ideal conditions.

Abstract = {{Our recent study reported that conformation change of granule-associated
   Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) may influence the role of the protein
   controlling colloid deposition in porous media (Flynn et al., 2012). The
   present study conceptualized the observed phenomena with an ellipsoid
   morphology model, describing BSA as an ellipsoid taking a side-on or
   end-on conformation on granular surface, and identified the following
   processes: (1) at low adsorbed concentrations, BSA exhibited a side-on
   conformation blocking colloid deposition; (2) at high adsorbed
   concentrations, BSA adapted to an end-on conformation promoted colloid
   deposition; and (3) colloid deposition on the BSA layer may
   progressively generate end-on molecules (sites) by conformation change
   of side-on BSA, resulting in sustained increasing deposition rates.
   Generally, the protein layer lowered colloid attenuation by the porous
   medium, suggesting the overall effect of BSA was inhibitory at the
   experimental time scale. A mathematical model was developed to interpret
   the ripening curves. Modeling analysis identified the site generation
   efficiency of colloid as a control on the ripening rate (declining rate
   in colloid concentrations), and this efficiency was higher for BSA
   adsorbed from a more dilute BSA solution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The central basin of Lake Erie has chronic hypoxia that is exacerbated

   computational study was conducted to determine the feasibility of

   The most efficient design delivered an air flow rate of 0.4-0.5 m(3)
   s(-1) through 40-50 non-interacting plumes, which only mix the
   watercolumn during the late summer hypoxic events. The optimal
   efficiency was computed using a new metric, which neglects changes in
   stratification resulting from meteorologically induced mixing, relative
   to those from artificial mixing. DOI:

Title = {{Effects of passive control rings positioned in the shear layer and
   potential core of a turbulent round jet}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Experimental measurements were carried out to study the effect of flow
   modification near the jet exit on a turbulent round free jet. To achieve
   this, two different fine rings, with square cross-sections, were
   designed and placed very close to the jet exit (x/D = 0.03). The first
   ring was placed in the middle of the shear layer while the second ring
   covered a small region of the potential core. Flying and stationary hot
   wire measurements were carried out to study the near- and
   intermediate-field development of the jet. Three Reynolds numbers (based
   on the jet exit mean velocity and the nozzle diameter) were used: 10
   000, 30 000, and 50 000. The results show a considerable reduction in
   the jet spread rate and turbulence intensity when the passive rings are
   employed. This is more obvious for the ring placed in the shear layer.
   The radial profiles of the mean and rms axial velocity and third and
   fourth moments of fluctuations at several axial positions are
   considered. The power density spectra reveal the suppression of the
   initial shear layer instability (shear layer mode), while the jet
   preferred instability (preferred mode) remains active as the shear layer
   is modified. In the case when potential core modifications are used, the
   suppression of the initial shear layer instability is still considerable
   although there is an evidence of another vortical structure behind the
   ring, which, it is speculated, is due to the vortex shedding behind the
   ring. In this case, too, the jet preferred instability remains active.
   Therefore, the current paper confirms the separation of these two modes.
   In addition, the current contribution provides a comprehensive study of
   the characteristics of different length scales in the development region
   of the jet (e.g., integral scale, Taylor microscale, and Kolmogorov
   scale) for both the modified and unmodified jets. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Biological processes are considered to be the most cost-effective
   technology for the off-gas treatment of volatile organic compounds (VOC)

   emerged in the early 1990s as innovative multiphase systems capable of
   overcoming some of the key limitations of traditional biological
   technologies such as the low mass transfer rates of hydrophobic VOCs and
   microbial inhibition at high VOC loading rates. Intensive research
   carried out in the last 5 years has helped to provide a better
   understanding of the mass transfer phenomena and VOC uptake mechanisms
   in TPPBs, which has significantly improved the VOC biodegradation
   processes utilizing this technology platform. This work presents an
   updated state-of-the-art review on the advances of TPPB technology for
   air pollution control. The most recent insights regarding non-aqueous
   phase (NAP) selection, microbiology, reactor design, mathematical
   modeling and case studies are critically reviewed and discussed.
   Finally, the key research issues required to move towards the
   development of efficient and stable full-scale VOC biodegradation

Abstract = {{Deformation mechanisms under tensile loading at room temperature have
   been studied in a polycrystalline nickel-based superalloy containing
   close to 50 vol.\% gamma'. In order to identify the effect of gamma'
   particle size on deformation mechanisms, model microstructures with
   unimodal gamma' size distributions were developed. The investigations
   were carried out by combining in situ loading experiments using neutron
   diffraction and two-site elasto-plastic self-consistent plasticity
   modelling with detailed post-mortem electron microscopy. The microscopy
   work also includes results for samples strained at 500 degrees C. During
   early plastic deformation, the diffraction data demonstrate that gamma
   and gamma' display the same elastic strain response, indicating that at
   this stage gamma' is cut by dislocations regardless of the gamma'
   particle size. Scanning electron microscopy studies showed an abundance
   of shearing processes in all three microstructures, hence supporting the
   conclusions drawn from the diffraction experiment. As the material is
   further deformed, elastic load transfer from gamma to gamma' was
   observed in the medium (130 nm) and coarse (230 nm) gamma'
   microstructures but not in the fine (90 nm) gamma' microstructure. The
   load transfer can be explained by assuming that Orowan looping becomes
   an additional operative deformation mode. Transmission electron
   microscopy confirmed that in the fine gamma' microstructure deformation
   takes place by strongly coupled dislocations cutting the gamma', while
   the medium and coarse gamma' microstructures showed additional signs of
   Orowan looping. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   sidelobe canceller (SGSC) formulation for the commonly used
   minimum-variance receiver, and derive a general framework to improve the
   robustness of a linear receiver when oscillator offsets exist. Then a
   new linear receiver is proposed in closed-form based on the proposed
   robust SGSC and a ridge regression technique. It is shown by simulations
   that the proposed linear receiver can provide very robust SINR
   performance and excellent symbol error rate (SER) performance in the
   existence of interference and unknown oscillator offsets.}},

Abstract = {{The Collahuasi district is a porphyry Cu-Mo subprovince located on the
   Andean high plateau of northern Chile. Late Eocene-early Oligocene
   mineralization in the district involved hydrothermal alteration of the
   upper Paleozoic to Lower Triassic Collahuasi Croup granodiorites,
   diorites, andesites, dacites, and rhyolites, which had previously
   experienced regional lower greenschist fades metamorphism as well as
   uneconomic porphyry-style mineralization and associated sericitic
   alteration. Alteration mapping represents an effective technique for
   prospecting for hydrothermal deposits, but, in low-grade metamorphic
   terrains, recognition of propylitic assemblages that represent the
   boundary of the mineralizing system is hampered by their resemblance to
   metamorphic mineral assemblages.
   Our results from Collahuasi indicate that petrographic criteria can
   distinguish propylitic alteration from the effects of lower greenschist
   facies metamorphism, but distinctions vary with rock type. Mafic,
   intermediate, and felsic rocks with varying degrees of propylitic
   alteration can be distinguished from background metamorphism mainly by
   the presence of calcite. However, propylitic alteration can also be
   distinguished by high whole-rock delta C-13 values and carbon contents
   (-19.1 to 1.4 parts per thousand and up to 0.79 wt \%, respectively)
   that result from the incorporation of magmatic CO2 during the
   mineralizing events. Lower delta C-13 values (-32.7 to -13.1 parts per
   thousand) and carbon contents (<0.09 wt \%) were recorded in other types
   of hydrothermal alteration (intermediate argillic, sericitic, and
   potassic alteration) and associated with background metamorphism. They
   reflect a dominantly C-13 depleted carbon component that remains in the
   rocks after extensive CO2 degassing during emplacement, alteration by
   hydrothermal fluids, or contamination by organic carbon. Carbon and
   oxygen isotope compositions of calcite from propylitic alteration, which
   range from -12 to +0.3 parts per thousand and 6.6 to 25.9 parts per
   thousand, respectively, are consistent with a predominantly magmatic
   origin for the carbonates, although subsequent resetting of the oxygen
   isotopes by local ground water and minor contributions of organic carbon
   are recorded in some samples. Spatial variation in delta C-13 values and
   carbon contents of outcrop samples from the Collahuasi district
   delineate zones of high magmatic CO2 component that correspond
   exclusively to propylitic alteration surrounding economic deposits.}},

Abstract = {{The PageRank algorithm employed at Google assigns a measure of
   importance to each web page for rankings in search results. In our
   recent papers, we have proposed a distributed randomized approach for
   this algorithm, where web pages are treated as agents computing their
   own PageRank by communicating with linked pages. This paper builds upon
   this approach to reduce the computation and communication loads for the
   algorithms. In particular, we develop a method to systematically
   aggregate the web pages into groups by exploiting the sparsity inherent
   in the web. For each group, an aggregated PageRank value is computed,
   which can then be distributed among the group members. We provide a
   distributed update scheme for the aggregated PageRank along with an
   analysis on its convergence properties. The method is especially
   motivated by results on singular perturbation techniques for large-scale
   Markov chains and multi-agent consensus. A numerical example is provided
   to illustrate the level of reduction in computation while keeping the
   error in rankings small.}},

Abstract = {{In time-varying frequency selective channels, to obtain high-rate joint
   time-frequency diversity, linear dispersion coded orthogonal frequency
   division multiplexing (LDC-OFDM), has recently been proposed. Compared
   with OFDM systems, single-carrier systems may retain the advantages of
   lower PAPR and lower sensitivity to carrier frequency offset (CFO)
   effects, which motivates this paper to investigate how to achieve joint
   frequency and time diversity for high-rate single-carrier block
   transmission systems. Two systems are proposed: linear dispersion coded
   cyclic-prefix single-carrier modulation (LDC-CP-SCM) and linear
   dispersion coded zero-padded single-carrier modulation (LDC-ZP-SCM)
   across either multiple CF-SCM or ZP-SCM blocks, respectively. LDC-SCM
   may use a layered two-stage LDC decoding with lower complexity. This
   paper analyzes the diversity properties of LDC-CP-SCM, and provides a
   sufficient condition for LDC-CP-SCM to maximize all available joint
   frequency and time diversity gain and coding gain. This paper shows that
   LDC-ZP-SCM may be effectively equipped with low-complexity minimum
   mean-squared error (MMSE) equalizers. A lower complexity scheme, linear
   transformation coded SCM (LTC-SCM), is also proposed with good diversity
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{The role of hydrogen in promoting the reduction by ammonia of NOx on
   silver catalysts has been investigated using a Short Time on Stream
   (STOS) technique to allow differentiation between potentially reactive
   intermediates and relatively inactive spectator species. Under these
   conditions, we have used DRIFTS to identify surface nitrate species that
   are formed and removed on a timescale of seconds. This is in contrast to
   nitrate species observed under normal steady-state conditions which can
   continue to form over many tens of minutes. Since this timescale of
   seconds is very similar to the response rate at which the NH3/NOx to N-2
   reaction is accelerated when H-2 is added, or decelerated when H-2 is
   removed, we conclude that this fast-forming and fast disappearing
   nitrate species is most probably adsorbed on or close to the active Ag
   sites. The removal of such a blocking nitrate species from the active
   sites can explain the effect of H-2 in greatly increasing the rate of
   the overall de-NOx reaction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{430}},
Number = {{1-3}},
Pages = {{27-36}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen adsorption into zirconium, as a result of corrosion in aqueous
   environments, leads to the precipitation of a secondary brittle hydride
   phase. These hydrides tend to first form at stress concentrations such
   as fretting flaws or cracks in engineering components, potentially
   degrading the structural integrity of the component. One mechanism for
   component failure is a slow crack growth mechanism known as Delayed
   Hydride Cracking (DHC), where hydride fracture occurs followed by crack
   arrest in the ductile zirconium matrix. The current work employs both an
   experimental and a modeling approach to better characterize the effects
   and behavior of hydride precipitation at such stress concentrations.
   Strains around stress concentrations containing hydrides were mapped
   using High Energy X-ray Diffraction (HEXRD). These studies highlighted
   important differences in the behavior of the hydride phase and the
   surrounding zirconium matrix, as well as the strain associated with the
   precipitation of the hydride. A finite element model was also developed
   and compared to the X-ray strain mapping results. This model provided
   greater insight into details that could not be obtained directly from
   the experimental approaches, as well as providing a framework for future
   modeling to predict the effects of hydride precipitation under varied
   conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mass discharge across transect planes is increasingly used as a metric
   for performance assessment of in situ groundwater remediation systems.
   Mass discharge estimates using concentrations measured in multilevel
   transects are often made by assuming a uniform flow field, and
   uncertainty contributions from spatial concentration and flow field
   variability are often overlooked. We extend our recently developed
   geostatistical approach to estimate mass discharge using transect data
   of concentration and hydraulic conductivity, so accounting for the
   spatial variability of both datasets. The magnitude and uncertainty of
   mass discharge were quantified by conditional simulation. An important
   benefit of the approach is that uncertainty is quantified as an integral
   part of the mass discharge estimate. We use this approach for
   performance assessment of a bioremediation experiment of a
   trichloroethene (TCE) source zone. Analyses of dissolved parent and
   daughter compounds demonstrated that the engineered bioremediation has
   elevated the degradation rate of TCE, resulting in a two-thirds
   reduction in the TCE mass discharge from the source zone. The
   biologically enhanced dissolution of TCE was not significant (similar to
   5\%), and was less than expected. However, the discharges of the
   daughter products cis-1,2, dichloroethene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride (VC)
   increased, probably because of the rapid transformation of TCE from the
   source zone to the measurement transect. This suggests that enhancing
   the biodegradation of cDCE and VC will be crucial to successful
   engineered bioremediation of TCE source zones.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study some relationships between the detection and
   estimation theories for a binary composite hypothesis test H-0 against
   H-1 and a related estimation problem. We start with a one-dimensional
   (1D) space for the unknown parameter space and one-sided hypothesis
   problems and then extend out results into more general cases. For
   one-sided tests, we show that the uniformly most powerful (UMP) test is
   achieved by comparing the minimum variance and unbiased estimator (MVUE)
   of the unknown parameter with a threshold. Thus for the case where the
   UMP test does not exist, the MVUE of the unknown parameter does not
   exist either. Therefore for such cases, a good estimator of the unknown
   parameter is deemed as a good decision statistic for the test. For a
   more general class of composite testing with multiple unknown
   parameters, we prove that the MVUE of a separating function (SF) can
   serve as the optimal decision statistic for the UMP unbiased test where
   the SF is continuous, differentiable, positive for all parameters under
   H-1 and is negative for the parameters under H-0. We then prove that the
   UMP unbiased statistic is equal to the MVUE of an SF. In many problems
   with multiple unknown parameters, the UMP test does not exist. For such
   cases, we show that if one detector between two detectors has a better
   receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve,(1) then using its
   decision statistic we can estimate the SF more epsilon-accurately, in
   probability. For example, the SF is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in
   some problems. These results motivate us to introduce new suboptimal
   SF-estimator tests (SFETs) which are easy to derive for many problems.
   Finally, we provide some practical examples to study the relationship
   between the decision statistic of a test and the estimator of its
   corresponding SF.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to fabricate a fibrous scaffold that closely
   resembled the micro-structural architecture and mechanical properties of
   collagen fibres found in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). To
   achieve this aim, fibrous scaffolds were made by electrospinning
   L-lactide based polymers. L-Lactide was chosen primarily due to its
   demonstrated biocompatibility, biodegradability and high modulus. The
   electrospun fibres were collected in tension on a rotating wire mandrel.
   Upon treating these fibres in a heated aqueous environment, they
   possessed a crimp-like pattern having a wavelength and amplitude similar
   to that of native ACL collagen. Of the polymer fibre scaffolds studied,
   those made from poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide) PLDLA exhibited the
   highest modulus and were also the most resilient to in vitro hydrolytic
   degradation, undergoing a slight decrease in modulus compared to the
   other polymeric fibres over a 6 month period. Bovine fibroblasts seeded
   on the wavy, crimp-like PLDLA fibres attached, proliferated and
   deposited extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules on the surface of the
   fibrous scaffold. In addition, the deposited ECM exhibited bundle
   formation that resembled the fascicles found in native ACL These
   findings demonstrate the importance of replicating the geometric
   microenvironment in developing effective tissue engineering scaffolds.

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the potential of incorporating
   bovine fibres as a means of reinforcing a typically brittle apatite
   calcium phosphate cement for vertebroplasty. Type I collagen derived
   from bovine Achilles tendon was ground cryogenically to produce an
   average fibre length of 0.96 +/- 0.55 mm and manually mixed into the
   powder phase of an apatite-based cement at 1,3 or 5 wt.\%. Fibre
   addition of up to 5 wt.\% had a significant effect (P <= 0.001) on the
   fracture toughness, which was increased by 172\%. Adding <= 1 wt.\%
   bovine collagen fibres did not compromise the compressive properties
   significantly, however, a decrease of 39-53\% was demonstrated at >= 3
   wt.\% fibre loading. Adding bovine collagen to the calcium phosphate
   cement reduced the initial and final setting times to satisfy the
   clinical requirements stated for vertebroplasty. The cement viscosity
   increased in a linear manner (R-2 = 0.975) with increased loading of
   collagen fibres, such that the injectability was found to be reduced by
   83\% at 5 wt.\% collagen loading. This study suggests for the first time
   the potential application of a collagen-reinforced calcium phosphate
   cement as a viable option in the treatment of vertebral fractures,
   however, issues surrounding efficacious cement delivery need to be

Title = {{The use of recycled demolition aggregate in precast concrete products -
   Phase III: Concrete pavement flags}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{674-680}},

Abstract = {{A study undertaken at the University of Liverpool has investigated the
   potential for using construction and demolition waste (C\&DW) derived
   aggregate in the manufacture of a range of precast concrete products,
   i.e. building and paving blocks and pavement flags. Phase Ill, which is
   reported here, investigated concrete pavement flags. This was subsequent
   to studies on building and paving blocks. Recycled demolition aggregate
   can be used to replace newly quarried limestone aggregate, usually used
   in coarse (6 mm) and fine (4 mm-to-dust) gradings. The first objective
   was, as was the case with concrete building and paving blocks, to
   replicate the process used by industry in fabricating concrete pavement
   flags in the laboratory. The ``wet{''} casting technique used by
   industry for making concrete flags requires a very workable mix so that
   the concrete flows into the mould before it is compressed. Compression
   squeezes out water from the top as well as the bottom of the mould. This
   industrial casting procedure was successfully replicated in the
   laboratory by using an appropriately modified cube crushing machine and
   a special mould typical of what is used by industry. The mould could be
   filled outside of the cube crushing machine and then rolled onto a steel
   frame and into the machine for it to be compressed. The texture and
   mechanical properties of the laboratory concrete flags were found to be
   similar to the factory ones. The experimental work involved two main
   series of tests, i.e. concrete flags made with concrete- and
   masonry-derived aggregate. Investigation of flexural strength was
   required for concrete paving flags. This is different from building
   blocks and paving blocks which required compressive and tensile
   splitting strength respectively. Upper levels of replacement with
   recycled demolition aggregate were determined that produced similar
   flexural strength to paving flags made with newly quarried aggregates,
   without requiring an increase in the cement content. With up to 60\% of
   the coarse or 40\% of the fine fractions replaced with concrete-derived
   aggregates, the target mean flexural strength of 5.0 N/mm(2) was still
   achieved at the age of 28 days. There was similar detrimental effect by
   incorporating the fine masonry-derived aggregate. A replacement level of
   70\% for coarse was found to be satisfactory and also conservative.
   However, the fine fraction replacement could only be up to 30\% and even
   reduced to 15\% when used for mixes where 60\% of the coarse fraction
   was also masonry-derived aggregate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The ductility of concrete made with commercially available steel and
   synthetic fibres has been investigated. Flexural stress-deflection
   relationships have been used to determine: flexural strength, flexural
   toughness, equivalent flexural strength, and equivalent flexural
   strength ratio. The flexural toughness of concrete was found to increase
   considerably when steel and synthetic fibres were used. However, equal
   dosages of different fibres did not result in specimens with the same
   flexural toughness. Flexural toughness differences of almost 35 J
   existed even at the same fibre dosage. This also resulted in
   considerable differences in the minimum required ground supported slab

Abstract = {{In night aviation, to land an aircraft, a pilot needs to be able to
   identify an airport. The approach lighting system (ALS) at an airport is
   used to provide identification and guidance to pilots. ALS consists of
   more than 100 luminaires which are installed in a defined pattern
   following strict guidelines by the International Civil Aviation
   Organization (ICAO). ICAO also has strict regulations for maintaining
   the performance level of the luminaires. However, to date there is no
   automated technique by which to monitor the performance of the lighting.
   We suggest using images of the lighting pattern captured using a camera
   placed inside an aircraft. Based on the information contained within
   these images, the performance of the luminaires has to be evaluated
   which requires identification of over 100 luminaires within the pattern
   of ALS image. This research proposes analysis of the pattern using
   morphology filters which use a variable length structuring element
   (VLSE). The dimension of the VLSE changes continuously within an image
   and varies for different images. A novel technique for automatic
   determination of the VLSE is proposed and it allows successful
   identification of the luminaires from the image data as verified through
   the use of simulated and real data.}},

Abstract = {{To understand and interpret human motion is a very active research area
   nowadays because of its importance in sports sciences, health care, and
   video surveillance. However, classification of human motion patterns is
   still a challenging topic because of the variations in kinetics and
   kinematics of human movements. In this paper, we present a novel
   algorithm for automatic classification of motion trajectories of human
   upper limbs. The proposed scheme starts from transforming 3-D positions
   and rotations of the shoulder/elbow/wrist joints into 2-D trajectories.
   Discriminative features of these 2-D trajectories are, then, extracted
   using a probabilistic shape-context method. Afterward, these features
   are classified using a k-means clustering algorithm. Experimental
   results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the
   state-of-the-art techniques.}},

Title = {{Analyzing shoulder translation with navigation technology}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{853-860}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Asymmetric stress imposed on the shoulder can lead to anterior
   shoulder instability in young athletes who perform repetitive overhead
   motions. A common treatment, surgical anterior capsule tightening,
   assumes that the instability is caused by abnormal anterior laxity. This
   study investigated the possibility that one element of overall
   imbalance, posterior capsular tightness, could be an underlying reason
   for shoulder instability. Surgical navigation technology, which is more
   accurate than whole-body motion-capture systems, was used to study
   anterior translational motions.
   Method The study was used four cadaver shoulders, with the scapula and
   rotator cuff muscles intact. Opto-electronic surgical navigation
   localization devices were mounted on the scapula and humerus to
   accurately capture positions and orientations. The shoulders were
   passively moved through 7 motions, 5 of simple angulation and 2
   combinations of clinical interest. Each motion was repeated in 4
   different soft-tissue states: rotator cuff intact, capsule intact, and
   surgically induced capsular tightnesses of 5 and 10mm.
   Results The shoulders had significantly greater anterior translation
   when the posterior capsule was artificially tightened (p < 0.05); this
   was particularly in movements that combined abduction with internal or
   external rotation, which are typical overhead sports motions. Overall
   translation was indifferent to whether the shoulders were intact or
   dissected down to the capsule, as was translation during flexion was
   indifferent to dissection state (p > 0.95).
   Conclusion Surgical navigation technology can easily be used to analyze
   cadaveric shoulder motion, with opportunities for adaptation to
   anesthetized patients. Results suggest that the inverse of artificial
   tightening, such as surgical release of the posterior capsule, may be an
   effective minimally invasive treatment of chronic shoulder dislocation
   subsequent to sports motions.}},

Abstract = {{The O9IV star HD?57682, discovered to be magnetic within the context of
   the Magnetism in Massive Stars (MiMeS) survey in 2009, is one of only
   eight convincingly detected magnetic O-type stars. Among this select
   group, it stands out due to its sharp-lined photospheric spectrum. Since
   its discovery, the MiMeS Collaboration has continued to obtain
   spectroscopic and magnetic observations in order to refine our knowledge
   of its magnetic field strength and geometry, rotational period and
   spectral properties and variability. In this paper we report new Echelle
   SpectroPolarimetric Device for the Observation of Stars (ESPaDOnS)
   spectropolarimetric observations of HD?57682, which are combined with
   previously published ESPaDOnS data and archival Ha spectroscopy. This
   data set is used to determine the rotational period (63.5708 +/-
   0.0057?d), refine the longitudinal magnetic field variation and magnetic
   geometry (dipole surface field strength of 880 +/- 50?G and magnetic
   obliquity of 79 degrees +/- 4 degrees as measured from the magnetic
   longitudinal field variations, assuming an inclination of 60 degrees)
   and examine the phase variation of various lines. In particular, we
   demonstrate that the Ha equivalent width undergoes a double-wave
   variation during a single rotation of the star, consistent with the
   derived magnetic geometry. We group the variable lines into two classes:
   those that, like Ha, exhibit non-sinusoidal variability, often with
   multiple maxima during the rotation cycle, and those that vary
   essentially sinusoidally. Based on our modelling of the Ha emission, we
   show that the variability is consistent with emission being generated
   from an optically thick, flattened distribution of magnetically confined
   plasma that is roughly distributed about the magnetic equator. Finally,
   we discuss our findings in the magnetospheric framework proposed in our
   earlier study.}},

Abstract = {{The barrier-based distributor is a multiphase flow distributor for a
   multichannel microreactor which assures flow uniformity and prevents
   channeling between the two phases. For N number of reaction channels,
   the barrier-based distributor consists of a gas manifold, a liquid
   manifold, N barrier channels for the gas, N barrier channels for the
   liquid, and N mixers for mixing the phases before the reaction channels.
   The flow distribution is studied numerically using a method based on the
   hydraulic resistive networks (RN). The single phase hydraulic RN model
   (Commenge et al., 2002;48:345358) is extended for two phases gas-liquid
   Taylor flow. For ReGL <30, the accuracy for the model was above 90\%.
   The developed-model was used to study the effects of fabrication
   tolerance and barrier channel dimensions. A design methodology has been
   proposed as an algorithm to determine the required hydraulic resistance
   in the barrier channels and their dimensions. This methodology is
   demonstrated using a numerical example. (c) 2012 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Previous studies have repeatedly demonstrated that the relevance of a
   citing document is related to the number of times with which the source
   document is cited. Despite the ease with which electronic documents
   would permit the incorporation of this information into citation-based
   document search and retrieval systems, the possibilities of repeated
   citations remain untapped. Part of this under-utilization may be due to
   the fact that very little is known regarding the pattern of repeated
   citations in scholarly literature or how this pattern may vary as a
   function of journal, academic discipline or self-citation. The current
   research addresses these unanswered questions in order to facilitate the
   future incorporation of repeated citation information into document
   search and retrieval systems. Using data mining of electronic texts, the
   citation characteristics of nine different journals, covering the three
   different academic fields (economics, computing, and medicine \&
   biology), were characterized. It was found that the frequency (f) with
   which a reference is cited Nor more times within a document is
   consistent across the sampled journals and academic fields.
   Self-citation causes an increase in frequency, and this effect becomes
   more pronounced for large N. The objectivity, automatability, and
   insensitivity of repeated citations to journal and discipline, present
   powerful opportunities for improving citation-based document search. (C)

Abstract = {{One hundred and twenty-five new high-precision spectropolarimetric
   observations have been obtained with ESPaDOnS (Eschelle
   Spectro-Polarimetric Device for the Observation of Stars) at the
   CanadaFranceHawaii Telescope and Narval at Telescope Bernard Lyot to
   investigate the magnetic properties of the classical Be star ? Ori. No
   Stokes V signatures are detected in our polarimetric data. Measurements
   of the longitudinal magnetic field, with a median error bar of 30?G, and
   direct modelling of the mean least-squares deconvolved Stokes V profiles
   yield no evidence for a dipole magnetic field with polar surface
   strength greater than similar to 80?G. We are therefore unable to
   confirm the presence of the magnetic field previously reported by Neiner
   et al. However, our spectroscopic data reveal the presence of periodic
   emission variability in H and He lines analogous to that reported by
   Neiner et al., considered as evidence of magnetically confined
   circumstellar plasma clouds. We revisit this hypothesis in light of the
   new magnetic analysis. Calculation of the magnetospheric Kepler radius
   RK and confinement parameter ?{*} indicates that a surface dipole
   magnetic field with a polar strength larger than 63?G is sufficient to
   form of a centrifugally supported magnetosphere around ? Ori. Our data
   are not sufficiently sensitive to detect fields of this magnitude; we
   are therefore unable to confirm or falsify the magnetic cloud
   hypothesis. Based on our results, we examine three possible scenarios
   that could potentially explain the behaviour of ? Ori: (1) that no
   significant magnetic field is (or was) present in ? Ori, and that the
   observed phenomena have their origin in another mechanism or mechanisms
   than corotating clouds. We are, however, unable to identify one; (2)
   that ? Ori hosts an intermittent magnetic field produced by dynamo
   processes; however, no such process has been found so far to work in
   massive stars and especially to produce a dipolar field; and (3) that ?
   Ori hosts a stable, organized (fossil) magnetic field that is
   responsible for the observed phenomena, but with a strength that is
   below our current detection threshold. Of these three scenarios, we
   consider the second one (dynamo process) as highly unlikely, whereas the
   other two should be falsifiable with intense monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of different processing routes on structure and properties of
   high-density polyethylene (HDPE)-clay nanocomposites was assessed.
   Different compatibilizer/clay ratios (a) were also studied to determine
   if interactions exist between processing route and polymer-clay
   compatibility. HDPE/HDPE-g-MA/clay with a values of 1 to 4 were melt
   compounded (twin screw extrusion), and then processed via three routes:
   compression moulding, compression moulding followed by biaxial
   stretching or blown film extrusion. The structure was examined using
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
   Tensile and oxygen barrier properties were determined. It was found that
   biaxial extensional forming produced the best enhancement in properties.
   An interaction between processing route and polymer-clay compatibility
   is evident. Halpin-Tsai (H-T) model was employed to predict relative
   modulus values. It showed good agreement with the experimental data. For
   biaxial extension at a = 4.0, the experimental relative modulus is
   greater than the predicted value. This may indicate the existence of a
   nano effect at the polymer-clay interface. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2012. (C)

Abstract = {{Aircraft engine gearboxes represent one of the many critical
   systems/elements that require special attention for longer and safer
   operation. Reactive maintenance strategies are unsuitable as they
   usually imply higher repair costs when compared to condition based
   maintenance. This paper discusses the main prognostics and health
   management (PHM) approaches, describes a newly designed gearbox
   experimental facility and analyses preliminary data for gear prognosis.
   The test rig is designed to provide full capabilities of performing
   controlled experiments suitable for developing a reliable diagnostic and
   prognostic system. The rig is based on the accessory gearbox of the GE
   J85 turbojet engine, which has been slightly modified and reconfigured
   to replicate real operating conditions such as speeds and loads. Defect
   to failure tests (DTFT) have been run to evaluate the performance of the
   rig as well as to assess prognostic metrics extracted from sensors
   installed on the gearbox casing (vibration and acoustic). The paper also
   details the main components of the rig and describes the various
   challenges encountered. Successful DTFT results were obtained during an
   idle engine performance test and prognostic metrics associated with the
   sensor suite were evaluated and discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

   polypropylene under process conditions}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{55-69}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Polypropylene sheets have been stretched at 160 degrees C to a state of
   large biaxial strain of extension ratio 3, and the stresses then allowed
   to relax at constant strain. The state of strain is reached via a path
   consisting of two sequential planar extensions, the second perpendicular
   to the first, under plane stress conditions with zero stress acting
   normal to the sheet. This strain path is highly relevant to solid phase
   deformation processes such as stretch blow moulding and thermoforming,
   and also reveals fundamental aspects of the flow rule required in the
   constitutive behaviour of the material. The rate of decay of stress is
   rapid, and such as to be highly significant in the modelling of
   processes that include stages of constant strain. A constitutive
   equation is developed that includes Eyring processes to model both the
   stress relaxation and strain rate dependence of the stress. The axial
   and transverse stresses observed during loading show that the use of a
   conventional Levy-Mises flow rule is ineffective, and instead a flow
   rule is used that takes account of the anisotropic state of the material
   via a power law function of the principal extension ratios. Finally the
   constitutive model is demonstrated to give quantitatively useful
   representation of the stresses both in loading and in stress relaxation.

   increase of cobalt and tungsten contents, cobalt could promote the
   segregation of tungsten along the martensite lath to form Laves phase,

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to determine the surface temperature
   of a high pressure die casting die during casting conditions. This was
   achieved by instrumentation of an insert which was placed in the

   directly measuring the die surface temperature during a HPDC production
   casting cycle and shows that this is an effective method to determine
   the die surface temperature during the casting cycle. The
   instrumentation results gave a peak and minimum temperature of 500
   degrees C and 240 degrees C respectively during steady state running
   conditions with a molten aluminium casting temperature of 660 degrees C.
   Stress analysis from the steady state measured temperature of the die
   surface was calculated through a simple FEA model and the resulting
   stress fluctuation was applied to a fatigue equation for the die
   material, the predicted number of cycles for cracking to start was found
   to correlate well with observed die damage. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Dimethyl ether (DME) is amongst one of the most promising alternative,
   renewable and clean fuels being considered as a future energy carrier.
   In this study, the comparative catalytic performance of gamma-Al2O3
   prepared from two common precursors (aluminum nitrate (AN) and aluminum
   chloride (AC)) is presented. The impact of calcination temperature was
   evaluated in order to optimize both the precursor and pre-treatment
   conditions for the production of DME from methanol in a fixed bed
   reactor. The catalysts were characterized by TGA, XRD, BET and
   TPD-pyridine. Under reaction conditions where the temperature ranged
   from 180 degrees C to 300 degrees C with a WHSV = 12.1 h(-1) it was
   found that all the catalysts prepared from AN(eta-Al2O3) showed higher
   activity, at all calcination temperatures, than those prepared from
   AC(gamma-Al2O3). In this study the optimum catalyst was produced from AN
   and calcined at 550 degrees C. This catalyst showed a high degree of
   stability and had double the activity of the commercial gamma-Al2O3 or
   87\% of the activity of commercial ZSM-5(80) at 250 degrees C. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{A series of iron containing zeolites with varying Si/Al ratios
   (11.5-140) and low iron content (similar to 0.9 wt.\% Fe) have been
   synthesised by solid-state ion exchange with commercially available
   zeolites and tested, for the first time, in the oxidative
   dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with N2O. The samples were
   characterised by XRD, N-2-Adsorption, NH3-TPD and DR-UV-vis
   spectroscopy. The acidity of the Fe-ZSM-5 can be controlled by high
   temperature and steam treatments and Si/Al ratio. The selectivity and
   yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al
   contents and reduced acidity. The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5
   was significantly higher than that of Fe-SiO2 since the presence of weak
   and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and
   iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation. The
   coking of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts could also be controlled by reduction of
   the surface acidity of ZSM-5 and by the use of O-2 in addition to N2O as
   the oxidant. Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared with solid-state method have
   been shown to have comparable activity and better stability towards
   coking compared with Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange

Abstract = {{A new approach to controlling the dynamics and yields of polyolefin

   subsequently generate a covalent network through the oligomerization of
   polymer-bound acrylate functionality. Selectivity of alkyl radical
   trapping by AOTEMPO to give alkoxyamine intermediates in preference to
   acrylate addition products is discovered using model compound studies
   and through rheological measurements of linear low density polyethylene
   cross-linking. The latter demonstrate the ability of AOTEMPO to delay
   the onset of cross-linking while not compromising the cross-link density
   of the resulting thermoset. The influences of reagent loadings, peroxide
   decomposition rates, and the structure of polymerizable functionality

Abstract = {{We present new stellar age profiles, derived from well-resolved optical
   and near-infrared images of 64 Virgo cluster disk galaxies, whose
   analysis poses a challenge for current disk galaxy formation models. Our
   ability to break the age-metallicity degeneracy and the significant size
   of our sample represent key improvements over complementary studies of
   field disk galaxies. Our results can be summarized as follows: first,
   and contrary to observations of disk galaxies in the field, these
   cluster galaxies are distributed almost equally amongst the three main
   types of disk galaxy luminosity profiles (I/II/III), indicating that the
   formation and/or survival of Type II breaks is suppressed within the
   cluster environment. Second, we find examples of statistically
   significant inversions ({''}U-shapes{''}) in the age profiles of all
   three disk galaxy types, reminiscent of predictions from high-resolution
   simulations of classically truncated Type II disks in the field. These
   features characterize the age profiles for only about a third (<= 36\%)
   of each disk galaxy type in our sample. An even smaller fraction of
   cluster disks (similar to 11\% of the total sample) exhibit age profiles
   that decrease outward (i.e., negative age gradients). Instead, flat
   and/or positive age gradients prevail (>= 50\%) within our Type I, II,
   and III subsamples. These observations thus suggest that while stellar
   migrations and inside-out growth can play a significant role in the
   evolution of all disk galaxy types, other factors contributing to the
   evolution of galaxies can overwhelm the predicted signatures of these
   processes. We interpret our observations through a scenario whereby
   Virgo cluster disk galaxies formed initially like their brethren in the
   field but which, upon falling into the cluster, were transformed into
   their present state through external processes linked to the environment
   (e. g., ram-pressure stripping and harassment). Current disk galaxy
   formation models, which have largely focused on field galaxies, fail to
   reproduce these results, thus calling for adequate hydrodynamical
   simulations of dense galaxy environments if we are to understand cluster
   disks. The current paper highlights numerous constraints for such
   simulations. In the Appendix, we confirm the claim by Erwin et al. that
   Type II breaks are absent in Virgo cluster S0s and discuss the detection
   of Type III breaks in such galaxies.}},

Abstract = {{A collaborative study on Raman spectroscopy and microspectrophotometry
   (MSP) was carried out by members of the ENFSI (European Network of
   Forensic Science Institutes) European Fibres Group (EFG) on different
   dyed cotton fabrics. The detection limits of the two methods were tested
   on two cotton sets with a dye concentration ranging from 0.5 to 0.005\%
   (w/w).
   This survey shows that it is possible to detect the presence of dye in
   fibres with concentrations below that detectable by the traditional
   methods of light microscopy and microspectrophotometry (MSP). The MSP
   detection limit for the dyes used in this study was found to be a
   concentration of 0.5\% (w/w). At this concentration, the fibres appear
   colourless with light microscopy. Raman spectroscopy clearly shows a
   higher potential to detect concentrations of dyes as low as 0.05\% for
   the yellow dye RY145 and 0.005\% for the blue dye RB221. This detection
   limit was found to depend both on the chemical composition of the dye
   itself and on the analytical conditions, particularly the laser
   wavelength.
   Furthermore, analysis of binary mixtures of dyes showed that while the
   minor dye was detected at 1.5\% (w/w) (30\% of the total dye
   concentration) using microspectrophotometry, it was detected at a level
   as low as 0.05\% (w/w) (10\% of the total dye concentration) using Raman
   spectroscopy.
   This work also highlights the importance of a flexible Raman instrument
   equipped with several lasers at different wavelengths for the analysis
   of dyed fibres. The operator and the set up of the analytical conditions
   are also of prime importance in order to obtain high quality spectra.
   Changing the laser wavelength is important to detect different dyes in a
   mixture. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have compiled a sample of 3041 spiral galaxies with multiband gri
   imaging from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7;
   Abazajian et al. 2009) and available galaxy rotational velocities, V,
   derived from HI linewidths. We compare the data products provided
   through the SDSS imaging pipeline with our own photometry of the SDSS
   images, and use the velocities, V, as an independent metric to determine
   ideal galaxy sizes (R) and luminosities (L). Our radial and luminosity
   parameters improve upon the SDSS DR7 Petrosian radii and luminosities
   through the use of isophotal fits to the galaxy images. This improvement
   is gauged via VL and RV relations whose respective scatters are reduced
   by similar to 8 and similar to 30 per cent with our parameters compared
   to similar relations built with SDSS parameters. The tightest VRL
   relations are obtained with the i-band radius, R-23.5,R-i, measured at
   23.5 mag arcsec(-2), and the luminosity L-23.5,L-i, measured within
   R-23.5,R-i. Our VRL scaling relations compare well, both in scatter and
   slope, with similar studies (though such comparisons depend sensitively
   on the nature and size of the compared samples). The typical slopes, b,
   and observed scatters, sigma, of the i-band VL, RL and RV relations are
   b(VL) = 0.27 +/- 0.01, b(RL) = 0.41 +/- 0.01, b(RV) = 1.52 +/- 0.07, and
   sigma(VL) = 0.074, sigma(RL) = 0.071, sigma(RV) = 0.154, respectively.
   Similar results for the SDSS g and r bands are also provided. Smaller
   scatters may be achieved with more pruned samples. We also compute
   scaling relations in terms of the baryonic mass (stars + gas), M-bar,
   ranging from M-bar similar or equal to 10(8.7) to 10(11.6) M-circle dot.
   Our baryonic velocity-mass (VM) relation has slope 0.29 +/- 0.01 and a
   measured scatter sigma(meas) = 0.076 dex.}},

   2-form (2MgO center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O) and 3-form (3MgO center

   hydroxychlorides form from the reaction of MgO with MgCl2 brines. They
   have historically been of importance as the components of Sorel cements.
   More recently, they have taken a central role in proposed flowsheets for
   chloride leaching of laterite nickel ores, with the chloride units being
   captured in magnesium hydroxychloride precipitates. Differential thermal
   analysis (DTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and mass spectrometry
   (MS) curves have been obtained for both the 2-form and the 3-form. In
   addition, results of an isothermal kinetic study on the 2-form are
   presented. The DTA-TGA-MS curves reveal a two-stage decomposition
   pathway for both hydroxychlorides, passing through currently unknown
   intermediates. An empirical equation is presented describing the
   decomposition rate of the 2-form, predicting 100\% decomposition within
   1 min at similar to 560 degrees C.}},

   demonstrated herein and validated for prismatic sub-stiffening features.
   Moreover, examination of the generated buckling coefficient data

Abstract = {{Several recent studies have investigated failure mechanisms for cast
   iron water pipes. These studies have primarily focused on the adverse
   effects of corrosion, frost, reactive backfill, and earthquakes. It
   appears that leaking pressure pipes can produce erosion voids under the
   buried structure. In this paper, a parametric study employing
   three-dimensional finite-element analyses is used to examine buried,
   continuous, cast iron water pipes. The objective is to understand the
   effect of such erosion voids on the stability of buried cast iron pipes
   and the longitudinal soil-pipe interaction. The results of the
   finite-element analyses demonstrate that the radial (sigma(R)) and the
   axial stresses (sigma(A)) are low compared with the hoop stresses
   (sigma(theta)), and the peak tension is always in the hoop direction. As
   a result of the high hoop stresses induced by the nonuniform bedding
   support, longitudinal fractures are likely to occur in the pipe, which
   may consequently cause pipe failure. DOI:

Abstract = {{The combination of milli-scale processing and microwave heating has been

   fine-chemical synthesis, providing improved catalytic activity and
   selective catalyst heating. Wall-coated and fixed-bed milli-reactors
   were designed and applied in the Cu-catalyzed Ullmann-type C-O coupling
   of phenol and 4-chloropyridine. In a batch reactor the results show
   clearly increased yields for the microwave heated process at low
   microwave powers, whereas high powers and catalyst loadings reduced the
   benefits of microwave heating. Slightly higher yields were found in the
   Cu/ZnO wall-coated as compared to the Cu/TiO2 fixed-bed flow-reactor.
   The benefit here is that the reaction occurs at the surface of the metal
   nanoparticles confined within a support film making the nano-copper
   equally accessible. Catalyst deactivation was mainly caused by Cu
   oxidation and coke formation; however, at longer process times leaching
   played a significant role. Catalyst activity could partially be
   recovered by removal of deposited by-product by means of calcination.
   After 6 h on-stream the reactor productivities were 28.3 and 55.1
   kg(prod)/(m(R)(3) h) for the fresh Cu/ZnO wall-coated and Cu/TiO2
   fixed-bed reactor, respectively. Comparison of single- and multimode
   microwaves showed a threefold yield increase for single-mode microwaves.
   Control of nanoparticles size and loading allows to avoid high
   temperatures in a single-mode microwave field and provides a novel
   solution to a major problem for combining metal catalysis and microwave
   heating. Catalyst stability appeared to be more important and provided
   twofold yield increase for the CuZn/TiO2 catalyst as compared to the
   Cu/TiO2 catalyst due to stabilized copper by preferential oxidation of
   the zinc. For this catalyst a threefold yield increase was observed in
   single-mode microwaves which, to the best of our knowledge, led to a not
   yet reported productivity of 172 kgprod/(m(R)(3) h) for the microwave
   and flow Ullmann C-O coupling. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Gas-liquid processing in microreactors remains mostly restricted to the
   laboratory scale due to the complexity and expenditure needed for an
   adequate numbering-up with a uniform flow distribution. Here, the
   numbering-up is presented for multi-phase (gas-liquid) flow in
   microreactor suitable for a production capacity of kg/h. Based on the
   barrier channels concept, the barrier-based micro/milli reactor (BMMR)
   is designed and fabricated to deliver flow non-uniformity of less than
   10\%. The BMMR consists of eight parallel channels all operated in the
   Taylor flow regime and with a liquid flow rate up to 150 mL/min. The
   quality of the flow distribution is reported by studying two aspects.
   The first aspect is the influence of different viscosities, surface
   tensions and flow rates. The second aspect is the influence of
   modularity by testing three different reaction channels type: (1) square
   channels fabricated in a stainless steel plate, (2) square channels
   fabricated in a glass plate, and (3) circular channels (capillaries)
   made of stainless steel. Additionally, the BMMR is compared to that of a
   single channel regard the slug and bubble lengths and bubble generation
   frequency. The results pave the ground for bringing multi-phase flow in
   microreactor one step closer for large scale production via
   numbering-up. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biotreatment of wastewaters containing toxic compounds can be
   jeopardized by surges in substrate concentration. Preventative measures
   include tight monitoring and control to either dilute high concentration
   transients, or to divert them to surge tanks for later release and
   treatment. Using phenol as a typical toxic substrate, we have imposed 4
   h phenol surges of 3,000, 6,000 and 8,000 mg/l from a steady-state feed
   of 500 mg/l, demonstrating such reduced treatment efficiency. In
   contrast, with the addition to the bioreactor of a small amount (3-10 \%
   w/v) of inert polymer beads (Hytrel 8206) possessing a high affinity for
   phenol (partition coefficient of 39), significant detoxification was
   achieved, resulting in a 100 \% increase in treatment efficiency, and
   good performance at phenol surges of up to 16,000 mg/l. The addition
   (passive operation) of polymers to a biotreatment system eliminated the
   need for intervention during toxic transients while, at the same time,
   demonstrating that the polymers perform this function automatically and
   at all times (aggressive operation).}},

Abstract = {{The mining industry is under increasing pressure to assess the

   enargite (Cu3AsS4), due to the rising demand for copper and gold. A
   sulphation roast, weak acid leach, and electrowinning process flowsheet
   has been studied to address the treatment of copper concentrates
   containing significant amounts of enargite. Copper is recovered from the
   calcine by acid leaching, with most of the arsenic being fixed in the
   leach residue after gold extraction by cyanidation. The relative
   simplicity of roasting combined with proven hydrometallurgical
   technologies has the potential to be economically advantageous and
   readily scaled for commercial operation. Based on a proposed reaction
   mechanism, a thermodynamic analysis has been performed using HSC

Abstract = {{The composition of a dynamic mixture of similar 2,2'-bipyridine
   complexes of iron(II) bearing either an amide
   (5-benzylamido-2,2'-bipyridine and
   5-(2-methoxyethane)amido-2,2'-bipyridine) or an ester
   (2,2'-bipyridine-5-carboxylic acid benzylester and
   2,2'-bipyridine-5-carboxylic acid 2-methoxyethane ester) side chain have
   been evaluated by electrospray mass spectroscopy in acetonitrile. The
   time taken for the complexes to come to equilibrium appears to be
   dependent on the counteranion, with chloride causing a rapid
   redistribution of two preformed heteroleptic complexes (of the order of
   1 hour), whereas the time it takes in the presence of tetrafluoroborate
   salts is in excess of 24 h. Similarly the final distribution of products
   is dependent on the anion present, with the presence of chloride, and to
   a lesser extent bromide, preferring three amide-functionalized ligands,
   and a slight preference for an appended benzyl over a methoxyethyl
   group. Furthermore, for the first time, this study shows that the
   distribution of a dynamic library of metal complexes monitored by ESI-MS
   can adapt following the introduction of a different anion, in this case
   tetrabutylammonium chloride to give the most favoured heteroleptic
   complex despite the increasing ionic strength of the solution.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the stresses and deformations are studied in a buried PVC
   water pipe with bell-and-spigot joints, and with localized voids leaving
   the invert and haunches unsupported. The finite element program ABAQUS
   is used to assess changes in the stresses and deformations as a function
   of the void geometry under the pipe. The results of the analyses are
   evaluated in terms of factors of safety and displacements. The minimum
   factor of safety calculated for the specific pipe and bedding conditions
   considered in this study decreases by 36\% if the void forms away from
   the joint, and by 30\% when a joint is centred over the void. The most
   critical void location is directly under the bell of the pipe, likely
   because this permits the greatest rotation at the joint. This is also
   the most likely void location resulting during construction, since the
   bedding is generally excavated under protruding bells. In each case
   being considered, the factor of safety remained above 5, illustrating
   that current water pipe design includes conservative choice of wall
   thickness to accommodate imperfections of this kind, in addition to
   other factors such as pressure surges. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We describe and employ a recently developed polaron master equation
   model to study the fluorescence spectra of a coherently driven quantum
   dot (QD) placed within a high-Q semiconductor microcavity (with Q the
   quality factor). We investigate phonon-induced damping in a regime where
   many cavity photons are required, and we also compare the resonance
   fluorescence spectra obtained using an effective phonon master equation
   in Lindblad form where simple analytical expressions are identified for
   various phonon-induced scattering rates. We consider two separate
   continuous-wave pumping scenarios, where either the system is driven
   through exciton pumping or the system is driven via the cavity. The
   cavity-QED (quantum electrodynamics) system is pumped sufficiently
   strongly such that the low-energy sideband of the Mollow triplet is
   tuned across the cavity mode resonance which is negatively detuned from
   the QD. For comparison, we also consider the case where the QD-cavity
   detuning is large enough such that the Mollow triplets do not spectrally
   overlap with the cavity mode. We find that the full width at half
   maximum (FWHM) of the high-energy Mollow sideband shows a pronounced
   nonlinear dependence on the pump intensity when the low-energy component
   of the triplet overlaps with the cavity mode (or vice versa), and can
   even be reduced with increased pumping. However, the FWHM depends
   linearly on the pump intensity when the Mollow triplets are far from the
   cavity resonance. We observe similar fluorescence spectra for both the
   exciton-driven system and the cavity-driven system. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) based on a semiconducting
   polymer blended with lithium salt and novel polyelectrolytes have been
   studied. Random copolymers of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether

   transition temperature (T-g) above room temperature. Devices have been
   optimized and successfully turned on upon heating. Cooling devices under
   applied voltage bias down to room temperature leads to frozen PN
   junctions. The relaxation of these junctions over voltage-free storage
   is studied. The higher the T-g, the longer the shelf-life of the
   junctions. This research opens the route to room temperature stable
   organic PN junctions for use in organic electronic devices such as
   light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic solar cells and other organic

Abstract = {{Low-molecular-weight poly(ethylene carbonate) diols of varying molecular
   weight were generated through catalyzed thermal degradation of
   high-molecular-weight poly(ethylene carbonate). These polymers were then
   end functionalized with acrylate groups. The resulting axo-diacrylates
   were effectively photo-cross-linked upon exposure to long-wave UV light
   in the presence of a photoinitiator to yield rubbery networks of low sol
   content. The degree of cross-linking effectively controlled the in vivo
   degradation rate of the networks by adherent macrophages; higher
   cross-link densities yielded slower degradation rates. The cross-link
   density did not affect the number of adherent macrophages at the
   elastomer/tissue interface, indicating that cross-linking affected the
   susceptibility of the elastomer to degradative species released by the
   macrophages. The reactive species likely responsible for in vivo
   degradation appears to be superoxide anion, as the in vivo results were
   in agreement with in vitro degradation via superoxide anion, while
   cholesterol esterase, known to degrade similar poly(alkylene
   carbonate)s, had no affect on elastomer degradation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe and evaluate new spectral line polarization
   observations obtained with the goal of mapping the surfaces of magnetic
   Ap stars in great detail. One hundred complete or partial Stokes IQUV
   sequences, corresponding to 297 individual polarized spectra, have been
   obtained for seven bright Ap stars using the Echelle SpectroPolarimetric
   Device for the Observation of Stars (ESPaDOnS) and NARVAL
   high-resolution spectropolarimeters. The targets span a range of masses
   from approximately 1.8 to 3.4 M circle dot, a range of rotation periods
   from 2.56 to 6.80 ?d and a range of maximum longitudinal magnetic field
   strengths from 0.3 to over 4 kG. For three of the seven stars, we have
   obtained dense phase coverage sampling the entire rotational cycle.
   These data sets are suitable for immediate magnetic and chemical
   abundance surface mapping using magnetic Doppler imaging. For the
   remaining four stars, partial phase coverage has been obtained, and
   additional observations will be required in order to map the surfaces of
   these stars. The median signal-to-noise ratio of the reduced
   observations is over 700 per 1.8 km?s-1 pixel. Spectra of all stars show
   Stokes V Zeeman signatures in essentially all individual lines, and most
   stars show clear Stokes QU signatures in many individual spectral lines.
   The observations provide a vastly improved data set compared to previous
   generations of observations in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, resolving
   power and measurement uncertainties. Measurement of the longitudinal
   magnetic field demonstrates that the data are internally consistent
   within computed uncertainties typically at the 50-100 sigma level. Data
   are also shown to be in excellent agreement with published observations
   and in qualitative agreement with the predictions of published surface
   structure models. In addition to providing the foundation for the next
   generation of surface maps of Ap stars, this study establishes the
   performance and stability of the ESPaDOnS and NARVAL high-resolution
   spectropolarimeters during the period 2006-2010.}},

Abstract = {{Recent patterns of migration indicate that international migrants are
   not confined to urban gateways. Instead many migrants have settled in
   new destination areas located in rural and small town areas. While this
   might appear to be a positive phenomenon for rural areas struggling with
   decline and stagnation, the reality is that many of these areas are
   ill-equipped to manage the rate and pace of change that has been
   witnessed in recent years. Migration to established, typically urban
   areas has been the subject of extensive research. However, little is
   known about the way in which migrants navigate their way through social
   structures as they settle into destinations with little experience of
   immigration. Using empirical research, this article considers the way in
   which migrants navigate their way through social structures to establish
   life in a so-called new migration destination. It analyses the way in
   which government and civil society respond to their needs of recent
   arrivals, showing how both NGOs and the statutory sector play an
   important role in this process. It considers the ramifications for these
   different sectors and the implications for so-called new destinations as
   they become more established or mature areas of immigration.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the influence of a crimp-like
   microarchitecture within electrospun polymer scaffolds on fibroblast
   extracellular matrix (ECM) production when cultured under dynamic
   conditions. Electrospun poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide) scaffolds
   possessing a wave pattern similar to collagen crimp (amplitude: 5 mu m
   and wavelength: 46 mu m) were seeded with bovine fibroblasts and
   mechanically stimulated under dynamic uniaxial tension. The effect of
   strain amplitude (5\%, 10\% and 20\%) was investigated in a short-term
   stimulation study. The 10\% strain amplitude in the stimulated
   crimp-like fibre scaffold increased only collagen synthesis, while the
   20\% strain amplitude increased both collagen and sulphated proteoglycan
   synthesis compared to stimulated uncrimped (straight) fibre scaffolds
   and unloaded controls (crimp-like static fibre scaffolds).
   Alternatively, mechanical stimulation of fibroblasts seeded on uncrimped
   fibre scaffolds induced significant fibroblast proliferation compared to
   the stimulated crimp-like fibre scaffolds and no-load controls.
   Long-term, dynamic mechanical stimulation of fibroblasts seeded on
   crimp-like fibre scaffolds at 10\% strain amplitude resulted in
   significantly up-regulated collagen accumulation and down-regulated
   sulphated proteoglycan accumulation. Additionally, the fibroblasts
   seeded on dynamically stimulated crimp-like fibre scaffolds appeared to
   form bundles that resembled fascicles, a characteristic hierarchical
   feature of the native ligament. Our findings demonstrate that
   fibroblasts seeded on crimp-like fibrous scaffolds respond more
   favourably (increased ECM synthesis and fascicle formation) to dynamic
   mechanical loading compared to those grown on scaffolds containing
   uncrimped (straight) fibres. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{This experimental study was carried out to investigate the flow field in
   the human extra-thoracic airway using the particle image velocimetry
   technique. The purpose of this study is to understand the physics of the
   turbulent flow in the pharynx/larynx region. The flow rate was 9 l/min,
   and the corresponding Reynolds number, based on the inlet condition, was
   670. Two thousand images were acquired at each location at a framing
   rate of 2 Hz. The mean turbulence intensity, turbulent kinetic energy
   and Reynolds stress fields were calculated. Moreover, the proper
   orthogonal decomposition method and quadrant analysis were also used for
   investigating the flow in the pharynx/larynx region. The results showed
   that the flow is strongly three dimensional and is characterised by
   re-circulation, jet-like and sink-like mean flows. The pharynx/larynx
   region is characterised by bursting events (e.g. ejection, sweep and
   interaction events) particularly in the epiglottal region. These events
   appear to be responsible for deforming and/or tearing apart the vortical
   structures. In addition, the major contribution to the Reynolds shear
   stress comes from the events that mainly burst with or against the flow
   direction which, in some cases, exceeded 100 \% of the inlet velocity.}},

   of 10 mu A/mu m, JL devices achieve two times higher values of cutoff
   frequency (f(T)) and maximum oscillation frequency (f(MAX)) along with
   65\% improvement in voltage gain (A(VO)) in comparison to conventional
   nonunderlap MOSFETs. ULP JL devices, which do not require source/drain
   (S/D) profile optimization, can perform comparably to underlap devices,
   thereby relaxing the stringent process constraints associated with S/D
   profile optimization in nanoscale devices. The results highlight new
   opportunities for realizing future ULP analog/RF design with JL
   transistors.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrahigh molecular weight polymers generally exhibit very high melt
   viscosities. They are therefore very difficult to process and require
   heavy-duty processing equipment. In some cases they cannot be processed
   at all using conventional melt processing techniques. In this study, a
   novel processing method called Thermoflow Forming (TFF) has been
   developed for manufacturing parts made from high viscosity polymers. The
   TFF process is based on the flow of polymer material in its
   thermoelastic state, between its glass transition and melting
   temperatures, by compressive flow thermoforming. The processing
   equipment consists of an upper and lower mold tool, which may be driven
   together, while its temperature is controlled through either induction
   heating or air cooling. Parts with both constant and varying wall
   thicknesses were successfully manufactured from ultrahigh molecular
   weight polyethylene and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Despite the
   significantly different wall thicknesses molded, the parts showed
   minimal warpage and no voids. Those made from PTFE exhibited a
   fibrillated morphological structure whose size and orientation depended
   on the material flow direction. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2012. (C) 2012 Society

Abstract = {{The potential of an extremely hydrophobic cobalt(II) catalyst for the
   synthesis of polymer nanolatexes in microemulsion polymerization is

   bis{[}(difluoronoryl)-diphenylglyoximato]cobalt(II). The average
   particle diameter can be reduced from 50 nm to approximately 10 nm in
   the presence of minor quantities of the cobalt(II) complex. The small
   particle size, combined with the relatively narrow particle size
   distribution, results in nanolatexes that are virtually transparent in
   appearance. Furthermore, the nucleation efficiency can be enhanced by up
   to two orders of magnitude, corresponding to approximately 1 particle
   nucleated for every 10(1) micelles. This represents a significant
   improvement as in microemulsion polymerization generally 1 particle is

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results obtained on the multiple layers of
   cobalt (Co)/platinum (Pt) and cobalt (Co)/platinum (Pt)/cobalt (Co) on
   the oxidised silicon substrate. The cobalt layers were deposited by
   metal-organic chemical vapour deposition on oxidised-silicon substrates
   at 450 A degrees C, in H-2 ambient with 2-torr processing pressure. The
   platinum layers were deposited by E-beam evaporation in a separate
   vacuum system. The magnetic properties of Co/Pt/Co and Co/Pt multilayer
   were compared with the single cobalt layers of similar thicknesses on
   the oxidised silicon substrate. From the hysteresis loops it was
   observed that thin cobalt layers on oxidised-silicon substrate shows
   hard magnetic property with coercivity H (c) values of 360 Oe and 500 Oe
   respectively for the 30- and 15-nm cobalt layers. The multiple layers of
   Co/Pt/Co and Co/Pt of cobalt thickness 15- and 30-nm with platinum
   1.5-nm spacer-layer show significant change in magnetic properties (i.e.
   coercivity H (c) and magnetisation M (s) ) and, gave soft magnetic
   properties with H (c) values 51 and 49 Oe respectively, which are
   significantly less than the H (c) values of single cobalt layers on
   oxidised silicon. Also, single and multiple layers cobalt with platinum
   were annealed and compared with the as-deposited layer structures. From
   the microstructure analysis by SEM, and AFM it was found that the single
   and multilayer had similar roughness. Magnetic images were observed by
   MFM and analyzed in terms of domain structure.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study poly(propylene sebacate) (PPSeb) nanocomposites
   containing 2 wt\% of either fumed silica nanoparticles (SiO2),
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), or montmorillonite (MMT) were
   prepared by in situ polymerization. TEM micrographs confirmed that the
   dispersion of the nanoparticles was homogeneous in the PPSeb matrix,
   although some small agglomerates were observed, mainly in SiO2
   nanocomposites. The tensile strength and Young's moduli were
   significantly increased in nanocomposites due to the addition of
   nanoparticles. The reinforcement effect of nanoparticles was also
   established through Dynamic Themomechanical analysis (DMA). Mass loss
   measurements showed that, when compared to neat PPSeb, the presence of
   nanoparticles results in reduced enzymatic hydrolysis rates. This is due
   to the hindering effect of nanoparticles on the action of the enzymes
   since the former reduce the available surface area for hydrolysis, but
   also due to the interactions taking place between nanoparticles and
   PPSeb matrix. The mechanism of enzymatic hydrolysis was investigated by
   molecular weight variation and LC-MS analysis of the soluble
   by-products. It was found that PPSeb and its nanocomposites have
   identical hydrolysis mechanisms; even thought nanocomposites have lower
   hydrolysis rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the reliability and thus the suitability of optical fibre
   strain sensors for surface strain measurement in concrete structures was
   investigated. Two different configurations of optical strain sensors
   were used each having different mountings making them suitable for
   different uses in various structures. Due to the very limited time
   available to install the sensors and take result, commercially packaged
   sensors were used. In the tests carried out each sensor was mounted onto
   a concrete beam which was then subjected to a range of known and
   calibrated loadings. The performance of the optical strain sensors thus
   evaluated was compared with the results of conventional techniques. This
   comparison allows for selecting the best performing combination of
   sensor/mounting, i.e. long-gauge sensor with mounts bolted to threaded
   rods glued into the concrete for use in future work in a field test
   where a limited time window was available for installation, testing and
   post-test demounting. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A continuously operated microwave heated millireactor setup has been
   developed for performing reactions of highly microwave absorbing media
   in a controlled and energy efficient manner. The setup consists of a
   tubular reactor integrated with a heat exchanger. A microwave
   transparent liquid was used as coolant to extract the excess heat from
   the reaction mixture, thus controlling the temperature of the reaction
   mixture by avoiding overshoots and subsequent boiling. A reactor-heat
   exchanger shell and tube unit with a diameter of the inner tube of
   3.10-3 m and a shell of 7.10-3 m inner diameter has been manufactured in
   quartz. The unit size was defined based on simulation with a
   heat-transfer model for the microwave cavity part. Microwave heating was
   incorporated as a volumetric heating source term using the
   temperature-dependent dielectric properties of the liquid. Model
   predictions were validated with measurements for a range of 0.167.10-6
   to 1.67.10-6 m3/s flow rates of coolant. The outlet temperature of both
   the reaction mixture and the coolant, were predicted accurately
   (tolerance of 3 K), and the process window was determined. The model for
   the reactor part provided the required length of the reactor for a
   hetero-geneously catalyzed esterification reaction. The predicted
   conversions, based on the obtained temperature profile in the reactor
   packed with the catalyst bed, known residence times and kinetics of the
   esterification reaction, were found to be in good agreement with the
   experimental results. Efficient utilization of microwave energy with
   heat recovery up to 20\% of the total absorbed microwave power and
   heating efficiencies up to 96\% were achieved. It has been demonstrated
   that the microwave heating combined with millireactor flow processing
   provides controlled and energy efficient operation thus making it a
   viable option for a fine chemical production scale of 1 kg/day (24 h
   period). (c) 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 58:

Journal = {{ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{144}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We present the first particle-based Lagrangian code that can follow the
   collisional/accretional/dynamical evolution of a large number of
   kilometer-sized planetesimals through the entire growth process of
   becoming planets. We refer to it as the Lagrangian Integrator for
   Planetary Accretion and Dynamics or LIPAD. LIPAD is built on top of
   SyMBA, which is a symplectic N-body integrator. In order to handle the
   very large number of planetesimals required by planet formation
   simulations, we introduce the concept of a tracer particle. Each tracer
   is intended to represent a large number of disk particles on roughly the
   same orbit and size as one another and is characterized by three
   numbers: the physical radius, the bulk density, and the total mass of
   the disk particles represented by the tracer. We developed statistical
   algorithms that follow the velocity and size evolution of the tracers
   due to close gravitational encounters and physical collisions with one
   another. The tracers mainly dynamically interact with the larger objects
   (planetary embryos) in the normal N-body way. LIPAD's greatest strength
   is that it can accurately model the wholesale redistribution of
   planetesimals due to gravitational interaction with the embryos, which
   has recently been shown to significantly affect the growth rate of
   planetary embryos. We verify the code via a comprehensive set of tests
   that compare our results with those of Eulerian and/or direct N-body
   codes.}},

Abstract = {{The mass transfer of phenol and butyl acetate to/from water was studied
   in two-phase partitioning bioreactors using immiscible organic solvents
   and solid polymer beads as the partitioning phases in a 5-L stirred tank
   bioreactor. Virtually instantaneous mass transfer was observed with
   phenol in water/2-undecanone, and with butyl acetate in water/silicone
   oil systems. The mass transfer of butyl acetate to silicone oil was
   rapid irrespective of the viscosity of the partitioning phase. When
   Hytrel(A (R)) polymer beads were employed as the partitioning phase,
   substrate transport to the polymer was found not to be externally mass
   transfer limited, but rather internally by substrate diffusion into the
   polymer. In contrast to gaseous, poorly soluble substrates studied in
   other works, mass transfer of soluble substrates such as phenol and
   butyl acetate to the polymer was unaffected by impeller speed but rather
   by polymer mass fraction.}},

Abstract = {{The mean velocity and turbulence intensity are the two main inputs to
   investigate the ship propeller induced seabed scouring resulting from a
   vessel is manoeuvring within a port where the underkeel clearances are
   low. More accurate data including the turbulence intensity is now
   available by using the laser doppler anemometry (LDA) measurement system
   and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. Turbulence intensity
   has a loose definition, which is the velocity fluctuation as the root
   mean square (RMS) referenced to a mean flow velocity. However, the
   velocity fluctuation and mean velocity can be the overall value
   including x, y and z directions or the value of a single component. LDA
   and CFD results were obtained from two different acquisition systems
   (Dantec LDA system and Fluent CFD package) and therefore the outputs
   cannot be compared directly. An effective method is proposed for
   comparing the turbulence intensity between the experimental measurements
   and the computational predictions within a ship propeller jet. The flow
   patterns of turbulence intensity within a ship propeller jet are
   presented by using the LDA measurements and CFD results from turbulence
   models of standard k - epsilon, RNG k - epsilon, realizable k-epsilon,
   standard k-omega, SST k-omega and Reynolds stresses. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{The Therapeutic Potential of Exogenous Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) for
   Cartilage Tissue Engineering}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Objective: While mechanical stimuli can be used to enhance the
   properties of engineered cartilage, a promising alternative may be to
   directly harness the underlying mechanotransduction pathways
   responsible. Our initial studies on the adenosine triphosphate
   (ATP)-purinergic receptor pathway demonstrated that stimulation by
   exogenous ATP improved tissue growth and properties but elicited matrix
   turnover under high doses (250 mu M) potentially due to the accumulation
   of extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (ePPi). Therefore, the purpose
   of this study was to identify the mechanism of ATP-mediated catabolism
   and determine a therapeutic dose to maximize the anabolic effect.
   Design: Isolated bovine articular chondrocytes were seeded in
   high-density, 3-dimensional culture supplemented with varying doses of
   ATP for 4 weeks. The effects on biosynthesis, matrix metalloproteinase
   13 (MMP-13) protein activity, and PPi accumulation were determined.
   Separate monolayer experiments were conducted to determine the effect of
   ePPi on MMP-13 activity. Results: High doses of ATP resulted in an
   increase in ePPi accumulation (by 54\%) and MMP-13 activity (by 39\%).
   Monolayer experiments confirmed a link between increased ePPi
   accumulation and MMP-13 activity, which appeared to require calcium and
   was inhibited by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126. Cultures supplemented with
   62.5 to 125 mu M ATP favored an anabolic response, which represented the
   therapeutic dose range. Conclusions: A therapeutic dose range of
   exogenous ATP to improve the properties of engineered cartilage has been
   identified, and a possible catabolic mechanism involving excess PPi was
   determined. Future research into PPi signal transduction and
   pathological crystal formation is necessary to maximize the beneficial
   effect of exogenous ATP on chondrocyte cultures.}},

Abstract = {{Articular cartilage suffers from a limited repair capacity when damaged
   by mechanical insult or degraded by disease, such as osteoarthritis. To
   remedy this deficiency, several medical interventions have been
   developed. One such method is to resurface the damaged area with
   tissue-engineered cartilage; however, the engineered tissue typically
   lacks the biochemical properties and durability of native cartilage,
   questioning its long-term survivability. This limits the application of
   cartilage tissue engineering to the repair of small focal defects,
   relying on the surrounding tissue to protect the implanted material. To
   improve the properties of the developed tissue, mechanical stimulation
   is a popular method utilized to enhance the synthesis of cartilaginous
   extracellular matrix as well as the resultant mechanical properties of
   the engineered tissue. Mechanical stimulation applies forces to the
   tissue constructs analogous to those experienced in vivo. This is based
   on the premise that the mechanical environment, in part, regulates the
   development and maintenance of native tissue(1,2). The most commonly
   applied form of mechanical stimulation in cartilage tissue engineering
   is dynamic compression at physiologic strains of approximately 5-20\% at
   a frequency of 1 Hz(1,3). Several studies have investigated the effects
   of dynamic compression and have shown it to have a positive effect on
   chondrocyte metabolism and biosynthesis, ultimately affecting the
   functional properties of the developed tissue(4-8). In this paper, we
   illustrate the method to mechanically stimulate chondrocyte-agarose
   hydrogel constructs under dynamic compression and analyze changes in
   biosynthesis through biochemical and radioisotope assays. This method
   can also be readily modified to assess any potentially induced changes
   in cellular response as a result of mechanical stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of the surface zone of concrete is acknowledged as a
   major factor governing the rate of deterioration of reinforced concrete
   structures because it provides the only barrier to the ingress of water
   containing dissolved ionic species such as chlorides, which ultimately
   initiate corrosion of the reinforcement. In situ monitoring of
   cover-zone concrete is therefore critical in attempting to make
   realistic predictions as to the in-service performance of the structure.
   To this end, this paper presents developments in a remote interrogation
   system to allow for continuous, real-time monitoring of the cover-zone
   concrete from an office setting. Use is made of a multi electrode array
   embedded within cover-zone concrete to acquire discretized electrical
   resistivity and temperature measurements, with both parameters monitored
   spatially and temporally. On-site instrumentation, which allows for the
   remote interrogation of concrete samples placed at a marine exposure
   site, is detailed together with data handling and processing procedures.
   Site measurements highlight the influence of temperature on electrical
   resistivity and an Arrhenius-based temperature correction protocol is
   developed using on-site measurements to standardize resistivity data to
   a reference temperature; this is an advancement over the use of
   laboratory-based procedures. The testing methodology and interrogation
   system represent a robust, low-cost, and high-value technique that could
   be deployed for intelligent monitoring of reinforced concrete
   structures. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000089. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{A hybrid system, concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) tube
   (CFFT)-encased steel I-section, is introduced. The embedded steel
   section enhances flexural strength and stiffness, and provides a
   pseudoductile behavior. It also facilitates connection of the CFFT
   member to footings or other members. Phase I of the experimental program
   addresses the flexural behavior of the system through ten beam
   specimens, including steel and CFFT control specimens. The glass
   fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) tubes varied in thickness and laminate
   structure. The steel section enhanced performance considerably,
   especially pseudoductility, in tubes with cross-ply laminates, in which
   a significant sustained reserved strength remains stable over large
   deflections on fracture of the tube. CFFTs with angle-ply tubes showed a
   considerable inherent ductility on their own, in which case, adding the
   steel section enhanced strength and stiffness only. Phase II addresses a
   moment connection through five cantilever tests. The connections consist
   of steel base plates welded to the steel sections, which are embedded
   into the CFFT members at various length (L-s)-to-span-length (L) ratios
   ranging from 0.1 to 1.0. Three distinct failure modes are observed. At
   (L-s/L) ratios of up to 0.17, premature bond failure occurs. At ratios
   of 0.17 to 0.47, the CFFT member achieves flexural tension failure of
   the tube just beyond the free end of the steel section. Beyond a 0.47
   ratio, the full plastic hinge capacity is developed at the fixed end. A
   simple design-oriented model that predicts strengths at the full range
   of (L-s/L) ratios is developed and validated. DOI:

Abstract = {{Marine invertebrates are at risk of extinction if climate changes
   outpace their ability to adapt to thermal stress, and cold-adapted taxa
   may be especially vulnerable because of their specialized physiologies
   and because their high-latitude distributions permit only limited
   poleward migration. Here, we use a database of 1437 early and middle
   Permian eastern Australian fossil collections from the Paleobiology
   Database to test for latitudinal range shifts, extinctions, and faunal
   invasion among high-latitude marine invertebrates during climate changes
   in the late Paleozoic ice age. Latitudinal range shifts are not
   apparent, either because genera were unable to migrate or, more likely,
   because sampling noise or the scale of analyses prevent their
   recognition. Extinction rates were moderately elevated during the
   largest climate shifts, however, possibly suggesting that at least some
   taxa were unable to respond to the rate or magnitude of climate change.
   Although recognition of range shifts within Australia is difficult,
   warm-water brachiopods, bivalves, and ammonoids invaded the region
   during pronounced warming in the Artinskian, highlighting the importance
   of temperature on faunal distribution. That faunal invasion was
   coincident with substantial restructuring of local paleocommunities, but
   both likely resulted from the common cause of increasing temperature
   rather than having a causal relationship. Temperature warming would have
   stressed cold-adapted stenotherms, triggering changes in local dominance
   and allowing immigration of warm-water taxa. These local and regional
   shifts in dominance and distribution imply that physiological stresses
   from even gradual climate change can be sufficient to trigger biotic
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber-reinforced self-consolidating concrete (FRSCC) has a tremendous
   potential to be used in construction industry because it combines the
   advantages of both self-consolidating concrete (SCC) and
   fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC). Nineteen concrete mixtures are
   developed by incorporating different dosages (up to 0.5\% volume or 22
   kg/m(3) of concrete) of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and metallic fibers and
   their combinations. The influences of fiber types, size, dosages, and
   fiber combinations (used in hybrid mixes) on fresh (slump flow, L-box
   passing ability, V-funnel flow time, and segregation index-a measure of
   workability) and rheological (viscosity and yield stress at various time
   intervals ranging from 10 to 70 min) properties are critically analyzed
   on the basis of experimental results. The workability/rheological
   properties of concrete mixtures are found to depend on types, dosages,
   geometry of fiber, and in cases of hybrid mixtures, interaction and
   synergic properties between different fiber types also play a critical
   role. The maximum dosage of PVA is limited to 0.125\% compared with
   0.3\% of metallic fibers in developed FRSCC mixtures because of PVA's
   higher workability reduction/viscosity increase capability. In addition,
   relationships among fresh/workability and rheological properties are
   also established. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000490. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Miocene palustrine ooids located in the Nullarbor Plain, southern
   Australia, illustrate the importance of microbes and soil processes in
   the formation of these spherically laminated grains in pedogenic
   settings. These particles are composed of dense minimicrite and include
   a wide assortment of microbially produced structures. Such biogenicity
   includes interpreted extracellular polymers (EPS), algal filaments,
   palygorskite and sepiolite nano-fiber mats, bacterial spores, and
   meniscate fabrics. Ooid nuclei are peloids that are interpreted to have
   formed via microbial binding of lacustrine sediment in a subsequent
   palustrine environment, both at the surface and inside underlying karst
   cavities. The peloids are encapsulated in multigenerational micrite
   laminations that form the spherical cortex. Individual cortical laminae
   are made up of degraded minimicrite crystals and complex encrusting mats
   of palygorskite and sepiolite nano-fibers. Cortex generation is
   interpreted to have been an annual process involving alternating soil
   hydration states. In this conceptual model, during the wet season, ooids
   were covered in bacterial mucus that bound ions from solution and
   produced hydrated Mg-Si gels that evenly surrounded the entire ooid. Gel
   dehydration during the following dry season resulted in precipitation of
   fibrous palygorskite and sepiolite. Succeeding seasonal variations in
   moisture produced numerous laminae that ultimately resulted in a
   multigenerational ooid cortex. This annual microbial process provides a
   new mechanism involving an autogenic formation of ooids that may be
   applied to a wide variety of pedogenic sediments. Unlike the more common
   marine ooids that require constant movement to achieve cortical
   precipitation, the process of grainification, combined with microbially,
   mediated mineral precipitation under different soil hydration states,
   results in the in-place formation of terrestrial ooids.}},

   Stabilization}},

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{765-774}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Hydraulic displacement is a mass removal technology suitable for
   stabilization of a dense, nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source zone,
   where stabilization is defined as reducing DNAPL saturations and
   reducing the risk of future pool mobilization. High resolution
   three-dimensional multiphase flow simulations incorporating a spatially
   correlated, heterogeneous porous medium illustrate that hydraulic
   displacement results in an increase in the amount of residual DNAPL
   present, which in turn results in increased solute concentrations in
   groundwater, an increase in the rate of DNAPL dissolution, and an
   increase in the solute mass flux. A higher percentage of DNAPL recovery
   is associated with higher initial DNAPL release volumes, lower density
   DNAPLs, more heterogeneous porous media, and increased drawdown of
   groundwater at extraction wells. The fact that higher rates of recovery
   are associated with more heterogeneous porous media stems from the fact
   that larger contrasts in permeability provide for a higher proportion of
   capillary barriers upon which DNAPL pooling and lateral migration can
   occur. Across all scenarios evaluated in this study, the ganglia-to-pool
   (GTP) ratio generally increased from approximately 0.1 to between
   approximately 0.3 and 0.7 depending on the type of DNAPL, the degree of
   heterogeneity, and the imposed hydraulic gradient. The volume of DNAPL
   recovered as a result of implementing hydraulic displacement ranged from
   between 9.4\% and 45.2\% of the initial release volume, with the largest
   percentage recovery associated with 1,1,1 trichloroethane, the least
   dense of the three DNAPLs considered.}},

Abstract = {{Standby diesel generator sets (gen-sets) are used worldwide to provide a
   backup electricity supply should the mains supply to a site be lost. The
   diesel engine can start rapidly and the gen-set can begin supplying

   performed when the engine is at its normal `hot' operating temperature.
   Unless a jacket water heater is used, once the gen-set is shutdown the
   engine will cool to the ambient temperature, and following start-up the
   load acceptance performance will be lower than when it was in a hot
   operating condition. A novel voltage regulator design which utilises
   engine temperature as a supplementary control input is presented,
   providing an improvement in a gen-set's cold load acceptance performance
   without compromising its standard hot performance. The new voltage
   regulator design is tested on a commercial diesel gen-set to demonstrate
   the optimised load acceptance performance.}},

Title = {{Influence of Specimen Geometry on Sample Disturbance Observed in
   Oedometric Testing of Clay Shales}},

Abstract = {{There has been a significant amount of research investigating the
   relationship between sample disturbance and laboratory test results in
   soft soils. As a result of this research, the general rule adopted is
   that using larger specimens results in less sample disturbance. When
   testing these larger specimens in the laboratory, the results are more
   representative of in situ behavior of the materials. In contrast, there
   has been relatively little corresponding research performed on hard
   soils whose behavior typically lies on the boundary between rock and
   soil. Extensive unloading in hard soils, from sampling, results in large
   suctions (negative pore pressures) and the formation of fractures that
   are uncharacteristic of the material in its natural state. This poses
   the question of whether the use of small specimens would produce more
   reliable laboratory results. This paper investigates the following two
   hypotheses within the context of oedometric testing: (1) testing smaller
   diameter specimens will produce results more representative of the in
   situ behavior of the material, and (2) an aspect ratio of 2.5 may reduce
   disturbance to the specimen during preparation are tested. The results
   of this testing program, including the intact material properties, and a
   characterization of the compression behaviour of clay shale from the
   Bearpaw Formation is also presented herein. Results show that a reduced
   specimen size, when working with a hard clay shale, minimizes the effect
   of disturbance and produces results that are the most representative of
   the intact material. Decreased specimen size also aids in determining
   preconsolidation pressure by not only reducing the disturbance to the
   sample resulting from unloading, but also by enabling these high
   stresses to be achieved in conventional testing equipment. Two criteria
   from the literature were used to assess disturbance within the oedometer
   specimens. Overall, the methods provide a good baseline of assessing
   disturbance, however, there is less gradation to the quality of a
   specimen in a hard soil. Parameters C-c and sigma(j)(p) were sensitive
   to sample disturbance, however, other parameters such as c(v) and K were
   less dramatically affected by disturbance. Therefore, care must be taken
   when assessing the compression of a hard soil as failing to achieve
   sufficiently higher stresses and the presence of disturbed specimens may
   lead to misleading C-c and sigma(j)(p) values.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: In image-guided therapy, real-time visualization of the anatomy
   and adjustments in the therapy plan due to anatomical motions during the
   procedure is of outmost importance. 3D ultrasound has the potential to
   enable this real-time monitoring; however, nonrigid registration of a
   sequence of 3D ultrasound volumes remains to be a challenging problem.
   The authors present our recent results on the development of a
   computationally inexpensive feature-based registration algorithm for
   elastic alignment of dynamic-3D ultrasound images.
   Methods: Our algorithm uses attribute vectors, based on the image
   intensity and gradient information, to perform feature-based matching in
   a sequence of 3D ultrasound images. Prior information from both the
   fixed and previous moving images is utilized to track features
   throughout the 3D image series. The algorithm has been compared to
   various publicly available registration techniques, i.e., the B-splines
   deformable registration, the symmetric forces Demons, and the fast
   free-form deformable registration method.
   Results: Using a series of validation experiments on datasets collected
   from carotid artery, liver, and kidney of 20 subjects, the authors
   demonstrate that the feature-based, B-splines, Demons, and fast
   free-form deformable registration techniques can all recover volume
   deformations in a 3D ultrasound image series with reasonable accuracy;
   however, the proposed feature-based registration technique has
   substantial computational advantage over the other approaches.
   Conclusions: The proposed feature-based registration technique has the
   potential for real-time implementation on a computationally inexpensive
   platform and has the capability of recovering nonrigid deformations in
   tissue with reasonable accuracy. (c) 2012 American Association of

Abstract = {{Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is an efficient and
   powerful population-based optimization technique, which is inspired by
   the conventional particle swarm optimization (PSO) and quantum mechanics

   combines QPSO with a selective probability operator to solve the
   economic dispatch (ED) problems with valve-point effects and multiple
   fuel options. To show the performance of the proposed SQPSO, it is
   tested on five standard benchmark functions and two ED benchmark
   problems, including a 40-unit ED problem with valve-point effects and a
   10-unit ED problem with multiple fuel options. The results are compared
   with differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and
   basic QPSO, as well as a number of other methods reported in the
   literature in terms of solution quality, convergence speed and
   robustness. The simulation results confirm that the proposed SQPSO is
   effective and reliable for both function optimization and ED problems.}},

Abstract = {{This works follows a publication of our group in J. Chem. Eng. Data
   2007, 52, 2204-2211 presenting high temperature and pressure density
   data for five imidazolium-based ionic liquids. At this period, very few
   ionic liquid density data were available in the literature, especially
   at high pressure, and the uncertainty of published results was
   calculated with respect to the literature data available for three of
   the five ionic liquids studied. Since 2007, the ionic liquid density
   databank has largely increased. In this work, a comparison of our
   published data in J. Chem. Eng. Data 2007, 52, 2204-2211, with more than
   1800 high pressure data coming from the literature up to December 2011
   is presented to assess the uncertainty of our published values. The
   claimed uncertainty is close to 0.31 \% for all IL density data sets
   except in the case of the {[}C(1)C(2)Im]{[}EtSO4], where the uncertainty
   is up to 1.1 \%. Reported data in J. Chem. Eng, Data 2007, 52,
   2204-2211, for this particular ionic liquid cannot be used as a
   reference. For this ionic liquid, new density measurements of the same
   sample batch have been remeasured by using the same experimental
   technique, and new experimental data presented herein are clearly higher
   than our previous published results. A H-1 NMR analysis of the sample
   has confirmed hydrolysis of the ethylsulfate anion to ethanol and
   hydrogenate anion which explains the differences observed between our
   density data and the literature.}},

Abstract = {{In the Himalayan chain the collision of India into Eurasia has produced
   some of the most complex crustal interactions along the Himalayan-Alpine
   Orogen. In NW Bhutan, middle to late Miocene deformation has been
   partitioned between conjugate strike-slip faulting, E-W extension along
   the Yadong-Gulu graben and kilometre-scale folding. To better understand
   the late deformation stages and their implications for the evolution of
   the eastern Himalayas, the palaeomagnetism in the erosional remnant of
   the Tethyan Himalayan rocks outcropping in NW Bhutan has been studied.
   Their position to the south of the trace of the inner South Tibetan
   Detachment, to the south of the Tibetan Plateau offers a unique
   possibility to study the Tertiary rotation of the Himalayas. Pyrrhotite
   is the carrier of the characteristic magnetisation based on 270-325
   degrees C unblocking temperatures. The age of the remanence is ca. 13 Ma
   indicated by illite K-40/Ar-40 cooling ages and a negative fold test.
   Small circle intersection method applied to the pyrrhotite components
   shows a ca. 32 degrees clockwise rotation with respect to stable India
   since 13 Ma. We suggest that this clockwise rotation is related to
   strain partitioning between NE-directed shortening, sinistral-slip along
   the Lingshi fault, and east-west extension. This represents a
   field-based explanation and a minimum onset age for present-day eastward
   motion of the upper-crust of SE-Tibet and NE-Himalayas. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to report the preliminary development of an
   automatic collision avoidance technique for unmanned marine craft based
   on standardised rules, COLREGs, defined by the International Maritime
   Organisation. It is noted that all marine surface vessels are required
   to adhere to COLREGs at all times in order to minimise or eliminate the
   risk of collisions. The approach presented is essentially a reactive
   path planning algorithm which provides feedback to the autopilot of an
   unmanned vessel or the human captain of a manned ship for steering the
   craft safely. The proposed strategy consists of waypoint guidance by
   line-of-sight coupled with a manual biasing scheme. This is applied to
   the dynamic model of an unmanned surface vehicle. A simple PID autopilot
   is incorporated to ensure that the vessel adheres to the generated
   seaway. It is shown through simulations that the resulting scheme is
   able to generate viable trajectories in the presence of both stationary
   and dynamic obstacles. Rules 8 and 14 of the COLREGs, which apply to the
   amount of manoeuvre and to a head-on scenario respectively are
   simulated. A comparison is also made with an offline or deliberative
   grid-based path planning algorithm which has been modified to generate
   COLREGs-compliant routes. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In both military and civilian applications, the inertial navigation
   system (INS) and the global positioning system (GPS) are two
   complementary technologies that can be integrated to provide reliable
   positioning and navigation information for land vehicles. The accuracy
   enhancement of INS sensors and the integration of INS with GPS are the
   subjects of widespread research. Wavelet de-noising of INS sensors has
   had limited success in removing the long-term (low-frequency) inertial
   sensor errors. The primary objective of this research is to develop a
   novel inertial sensor accuracy enhancement technique that can remove
   both short-term and long-term error components from inertial sensor
   measurements prior to INS mechanization and INS/GPS integration. A high
   resolution spectral analysis technique called the fast orthogonal search
   (FOS) algorithm is used to accurately model the low frequency range of
   the spectrum, which includes the vehicle motion dynamics and inertial
   sensor errors. FOS models the spectral components with the most energy
   first and uses an adaptive threshold to stop adding frequency terms when
   fitting a term does not reduce the mean squared error more than fitting
   white noise. The proposed method was developed, tested and validated
   through road test experiments involving both low-end tactical grade and
   low cost MEMS-based inertial systems. The results demonstrate that in
   most cases the position accuracy during GPS outages using FOS de-noised
   data is superior to the position accuracy using wavelet de-noising.}},

Abstract = {{CO2 stimuli-responsive polystyrene latexes having a solids content of
   27\% were prepared in a surfactant-free emulsion polymerization (SFEP)
   under a CO2 atmosphere, employing only commercially available chemical
   compounds: styrene, the initiator VA-061, and 0.54 mol \% of the
   CO2-switchable comonomer DEAEMA. The resulting polymer particles are
   230-300 nm in diameter and are monodisperse (PDI <= 0.054), as confirmed
   by DLS, TEM, and SEM. Although they are stable under a CO2 atmosphere,
   the latexes can be easily destabilized by the bubbling of air through
   the sample at 40 degrees C, allowing for recovery of the particles by
   filtration. Recovered polymer particles can be dried to powder and
   readily redispersed in carbonated water, yielding latexes with very
   similar zeta-potential and particle size as the original latexes. In
   addition, the bicarbonate salt of formed during the polymerization has
   been found to act as a CO2-switchable flocculant, thus, facilitating the
   coagulation of the latex without altering the properties of the latex
   after redispersion.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Zr-2.5Nb samples removed after 7 years of service from a nuclear power
   reactor were investigated by traditional mechanical testing and whole
   pattern neutron diffraction line profile analysis of the irradiated and
   deformed materials. A significant increase in yield strength and
   subsequent strain softening are observed in the as-irradiated material.
   The line profile analysis allows the change in mechanical properties to
   be directly related to evolution of the microstructure. A fourfold
   increase in overall dislocation density accomplished entirely by an
   increase in the < a > Burgers vectors dislocations, and profound change
   in the dislocation network arrangement, are found to be created by the
   fast neutron irradiation. Comparison to the microstructural evolution
   during plastic deformation of the unirradiated sample shows a similar
   increase in dislocation density, but the increase is equally distributed
   amongst < a > and < c + a >-type dislocations. Finally, plastic
   deformation of the previously irradiated material again increases the
   dislocation density significantly but, in contrast, does so through a
   10-fold increase in the < c + a > dislocation density relative to the
   as-irradiated material, while the < a > Burgers vector density does not
   change. The different evolution of the < a > and < c + a > Burgers
   vector ratios in the unirradiated and irradiated Zr-2.5Nb during plastic
   deformation can perhaps be explained by the strain localization effect
   previously reported in irradiated Zircaloy subjected to deformation. (C)

Abstract = {{A methodology is presented for generating an inlet containing an
   entrained flow surrounded by an annular flow of driving, supersonic gas.
   As the driving flow expands outward into an annular pattern, it
   maintains a circular throat area while allowing the entrained flow to be
   drawn toward the axisymmetric axis. The methodology accounts for both
   compressibility and viscous effects, and it can be scaled for a variety
   of operating conditions and driving gases. Designs are presented for the
   inlet to an example rocket-based combined-cycle engine based on both a
   kerosene-fueled and a hydrogen-fueled rocket. Numerical results are
   presented, showing rocket exhaust patterns that contain uniform
   conditions over 75\% of the annular exhaust area. The entrained air
   passage is also shown to have high total pressure recovery over the
   subsonic flight range. The predicted performance is shown to be within
   10\% of the numerical simulations over the range of conditions

Abstract = {{Assessment of elevated concentrations of potentially toxic elements
   (PTE) in soils and the association with specific soil parent material
   have been the focus of research for a number of years. Risk-based
   assessment of potential exposure scenarios to identified elevated PTE
   concentrations has led to the derivation of site- and
   contaminant-specific soil guideline values (SGVs), which represent
   generic assessment criteria (GACs) to identify exceeded levels that may
   reflect an unacceptable risk to human health. A better understanding of
   the `bio-available' or `bioaccessible' contaminant concentrations offers
   an opportunity to better refine contaminant exposure assessments.
   Utilizing a comprehensive soil geochemical dataset for Northern Ireland
   provided by the Tellus Survey (GSNI) in conjunction with supplementary
   bioaccessibility testing of selected soil samples following the Unified
   BARGE Method, this paper uses exploratory data analysis and
   geostatistical analysis to investigate the spatial variability of
   pseudo-total and bioaccessible concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni,
   Pb, U, V and Zn. The paper investigates variations in individual element
   concentrations as well as cross-element correlations and observed
   lithological/pedological associations. The analysis of PTE
   concentrations highlighted exceeded levels of GAC values for V and Cr
   and exceeded SGV/GAC values for Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. UBM testing
   showed that for some soil parent materials associated with elevated PTE
   concentrations e.g. the Antrim Lava Group with high Ni concentrations,
   the measured oral bioaccessible fraction was relatively low. For other
   soil parent materials with relatively moderate PTE concentrations,
   measured oral bioaccessible fraction was relatively high (e.g. the Gala
   Sandstone Group of the Southern Uplands-Down Longford Terrain). These
   findings have implications for regional human health risk assessments
   for specific PTEs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Correct modelling of solar photovoltaic (PV) system yields is necessary
   to optimize system design, improve reliability of projected outputs to
   ensure favourable project financing and to facilitate proper operations
   and maintenance. An improved methodology for fine resolution modelling
   of PV systems is presented using module short-circuit current (I-sc) at
   5-mM time-scales, and clearly identifies pertinent error mechanisms that
   arise when working at this high resolution. This work used a modified
   version of the Sandia array performance model, and introduces new
   factors to the calculation of I-sc. to account for identified error
   mechanisms, including instrumentation alignment, spectral, and module
   power tolerance errors. A simple methodology was introduced and verified
   where specific module parameters can be derived solely from properly
   filtered performance time series data. In particular, this paper focused
   on methodologies for determining the predicted I-sc for a variety of
   solar PV module types. These methods of regressive analysis
   significantly reduced the error of the predicted model, and demonstrate
   the need for this form of modelling when evaluating long term PV array
   performance. This methodology has applications for current systems
   operators, which will enable the extraction of useful module parameters
   from existing data in addition to more precise continuous monitoring of
   existing systems, and can also be used to more accurately model and
   optimize new systems. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The effect of hybrid photovoltaic thermal device operating conditions on

Abstract = {{Historically, the design of hybrid solar photovoltaic thermal (PVT)
   systems has focused on cooling crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based
   photovoltaic (PV) devices to avoid temperature-related losses. This
   approach neglects the associated performance losses in the thermal
   system and leads to a decrease in the overall exergy of the system.
   Consequently, this paper explores the use of hydrogenated amorphous
   silicon (a-Si:H) as an absorber material for PVT in an effort to
   maintain higher and more favorable operating temperatures for the
   thermal system. Amorphous silicon not only has a smaller temperature
   coefficient than c-Si, but also can display improved PV performance over
   extended periods of higher temperatures by annealing out defect states
   from the Staebler-Wronski effect. In order to determine the potential
   improvements in a-Si:H PV performance associated with increased
   thicknesses of the i-layers made possible by higher operating
   temperatures, a-Si:H PV cells were tested under 1 sun illumination
   (AM1.5) at temperatures of 25 degrees C (STC), 50 degrees C
   (representative PV operating conditions), and 90 degrees C
   (representative PVT operating conditions). PV cells with an i-layer
   thicknesses of 420, 630 and 840 nm were evaluated at each temperature.
   Results show that operating a-Si:H-based PV at 90 degrees C, with
   thicker i-layers than the cells currently used in commercial production,
   provided a greater power output compared to the thinner cells operating
   at either PV or PVT operating temperatures. These results indicate that
   incorporating a-Si:H as the absorber material in a PVT system can
   improve the thermal performance, while simultaneously improving the
   electrical performance of a-Si:H-based PV. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Lipid peroxidation is a common feature of many chemical and biological
   processes, and is governed by a complex kinetic scheme. A fundamental
   stage in kinetic investigations of lipid peroxidation is the accurate
   determination of the rate of peroxidation, which in many instances is
   heavily reliant on the method of finite differences. Such numerical
   approximations of the first derivative are commonly employed in
   commercially available software, despite suffering from considerable
   inaccuracy due to rounding and truncation errors. As a simple solution
   to this, we applied three empirical sigmoid functions (viz. the
   Prout-Tompkins, Richards \& Gompertz functions) to data obtained from
   the AAPH-mediated peroxidation of aqueous linoleate liposomes in the
   presence of increasing concentrations of Trolox, evaluating the curve
   fitting parameters using the widely available Microsoft Excel Solver
   add-in. We have demonstrated that the five-parameter Richards' function
   provides an excellent model for this peroxidation, and when applied to
   the determination of fundamental rate constants, produces results in
   keeping with those available in the literature. Overall, we present a
   series of equations, derived from the Richards' function, which enables
   direct evaluation of the kinetic measures of peroxidation. This
   procedure has applicability not only to investigations of lipid
   peroxidation, but to any system exhibiting sigmoid kinetics. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Experimental modeling of wireless fading channels performed by the
   WINNER II project has been shown to fit a Rician rather than Rayleigh
   distribution, the latter being assumed in many analytical studies of
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems.
   Unfortunately, a Rician MIMO channel matrix has a nonzero mean (i.e.,
   specular component) that yields, for the matrix product that determines
   the MIMO performance, a noncentral Wishart distribution that is
   difficult to analyze. Previously, the noncentral Wishart distribution
   has been approximated, based on a first-order-moment fit, by a central
   Wishart distribution and used to derive average error probability (AEP)
   expressions for zero-forcing (ZF) detection. We first reveal that this
   approximation and the MIMO performance evaluation tools derived from it
   may be reliable only for rank-one specular matrices. We then exploit
   this approximation to derive an AEP expression for a lesser known, yet
   optimal, MIMO ZF approach that, unlike the conventional approach,
   accounts for channel estimation accuracy through the channel statistics.
   After validating this AEP expression for the rank-one case, it is shown
   that the ZF performance averaged over realistic (i.e., WINNER II)
   distributions of the Rician K-factor and azimuth spread (AS) can be much
   worse than that for the average K and AS. Finally, through simulations,
   it is shown that the optimal detection approach can substantially
   outperform the conventional approach for ZF for full-rank specular
   matrices, as well as for minimum mean square error detection for both
   rank-one and full-rank specular matrices.}},

Abstract = {{In many situations, the number of data points is fixed, and the
   asymptotic convergence results of popular model selection tools may not
   be useful. A new algorithm for model selection, RIVAL (removing
   irrelevant variables amidst Lasso iterations), is presented and shown to
   be particularly effective for a large but fixed number of data points.
   The algorithm is motivated by an application of nuclear material
   detection where all unknown parameters are to be non-negative. Thus,
   positive Lasso and its variants are analyzed. Then, RIVAL is proposed
   and is shown to have some desirable properties, namely the number of
   data points needed to have convergence is smaller than existing methods.

Abstract = {{Cerebral aneurysms are a common cause of death and disability. Of all
   the cardiovascular diseases, aneurysms are perhaps the most strongly
   linked with the local fluid mechanic environment. Aside from early in
   vivo clinical work that hinted at the possibility of high-frequency
   intra-aneurysmal velocity oscillations, flow in cerebral aneurysms is
   most often assumed to be laminar. This work investigates, through the
   use of numerical simulations, the potential for disturbed flow to exist
   in the terminal aneurysm of the basilar bifurcation. The nature of the
   disturbed flow is explored using a series of four idealized basilar tip
   models, and the results supported by four patient specific terminal
   basilar tip aneurysms. All four idealized models demonstrated
   instability in the inflow jet through high frequency fluctuations in the
   velocity and the pressure at approximately 120 Hz. The instability
   arises through a breakdown of the inflow jet, which begins to oscillate
   upon entering the aneurysm. The wall shear stress undergoes similar
   high-frequency oscillations in both magnitude and direction. The neck
   and dome regions of the aneurysm present 180 deg changes in the
   direction of the wall shear stress, due to the formation of small
   recirculation zones near the shear layer of the jet (at the frequency of
   the inflow jet oscillation) and the oscillation of the impingement zone
   on the dome of the aneurysm, respectively. Similar results were observed
   in the patient-specific models, which showed high frequency fluctuations
   at approximately 112 Hz in two of the four models and oscillations in
   the magnitude and direction of the wall shear stress. These results
   demonstrate that there is potential for disturbed laminar unsteady flow
   in the terminal aneurysm of the basilar bifurcation. The instabilities
   appear similar to the first instability mode of a free round jet.

Abstract = {{The experimental study considered passive effusion cooling in an S-bend
   diffusing passage in which ambient cool air was drawn naturally into the
   S-bend passage with subatmospheric flow distributions. Seven-hole
   pressure probes were used to measure the test section's inlet and outlet
   flow conditions which were used to evaluate the performance of the
   S-bend diffuser. Back-pressure, outlet flow-fields, and wall pressure
   distributions were investigated to study the effects of effusion cooling
   on the pressure recovery performance of the S-bend diffuser. The study
   revealed a substantial back-pressure penalty and wall pressure
   distribution alteration in the S-bend passage with full coverage
   effusion cooling. The outlet diffuser was shown to be not as effective
   with effusion cooling. The findings highlighted the importance of the
   design of effusion holes locations in complex flow passages. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Spherical particles have been sampled from soils and silica-rich rock
   coatings close to major smelter centers at Coppercliff, Coniston, and
   Falconbridge in the Sudbury area, Canada. Detailed analyses employing
   optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron
   microscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and Mossbauer spectroscopy have
   been conducted to elucidate their nature, origin and potential
   alteration. The spherical particles are on the nano- to millimeter-size
   range and are composed principally of magnetite, hematite, Fe-silicates
   (olivine, pyroxenes), heazlewoodite, bornite, pyrrhotite, spinels
   (including trevorite and cuprospinel), delafossite, and cuprite or
   tenorite. The spinels present have variable Cu and Ni contents, whereas
   delafossite and cuprite are Ni free. Texturally, the spherical particles
   are composed of a Fe-oxide-Fe-silicate matrix with sulfide inclusions.
   The matrix displays growth features of a Fe-rich phase that commonly
   form during rapid cooling and transformation processes within smelter
   and converter facilities. Examination of weathered spherical particles
   indicates that some sulfide inclusions have dissolved prior to the
   alteration of the Fe-silicates and oxides and that the weathering of
   Fe-silicates occurs simultaneously with the transformation of magnetite
   into hematite. A higher proportion of Cu vs. Ni in the clay and organic
   fraction noted in the Sudbury soils is explained by (1) the formation of
   stronger adsorption complexes between Cu and the corresponding surface
   species and (2) the preferential release of Cu vs. Ni by smelter-derived
   particles. The latter mechanism is based on the observations that (a)
   cuprospinels have higher dissolution rates than Ni spinels, (b) a larger
   proportion of Cu occurs in the nanometer-size (and thus more soluble)
   fraction of the emitted particles, and (c) Ni spinels of relatively low
   solubility form in the alteration zone of heazlewoodite inclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Oscillator phase noise limits the performance of high speed
   communication systems since it results in time varying channels and
   rotation of the signal constellation from symbol to symbol. In this
   paper, joint estimation of channel gains and Wiener phase noise in
   multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems is analyzed. The signal model
   for the estimation problem is outlined in detail and new expressions for
   the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the multi-parameter estimation
   problem are derived. A data-aided least-squares (LS) estimator for
   jointly obtaining the channel gains and phase noise parameters is
   derived. Next, a decision-directed weighted least-squares (WLS)
   estimator is proposed, where pilots and estimated data symbols are
   employed to track the time-varying phase noise parameters over a frame.
   In order to reduce the overhead and delay associated with the estimation
   process, a new decision-directed extended Kalman filter (EKF) is
   proposed for tracking the MIMO phase noise throughout a frame. Numerical
   results show that the proposed LS, WLS, and EKF estimators' performances
   are close to the CRLB. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that by
   employing the proposed channel and time-varying phase noise estimators
   the bit-error rate performance of a MIMO system can be significantly
   improved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to better understand the impact of the bar on the evolution of
   spiral galaxies, we measure the properties of giant H?ii regions and the
   bar in the SB(s)b galaxy NGC?5430. We use two complementary data sets,
   both obtained at the Observatoire du Mont-Megantic: a hyperspectral data
   cube from the imaging Fourier transform spectrograph SpIOMM
   (Spectrometre-Imageur a transformee de Fourier de l-Observatoire du
   Mont-Megantic) and high-resolution spectra across the bar from a
   long-slit spectrograph. We flux-calibrate SpIOMM spectra for the first
   time, and produce Ha and {[}N?ii]?6584?angstrom intensity maps from
   which we identify 51 giant H?ii regions in the spiral arms and bar. We
   evaluate the type of activity, the oxygen abundance and the age of the
   young populations contained in these giant H?ii regions and in the bar.
   Thus, we confirm that NGC?5430 does not harbour a strong active galactic
   nucleus, and that its WolfRayet knot shows a pure H?ii region nature. We
   find no variation in abundance or age between the bar and spiral arms,
   nor as a function of galactocentric radius. These results are consistent
   with the hypothesis that a chemical mixing mechanism is at work in the
   galaxy's disc to flatten the oxygen abundance gradient. Using the
   starburst99 model, we estimate the ages of the young populations, and
   again find no variations in age between the bar and the arms or as a
   function of radius. Instead, we find evidence for two galaxy-wide waves
   of star formation, about 7.1 and 10.5?Myr ago. While the bar in NGC?5430
   is an obvious candidate to trigger these two episodes, it is not clear
   how the bar could induce widespread star formation on such a short
   time-scale.}},

   of the hybrid composites when compared to the glass fiber composites and
   the virgin matrix. From the tan delta curves, a strong influence of
   glass fiber and nanoclay content on the magnitude of tan delta(max)
   value was observed. Impact test showed a reduction in the critical

   relationships exist between the recorded variables, an improved
   nonlinear PCA, which incorporates the radial basis function (RBF)

   stages. The first stage involves the use of the serial principal curve
   to obtain the nonlinear scores and approximated data. The second stage
   is to construct two RBF networks using a fast recursive algorithm to
   solve the topology problem in traditional nonlinear PCA. The benefits of
   this improvement are demonstrated in the practical application to a

Abstract = {{The article is focused on analysis of global efficiency of new mold for
   rotational molding of plastic parts, being directly heated by thermal
   fluid. The overall efficiency is based on several items such as
   reduction of cycle time, better uniformity of heatingcooling and low

   and electroforming for making the optimal manifold and cavity shell of
   the mold. Experimental test of a prototype mold was carried out on an
   experimental rotational molding machine, developed for this purpose,
   measuring wall temperature, and internal air temperature, with and
   without plastic material inside. Results were compared with conventional
   mold heated into an oven and to theoretical simulations done by
   Computational Fluid Dynamic software (CFD). The analysis represents
   considerable improvement of cycle time related to conventional methods
   (heated by oven) and better thermal uniformity to conventional

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach which enables new parameters to be added
   to a CAD model for optimization purposes. It aims to remove a common
   roadblock to CAD based optimization, where the parameterization of the
   model does not offer the shape sufficient flexibility for a truly
   optimized shape to be created. A technique has been developed which uses
   adjoint based sensitivity maps to predict the sensitivity of performance
   to the addition to a model of four different feature types, allowing the
   feature providing the greatest benefit to be selected. The optimum
   position to add the feature is also discussed. It is anticipated that
   the approach could be used to iteratively add features to a model,
   providing greater flexibility to the shape of the model, and allowing
   the newly-added parameters to be used as design variables in a
   subsequent shape optimization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel detection method for broken rotor bar fault
   (BRB) in induction motors based on the estimation of signal parameters
   via rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT) and simulated annealing
   algorithm (SAA). The performance of ESPRIT is tested with the simulated
   stator current signal of an induction motor with BRB. It shows that even
   with short-time measurement data, the technique is capable of correctly
   identifying the frequencies of the BRB characteristic components but
   with a low accuracy on the amplitudes and initial phases of those
   components. The SAA is then used to determine their amplitudes and
   initial phases and shows satisfactory results. Finally, experiments on a
   3-kW, 380-V, 50-Hz induction motor are conducted to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the ESPRIT-SAA-based method in detecting BRB with
   short-time measurement data. It proves that the proposed method is a
   promising choice for BRB detection in induction motors operating with
   small slip and fluctuant load.}},

Abstract = {{The public is typically in agreement with the renewable energy targets
   established in many national states and generally supports the idea of
   increased reliance on wind energy. Nevertheless, many specific wind
   power projects face significant local opposition. A key question for the
   wind energy sector is, therefore, how to better engage local people to
   foster support for specific projects. IEA Wind Task 28 on Social
   Acceptance of Wind Energy Projects aims to facilitate wind energy
   development by reviewing current practices, emerging ideas, and
   exchanging successful practices among the participating countries. It
   also aims to disseminate the insights of leading research to a
   nontechnical audience, including project developers, local planning
   officials, and the general public. The interdisciplinary approach
   adopted by Task 28 enables an in-depth understanding of the nature of
   opposition to wind projects and a critical assessment of emerging
   strategies for social acceptance. Task 28 has analyzed a range of key
   issues related to social acceptance of wind energy, including the
   impacts on landscapes and ecosystems, on standard of living and
   well-being, the implementation of energy policy and spatial planning,
   the distribution of costs and benefits, and procedural justice. It is
   clear that although wind energy has many benefits; however, specific
   projects do impact local communities. As such the concerns of the
   affected people have to be taken seriously. Moreover, as opposition is
   rarely without foundation, it is in the interests of developers and
   advocates to engage local people and to improve projects for the benefit
   of all. (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Bioresorbable polymers have been widely investigated as materials
   exhibiting significant potential for successful application in the
   fields of tissue engineering and drug delivery. Further to the ability
   to control degradation, surface engineering of polymers has been
   highlighted as a key method central to their development. Previous work
   has demonstrated the ability of electron beam (e-beam) technology to
   control the degradation profiles and bioresorption of a number of
   commercially relevant bioresorbable polymers (poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA),
   L-lactide/DL-lactide co-polymer (PLDL) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid
   (PLGA)). This work investigates the further potential of e-beam
   technology to impart added biofunctionality through the manipulation of
   polymer (PLLA) surface properties. PLLA samples were subjected to e-beam
   treatments in air, with varying beam energies and doses. Surface
   characterization was then performed using contact angle analysis, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and atomic force
   microscopy. Results demonstrated a significant increase in surface
   wettability post e-beam treatment. In correlation with this, XPS data
   showed the introduction of oxygen-containing functional groups to the
   surface of PLLA. Raman spectroscopy indicated chain scission in the near
   surface region of PLLA (as predicted). However, e-beam effects on
   surface properties were not shown to be dependent on beam energy or
   dose. E-beam irradiation did not seem to affect the surface roughness of
   PLLA as a direct consequence of the treatment. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{The current study investigated the time-averaged velocity and turbulence
   intensity at the initial downstream flow from a six-bladed ship
   propeller. The six-bladed propeller provided the rapid periodical pulses
   of thrust in one revolution due to the blades leading to a complex
   downstream jet. The six-bladed propeller is popular as a boat racing
   propeller, but the presentation of its flow structure was rarely found
   in the previous studies. In this study, the experiments were carried out
   in a water tank to measure the time-averaged velocity and turbulence
   intensity by using a Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) system. The jet was
   produced by rotating the propeller at a constant speed powered by an
   electric motor. The maximum tangential and radial velocities of the
   six-bladed propeller were of 76\% and 17\% of the maximum axial velocity
   respectively. The study found that the six-bladed propeller has a lower
   tangential velocity, but a higher radial velocity with its own diffusing
   mechanism when comparing to the three-bladed propeller. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The mechanical response of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) in
   elongation is strongly dependent on temperature, strain and strain rate.
   Near the glass transition temperature T-g, the stress-strain curve
   presents a strain softening effect vs strain rate but a strain hardening
   effect vs strain under conditions of large deformations. The goal of
   this work is to propose a visco hyperelastic model to predict the PET
   behaviour when subjected to large deformations and to manage the
   identification of the material properties from the experimental data by
   an original method. To represent the non-linear effects, an elastic part
   depending on the elastic equivalent strain and a non-Newtonian viscous
   part depending on both viscous equivalent strain rate and cumulated
   viscous strain are tested. The model parameters can then be accurately
   obtained through a comparison with the experimental uniaxial and biaxial
   tests. The influence of the temperature on the viscous part is also
   modelled and an evaluation of the adiabatic self heating of the specimen
   is compared to experimental results. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The finite element method plays an extremely important role in forging
   process design as it provides a valid means to quantify forging errors
   and thereby govern die shape modification to improve the dimensional
   accuracy of the component. However, this dependency on process
   simulation could raise significant problems and present a major drawback
   if the finite element simulation results were inaccurate. This paper
   presents a novel approach to assess the dimensional accuracy and shape
   quality of aeroengine blades formed from finite element hot-forging
   simulation. The proposed virtual inspection system uses conventional
   algorithms adopted by modern coordinate measurement processes as well as
   the latest free-form surface evaluation techniques to provide a robust
   framework for virtual forging error assessment. Established techniques
   for the physical registration of real components have been adapted to
   localise virtual models in relation to a nominal design model. Blades
   are then automatically analysed using a series of intelligent routines
   to generate measurement data and compute dimensional errors. The results
   of a comparison study indicate that the virtual inspection results and
   actual coordinate measurement data are highly comparable and the
   procedures for registration and virtual inspection are computationally
   efficient, validating the approach as an effective and accurate means to
   quantify forging error in a virtual environment. Consequently, this
   provides adequate justification for the implementation of the virtual
   inspection system in the virtual process design, modelling and
   validation of forged aeroengine blades in industry. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Evidence that a 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexadienide anion is stabilized by
   aromatic ``negative hyperconjugation{''} is described. It complements an
   earlier inference of ``positive{''} hyperconjugative aromaticity for the
   cyclohexadienyl cation. The anion is a reactive intermediate in the
   dehydration of benzene cis-1,2-dihydrodiol to phenol. Rate constants for
   3-substituted benzene cis-dihydrodiols are correlated by values with rho
   = 3.2. Solvent isotope effects for the reactions are k(H2O)/k(D2O) =
   1.2-1.8. These measurements are consistent with reaction via a carbanion
   intermediate or a concerted reaction with a ``carbanion-like{''}
   transition state. These and other experimental results confirm that the
   reaction proceeds by a stepwise mechanism, with a change in
   rate-determining step from proton transfer to the loss of hydroxide ion
   from the intermediate. Hydrogen isotope exchange accompanying
   dehydration of the parent benzene cis-1,2-dihydrodiol was not found, and
   thus, the proton transfer step is subject to internal return. A rate
   constant of similar to 10(11) s(-1), corresponding to rotational
   relaxation of the aqueous solvent, is assigned to loss of hydroxide ion
   from the intermediate. The rate constant for internal return therefore
   falls in the range 10(11)-10(12) s(-1). From these limiting values and
   the measured rate constant for hydroxide-catalyzed dehydration, a pK(a)
   of 30.8 +/- 0.5 was determined for formation of the anion. Although loss
   of hydroxide ion is hugely exothermic, a concerted reaction is not
   enforced by the instability of the intermediate. Stabilization by
   negative hyperconjugation is proposed for 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexadienide
   and similar anions, and this proposal is supported by additional
   experimental evidence and by computational results, including evidence
   for a diatropic ({''}aromatic{''}) ring current in
   3,3-difluorocyclohexadienyl anion.}},

Abstract = {{In order to study ultracold charge-transfer processes in hybrid atom-ion
   traps, we have mapped out the potential-energy curves and molecular
   parameters for several low-lying states of the Rb, Yb+ system. We employ
   both a multireference configuration interaction and a full configuration
   interaction (FCI) approach. Turning points, crossing points, potential
   minima, and spectroscopic molecular constants are obtained for the
   lowest five molecular states. Long-range parameters, including the
   dispersion coefficients, are estimated from our ab initio data. The
   separated-atom ionization potentials and atomic polarizability of the
   ytterbium atom (alpha(d) = 128.4 atomic units) are in good agreement
   with experiment and previous calculations. We present some dynamical
   calculations for (adiabatic) scattering lengths for the two lowest (Yb,
   Rb+) channels that were carried out in our work. However, we find that
   the pseudopotential approximation is rather limited in validity and only
   applies to nK temperatures. The adiabatic scattering lengths for both
   the triplet and singlet channels indicate that both are large and
   negative in the FCI approximation.}},

Abstract = {{Neural network (NN) approaches have been widely applied for modeling and
   identification of nonlinear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   systems. This paper proposes a stochastic analysis of a class of these
   NN algorithms. The class of MIMO systems considered in this paper is
   composed of a set of single-input nonlinearities followed by a linear
   combiner. The NN model consists of a set of single-input memoryless NN
   blocks followed by a linear combiner. A gradient descent algorithm is
   used for the learning process. Here we give analytical expressions for
   the mean squared error (MSE), explore the stationary points of the
   algorithm, evaluate the misadjustment error due to weight fluctuations,
   and derive recursions for the mean weight transient behavior during the
   learning process. The paper shows that in the case of independent
   inputs, the adaptive linear combiner identifies the linear combining
   matrix of the MIMO system (to within a scaling diagonal matrix) and that
   each NN block identifies the corresponding unknown nonlinearity to
   within a scale factor. The paper also investigates the particular case
   of linear identification of the nonlinear MIMO system. It is shown in
   this case that, for independent inputs, the adaptive linear combiner
   identifies a scaled version of the unknown linear combining matrix. The
   paper is supported with computer simulations which confirm the
   theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{New U-Pb and Ar-40-Ar-39 geochronology and structural data from high- to
   medium grade metamorphic shear zones of the Ossa-Morena Zone, and
   structural data from Early Carboniferous basins (Ossa-Morena Zone and
   South-Portuguese Zone), place additional constraints on the Variscan
   tectonics in SW Iberia. A zircon U-Pb age of 465 +/- 14Ma (Middle
   Ordovician) measured on migmatite from the Coimbra-Cordoba shear zone is
   interpreted as the age of protolith crystallization. This age
   determination revises the information contained in the geological map of
   Portugal, in which these rocks were considered to be Proterozoic in age.
   This paper describes the evolution of Variscan wrench tectonics related
   to the development of shear zones, exhumation of deep crustal rocks and
   emplacement of magma in the Ossa-Morena Zone basement. In the
   Coimbra-Cordoba shear zone (transpressional), migmatites were rapidly
   exhumed from a depth of 42.5 km to 16.6km over a period of ca. 10Ma in
   the Visean (ca. 340-330Ma), indicating oblique slip exhumation rates of
   8.5 to 10.6mm/yr (Campo Maior migmatites) and 3.2 mm/yr (Ouguela
   gneisses) respectively. In the Evora Massif, the gneisses of the Boa Fe
   shear zone (transtensional) were exhumed from 18.5 to 7.4 km depth in
   the period ca. 344-334Ma (Visean), with exhumation oblique slip rates of
   2.8 to 4.2 mm/yr. At the same time, the Early Carboniferous basins of SW
   Iberia were filled by turbidites and olistoliths, composed mostly of
   Devonian rocks. The presence of olistoliths indicates significant
   tectonic instability during sedimentation with large-scale mass
   movement, probably in the form of gravity slides. Deformation and
   metamorphism dated at 356 +/- 12 Ma, 321 +/- 13 Ma and 322 +/- 29 Ma
   respectively suggests that Variscan wrench movements were active in SW
   Iberia during the Early Carboniferous for a period of at least 35 Ma.

Abstract = {{Numerous environmental pressures have precipitated long-term population
   reductions of many insect species. Population declines in aerially
   foraging insectivorous birds have also been detected, but the cause
   remains unknown partly because of a dearth of long-term monitoring data
   on avian diets. Chimney swifts (Chaetura pelagica) are a model aerial
   insectivore to fill such information gaps because their roosting
   behaviour makes them easy to sample in large numbers over long time
   periods. We report a 48-year-long (1944-1992) dietary record for the
   chimney swift, determined from a well-preserved deposit of guano and
   egested insect remains in Ontario (Canada). This unique archive of
   palaeo-environmental data reflecting past chimney swift diets revealed a
   steep rise in dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and metabolites,
   which were correlated with a decrease in Coleoptera remains and an
   increase in Hemiptera remains, indicating a significant change in
   chimney swift prey. We argue that DDT applications decimated Coleoptera
   populations and dramatically altered insect community structure by the
   1960s, triggering nutritional consequences for swifts and other aerial
   insectivores.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term performance of embankments with creep susceptible
   geosynthetics as a basal reinforcement layer over rate-sensitive soils
   is examined. Various factors, including reinforcement type and
   stiffness, soil viscosity, construction rate, and allowable long-term
   reinforcement strain, affecting the time-dependent behavior of
   reinforced embankments are investigated. Increasing the reinforcement
   stiffness (for a given allowable strain) allowed construction of higher
   embankments from a stability perspective; however, it also resulted in
   larger deformations and potential serviceability issues. Lateral toe
   spreading, maximum settlement, and differential settlement increased
   with the increasing rate of construction. Reducing the allowable
   long-term reinforcement strain proved to be an effective means of
   limiting embankment deformation. The analyses also showed that if the
   long-term reinforcement strain can be limited to < 5\% and combined with
   the practical rate of construction, the long-term deformations of
   reinforced embankments can be controlled. (c) 2012 American Society of

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The results of load and resistance factor design (LRFD) calibration are
   reported for the pullout limit state in geogrid reinforced soil walls
   under self-weight loading and permanent uniform surcharge. Bias
   statistics are used to account for the prediction accuracy of the
   underlying deterministic models for load and pullout capacity and the
   random variability in the input parameters. The paper shows that the
   current AASHTO simplified method to calculate reinforcement loads under
   operational conditions is overly conservative leading to poor prediction
   accuracy of the underlying deterministic model used in LRFD calibration.
   Refinements to the load and default pullout capacity models in the
   AASHTO and Federal Highway Administration guidance documents are
   proposed. These models generate reasonable resistance factors using a
   load factor of 1.35 and give a consistent probability of pullout failure
   of 1\%. A comparison with the allowable stress design (ASD) past
   practice shows that the operational factors of safety using a
   reliability-based LRFD approach give factors of safety greater than 1.5.
   Regardless of the design approach (ASD or LRFD), the analysis results
   demonstrate that the current empirical minimum reinforcement length
   criteria will likely control the design for pullout. (c) 2012 American

Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{922-933}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The paper reports the results of load and resistance factor design
   (LRFD) calibration for pullout and yield limit states for steel strip
   reinforced soil walls under self-weight loading. An important feature of
   the calibration method is the use of bias statistics to account for
   prediction accuracy of the underlying deterministic models for
   reinforcement load, pullout capacity and yield strength of the steel
   strips, and random variability in input parameters. To improve the
   accuracy of reinforcement load predictions, small adjustments to current
   semiempirical American Association of State Highway and Transportation
   Officials (AASHTO) load design charts are proposed. Similarly, current
   empirical-based design charts found in AASHTO and Federal Highway
   Administration (FHWA) guidance documents for the estimation of the
   pullout resistance factor for smooth and ribbed steel strips are
   adjusted to improve the accuracy of pullout capacity predictions. The
   results of calibration lead to a load factor of 1.35 that is consistent
   with current practice and resistance factors that together give a
   consistent probability of failure of 1\% for all three limit states
   considered. Furthermore, comparison with allowable stress design (ASD)
   past practice (AASHTO simplified method) shows that the operational
   factors of safety using a rigorous LRFD approach give the same or higher
   factors of safety and lower probabilities of failure. In this study,
   data for steel strip reinforced soil walls are used as an example to
   illustrate rigorous reliability theory-based LRFD calibration concepts.
   However, the general approach is applicable to other reinforced soil
   wall technologies and calibration outcomes can be updated as more data
   become available. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000665. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Ill-conditioned multivariable processes exhibit significantly strong
   interactions among system variables and large gain directions from the
   system inputs to the outputs, which makes the identification and control
   a challenging task. The objective of this paper is to develop an order
   estimation algorithm for model identification of ill-conditioned
   processes using subspace methods. In this paper, the order is determined
   from noise-corrupted samples with high accuracy based on the principal
   component analysis (PCA) method. To excite each direction in the
   ill-conditioned process, test signals are designed carefully based on
   the system characteristics. Using the PCA modeling, the model prediction
   error is first reconstructed, and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
   is then used to examine the modeling error bound and thus to determine
   the process order. A new weighted direction variable is proposed to
   strengthen the interactions along the small gain directions, thus
   improving the identifiability and accuracy of the ill-conditioned model.
   The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by an application
   study on a high purity distillation column process under noise
   conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the mechanisms involved in dissolved oxygen (DO)
   transfer from a turbulent flow to an underlying organic sediment bed
   populated with DO-absorbing bacteria. Our numerical study relies on a
   previously developed and tested computational tool that couples a
   bio-geochemical model for the sediment layer and large-eddy simulation
   for transport on the water side. Simulations have been carried out in an
   open channel configuration for different Reynolds numbers (Re-tau =
   180-1000), Schmidt numbers (Sc = 400-1000), and bacterial populations
   (chi{*} = 100-700 mg l(-1)). We show that the average oxygen flux across
   the sediment-water interface (SWI) changes with Re-tau and Sc, in good
   agreement with classic heat-and-mass-transfer parametrizations. Time
   correlations at the SWI show that intermittent peaks in the wall-shear
   stress initiate the mass transfer and modulate its distribution in space
   and time. The diffusive sublayer acts as a de-noising filter with
   respect to the overlying turbulence; the instantaneous mass flux is not
   affected by low-amplitude background fluctuations in the wall-shear
   stress but, on the other hand, it is receptive to energetic and coherent
   near-wall transport events, in agreement with the surface renewal
   theory. The three transport processes involved in DO depletion
   (turbulent transport, molecular transport across the diffusive sublayer,
   and absorption in the organic sediment layer) exhibit distinct temporal
   and spatial scales. The rapidly evolving near-wall high-speed streaks
   transport patches of fluid to the edge of the diffusive sublayer,
   leaving slowly regenerating elongated patches of positive DO
   concentration fluctuations and mass flux at the SWI. The sediment
   surface retains the signature of the overlying turbulent transport over
   long time scales, allowed by the slow bacterial absorption. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Fusion process is known to be the initial step of viral infection and
   hence targeting the entry process is a promising strategy to design
   antiviral therapy. The self-inhibitory peptides derived from the
   enveloped (E) proteins function to inhibit the proteinprotein
   interactions in the membrane fusion step mediated by the viral E
   protein. Thus, they have the potential to be developed into effective
   antiviral therapy. Herein, we have developed a Monte Carlo-based
   computational method with the aim to identify and optimize potential
   peptide hits from the E proteins. The stability of the peptides, which
   indicates their potential to bind in situ to the E proteins, was
   evaluated by two different scoring functions, dipolar distance-scaled,
   finite, ideal-gas reference state and residue-specific all-atom
   probability discriminatory function. The method was applied to a-helical
   Class I HIV-1 gp41, beta-sheet Class II Dengue virus (DENV) type 2 E
   proteins, as well as Class III Herpes Simplex virus-1 (HSV-1)
   glycoprotein, a E protein with a mixture of a-helix and beta-sheet
   structural fold. The peptide hits identified are in line with the
   druggable regions where the self-inhibitory peptide inhibitors for the
   three classes of viral fusion proteins were derived. Several novel
   peptides were identified from either the hydrophobic regions or the
   functionally important regions on Class II DENV-2 E protein and Class
   III HSV-1 gB. They have potential to disrupt the proteinprotein
   interaction in the fusion process and may serve as starting points for
   the development of novel inhibitors for viral E proteins. Proteins 2012;

Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{341}},
Pages = {{255-267}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The effects of planar defects and composition on Ar mobility in
   trioctahedral micas have been investigated in samples from a small
   marble outcrop (similar to 500 m(2)) in the Frontenac Terrane, Grenville
   Province, Ontario. These micas crystallized during amphibolite-facies
   metamorphism at similar to 1170 Ma and experienced a thermal pulse
   similar to 100 Ma later at shallow crustal levels associated with the
   emplacement of plutons. Rb-87/Sr-86 ages of the phlogopites range from
   similar to 950 to similar to 1050 Ma, consistent with resetting during
   the later thermal event. The same phlogopites however, give Ar-40/Ar-39
   ages between 950 and 1160 Ma, spanning the age range of the two thermal
   events. This result is intriguing because these micas have undergone the
   same thermal history and were not deformed after peak metamorphic
   conditions. In order to understand this phenomenon, the chemical,
   crystallographical, and microstructural nature of four mica samples has
   been characterized in detail using a wide range of analytical
   techniques. The scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron microprobe
   (EMP), and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
   (LA-ICP-MS) data show that the micas are chemically homogeneous (with
   the exception of Ba) and similar in composition. The Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy and Mossbauer results show that the M sites for
   three of the micas are dominated by divalent cations and the Fe3+/(Fe2+
   + Fe3+) ratio for all four phlogopites ranges from 0.10 to 0.25. The
   stable-isotopic data for calcite indicate that this outcrop was not
   affected by hydrothermal fluids after peak metamorphism. No correlation
   between chemical composition and Rb-87/Sr-86 and Ar-40/Ar-39 age or
   between crystal size and Ar-40/Ar-39 age is observed. The only major
   difference among all of the micas was revealed through transmitted
   electron microscope (TEM), which shows that the older 1M micas contain
   significantly more layer stacking defects, associated with
   crystallization, than the younger micas. We propose that these defect
   structures, which are enclosed entirely within the mineral grain may
   serve as Ar traps and effectively increase the Ar retentivity of the
   mineral. As this phenomenon has not been previously documented in micas,
   this may have significant implications for the interpretation of
   Ar-40/Ar-39 ages of minerals which have similar defect structures. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{76-84}},
Month = {{AUG-SEP}},
Abstract = {{The Paleoproterozoic Thelon Basin is located in the Churchill Province
   of the Canadian Shield, Nunavut, Canada, and is host to economic
   unconformity-type uranium mineralization (the Kiggavik deposit) and has
   the potential to host other deposits. The Thelon Formation sandstones
   and conglomerates and the Pitz Formation sandstones from the Garry Lake
   area contain phosphates, illite, minor chlorite and quartz as cements.
   The matrix phosphates are fluorapatite with U concentrations up to 103.5
   ppm in the Thelon Formation rocks and up to 991 ppm in the Pitz
   Formation rocks. Lead isotope ratios and associated trace element
   concentrations extracted from sandstones and conglomerates by partial
   leaching with 2\% nitric acid show that rocks with phosphates in the
   matrix have radiogenic Pb-206/Pb-24 ratios as well as high U, Pb, Th, Ca
   and P concentrations. Some radiogenic Pb is interpreted to be produced
   in situ by breakdown of fluorapatites. However, a (206)pb/(204)pb vs.
   U-238/Pb-206 diagram indicates that in some samples there is an excess
   of Pb-206 that could not have been produced by the amount of U in the
   sample and that must have been derived from an extraneous U-rich source
   and then introduced into the rock by later fluids. The Pb- Pb model for
   leachates gives an age of ca. 1593 Ma, which is younger than the age of
   the detrital and early diagenetic phosphates and is close to the age of
   the phosphate cements from the Garry lake area of 1558 Ma. This suggests
   that there was later remobilization and migration of uranium-bearing
   fluids when the aquifers were open to diagenetic fluids, which could
   have resulted in formation of a deposit in the north-eastern part of the
   Thelon Basin. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The coencapsulation of growth factor-loaded microspheres with
   adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) within a hydrogel matrix was studied
   as a potential means to enhance ASC chondrogenesis in the development of
   a cell-based therapeutic strategy for the regeneration of partial
   thickness chondral defects. A photopolymerizable N-rnethacrylate glycol
   chitosan (MGC) was employed to form an in situ gel used to encapsulate
   microspheres loaded with bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP-6) and
   transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGF-beta 3) with human ASCs. ASC
   viability and retention were enhanced when the Young's modulus of the
   MGC ranged between 225 and 380 kPa. Grafting an RGD-containing peptide
   onto the MGC backbone (RGD-MGC) improved ASC viability within the gels,
   remaining at greater than 90\% over 14 days in culture. The effects of
   BMP-6 and TGF-beta 3 released from the polymer microspheres on ASC
   chondrogenesis were assessed, and the level of differentiation was
   compared to ASCs in control gels containing nongrowth factor-loaded
   microspheres cultured with and without the growth factors supplied in
   the medium. There was enhanced expression of chondrogenic markers at
   earlier time points when the ASCs were induced with the sustained and
   local release of BMP-6 and TGF-beta 3 from the microspheres. More
   specifically, the normalized glycosaminoglycan and collagen type II
   protein expression levels were significantly higher than in the
   controls. In addition, the ratio of collagen type II to type I was
   significantly higher in the microsphere delivery group and increased
   over time End point RT-PCR analysis supported that there was a more
   rapid induction and enhancement of ASC chondrogenesis in the controlled
   release group. Interestingly, in all of the assays, there was evidence
   of chondrogenic differentiation when the ASCs were cultured in the gels
   in the absence of growth factor stimulation. Overall, the co-delivery of
   growth-factor-loaded microspheres and ASCs in RGD-modified MGC gels
   successfully induced ASC chondrogenesis and is a promising strategy for
   cartilage repair.}},

   the plug flow situation, where the predictions according to the original

   factor at Fourier numbers above 0.1. The developed expressions in the

Abstract = {{Skidding, which occurs in rolling element bearings during shaft
   rotational acceleration, causes wear and incipient failure. This paper
   presents an analytical model to investigate skidding during rolling
   element bearing acceleration, taking account of the contact force and
   friction force between the rolling elements and the races and the cage,
   gravity, and the centrifugal force of the rolling elements. The Hertzian
   contact theory is applied to calculate the non-linear contact force. The
   Coulomb friction law is used to calculate the friction force. All forces
   above are included in force equilibrium equations to derive the
   non-linear governing equations of the bearing during acceleration, and
   are solved using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm with fixed time
   step. The proposed model is verified by comparison to other published
   results and with experimental results. The proposed model can be used to
   investigate skidding in rolling element bearings during acceleration and
   the transient motion behavior of rolling elements, and it will lay the
   theoretical foundations for eliminating skidding in rolling element
   bearings.}},

Abstract = {{The James Clerk Maxwell Telescope Nearby Galaxies Legacy Survey (NGLS)
   comprises an H?i-selected sample of 155 galaxies spanning all
   morphological types with distances less than 25?Mpc. We describe the
   scientific goals of the survey, the sample selection and the observing
   strategy. We also present an atlas and analysis of the CO J=3 - 2 maps
   for the 47 galaxies in the NGLS which are also part of the Spitzer
   Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey. We find a wide range of molecular gas
   mass fractions in the galaxies in this sample and explore the
   correlation of the far-infrared luminosity, which traces star formation,
   with the CO luminosity, which traces the molecular gas mass. By
   comparing the NGLS data with merging galaxies at low and high redshift,
   which have also been observed in the CO J=3 - 2 line, we show that the
   correlation of far-infrared and CO luminosity shows a significant trend
   with luminosity. This trend is consistent with a molecular gas depletion
   time which is more than an order of magnitude faster in the merger
   galaxies than in nearby normal galaxies. We also find a strong
   correlation of the LFIR/LCO(3-2) ratio with the atomic-to-molecular gas
   mass ratio. This correlation suggests that some of the far-infrared
   emission originates from dust associated with atomic gas and that its
   contribution is particularly important in galaxies where most of the gas
   is in the atomic phase.}},

Title = {{The mechanical effect of the existing cement mantle on the in-cement
   femoral revision}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cement-in-cement revision hip arthroplasty is an
   increasingly popular technique to replace a loose femoral stem which
   retains much of the original cement mantle. However, some concern exists
   regarding the retention of the existing fatigued and aged cement in such
   cement-in-cement revisions. This study investigates whether leaving an
   existing fatigued and aged cement mantle degrades the mechanical
   performance of a cement-in-cement revision construct.
   Methods: Primary cement mantles were formed by cementing a polished stem
   into sections of tubular steel. If in the test group, the mantle
   underwent conditioning in saline to simulate ageing and was subject to a
   fatigue of 1 million cycles. If in the control group no such
   conditioning or fatigue was carried out. The cement-in-cement procedure
   was then undertaken. Both groups underwent a fatigue of 1 million cycles
   subsequent to the revision procedure.
   Findings: Application of a Mann-Whitney test on the recorded subsidence
   (means: 0.51, 0.46, n = 10 + 10, P = 0.496) and inducible displacement
   (means: 038, 0.36, P = 0.96) revealed that there was no statistical
   difference between the groups.
   Interpretation: This study represents further biomechanical
   investigation of the mechanical behaviour of cement-in-cement revision
   constructs. Results suggest that pre-revision fatigue and ageing of the
   cement may not be deleterious to the mechanical performance of the
   revision construct. Thus, this study provides biomechanical evidence to
   back-up recent successes with this useful revision technique. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper reports an experimental investigation of the vortical
   structures in the pharynx/larynx region of an idealised human
   extra-thoracic airway obtained using particle image velocimetry (PIV).
   The inlet velocity was 0.13 m/s yielding a Reynolds number, based on the
   inlet condition, of 670. Two thousand images were acquired at each
   location at a framing rate of 2 Hz. The proper orthogonal decomposition
   method was applied to the PIV data. Only a few modes were used for POD
   reconstruction which recovered about 60 \% of the turbulent kinetic
   energy. A vortex identification algorithm was employed to identify and
   measure properties of the structures. This step was followed by a
   statistical analysis of the distribution of number, size, and strength
   of these vortices. The results reveal the formation of a large number of
   structures identified along two planes in the pharynx/larynx region.
   This study also revealed an increased strength in the counter-clockwise
   structures as compared to clockwise structures in the pharynx region. As
   well, there is some evidence to suggest that the vortical structures,
   whose axes are perpendicular to the sagittal plane, change their
   orientation as they proceed further into the laryngeal region.}},

Abstract = {{Chert and iron formation from the Ferriman Group (ca. 1.88 Ga), Labrador
   Trough, Canada, contain an exceptional assemblage of fossil bacteria and
   biofilms preserved within a well-defined stratigraphic framework.
   Lithofacies associations suggest that microbes were restricted to
   suboxic, shallow-water environments through three sea-level cycles.
   Microfossils are preserved as chert or sedimentary apatite (francolite)
   in hematite-rich, peritidal facies. Nearshore evaporation and Fe-redox
   pumping of silica drove rapid penecontemporaneous silicification of
   microbial mats. In some communities, breakdown of organic matter and
   Fe-redox pumping of pore water phosphate caused their syndepositional
   phosphatization. Preservation of bacteria was precluded in deeper
   settings because these processes could not operate at an anoxic
   seafloor.
   Filamentous forms dominate microbial morphologies. Secondary electron
   imaging of freshly broken surfaces shows filaments that are similar in
   size and shape to modern bacteria; filaments vary from 0.5 and 1 mu m
   wide and reach tens of mu m in length. They commonly envelop chert and
   iron oxide grains, which stabilized the seafloor and contributed to
   firmground development. The filamentous morphology, similar mat-forming
   behavior, and suboxic paleoenvironments where these fossils lived are
   consistent to those of modern Fe-oxidizing bacteria and some
   cyanobacteria. Associated organic matter with low delta C-13 values is
   also present. Most values vary between ca. -38 and -20 parts per
   thousand, which is consistent with isotopic fractionation by such
   bacteria. Unlike modern settings, however, their distribution was
   restricted to shallow marine and peritidal environments where
   photosynthetically produced oxygen oases likely impinged on the
   seafloor. Although Fe-oxidizing bacteria were possibly important in
   forming some iron formation facies in the Ferriman Group, physiochemical
   precipitation of Fe-(oxyhydr)oxides caused by photosynthetic oxygen was
   also probably widespread in the photic zone across the shelf. This study
   demonstrates that a combined microanalytical, sedimentologic, and
   stratigraphic analysis of fossil bacteria not only yields a more
   detailed picture of the Precambrian biosphere, but also highlights the
   importance of taphonomy in the search for early life. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Regional shortening followed by channel flow induced collapse: A new

Abstract = {{The lateral flow and extrusive exhumation of ductile migmatitic gneisses
   due to a horizontal gradient in lithostatic pressure, a process termed
   ``channel flow{''} or ``lateral protrusion{''}, has previously been
   proposed as an important tectonic process in large hot orogens.
   Centrifuge simulation of (i) layer-parallel shortening followed by (ii)
   collapse of a cover sequence during ductile flow of underlying layers in
   an analogous manner to channel flow suggests a new mechanism for the
   development of structures within Neoarchaean granite-greenstone
   terrains. The centrifuge model incorporates an upper package of
   silicone-modelling clay microlaminates that simulate a greenstone
   sequence that overlies slightly less dense ductile silicone putties,
   whose rheological properties simulate migmatitic felsic gneiss. A low
   viscosity, low-density layer along half of the
   infrastructure-superstructure interface simulates the presence of
   granitoid melt. During initial layer-parallel shortening upright folds
   form in the upper ``greenstone{''} package and the interface with
   underlying ductile layers is folded. In basal silicone layers, recumbent
   to overturned non-cylindrical and upright folds form with increasing
   distance from the moving end wall. Removal of material parallel to fold
   hinges at the `foreland' end of the model (i.e. furthest from the ram
   used to shorten models) in several stages simulates erosion and the
   difference in gravitational loading thus created induces ductile flow
   and lateral extrusion of basal silicone layers. Models aim to reproduce
   features comparable to those developed during extrusive channel flow and
   focused exhumation of basement migmatitic gneiss in nature. Early-formed
   recumbent to inclined folds are then accentuated during simulated
   channel flow. while new recumbent isoclinal folds in basal layers
   develop. Broad antiforms and tight synforms similar to the ``dome and
   keel{''} geometry that typifies many Archaean granite-greenstone belts
   are produced as a late feature in the model. Channel flow and collapse
   of a fold-thickened crust is therefore proposed as a potential
   alternative mechanism for the formation of structures in some
   Neoarchaean granite-greenstone terrains. By analogy with other physical
   and numerical models, channel flow in the Neoarchaean may be enhanced by
   impingement of an upper mantle wedge into the base of the crust. Our
   results imply that both lithospheric shortening and non-diapiric
   gravitational instabilities may be responsible for the formation of some
   Archaean ``dome and keel{''} structures and may account for the
   juxtaposition of some granite-greenstone and high-grade gneiss terrains
   in the Archaean. Model results also show similarities to structures
   produced during lateral flow and withdrawal of salt in fold belts. (C)

Abstract = {{We introduce a new survey to map the radio continuum halos of a sample
   of 35 edge-on spiral galaxies at 1.5 GHz and 6 GHz in all polarization
   products. The survey is exploiting the new wide bandwidth capabilities
   of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (i.e., the Expanded Very Large
   Array) in a variety of array configurations (B, C, and D) in order to
   compile the most comprehensive data set yet obtained for the study of
   radio halo properties. This is the first survey of radio halos to
   include all polarization products. In this first paper, we outline the
   scientific motivation of the survey, the specific science goals, and the
   expected improvements in noise levels and spatial coverage from the
   survey. Our goals include investigating the physical conditions and
   origin of halos, characterizing cosmic-ray transport and wind speed,
   measuring Faraday rotation and mapping the magnetic field, probing the
   in-disk and extraplanar far-infrared-radio continuum relation, and
   reconciling non-thermal radio emission with high-energy gamma-ray
   models. The sample size allows us to search for correlations between
   radio halos and other properties, including environment, star formation
   rate, and the presence of active galactic nuclei. In a companion paper
   (Paper II) we outline the data reduction steps and present the first
   results of the survey for the galaxy, NGC 4631.}},

   RESULTS ON NGC 4631}},

Abstract = {{We present the first results from the Continuum Halos in Nearby
   Galaxies-an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES), a new survey of 35 edge-on galaxies
   to search for both in-disk and extraplanar radio continuum emission.
   CHANG-ES is exploiting the new wide-band, multi-channel capabilities of
   the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (i.e., the Expanded Very Large Array
   or EVLA) with observations in two bands centered at 1.5 and 6 GHz in a
   variety of array configurations with full polarization. The motivation
   and science case for the survey are presented in a companion paper
   (Paper I). These first results are based on C-array test observations in
   both observing bands of the well-known radio halo galaxy, NGC 4631. In
   this paper, we outline the observations and the data reduction steps
   that are required for wide-band calibration and mapping of EVLA data,
   including polarization. With modest on-source observing times (30
   minutes at 1.5 GHz and 75 minutes at 6 GHz for the test data), we have
   achieved best rms noise levels of 22 and 3.5 mu Jy beam(-1) at 1.5 GHz
   and 6 GHz, respectively. New disk-halo features have been detected,
   among them two at 1.5 GHz that appear as loops in projection. We present
   the first 1.5 GHz spectral index map of NGC 4631 to be formed from a
   single wide-band observation in a single array configuration. This map
   represents tangent slopes to the intensities within the band centered at
   1.5 GHz, rather than fits across widely separated frequencies as has
   been done in the past and is also the highest spatial resolution
   spectral index map yet presented for this galaxy. The average spectral
   index in the disk is (alpha) over bar (1.5GHz) = -0.84 +/- 0.05
   indicating that the emission is largely non-thermal, but a small global
   thermal contribution is sufficient to explain a positive curvature term
   in the spectral index over the band. Two specific star-forming regions
   have spectral indices that are consistent with thermal emission.
   Polarization results (uncorrected for internal Faraday rotation) are
   consistent with previous observations and also reveal some new features.
   On broad scales, we find strong support for the notion that magnetic
   fields constrain the X-ray-emitting hot gas.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model to predict biologically induced clogging of municipal
   solid waste leachate collection systems is described. The model
   simulates the accumulation of clog mass in the porous media by the
   growth of biomass and precipitation of minerals. In addition, the
   settling and deposition of suspended particles is modelled. A technique
   for modelling filter-separator layers between the waste and the coarse
   granular drainage material is described. The application of the model is
   illustrated for two series of laboratory mesocosm experiments: one where
   the waste was in direct contact with the underlying drainage layer and
   the second where there was a granular filter between the waste and the
   coarse gravel drainage layer. The modelling shows that the clogging of
   the gravel in the lower regions of the saturated drainage layer is
   estimated better by the advanced numerical model than the previously
   published model. In both cases, the calculated results are in
   encouraging agreement with the observed behaviour. It is concluded that
   this model has potential for use in modelling biologically induced
   clogging of municipal landfill leachate collection systems.}},

Abstract = {{An existing elastoviscoplastic constitutive model is modified using
   concepts of the state-dependent fluidity parameters and the damage law,
   to incorporate the effect of soil structure and its destructuration. The
   model is employed to simulate the performance of a well-documented case
   study of the reinforced test embankment constructed over a sensitive
   Champlain clay deposit at Saint Alban, Quebec. The finite element
   calculations, using both the original (nonstructured) and modified
   (structured) elastoviscoplastic soil models, are compared with the
   observed field data from a test embankment brought to failure. The
   results from the structured elastoviscoplastic soil model show better
   agreements with the field data when compared with those analyzed using
   the nonstructured elastoviscoplastic soil model. The modified model
   captures many features of the reinforced embankment behaviour, such as
   vertical settlement, excess pore-water pressure responses, and
   reinforcement force. However, they also reveal the fact that another
   important characteristic of the natural clay deposit - anisotropy -
   needs to be considered to provide an adequate prediction of horizontal
   deformations. The role of geosynthetic reinforcement and its viscosity
   on short-term responses of the reinforced embankment examined in this
   study is also discussed}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Two-phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs) employ an
   immiscible phase to partition toxic substrates/products to/away from
   cells to reduce cytotoxicity and improve bioprocess performance.
   Initially, immiscible organic solvents were used as the sequestering
   phase, and their selection included consideration of solutesolvent
   affinity, which can be predicted through first principles consideration
   of solute activity and phase equilibrium thermodynamics. Polymers can
   replace organic solvents in such systems, however, their selection has
   largely been via heuristic means, and a more fundamental approach is
   necessary for future success in rational polymer identification.
   RESULTS: Material properties (polymer crystallinity, solubility
   parameter, and glass transition temperature Tg) were examined across
   several polymers and polyaromatic hydrocarbons as target solutes. All
   were shown to influence solutepolymer affinity. CONCLUSION: This first
   attempt at identifying physical/chemical properties that affect
   solutepolymer partitioning has been able to demonstrate some clear
   trends, and has allowed us to formulate a polymer selection guide, based
   on first principles, to facilitate the selection of solutepolymer pairs
   for solidliquid TPPB applications. Copyright (C) 2012 Society of

Abstract = {{This work presents experimental determinations of oxide phase
   stabilities in the MgCl2-MgO-H2O system. Magnesium hydroxychlorides are
   compounds with the overall stoichiometry xMgO center dot yMgCl(2)center
   dot zH(2)O, which form from the reaction of MgO with MgCl2 brines. They
   have historically been of importance as the components of Sorel cements;
   they also have a central role in proposed flowsheets for chloride
   leaching of laterite nickel ores (among others) and treatment of waste
   liquors from carnallite processing. A phase diagram of the MgCl2-MgO-H2O
   system is presented, incorporating both this investigation's results and
   the values from the literature. Thermochemical values of the 2-form and
   3-form hydroxychlorides are estimated from the phase diagram. In
   addition, a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrograph of the
   hydroxychloride precipitate is presented.
   The highlights of this article are as follows:
   Precipitates of stoichiometry xMgO center dot yMgCl(2)center dot zH(2)O
   were obtained by adding MgO to MgCl2 solutions.
   An equilibrium phase diagram for oxide species in magnesium chloride
   solutions is presented.
   Standard entropy and enthalpy of formation values have been estimated
   for 2-form and 3-form hydroxychlorides, 3MgO center dot MgCl2 center dot
   11H(2)O and 2MgO center dot MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O.
   One application includes recovering the chloride units from
   spent-solution brines as hydroxychloride precipitates. These can then be
   thermally decomposed to produce HCl.}},

Abstract = {{Melt temperature is one of the key variables in polymer extrusion which
   determines process thermal stability and hence melt quality. Therefore,
   melt temperature is commonly measured in polymer processing and
   point/bulk melt temperature measurement methods are widely used in the
   present industry. Some thermal profile measurement methods have also
   been attempted in research. This study presents a review of melt
   temperature measurements in polymer extrusion in research and industry,
   and describes the results of an experimental evaluation carried out to
   explore the performance of five melt temperature measurement techniques.
   In addition, an investigation was carried out on the fully developed
   melt temperature profile of a cylindrical rod die. Moreover, the
   existing challenges and possible future applications for extrusion
   thermal monitoring are discussed. The results confirmed that melt
   temperature varied significantly at different radial locations within
   the die. Point/bulk melt temperature measurements were found to provide
   relatively limited information on process thermal quality close to the
   die wall. Hence, information provided by these sensors is less
   representative of actual thermal conditions as they are unable to
   capture thermal information from the whole melt flow cross-section.
   Therefore, the importance of the development of industrially compatible
   thermal profile measurement techniques is emphasised. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The use of polymers for in situ removal of ethanol, an inhibitory
   fermentation product, was investigated. Results from capacity
   experiments with six amorphous polymers showed that nylon 6,6 had the
   greatest capacity for ethanol, 0.123 g ethanol/g polymer. The
   Flory-Huggins solubility parameter for this polymer most closely matched
   that of ethanol and provided an initial indication that rational polymer
   selection based on the Flory-Huggins theory, which describes
   polymer-solute interactions, can be used to predict potential absorptive
   polymers for the uptake of target molecules. A hard, crystalline
   polymeric resin with surface-adsorptive properties, DOWEX Optipore L493,
   was found to have a higher ethanol capacity, 0.346 g ethanol/g polymer.
   Batch fermentations of a glucose medium using Saccharomyces cerevisiae
   were conducted in both the presence and absence of the polymeric
   adsorbent, DOWEX Optipore L493. Although the addition of the resin had a
   positive effect on reducing the aqueous ethanol concentration via in
   situ ethanol removal, its presence in the medium, perhaps due to
   abrasive effects on the cells, diminished this positive performance. (c)

Abstract = {{Black silica-and sulfate-bearing rock coatings in the Greater Sudbury
   area, Canada provide a record of atmospheric processes and emitted
   particulate matter associated with historical smelting operations in
   this area. Coating samples collected over the Greater Sudbury region are
   characterized with scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe
   analysis, laser ablation inductively coupled mass-spectrometry, S-stable
   isotope measurements and micro X-ray fluorescence. On the micrometer
   scale, Cu, Pb, As, Se and S occur in close association within
   metal-sulfate rich layers composed of Fe-and Cu-sulfates. The
   concentrations of these and other elements do not represent their
   chemical proportions in the smelter plumes due to
   dissolution-precipitation processes, element substitutions and the
   stability of various phases involved in the coating formation. On the
   regional scale, the atomic ratios of Pb:Ni, As:Ni and Se:Ni decrease in
   the coatings with increasing distance from the smelting centers. This
   observation is consistent with higher wet deposition rates of small
   diameter Pb, As and Se-bearing primary sulfate aerosols (<2.5 mu m),
   compared to larger diameter (>2.5 mu m) Ni-bearing particulate matter.
   The mixing of primary (higher delta S-34 values) and secondary (lower
   delta S-34 values) sulfates explains the delta S-34 values of sulfates
   within the coatings close to smelting centers and the decrease in these
   values is attributed to the decrease in the ratio of primary to
   secondary sulfates with distance from the smelting centers. The
   information preserved in mineral surface-coatings together with an
   understanding of stoichiometry, geochemical processes and former
   environmental conditions provide a valuable record of atmospheric
   compositions, mixing, scavenging, deposition rates and oxidation
   processes, and the nature and source of anthropogenic releases to the
   atmosphere. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the utility of N-15 and O-18 isotope abundance analyses to
   identify nitrate sources: A soil zone study}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{N-15 and O-18 isotope abundance analyses in nitrate (NO3-) (expressed as
   delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- values respectively) have often been
   used in research to help identify NO3- sources in rural groundwater.
   However, questions have been raised over the limitations as overlaps in
   6 values may occur between N source types early in the leaching process.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of using stable
   isotopes for nitrate source tracking through the determination of delta
   N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- in the unsaturated zone from varying N
   source types (artificial fertiliser, dairy wastewater and cow slurry)
   and rates with contrasting isotopic compositions. Despite NOT
   concentrations being often elevated, soil water nitrate poorly mirrored
   the N-15 content of applied N and therefore, delta N-15-NO3- values were
   of limited assistance in clearly associating nitrate leaching with N
   inputs. Results suggest that the mineralisation and the nitrification of
   soil organic N, stimulated by previous and current intensive management,
   masked the cause of leaching from the isotopic prospective. delta
   O-18-NO3- was of little use, as most values were close to or within the
   range expected for nitrification regardless of the treatment, which was
   attributed to the remineralisation of nitrate assimilated by bacteria
   (mineralisation immobilisation turnover or MIT) or plants. Only in
   limited circumstances (low fertiliser application rate in tillage) could
   direct leaching of synthetic nitrate fertiliser be identified (delta
   N-15-NO3- < 0 parts per thousand and delta O-18-NO3- > 15 parts per
   thousand). Nevertheless, some useful differences emerged between
   treatments. delta N-15-NO3- values were lower where artificial
   fertiliser was applied compared with the unfertilised controls and
   organic waste treatments. Importantly, delta N-15-NO3- and delta
   O-18-NO3- variables were negatively correlated in the artificial
   fertiliser treatment (0.001 <= p <= 0.05, attributed to the varying
   proportion of fertiliser-derived and synthetic nitrate being leached)
   while positively correlated in the dairy wastewater plots ( p <= 0.01,
   attributed to limited denitrification). These results suggest that it
   may be possible to distinguish some nitrate sources if analysing
   correlations between 6 variables from the unsaturated zone. In
   grassland, the above correlations were related to N input rates, which
   partly controlled nitrate concentrations in the artificial fertiliser
   plots (high inputs translated into higher NO concentrations with an
   increasing proportion of fertiliser-derived and synthetic nitrate) and
   denitrification in the dairy wastewater plots (high inputs corresponded
   to more denitrification). As a consequence, nitrate source
   identification in grassland was more efficient at higher input rates due
   to differences in 6 values widening between treatments. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We present a detailed derivation of a multisite mean-field theory
   (MSMFT) used to describe the Mott-insulator to superfluid transition of
   bosonic atoms in optical lattices. The approach is based on partitioning
   the lattice into small clusters which are decoupled by means of a
   mean-field approximation. This approximation invokes local superfluid
   order parameters defined for each of the boundary sites of the cluster.
   The resulting MSMFT grand potential has a nontrivial topology as a
   function of the various order parameters. An understanding of this
   topology provides two different criteria for the determination of the
   Mott insulator superfluid phase boundaries. We apply this formalism to
   d-dimensional hypercubic lattices in one, two, and three dimensions and
   demonstrate the improvement in the estimation of the phase boundaries
   when MSMFT is utilized for increasingly larger clusters, with the best
   quantitative agreement found for d = 3. The MSMFT is then used to
   examine a linear dimer chain in which the onsite energies within the
   dimer have an energy separation of Lambda. This system has a complicated
   phase diagram within the parameter space of the model, with many
   distinct Mott phases separated by superfluid regions.}},

   and a liposome composed of a synthesized lipid,
   1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine (EPC), and either
   1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) or cholesterol as
   co-lipid, exhibited plasmid DNA binding and protection from DNase I
   degradation, and concentration dependent cytotoxicity using Chinese
   hamster ovary-K1 cells. The transfection efficiency of formulations with
   cholesterol outperformed those with DOPE, and in many cases the

Abstract = {{In this article, we present an efficient method for isolating cellulose
   nanofibers from para rubberwood sawdust with a combination of chemical,
   mechanical, and ultrasonic treatments. The effects of the alkali
   concentration and treatment pathway on the cellulose structure and
   properties are discussed. The reinforcing efficiency of the resulting
   fibers on poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) composites was characterized. Field
   emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy
   results revealed a well-organized network of the nanofibers with
   diameters in the range 2080 nm and lengths of micrometer-scale
   dimensions. Fibers with a high crystallinity of 83\% having a cellulose
   I structure were prepared by an isolation process involving a mild
   alkali solution and delignification before acid hydrolysis. Clear
   composite films with significant improvements in their modulus (by
   100\%) and strength (by 80\%) were obtained by the addition of 7 wt \%
   fiber. Strong interaction between the fibers and PVA was evident from
   dynamic mechanical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. (c)

Abstract = {{When using alternating current submerged arc welding to produce pipes
   from microalloyed linepipe steel strip, it is necessary to balance
   penetration depth and deposition rates in order to minimise the number
   of weld passes while still maintaining good heat affected zone
   properties. A series of bead on plate submerged arc welds were performed
   on X70 steel, varying either traditional variables (i.e. current,
   voltage, travel speed and polarity) or waveform variables (i.e. balance,
   offset and frequency). Cross-section profile areas were measured,
   penetration profile shape {[}i.e. the semipenetration (SP) ratio] was
   calculated and hardness and Charpy V notch (CVN) impact testing were
   performed. By using a 3.2 mm welding wire with a constant current mode,
   increased current resulted in greater wire feed speeds (WFS), while WFS
   was reduced by increasing voltage or decreasing travel speed. Increased
   balance reduced WFS and increased weld penetration, while offset and
   frequency did not appear to significantly affect WFS or bead profile.
   Waveform variables did not have significant effects on Vickers hardness
   traverses. Preliminary CVN testing showed that using 30 Hz frequency
   resulted in lower fracture energies, and using 75\% balance resulted in
   greater energies. Improved CVN results were achieved when welds were
   produced with lower heat input and greater SP ratio values.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the impact of a grid-connected large
   photovoltaic (PV) power generation station on the power system
   small-signal stability. The focus of discussion in the paper is the
   damping of local-mode power system oscillations. Hence, a simple
   single-machine infinite-bus power system with the grid-connected PV
   generation station is used. Firstly, a comprehensive model of the
   single-machine infinite-bus power system integrated with the PV
   generation station is established. Then the conventional technique of
   the damping torque analysis is employed to examine the effect of the PV
   generation on the damping of power system local-mode oscillations.
   Analysis in the paper reveals that there exists a critical operating
   condition when the damping torque contribution from the PV station to
   the electromechanical oscillation loop of conventional generator changes
   sign. Hence, the small-signal stability of the power system can be
   affected negatively by the PV penetration when it operates beyond the
   critical operating condition. In the paper, an example power system is
   presented. The results of numerical computation and non-linear
   simulation demonstrate and confirm all the analytical conclusions
   obtained. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In vascular tissue, elastin is an essential extracellular matrix protein
   that plays an important biomechanical and biological signalling role.
   Native elastin is insoluble and is difficult to extract from tissues,
   which results in its relatively rare use for the fabrication of vascular
   tissue engineering scaffolds. Recombinant elastin-like polypeptide-4
   (ELP4), which mimics the structure and function of native tropoelastin,
   represents a practical alternative to the native elastic fibre for
   vascular applications. In this study, electrospinning was utilized to
   fabricate fibrous scaffolds which were subsequently surface modified
   with ELP4 and used as substrates for smooth muscle cell culture. ELP4
   surface modified materials demonstrated enhanced smooth muscle cell
   (SMC) adhesion and maintenance of cell numbers over a 1-week period
   relative to controls. SMCs seeded on the ELP4 surface modified materials
   were also shown to exhibit the cell morphology and biological markers of
   a contractile phenotype including a spindle-like morphology, actin
   filament organization and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain expression.
   Competitive inhibition experiments demonstrated that the elastin-laminin
   cell surface receptor and its affinity for the VGVAPG peptide sequence
   on ELP4 molecules are likely involved in the initial SMC contact with
   the ELP4 modified materials. Elastin-like polypeptides show promise as
   surface modifiers for candidate scaffolds for engineering contractile
   vascular tissues. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In the present study use of solar-assisted buoyancy-driven natural
   ventilation in a simple atrium building is explored numerically with
   particular emphasis on the thermal comfort conditions in the building.
   Initially various geometric configurations of the atrium space were
   considered in order to investigate airflows and temperature
   distributions in the building using a validated computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) model. The Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS)
   modelling approach with the SST-k-omega turbulence model and the
   Discrete Transfer Radiation Model (DTRM) was used for the
   investigations. The steady-state governing equations were solved using a
   commercial CFD solver FLUENT (c). From the numerical results obtained,
   it was noted that an atrium space integrated with a solar chimney would
   be a relatively better option to be used in an atrium building. In the
   geometry selected, the performance of the building in response to
   various changes in design parameters was investigated. The produced
   airflows and temperature distributions were then used to evaluate indoor
   thermal comfort conditions in terms of the thermal comfort indices, i.e.
   the well-known predicted mean vote (PMV) index, its modifications
   especially for natural ventilation, predicted percent dissatisfied (PPD)
   index and Percent dissatisfied (PD) factor due to draft. It was found
   that the thermal conditions in the occupied areas of the building
   developed as a result of the use of solar-assisted buoyancy-driven
   ventilation for the particular values of the design parameters selected
   are mostly in the comfortable zone. Finally, it is demonstrated that the
   proposed methodology leads to reliable thermal comfort predictions,
   while the effect of various design variables on the performance of the
   building is easily recognized. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Low molecular weight poly(5-ethylene ketal
   epsilon-caprolactone-co-D,L-lactide) (PEKCDLLA) is being considered as a
   viscous liquid, injectable depot for localized drug delivery. This
   polymer degrades in vitro via surface erosion, which is potentially
   advantageous for the proposed application. However, the in vivo
   degradation rate and mechanism, and tissue response, to polymers based
   on 5-ethylene ketal epsilon-caprolactone have not yet been reported. The
   purpose of this study was to measure the in vivo weight loss and change
   in polymer properties and assess the tissue response to PEKCDLLA after
   subcutaneous injection in rats. The tissue response was assessed
   histologically using Masson's trichrome staining and
   immunohistochemically by staining for CD68 positive cells. The polymer
   lost weight with time in a nearly linear fashion but did not exhibit
   significant changes in number average molecular weight, polydispersity
   index, and glass transition temperature or monomer ratio, consistent
   with a surface erosion process. The tissue response to the polymer was
   moderate and comparable to that reported in the literature for other
   degradable polymers used in clinical applications. These findings
   indicate that PEKCDLLA is a promising candidate for injectable drug
   delivery.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with the problem of detecting distributed targets in
   the presence of homogeneous and partially homogeneous Gaussian
   disturbance with unknown covariance matrix. The proposed detectors
   improve the adaptive beamformer orthogonal rejection test (ABORT) idea
   to address detection of distributed targets, which makes it possible to
   decide whether some observations contain a useful target or a signal
   belonging to the orthogonal complement of the useful subspace. At the
   design stage, the authors resort to either the plain generalised
   likelihood ratio test (GLRT) or ad hoc design procedures. Remarkably,
   the considered criteria lead to receivers ensuring the constant false
   alarm rate (CFAR) property with respect to the unknown quantities.
   Moreover, authors' derivations show that the ad hoc detector for a
   partially homogeneous environment coincides with the generalised
   adaptive subspace detector. The performance assessment conducted by
   Monte Carlo simulation has confirmed the effectiveness of the newly
   proposed detection algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The bioeconomy, and in particular, biorefining and bioenergy production,
   have received considerable attention in recent years as a shift to
   renewable bioresources to produce similar energy and chemicals derived
   from fossil energy sources, represents a more sustainable path. Membrane
   technologies have been shown to play a key role in process
   intensification and products recovery and purification in biorefining
   and bioenergy production processes. Among the various separation
   technologies used, membrane technologies provide excellent fractionation
   and separation capabilities, low chemical consumption, and reduced
   energy requirements. This article presents a state-of-the-art review on
   membrane technologies related to various processes of biorefining and
   bioenergy production, including: (i) separation and purification of
   individual molecules from biomass, (ii) removal of fermentation
   inhibitors, (iii) enzyme recovery from hydrolysis processes, (iv)
   membrane bioreactors for bioenergy and chemical production, such as
   bioethanol, biogas and acetic acid, (v) bioethanol dehydration, (vi)
   bin-oil and biodiesel production, and (vii) algae harvesting. The
   advantages and limitations of membrane technologies for these
   applications are discussed and new membrane-based integrated processes
   are proposed. Finally, challenges and opportunities of membrane
   technologies for biorefining and bioenergy production in the coming
   years are addressed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   vector control that is commonly used for the mitigation of the current

   robust solution that can track an unknown time-varying number of
   multiple targets, while keeping continuous tracks even in scenarios with
   large number of false contacts per ping, a particle filter (PF)-based
   technique is proposed in this paper. The PF is a nonlinear filtering
   technique that can accommodate arbitrary sensor characteristics, motion
   dynamics, and noise distributions. An enhanced version of the PF called
   the mixture PF is utilized in this paper. While the sampling/importance
   resampling PF samples from the prior importance density and weights the
   particles according to the observation likelihood, the mixture PF
   samples from both importance densities and weights the different groups
   of particles respectively. The usage of this mixture of importance
   densities provides better performance and faster convergence to the true
   targets locations. In order to track an unknown time-varying number of
   targets, two mixture PFs are used (one for target detection and the
   other for tracking multiple targets), and a density-based clustering
   technique. The first filter starts with random uniformly distributed
   samples over the surveillance area and resets every five pings. Just
   before the reset, the clustering technique runs to detect the clusters
   that corresponds to different targets and passes them to the second
   filter. The performance of the proposed technique is examined and
   demonstrated by different simulated scenarios and some real datasets
   from the SEABAR07 trial by the NATO Underwater Research Center.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents experimental and numerical results of
   intermediate-scale and full-scale fire tests conducted on flexurally
   strengthened reinforced concrete members. Two full-scale reinforced
   concrete T-beams and two intermediate-scale slabs were strengthened in

   insulated with a layer of spray-on material. T-beams and slabs were then
   exposed to a standard fire. T-beams were loaded to their service load.
   Deflections and temperatures were measured during the tests. A numerical
   finite-difference/volume heat transfer model was used to simulate the
   temperature field inside the section. The validity of the numerical
   model was verified by comparing the predicted temperatures with those
   recorded during the fire test. Fire test results show that fire

Abstract = {{The effect of tide-induced water table fluctuations on the sorption of
   naphthalene in beach aquifers is investigated. In particular, the cases
   of equilibrium and rate-limited sorption of naphthalene to aquifer
   solids are studied by examining the partition coefficient and rate of
   mass transfer from mobile to immobile regions. Results showed that the
   tidal effect on contaminant concentrations was not only dependent on the
   spill location but also on the partition coefficient and the rate of
   mass transfer. A difference of 13\% of the initial spilled concentration
   was observed between the transient-and steady-head boundaries when the
   sorption partition coefficient between the contaminant and the sorbent
   was small (1 x 10(-4) m(3)/kg). However, when the partition coefficient
   increased to 5 x 10(-3) m(3)/kg, these differences became negligible.
   This suggests that for contaminants with higher hydrophobicity, a steady
   head may be used to simulate a seaward boundary, thereby reducing the
   extensive computations associated with the transient-head boundary.
   Likewise, small rates of mass transfer from mobile to immobile regions
   have produced different plume sizes in cases of transient-and
   steady-head boundaries. These differences in plume size disappeared upon
   an increase in mass transfer rate.}},

Journal = {{CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{782-795}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The development of progressive failure in sensitive clay slopes is
   analysed using principles from fracture mechanics, where failure stress
   depends on a material property (toughness) and length of an existing
   weakness, unlike traditional soil mechanics where failure stress is
   generally assumed to be only a function of material strength. An
   existing weakness, or partially developed failure surface, can propagate
   due to sudden loads, as might be induced by seasonal erosion cycles,
   small local landslides at a river bank or earthquake shaking. The paper
   examines the growth of the failure surface over time due to such loads.
   The analysis shows that a large landslide in sensitive clay can occur
   after a number of seasonal erosion cycles with no obvious trigger. It
   also shows that a larger load due to either a small landslide or
   earthquake can cause a developing failure surface to propagate freely
   toward general collapse. Large landslides in sensitive clay are often
   preceded by a smaller landslide at the river bank, but can be triggered
   by large earthquakes or may occur for no obvious reason. The agreement
   between predictions and real behaviour suggests that the model for
   progressive failure of large landslides in sensitive clay deserves
   further consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Recently a number of robotic intervention systems for magnetic resonance
   image (MRI)-guided needle placement in the prostate have been reported.
   In MRI-guided needle interventions, after a needle is inserted, the
   needle position is often confirmed with a volumetric MRI scan. Commonly
   used titanium needles are not directly visible in an MRI, but they
   generate a susceptibility artifact in the immediate neighborhood of the
   needle. This paper reports the results of a quantitative study of the
   relationship between the true position of titanium biopsy needle and the
   corresponding needle artifact position in MRI, thereby providing a
   better understanding of the influence of needle artifact on targeting
   errors. The titanium needle tip artifact extended 9 mm beyond the actual
   needle tip location with tendency to bend toward the scanner's B-0
   magnetic field direction, and axially displaced 0.38 and 0.32 mm (mean)
   in scanner's frequency and phase encoding direction, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In the High Arctic, groundwater fluxes are limited by the presence of
   continuous permafrost, although it has been hypothesized that there may
   be localized groundwater flow and hydraulic connectivity beneath large
   lakes, due to the presence of taliks, or large regions of unfrozen
   ground. However, due to the logistical difficulty of employing seepage
   meters and piezometers in deep, ice-covered lakes, relatively little is
   known about groundwater discharge to polar lakes. One method of
   assessing groundwater discharge is through the use of geochemical
   tracers. We conducted a pilot study to quantify groundwater discharge
   into a High Arctic lake using dissolved radon gas as a geochemical
   tracer. Lake water was collected in 15 L polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags
   with minimal atmospheric interaction from a 25-m deep lake near
   Shellabear Point, Melville Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. Sample
   bags were aerated through a closed water loop for 60 min to allow
   sufficient radon to equilibrate in a coupled air circuit. Radon in air
   concentrations were measured on a Durridge RAD7 portable alpha
   spectrometer. The field trial in a remote setting and separate tests
   with groundwater samples collected from a temperate site demonstrate the
   utility of the methodology. The limited results suggest that radon
   levels in the lower water column are elevated above background levels
   following nival melt in the surrounding watershed. Although these
   results are insufficient to quantify groundwater discharge, the results
   suggest subsurface flow may exist, and further study is warranted.}},

   reveal that the impact energy of the half-size samples greatly increased

Abstract = {{International standards for testing soft magnetic materials require that
   the magnetic flux density remain sinusoidal with respect to time.
   Traditionally, this has been achieved via control of the magnetic flux
   using either analog feedback, which provides real-time control, or
   iterative digital feedback, which yields more accurate solutions with
   the cost of increased convergence time. In certain applications, such as
   magnetic nondestructive testing, rapid convergence of multiple
   interacting flux controlled channels is required. In this paper, a
   multichannel flux controller design is presented that combines the
   real-time performance of analog feedback with an iterative digital
   feedback algorithm to reduce error. The system demonstrates a 95\%
   reduction in convergence time at power line frequencies over a
   comparable system using only digital feedback. Several examples of the
   system's ability to control arbitrary periodic waveforms are presented
   over the frequency range from 0.735 Hz to 100 Hz. Sinusoidal form factor
   errors are shown to be < 0.1\% from 2 Hz to 100 Hz across four strongly
   coupled channels with highly nonlinear magnetizing conditions. A
   detailed description of both analog circuit and digital algorithms is
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of through-wall bolts is examined for strengthening
   T-joints of rectangular hollow steel sections. This is accomplished by
   controlling the web outward budding of the chord under the brace axial
   load. The study examined the effect of the number and pattern of bolts,
   as well as the web height-to-wall thickness (h/t) ratio of the chord, on
   strengthening effectiveness. Rectangular 203 x 76 x (3.09, 4.5, and
   5.92) mm chord members were tested. The number of 8 mm diameter steel
   bolts varied from a single bolt to 15 bolts of various distributions.
   Holes were first drilled in the vertical walls of the chord member, and
   then bolts were inserted through one wall and anchored at the other
   wall. The joint strength increased by 29\% for chords with (h/t) of 65.
   As (h/t) ratio reduced to 45 and 35, the gains were only 6.2\% and
   3.1\%, respectively. The number and distribution of bolts had little
   effect on their effectiveness. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Fibre reinforced polymers (FRPs) have demonstrated good performance in
   retrofitting deteriorated reinforced concrete structures. However, there
   remains a paucity of information on the performance of available FRP
   strengthening systems at elevated temperatures, and the perceived
   susceptibility of these systems to fire continues to discourage their
   use in some applications. To begin to address this issue for the
   specific case of strengthening rectangular concrete columns with FRP
   wraps, an experimental and analytical study has been performed. An
   objective of the study is to develop validated computational models that
   can be used to perform parametric analyses and suggest design guidelines
   for these types of structural members. This paper presents the
   development and partial verification of a computational model that can
   simulate the structural behaviour of a short or slender, concentrically
   or eccentrically loaded, unwrapped or FRP wrapped column under both
   ambient and fire conditions. Results of initial analytical studies,
   including validation of the model using test data available in the

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new resonant (R) controller. The proposed R
   controller is input-output equivalent to the conventional R controller
   but it is internally nonlinear. Its internal state variables are the
   transformed versions of the conventional R controller into the polar
   coordinates. It is, thus, given the name of polar form resonant (PFR)
   controller. While the PFR is totally equivalent to the R controller in
   continuous-time domain, it offers a much higher structural robustness
   when it comes to digital implementations. Particularly, it is shown in
   this paper that the PFR resolves the well-known structural sensitivity
   of the R controller for applications that need high sampling frequency
   and have word length limitations. Such a structural sensitivity is
   conventionally resolved by resorting to the delta-domain realizations.
   The PFR offers an alternative method to the delta-domain realization
   technique with even higher degree of robustness and easier stage of
   adjustment. Moreover, the PFR can easily be enhanced to accommodate
   frequency variations, a feature that is not easily attainable using the
   delta-domain method. Feasibility of the PFR controller is verified using
   a laboratory prototype of a single-phase uninterruptible power supply
   system operating at high sampling and switching frequencies where the
   control system is implemented on a field programmable gate array board.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental values for the carbon dioxide solubility in eight pure
   electrolyte solvents for lithium ion batteries - such as ethylene
   carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC),
   ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC),
   gamma-butyrolactone (gamma BL), ethyl acetate (EA) and methyl propionate
   (MP) - are reported as a function of temperature from (283 to 353) K and
   atmospheric pressure. Based on experimental solubility data, the Henry's
   law constant of the carbon dioxide in these solvents was then deduced
   and compared with reported values from the literature, as well as with
   those predicted by using COSMO-RS methodology within COSMOthermX
   software and those calculated by the Peng-Robinson equation of state
   implemented into Aspen plus. From this work, it appears that the CO2
   solubility is higher in linear carbonates (such as DMC, EMC, DEC) than
   in cyclic ones (EC, PC, gamma BL). Furthermore, the highest CO2
   solubility was obtained in MP and EA solvents, which are comparable to
   the solubility values reported in classical ionic liquids. The precision
   and accuracy of the experimental values, considered as the per cent of
   the relative average absolute deviations of the Henry's law constants
   from appropriate smoothing equations and from literature values, are
   close to (1\% and 15\%), respectively. From the variation of the Henry's
   law constants with temperature, the partial molar thermodynamic
   functions of dissolution such as the standard Gibbs free energy, the
   enthalpy, and the entropy are calculated, as well as the mixing enthalpy
   of the solvent with CO2 in its hypothetical liquid state. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Characterization of laser light reflection during the laser transmission
   welding (LTW)(3) of thermoplastics is especially important for
   applications in which non-zero laser incidence angles are used. At
   higher laser incidence angles, reflection increases and has the
   potential to burn surrounding features of the part to be welded. This
   study presents and validates a technique for laser reflection
   measurement. Reflected energy is absorbed by a black plastic plate
   (containing carbon black, which is the absorber of the reflected
   energy). The surface temperature of the plate is measured by an infrared
   (IR) camera. The distribution of reflected power required to generate
   this temperature profile is estimated using a simple heat transfer
   model. The technique was validated by irradiating the black plate by the
   laser directly, while observing the time-varying temperature
   distribution of the plate by the IR camera. In this case, good agreement
   was observed between the estimated total power and the actual laser
   input power. Good agreement also existed between the estimated power
   distribution and that determined experimentally via a knife edge based
   beam profiling technique. The thermal imaging technique was subsequently
   used to measure the magnitude and distribution of laser light reflection

Abstract = {{Laser light reflection during the laser transmission welding (LTW) of
   thermoplastics has the potential to overheat and/or cause unintentional
   welding of adjacent features of the part being welded. For this reason,
   and in order to assess how much light is being absorbed by the
   transparent part (after measurement of the light transmitted through the
   transparent part), it is important to be able to quantify the magnitude
   and distribution of reflected light. The magnitude and distribution of
   the reflected light depends on the total laser input power as well as
   its distribution, the laser incidence angle (angle between the normal to
   the transparent part surface and the laser beam), the laser light
   polarization as well as the surface and optical properties of the
   transparent part. A novel technique based on thermal imaging of the
   reflected light was previously developed by the authors. It is used in
   this study to characterize the magnitude and distribution of reflected
   light from thermoplastics as a function of thickness (1-3.1 mm), laser
   incidence angle (20-40 degrees) and surface roughness (0.04-1.04 mu m).
   Results from reflection tests on nearly polished nylon 6 (surface
   roughness between 0.04 and 0.05 mu m) have shown that, for the various
   thicknesses tested (1-3.1 mm), the total reflection was larger than the
   specular top surface reflection predicted via the Fresnel relation. From
   these observations, it is conjectured that, in addition to top surface
   reflection, the bulk and/or bottom surface also contribute to the total
   reflection. The results also showed that reflection decreased slightly
   with increasing thickness. As expected, for the p-polarized light used
   in this study, the reflection decreased with increasing angle of
   incidence for the range of angles studied. It was also found that when
   the surface roughness was close to zero and when it was close to the
   wavelength of the input laser beam (i.e. 940 nm), the reflectance values
   were close and reached a minimum between these two roughness values. (C)

   contamination at a site located on the summit of Resolution Island,
   Nunavut, just southeast of Baffin Island at 61 degrees 35'N and 60
   degrees 40'W. The site was part of a North American military defense
   system established in the 1950s that became heavily contaminated with
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) during and subsequent to, its
   operational years. Each of the three barrier designs has a different
   configuration, to meet the needs of the targeted remediation area, based
   on their unique contaminant histories. Modifications were made to the
   barrier designs based on both field observations and laboratory results.
   The comparison of field and laboratory results indicated that areas with
   higher concentrations of PCB contamination behaved differently than
   areas with lower concentrations of PCB contaminated soil. Previous
   laboratory studies only partially replicated field observations and
   results. It had previously been hypothesized that particle retention was
   the most important factor in trapping and capturing PCBs. However,
   rinsed filter samples from the field indicated that partitioning of PCBs
   between contaminated soil and granular activated carbon (GAC) filter
   particles were occurring at levels of 62 +/- 11\%, suggesting that
   sequestration of the PCBs from the environment should be a primary focus
   of the barrier. This sequestration requires both particle retention
   (within the granular sorptive filters) as well as maintained contact
   time between particles for sorption processes to proceed. This mechanism
   partitioning of PCB to GAC - was more important in areas with higher PCB
   concentration. These results suggest that it may be possible to tailor
   future barrier designs to their unique site histories and locations. (c)

Abstract = {{By depositing ceria over supported precious metal (PM) catalysts and
   characterizing them with in situ diffuse reflectance UV (DR UV) and in
   situ Raman spectroscopy, we have been able to prove a direct correlation
   between a decrease in ceria band gap and the work function of the metal
   under reducing conditions. The PM ceria interaction results in changes
   on the ceria side of the metal ceria interface, such that the degree of
   oxygen vacancy formation on the ceria surface also correlates with the
   precious metal work function. Nevertheless, conclusive evidence for a
   purely electronic interaction could not be provided by X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. On the contrary, the results
   highlight the complexity of the PM ceria interaction by supporting a
   spillover mechanism resulting from the electronic interaction under
   reducing conditions. Under oxidizing conditions, another effect has been
   observed; namely, a structural modification of ceria induced by the
   presence of PM cations. In particular, we have been able to demonstrate
   by in situ Raman spectroscopy that, depending on the PM ionic radius, it
   is possible to create PM ceria solid solutions. We observed that this
   structural modification prevails under an oxidizing atmosphere, whereas
   electronic and chemical interactions take place under reducing
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, living radical polymerization (LRP) has
   revolutionized academic research in the fields of free-radical
   polymerization and materials design. Sophisticated macromolecular
   architectures, designed for a variety of applications and end-use
   properties, can now be synthesized using relatively simple LRP
   chemistries that do not require stringent oxygen or moisture free
   environments, subzero reaction temperatures, or highly purified
   reagents. Publications abound not only in the fundamentals of LRP but
   also its use in designing tailor-made polymers and polymer hybrid
   composites. Corporate research organizations have also been actively
   involved in LRP, with numerous patents being issued annually. Despite
   the intense research interest, however, comparatively few products have
   been commercialized, with high process costs being a primary factor.
   Most commercial free-radical polymerizations are conducted in aqueous
   dispersions due to significantly lower process costs compared to bulk or
   solution polymerizations. Successful widespread commercialization of LRP
   will be advantaged by the development of waterborne processes yielding
   aqueous dispersions of nanoparticles. Conducting LRP within
   nanoparticles (i.e., using nanoscale particles as self-contained
   chemical reactors or ``nanoreactors{''}) enables faster reaction times
   and if harnessed properly will provide better control over the polymer
   livingness; it also has the potential in the control of the particle
   mesostructure and microstructure. Recent progress in LRP dispersions is
   presented with a discussion of outstanding issues and challenges as well
   as the outlook for adoption of LRP dispersions by industry.}},

Title = {{Prolonged carbonate diagenesis under an evolving late cenozoic climate;
   Nullarbor Plain, southern Australia}},
Journal = {{SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{261}},
Pages = {{33-49}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{The Nullarbor Plain in southern Australia, the largest areal karst on
   the globe, is a similar to 240,000 km(2) uplifted succession of Cenozoic
   marine carbonates whose surface has been exposed for 14 to 15 my. The
   middle Miocene Nullarbor Limestone forms the upper surface of the plain
   and hosts a complex and prolonged record of meteoric diagenesis. Such a
   complete record offers unique insights into the effects of climate,
   tectonics, sea level, topography, and hydrology on the style and
   placement of numerous diagenetic events in flat low lying carbonate
   plains. Alteration took place during three broad phases comprising eight
   stages that are interpreted to have formed against a background of
   dramatic climate change. Middle Miocene phase one diagenesis took place
   under a humid climate and resulted in rapid mineral equilibration,
   calcite cementation, extensive karst development, and finally widespread
   lacustrine and palustrine sedimentation. Resultant palustrine sediments,
   especially terrestrial ooids, are now preserved at the surface and in
   underlying karst cavities. Latest middle Miocene to middle Pliocene
   phase two diagenesis occurred during a prolonged period (similar to 8
   m.y.) of temperate climate and resulted in initial deep cave dissolution
   during low sea levels and later shallow cave development in the course
   of a high sea level. Onset of a somewhat more arid climate in the latest
   Pliocene led to the development of the modem desolate landscape of the
   Plain. This final phase of diagenesis involved creation of solution pits
   filled with black limestone pebbles, open and closed dolines with
   associated colluvium fill, and pervasive pedogenic calcrete. The
   Nullarbor Plain demonstrates that low lying carbonate plains can have
   low surficial erosion rates, precisely record relative sea level
   positions, be able to have extensive caves with extended periods of
   arrested calcite precipitation, and finally host extensive terrestrial
   ooid deposits. The importance of this comprehensive paragenetic record
   is its applicability to not only recognize unconformities in the rock
   record but to better appreciate the climate in which they formed. (C)

Abstract = {{Self-monitoring aligned MWCNT loaded PET composites, with different CNT
   content, were prepared via twin-screw extrusion starting from a

   electrical resistance as a function of stress. Moreover, the insertion
   of MWCNTs resulted in mechanical reinforcement with respect to neat PET.
   It was found that both self-monitoring behavior and mechanical
   performance are directly related to MWCNT content and to the direction
   of applied stress with respect to CNT orientation. In particular, too
   high MWCNT content decreased sensitivity at low strain, whereas a
   minimum MWCNT content was required to insure ohmic conductivity. (C)

Title = {{Large-eddy simulation of oxygen transfer to organic sediment beds}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{We have developed a model for dissolved oxygen (DO) transfer from water
   to underlying organic sediment beds. The model couples large-eddy
   simulation (LES) of turbulent transport in the water column, a
   biogeochemical model for DO transport and consumption in the sediment,
   and Darcy's Law for the pore water-driven transport. The model
   highlights the spatial and temporal relationship between the turbulent
   bursting events, the near-wall transport of DO, and the response of the
   sediment layer. The numerical results-compared to data from laboratory
   experiments-stress the importance of analyzing instantaneous transport
   events (not reproducible in a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model) to
   better characterize and model the processes that lead to oxygen
   depletion in the sediment layer. The model's results are compared
   against experimental data and the sensitivity to the governing
   parameters has been tested. As the current velocity increases, the
   sediment-oxygen demand (SOD) increases more slowly than the friction
   velocity at the wall, in accordance with classic heat-and-mass transfer
   laws. The overall SOD is approximately proportional to the bacterial
   content of the sediment layer. The predicted mean advective flux in the
   porous medium and across the sediment-water interface is negligible
   compared to the total dispersive flux, for permeabilities typical of the
   sediments used in the experiments (10(-7) and 10(-6) cm(2)). Higher
   permeabilities (10(-5) cm(2)) appear to yield results not consistent
   with experimental data. This computational tool will contribute toward
   the design of a process-oriented parametrization for the SOD, currently
   missing in oceanographic applications, that can be easily extended to
   the transport of other bio-limiting substances.}},

Abstract = {{Both uranous and uranyl minerals are present in the Centennial
   unconformity-type U deposit situated in the SW Athabasca Basin, Canada.
   At least two generations of uraninite are present (disseminated and
   massive), often strongly altered to coffinite, followed by minor fibrous
   coffinite forming in veins. Uranyl minerals, mostly uranophane with
   minor haiweeite precipitating in veins and in hand sample-scaled
   breccias, are present in significant amounts (ca. 5\% of the ore) not
   observed elsewhere in the Athabasca Basin. The multi-stage evolution of
   the Centennial deposit is explained by the existence of high
   permeability conduits, promoting the recurrent circulation of P-rich
   fluids that remobilized U locally. Stable isotopes composition of
   uranophane (delta D of ca. -130 parts per thousand and delta O-18 of ca.
   6 parts per thousand) suggests that recent oxidizing meteoric fluids
   penetrated to the unconformity (at a depth of ca. 800 m) via the major
   Dufferin lake fault.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we provide an account of the property-led boom and bust
   which has brought Ireland to the point of bankruptcy. Our account
   details the pivotal role which neoliberal policy played in guiding the
   course of the country's recent history, but also heightens awareness of
   the how the Irish case might, in turn, instruct and illuminate mappings
   and explanations of neoliberalism's concrete histories and geographies.
   To this end, we begin by scrutinising the terms and conditions under
   which the Irish state might usefully be regarded as neoliberal.
   Attention is then given to uncovering the causes of the Irish property
   bubble, the housing oversupply it created, and the proposed solution to
   this oversupply. In the conclusion we draw attention to the
   contributions which our case study might make to the wider literature of
   critical human geographies of neoliberalism, forwarding three concepts
   which emerge from the Irish story which may have wider resonance, and
   might constitute a useful fleshing out of theoretical framings of
   concrete and particular neoliberalisms: path amplification,
   neoliberalism's topologies and topographies, and accumulation by
   repossession.}},

Abstract = {{The advantage of using an available and abundant residual biomass, such
   as lignin, as a raw material for activated carbons is that it provides
   additional economical interest to the technical studies. In the current
   investigation, a more complete understanding of adsorption of Cr(VI)
   from aqueous systems onto H3PO4-acid activated lignin has been achieved
   via microcolumns, which were operated under various process conditions.
   The practice of using microcolumn is appropriate for defining the
   adsorption parameters and for screening a large number of potential
   adsorbents. The effects of solution pH (2-8), initial metal ion
   concentration (0.483-1.981 mmol.L-1), flow rate (1.0-3.1 cm(3).min(-1)),
   ionic strength (0.01-0.30 mmol.L-1) and adsorbent mass (0.11-0.465 g) on
   Cr(VI) adsorption were studied by assessing the microcolumn breakthrough
   curve. The microcolumn data were fitted by the Thomas model, the
   modified Dose model and the BDST model. As expected, the adsorption
   capacity increased with initial Cr(VI) concentration. High linear flow
   rates, pH values and ionic strength led to early breakthrough of Cr(VI).
   The model constants obtained in this study can be used for the design of
   pilot scale adsorption process.}},

Abstract = {{High surface area activated carbons were produced by thermal activation

   than a commercially available carbon, while the larger size dye, AY117,
   showed little adsorption. The experimental data were analyzed using

Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This work is concerned with the investigation of the concentration
   fields in an electrokinetic micromixer and its optimization in order to
   achieve high mixing rates. The mixing concept is based on the
   combination of an alternating electrical excitation applied to a
   pressure-driven base flow in a meandering microchannel geometry. The
   electrical excitation induces a secondary electrokinetic velocity
   component, which results in a complex flow field within the meander
   bends. A mathematical model describing the physicochemical phenomena
   present within the micromixer is implemented in an in-house
   finite-element-method code. We first perform simulations comparable to
   experiments concerned with the investigation of the flow field in the
   bends. The comparison of the complex flow topology found in simulation
   and experiment reveals excellent agreement. Hence, the validated model
   and numerical schemes are employed for a numerical optimization of the
   micromixer performance. In detail, we optimize the secondary
   electrokinetic flow by finding the best electrical excitation
   parameters, i.e., frequency and amplitude, for a given waveform. Two
   optimized electrical excitations featuring a discrete and a continuous
   waveform are discussed with respect to characteristic time scales of our
   mixing problem. The results demonstrate that the micromixer is able to
   achieve high mixing degrees very rapidly. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Activity and selectivity are both important issues in heterogeneous
   catalysis and recent experimental results have shown that Ni catalysts
   doped by gold exhibit high activity for the hydrogenation of acetylene
   with good selectivity of ethylene formation. To unravel the underlying
   mechanism for this observation, the general trend of activity and
   selectivity of Ni surfaces doped by Au, Ag, and Cu has been investigated
   using density functional theory calculations. Complete energy profiles
   from C2H2 to C2H4 on Ni(111), Au/Ni(111), Ag/Ni(111) and Cu/Ni(111) are
   obtained and their turnover frequencies (TOFs) are computed. The results
   show that acetylene adsorption on Ni catalyst is strong which leads to
   the low activity while the doping of Au, Ag, and Cu on the Ni catalyst
   weakens the acetylene adsorption, giving rise to the increase of
   activity. The selectivity of ethylene formation is also quantified by
   using the energy difference between the hydrogenation barriers and the
   absolute value of the adsorption energies of ethylene. It is found that
   the selectivity of ethylene formation increases by doping Au and Ag,
   while those of Cu/Ni and Ni are similar.}},

   detected a small amount of residual organic solvent in a starch-peptide
   conjugate solution containing only 40 mu g/mL of peptide. UVRR
   spectroscopy was then used to characterize a protein, TGF-beta 3,
   adsorbed onto solid granules of TCP at 50 and 250 mu g/cm(3). This study
   shows that UVRR is suitable to characterize the protein formulations in
   a broad range of concentrations, in liquid, aggregated, and solid
   states. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) are commonly used as hydraulic barriers,
   owing to their low hydraulic conductivity and their ability to form a
   composite barrier system with geomembranes. The GCL is manufactured and
   placed at a low initial moisture content, and must hydrate in the field
   in order to function as an effective barrier. With the overlying
   geomembrane limiting infiltration from above, moisture must come from
   the underlying foundation soil. In this paper, numerical simulations are
   completed to calibrate models for GCL hydration followed by a
   sensitivity analysis on the underlying soil properties and moisture
   content. The results show that the driving factor used to predict the
   GCL hydration level is the suction value provided by the underlying
   soil. The GCL requires such a small quantity of moisture relative to the
   amount in the soil that the suction within the soil at the beginning and
   end of models is relatively constant. The time rate of GCL hydration was
   found to be mainly a function of the unsaturated properties of the GCL.
   A methodology is developed to predict the final GCL moisture content and
   time rate of hydration.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time estimates of environment dynamics play an important role in
   the design of controllers for stable interaction between robotic
   manipulators and unknown environments. The Hunt-Crossley (HC) dynamic
   contact model has been shown to be more consistent with the physics of
   contact, compared with the classical linear models, such as Kelvin-Voigt
   (KV). This paper experimentally evaluates the author's previously
   proposed single-stage identification method for real-time parameter
   estimation of HC nonlinear dynamic models. Experiments are performed on
   various dynamically distinct objects, including an elastic rubber ball,
   a piece of sponge, a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) phantom, and a PVC phantom
   with a hard inclusion. A set of mild conditions for guaranteed unbiased
   estimation of the proposed method is discussed and experimentally
   evaluated. Furthermore, this paper rigorously evaluates the performance
   of the proposed single-stage method and compares it with those of a
   double-stage method for the HC model and a recursive least squares
   method for the KV model and its variations in terms of convergence rate,
   the sensitivity to parameter initialization, and the sensitivity to the
   changes in environment dynamic properties.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents numerical modeling of the flexural behaviour of
   sandwich panels composed of {[}0/90] woven glass fibre reinforced
   polymer skins and polyurethane foam core, including various patterns of
   glass fibre reinforced polymer ribs, as well as cores of different
   densities. A robust finite element model has been developed. It accounts
   for material nonlinearities; most pronounced in soft cores and {[}0/90]
   glass fibre reinforced polymer ribs in shear, as well as geometric
   nonlinearities arising in panels without ribs, in the form of a
   reduction in panel thickness and excessive shear deformation. The model
   captures both material failures and stability failure, essentially skin
   wrinkling in compression. The model is successfully validated using a
   large experimental database and predicts well full flexural responses.
   It is shown that ribs allow compression skin to reach its full material
   strength. Panels without ribs fail by skin wrinkling under concentrated
   loads, while those under distributed loads fail either by excessive
   shear deformation or diagonal fracture of the core, depending on core
   density. Failure of glass fibre reinforced polymer tension skin never
   occurred in this study. For panels without ribs, the three-dimensional
   finite element model agrees closely with a simplified two-dimensional
   model. A parametric study addressing longitudinal rib spacing showed
   that flexural strength increases as rib spacing reduces, until it
   stabilizes at a rib spacing-to-panel thickness ratio of 2.93.}},

Title = {{Measuring the blame of each formula for inconsistent prioritized

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LOGIC AND COMPUTATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{481-516}},

Abstract = {{It is increasingly recognized that identifying the degree of blame or
   responsibility of each formula for inconsistency of a knowledge base
   (i.e. a set of formulas) is useful for making rational decisions to
   resolve inconsistency in that knowledge base. Most current techniques
   for measuring the blame of each formula with regard to an inconsistent
   knowledge base focus on classical knowledge bases only. Proposals for
   measuring the blames of formulas with regard to an inconsistent
   prioritized knowledge base have not yet been given much consideration.
   However, the notion of priority is important in inconsistency-tolerant
   reasoning. This article investigates this issue and presents a family of
   measurements for the degree of blame of each formula in an inconsistent
   prioritized knowledge base by using the minimal inconsistent subsets of
   that knowledge base. First of all, we present a set of intuitive
   postulates as general criteria to characterize rational measurements for
   the blames of formulas of an inconsistent prioritized knowledge base.
   Then we present a family of measurements for the blame of each formula
   in an inconsistent prioritized knowledge base under the guidance of the
   principle of proportionality, one of the intuitive postulates. We also
   demonstrate that each of these measurements possesses the properties
   that it ought to have. Finally, we use a simple but explanatory example
   in requirements engineering to illustrate the application of these
   measurements. Compared to the related works, the postulates presented in
   this article consider the special characteristics of minimal
   inconsistent subsets as well as the priority levels of formulas. This
   makes them more appropriate to characterizing the inconsistency measures
   defined from minimal inconsistent subsets for prioritized knowledge
   bases as well as classical knowledge bases. Correspondingly, the
   measures guided by these postulates can intuitively capture the
   inconsistency for prioritized knowledge bases.}},

Abstract = {{In the Greater Himalayan sequence of far northwestern Nepal, detailed
   mapping, thermobarometry, and microstructure analysis are used to test
   competing models of the construction of Himalayan inverted metamorphism.
   The inverted Greater Himalayan sequence, which is characterized by an
   increase in peak metamorphic temperatures up structural section from 580
   to 720 degrees C, is divided into two tectonometamorphic domains. The
   lower domain contains garnet- to kyanite-zone rocks whose peak
   metamorphic assemblages suggest a metamorphic field pressure gradient
   that increases up structural section from 8 to 11 kbar, and which
   developed during top-to-the-south directed shearing. The upper portion
   of the Greater Himalayan sequence is composed of kyanite- and
   sillimanite-zone migmatitic gneisses that contain a metamorphic pressure
   gradient that decreases up structural section from 10 to 5 kbar. The
   lower and upper portions of the Greater Himalayan sequence are separated
   by a metamorphic discontinuity that spatially coincides with the base of
   the lowest migmatite unit. Temperatures inferred from quartz
   recrystallization mechanisms and the opening angles of quartz c-axis
   fabrics increase up section through the Greater Himalayan sequence from
   530 to >700 degrees C and yield similar results to peak metamorphic
   temperatures determined by thermometry. The observations from the
   Greater Himalayan sequence in far northwestern Nepal are consistent with
   numerical predictions of channel-flow tectonic models, whereby the upper
   hinterland part evolved as a ductile southward tunnelling mid-crustal
   channel and the lower foreland part ductily accreted in a critical-taper
   system at the leading edge of the extruding channel. The boundary
   between the upper and lower portions of the Greater Himalayan sequence
   is shown to represent a forelandhinterland transition zone that is used
   to reconcile the different proposed tectonic styles documented in
   western Nepal.}},

Abstract = {{A study on the effect of matrix yield strength on precipitation of
   hydride phases in zirconium alloys is presented. X-ray diffraction
   measurements from the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at
   Brookhaven National Laboratory were used to characterise the quantity of
   delta (fcc) and gamma (fct) hydride phases in zirconium alloys as a
   function of yield stress and cooling rate. While experimental results
   indicate that yield stress has a pronounced effect on hydride phase
   stability in the zirconium-hydrogen system, other factors including
   defect structure and beta-phase distribution also influence the hydride
   phase stability, for material of a given yield stress. These results
   offer a possible explanation for the wide range of hydride phase
   stability reported in the literature for the zirconium-hydrogen system.

Abstract = {{Measuring force production in muscles is important for many applications
   such as gait analysis, medical rehabilitation, and human-machine
   interaction. Substantial research has focused on finding signal
   processing and modeling techniques which give accurate estimates of
   muscle force from the surface-recorded electromyogram (EMG). The
   proposed methods often do not capture both the nonlinearities and
   dynamic components of the EMG-force relation. In this study, parallel
   cascade identification (PCI) is used as a dynamic estimation tool to map
   surface EMG recordings from upper-arm muscles to the induced force at
   the wrist. PCI mapping involves generating a parallel connection of a
   series of linear dynamic and nonlinear static blocks. The PCI model
   parameters were initialized to obtain the best force prediction. A
   comparison between PCI and a previously published Hill-based
   orthogonalization scheme, that captures physiological behaviour of the
   muscles, has shown 44\% improvement in force prediction by PCI (averaged
   over all subjects in relative-mean-square sense). The improved
   performance is attributed to the structural capability of PCI to capture
   nonlinear dynamic effects in the generated force. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Towards an understanding of the causes and effects of software
   requirements change: two case studies}},
Journal = {{REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{133-155}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Changes to software requirements not only pose a risk to the successful
   delivery of software applications but also provide opportunity for
   improved usability and value. Increased understanding of the causes and
   consequences of change can support requirements management and also make
   progress towards the goal of change anticipation. This paper presents
   the results of two case studies that address objectives arising from
   that ultimate goal. The first case study evaluated the potential of a
   change source taxonomy containing the elements `market', `organisation',
   `vision', `specification', and `solution' to provide a meaningful basis
   for change classification and measurement. The second case study
   investigated whether the requirements attributes of novelty, complexity,
   and dependency correlated with requirements volatility. While
   insufficiency of data in the first case study precluded an investigation
   of changes arising due to the change source of `market', for the
   remainder of the change sources, results indicate a significant
   difference in cost, value to the customer and management considerations.
   Findings show that higher cost and value changes arose more often from
   `organisation' and `vision' sources; these changes also generally
   involved the co-operation of more stakeholder groups and were considered
   to be less controllable than changes arising from the `specification' or
   `solution' sources. Results from the second case study indicate that
   only `requirements dependency' is consistently correlated with
   volatility and that changes coming from each change source affect
   different groups of requirements. We conclude that the taxonomy can
   provide a meaningful means of change classification, but that a single
   requirement attribute is insufficient for change prediction. A
   theoretical causal account of requirements change is drawn from the
   implications of the combined results of the two case studies.}},

Abstract = {{Microbiologically contaminated water severely impacts public health in
   low-income countries, where treated water supplies are often
   inaccessible to much of the population. Groundwater represents a water
   source that commonly has better microbiological quality than surface
   water. A 2-month intensive flow and quality monitoring programme of a
   spring in a densely settled, unsewered parish of Kampala, Uganda,
   revealed the persistent presence of high chloride and nitrate
   concentrations that reflect intense loading of sewage in the spring's
   catchment. Conversely, thermotolerant coliform bacteria counts in spring
   water samples remained very low outside of periods of intense rainfall.
   Laboratory investigations of mechanisms responsible for this behavior,
   achieved by injecting a pulse of H40/1 bacteriophage tracer into a
   column packed with locally derived granular laterite, resulted in
   near-total tracer adsorption. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed
   the laterite to consist predominantly of quartz and kaolinite, with
   minor amounts (< 5\%) of haematite. Batch studies comparing laterite
   adsorption capacity with a soil having comparable mineralogy, but with
   amorphous iron oxide rather than haematite, showed the laterite to have
   a significantly greater capacity to adsorb bacteriophage. Batch study
   results using pure haematite confirmed that its occurrence in laterite
   contributes substantially to micro-organism attenuation observed and
   serves to protect underlying groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{Being a new generation of green solvents and high-tech reaction media of
   the future, ionic liquids have increasingly attracted much attention. Of
   particular interest in this context are room temperature ionic liquids
   (in short as ILs in this paper). Due to the relatively high viscosity,
   ILs is expected to be used in the form of solvent diluted mixture with
   reduced viscosity in industrial application, where predicting the
   viscosity of IL mixture has been an important research issue. Different
   IL mixture and many modelling approaches have been investigated. The
   objective of this study is to provide an alternative model approach
   using soft computing technique, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN)
   model, to predict the compositional viscosity of binary mixtures of ILs
   {[}C-n-mim]{[} NTf2] with n=4, 6, 8, 10 in methanol and ethanol over the
   entire range of molar fraction at a broad range of temperatures from
   T=293.0-328.0K. The results show that the proposed ANN model provides
   alternative way to predict compositional viscosity successfully with
   highly improved accuracy and also show its potential to be extensively
   utilized to predict compositional viscosity taking account of IL alkyl
   chain length, as well as temperature and compositions simultaneously,
   i.e., more complex intermolecular interactions between components in
   which it would be hard or impossible to establish the analytical model.
   This illustrates the potential application of ANN in the case that the
   physical and thermodynamic properties are highly non-linear or too
   complex.}},

Abstract = {{We present Ha fluxes, star formation rates (SFRs) and equivalent widths
   (EWs) for a sample of 156 nearby galaxies observed in the 12CO J= 32
   line as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope Nearby Galaxies Legacy
   Survey. These are derived from images and values in the literature and
   from new Ha images for 72 galaxies which we publish here. We describe
   the sample, observations and procedures to extract the Ha fluxes and
   related quantities. We discuss the SFR properties of our sample and
   confirm the well-known correlation with galaxy luminosity, albeit with
   high dispersion. Our SFRs range from 0.1 to 11 M? yr-1 with a median SFR
   value for the complete sample of 0.2 M? yr-1. This median value is
   somewhat lower than similar published measurements, which we attribute,
   in part, to our sample being H i selected and, thus, not biased towards
   high SFRs as has frequently been the case in previous studies.
   Additionally, we calculate internal absorptions for the Ha line, A(Ha),
   which are lower than many of those used in previous studies. Our derived
   EWs, which range from 1 to 880 angstrom with a median value of 27
   angstrom, show little dependence on luminosity but rise by a factor of 5
   from early- to late-type galaxies. This paper is the first in a series
   aimed at comparing SFRs obtained from Ha imaging of galaxies with
   information derived from other tracers of star formation and atomic and
   molecular gas.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional analysis methods of cable structures do not consider
   sliding of cables inside the joint, which may lead to inaccuracy of the
   theoretical behavior of the structure. In order to develop an effective
   method for cable sliding, a two-node cable element based on the
   analytical solution for an elastic catenary was studied. The cable
   sliding stiffness and the effect of friction were investigated. To
   validate the proposed numerical method, analyses of two examples given
   in the literature were conducted. The results demonstrated that the
   method given in this paper is accurate and effective, and can take into
   account cable sliding in cable structures. In addition, it was shown
   that the effect of cable sliding on the behavior of cable structures is
   significant. It was also shown that the friction at the support hampers
   the flow of the cable force, leading to unequal cable tensions on both
   sides of the support.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the details of a combined hardware/software system,
   which has been developed to provide haptic feedback for teleoperated
   laparoscopic surgical robots. Surgical instruments incorporating quantum
   tunnelling composite (QTC) force measuring sensors have been developed
   and mounted on a pair of Mitsubishi PA-10 industrial robots. Feedback
   forces are rendered on pseudo-surgical instruments based on a pair of
   PHANTOM Omni devices, which are also used to remotely manipulate the
   robotic arms. Measurements of the behaviour of the QTC sensors during a
   simulated teleoperated procedure are given. In addition, a method is
   proposed that can compensate for their non-linear characteristics in
   order to provide a `realistic feel' to the surgeon through the haptic
   feedback channel. The paper concludes by explaining how the force
   feedback channel is combined with a visual feedback channel to enable a
   surgeon to perform a two-handed surgical procedure better on a remote
   patient by more accurately controlling a pair of robot arms via a
   computer network.}},

Abstract = {{With the aim of developing a clinically-translatable cell expansion and
   delivery vehicle for adipose tissue engineering, the adipogenic
   differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) was
   investigated on microcarriers fabricated from human decellularized
   adipose tissue (DAT). ASCs seeded on the DAT microcarriers and cultured
   in adipogenic differentiation medium within a low-shear spinner culture
   system demonstrated high levels of adipogenic differentiation, as
   measured by the expression of adipogenic genes, glycerol-3-phosphate
   dehydrogenase (GPDH) enzyme activity, and intracellular lipid
   accumulation. In contrast, gelatin microcarrier controls did not
   demonstrate significant adipogenesis, emphasizing the role of the native
   matrix in mediating ASC differentiation. Interestingly, ASCs cultured on
   the DAT microcarriers in proliferation medium expressed elevated levels
   of the adipogenic markers, suggesting that the DAT provided an
   adipo-inductive substrate for the human ASCs. in vivo testing of the DAT
   and gelatin microcarriers in a subcutaneous Wistar rat model confirmed
   injectability and demonstrated stable volume retention over 28 days.
   Under histological analysis, the DAT microcarriers demonstrated no
   evidence of immunogenicity or cytotoxicity, with the DAT supporting
   cellular infiltration and tissue remodeling. Pre-seeding the DAT
   microcarriers with allogenic rat ASCs enhanced cellularity and
   angiogenesis within the implant region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Melt viscosity is a key indicator of product quality in polymer
   extrusion processes. However, real time monitoring and control of
   viscosity is difficult to achieve. In this article, a novel soft sensor
   approach based on dynamic gray-box modeling is proposed. The soft sensor
   involves a nonlinear finite impulse response model with adaptable linear
   parameters for real-time prediction of the melt viscosity based on the
   process inputs; the model output is then used as an input of a model
   with a simple-fixed structure to predict the barrel pressure which can
   be measured online. Finally, the predicted pressure is compared to the
   measured value and the corresponding error is used as a feedback signal
   to correct the viscosity estimate. This novel feedback structure enables
   the online adaptability of the viscosity model in response to modeling
   errors and disturbances, hence producing a reliable viscosity estimate.
   The experimental results on different material/die/extruder confirm the
   effectiveness of the proposed soft sensor method based on dynamic
   gray-box modeling for real-time monitoring and control of polymer

Abstract = {{Solar water disinfection (SODIS) has proven to be effective at reducing
   diarrheal incidence in epidemiological intervention studies. However,
   the SODIS method is limited to waters of low turbidity (<30 NTU). This
   study investigates the use of common table salt (NaCl) to reduce the
   turbidity of water containing suspended colloidal clay particles for use
   in the SODIS method. Three representative clays found in tropical soils
   (kaolinite, illite and bentonite) were tested at three levels of
   turbidity (50, 100 and 200 NTU) for their flocculating behavior with
   multiple NaCl concentrations to find the optimum. Supernatants were
   tested for sodium concentration for comparison against health and taste
   thresholds. Results show that unlike kaolinite and illite, pure
   bentonite solutions were shown to be very responsive to NaCl and
   produced supernatants with as low as 4 NTU (98\% particle removal
   efficiency). This study has shown that NaCl, in combination with
   high-activity clay particles in solution, may effectively reduce
   turbidity to levels suitable for SODIS treatment, thereby expanding the
   number of people who can utilize the technology effectively.}},

   reduce static strength performance. However, results from fuselage and

Abstract = {{Nitride-strengthened, reduced activation, martensitic steel is
   anticipated to have higher creep strength because of the remarkable
   thermal stability of nitrides. Two nitride-strengthened, reduced
   activation martensitic steels with different carbon contents were
   prepared to investigate the microstructure and mechanical property
   changes with decreasing carbon content. It has been found that both
   steels had the microstructure of full martensite with fine nitrides
   dispersed homogeneously in the matrix and displayed extremely high
   strength but poor toughness. Compared with the steel with low carbon
   content (0.005 pct in wt pct), the steel with high carbon content (0.012
   pct in wt pct) had not only the higher strength but also the higher
   impact toughness and grain coarsening temperature, which was related to
   the carbon content. On the one hand, carbon reduction led to Ta-rich
   inclusions; on the other hand, the grain grew larger when normalized at
   high temperature because of the absence of Ta carbonitrides, which would
   decrease impact toughness. The complicated Al2O3 inclusions in the two
   steels have been revealed to be responsible for the initiated cleavage
   fracture by acting as the critical cracks.}},

Abstract = {{Objective measurement of dysarthric speech intelligibility can assist
   clinicians in the diagnosis of speech disorder severity as well as in
   the evaluation of dysarthria treatments. In this paper, several
   objective measures are proposed and tested as correlates of subjective
   intelligibility. More specifically, the kurtosis of the linear
   prediction residual is proposed as a measure of vocal source excitation
   oddity. Additionally, temporal perturbations resultant from imprecise
   articulation and atypical speech rates are characterized by short- and
   long-term temporal dynamics measures, which in turn, are based on
   log-energy dynamics and on an auditory-inspired modulation spectral
   signal representation, respectively. Motivated by recent insights in the
   communication disorders literature, a composite measure is developed
   based on linearly combining a salient subset of the proposed measures
   with conventional prosodic parameters. Experiments with the
   publicly-available `Universal Access' database of spastic dysarthric
   speech (10 patient speakers; 300 words spoken in isolation, per speaker)
   show that the proposed composite measure can achieve correlation with
   subjective intelligibility ratings as high as 0.97; thus the measure can
   serve as an accurate indicator of dysarthric speech intelligibility. (C)

Abstract = {{The activities and stabilities of gamma-Al2O3 supported Ni catalysts
   (Ni10/gamma-Al2O3 and Ru(0.1)Ni10/gamma-Al2O3) for hydrogen generation
   through the supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of glucose were
   investigated at 700 degrees C, 24 MPa and a weight hourly space velocity
   (WHSV) of 6 h (1) in a bench-scale continuous down-flow tubular reactor.
   The Ru0.1Ni10/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst (10 wt.\% Ni, the Ru-to-Ni molar
   ratio of 0.1) exhibited higher activity and stability than
   Ni10/gamma-Al2O3 (10 wt.\% Ni). With the Ru(0.1)Ni10/gamma-Al2O3
   catalyst, negligible catalyst deactivation was observed over a period of
   33 h on stream. The H-2 yield was maintained as high as similar to 50
   mol/kg glucose throughout the entire stability test. In contrast, the
   activity of Ni10/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst (10 wt.\% Ni) decreased after
   approximately 7 h on stream, accompanied by a marked decrease in the H-2
   yield from similar to 50 mol/kg glucose initially to similar to 25
   mol/kg glucose after 7 h. The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and
   H-2 chemisorption analyses on the fresh catalysts demonstrated that the
   addition of a small amount of Ru as a modifier could improve Ni
   dispersion, which could account for the enhanced activity and higher
   stability of the Ru(0.1)Ni10/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Basic vegetable blends (BVB's) and soya oils, used in the animal feed
   industry, are sometimes adulterated with transformer and mineral oil as
   a means of illegally increasing profit. A set of BVB's and soya oil
   samples adulterated with transformer oil and mineral oil were
   characterised using both NIRS and Raman spectroscopy. Applying
   chemometrics to the NIRS and Raman spectral data, very good calibration
   and prediction statistics were obtained for transformer and mineral
   oils. Using NIRS, R-2 values greater than 0.99 were obtained with
   corresponding values for root mean squared error of calibration and
   prediction (<0.57 and <0.55, respectively). Using Raman, R-2 values
   greater than 0.97 were obtained with the root mean squared error of
   calibration (<2.01) and prediction (<1.92) calculated. Furthermore,
   using a qualitative approach it was possible, using PCA, to discriminate
   between 100\% soya and BVB. This study demonstrates that both NIRS and
   Raman technology can be successfully applied as rapid screening
   techniques for the detection of oil adulteration and fraud in the food
   and feed industry. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{52}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Quite extensive measurements undertaken in a three-story atrium space
   (floors 14th-16th) with a hybrid solar-assisted natural ventilation
   system in the Engineering building of the Concordia University,
   Montreal, Canada have recently become available. The thermal conditions
   of the atrium space have been studied numerically using the Reynolds
   Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) modeling approach. The RANS turbulence
   models that were tested include the standard k-epsilon, RNG k-epsilon,
   `realizable' k-epsilon, and SST k-omega turbulence models. The radiation
   exchange between the surfaces of the atrium space was considered using
   the Discrete Transfer Radiation Model (DTRM). The resultant steady state
   governing equations were solved using a commercial CFD solver FLUENT.
   Numerical results were obtained for the conditions existing when
   measurements were taken in the Concordia atrium on typical clear days
   with the blinds fully open or fully closed and with the natural
   ventilation system (NV) ON or OFF. The CFD model predictions were
   validated by the comparison against the experimental measurements
   available and it was found that the numerical predictions implying CFD
   model agree well with the measurements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Antipatterns are poor design choices that are conjectured to make
   object-oriented systems harder to maintain. We investigate the impact of
   antipatterns on classes in object-oriented systems by studying the
   relation between the presence of antipatterns and the change- and
   fault-proneness of the classes. We detect 13 antipatterns in 54 releases
   of ArgoUML, Eclipse, Mylyn, and Rhino, and analyse (1) to what extent
   classes participating in antipatterns have higher odds to change or to
   be subject to fault-fixing than other classes, (2) to what extent these
   odds (if higher) are due to the sizes of the classes or to the presence
   of antipatterns, and (3) what kinds of changes affect classes
   participating in antipatterns. We show that, in almost all releases of
   the four systems, classes participating in antipatterns are more
   change-and fault-prone than others. We also show that size alone cannot
   explain the higher odds of classes with antipatterns to underwent a
   (fault-fixing) change than other classes. Finally, we show that
   structural changes affect more classes with antipatterns than others. We
   provide qualitative explanations of the increase of change- and
   fault-proneness in classes participating in antipatterns using release
   notes and bug reports. The obtained results justify a posteriori
   previous work on the specification and detection of antipatterns and
   could help to better focus quality assurance and testing activities.}},

Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{The most commonly occurring boundary separating Ge-5 x 5 domains grown

   that this boundary can be used to template one-dimensional arrays of
   identical In and Ga magic clusters with a lattice constant of 3.3 nm.
   This is larger than the lattice constant of the two-dimensional magic
   cluster arrays templated by the Si(111)-7 x 7 surface reconstruction
   (2.7 nm), although the magic clusters have the same structure. We also
   demonstrate that a necessary condition for cluster growth at the domain
   boundary is the presence of faulted dimer-adatom-stacking-fault-7 x 7
   half unit cells. The relatively unexplored possibility of exploiting the
   unique structural and electronic properties of domain boundaries in
   nanostructured materials is discussed.}},

Title = {{A new efficient convergence criterion for reducing computational expense
   in topology optimization: reducible design variable method}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{A new efficient convergence criterion, named the reducible design
   variable method (RDVM), is proposed to save computational expense in
   topology optimization. There are two types of computational costs: one
   is to calculate the governing equations, and the other is to update the
   design variables. In conventional topology optimization, the number of
   design variables is usually fixed during the optimization procedure.
   Thus, the computational expense linearly increases with respect to the
   iteration number. Some design variables, however, quickly converge and
   some other design variables slowly converge. The idea of the proposed
   method is to adaptively reduce the number of design variables on the
   basis of the history of each design variable during optimization. Using
   the RDVM, those design variables that quickly converge are not
   considered as design variables for the next iterations. This means that
   the number of design variables can be reduced to save the computational
   costs of updating design variables. Then, the iteration will repeat
   until the number of design variables becomes 0. In addition, the
   proposed method can lead to faster convergence of the optimization
   procedure, which indeed is a more significant time saving. It is also
   revealed that the RDVM gives identical optimal solutions as those by
   conventional methods. We confirmed the numerical efficiency and solution
   effectiveness of the RDVM with respect to two types of optimization:
   static linear elastic minimization, and linear vibration problems with
   the first eigenvalue as the objective function for maximization.

Abstract = {{We present evidence for a Galactic North-South asymmetry in the number
   density and bulk velocity of solar neighborhood stars. The number
   density profile, which is derived from main-sequence stars in the Sloan
   Digital Sky Survey, shows a (North-South)/(North + South) deficit at
   vertical bar z vertical bar similar or equal to 400 pc and an excess at
   vertical bar z vertical bar similar to 800 pc. The bulk velocity
   profile, which is derived from the Sloan Extension for Galactic
   Understanding and Exploration, shows a gradual trend across the Galactic
   midplane as well as smaller-scale features. We speculate that the
   North-South asymmetry, which has the appearance of a wavelike
   perturbation, is intrinsic to the disk. We explore the physics of this
   phenomenon through an analysis of the linearized Boltzmann and Poisson
   equations and through one-dimensional simulations. The perturbation may
   be excited by the passage of a satellite galaxy or dark matter subhalo
   through the Galactic disk, in which case we are witnessing a recent
   disk-heating event.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, nickel germanide Schottky contacts have been fabricated on
   n-type germanium (n-Ge) with an optimum barrier height of 0.63 eV. For
   rapid thermal annealing (RTA) temperatures above 300 degrees C, all
   phases of nickel and germanium convert to nickel mono-germanide (NiGe).
   However, higher RTA temperatures are also found to cause agglomeration

Abstract = {{We report coupling of the excitonic photon emission from photoexcited
   PbSe colloidal quantum dots (QDs) into an optical circuit that was
   fabricated in a silicon-on-insulator wafer using a CMOS-compatible
   process. The coupling between excitons and sub-mu m sized silicon
   channel waveguides was mediated by a photonic crystal microcavity. The
   intensity of the coupled light saturates rapidly with the optical
   excitation power. The saturation behaviour was quantitatively studied
   using an isolated photonic crystal cavity with PbSe QDs site-selectively
   located at the cavity mode antinode position. Saturation occurs when a
   few mu W of continuous wave HeNe pump power excites the QDs with a
   Gaussian spot size of 2 mu m. By comparing the results with a master
   equation analysis that rigorously accounts for the complex dielectric
   environment of the QD excitons, the saturation is attributed to ground
   state depletion due to a non-radiative exciton decay channel with a trap
   state lifetime similar to 3 mu s. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Engineers who develop fundamental models for chemical processes are
   often unable to estimate all of the parameters, especially when
   available data are limited or noisy. In these situations, modelers may
   decide to select only a subset of the parameters for estimation. An
   orthogonalization algorithm combined with a mean squared error (MSE)
   based selection criterion has been used to rank parameters from most to
   least estimable and to determine the parameter subset that should be
   estimated to obtain the best predictions. A robustness test is proposed
   and applied to a batch reactor model to assess the sensitivity of the
   selected parameter subset to initial parameter guesses. A new ranking
   and selection technique is also developed based on the MSE criterion and
   is compared with existing techniques in the literature. Results obtained
   using the proposed ranking and selection techniques agree with those
   from leave-one-out cross-validation but are more computationally
   attractive.}},

   divinyl benzene sulphonate copolymer resin. The results of tomography
   revealed uneven temperature and composition maps of water and deuterated
   water vapours in the core-packed bed and in the vicinity of the wall
   owing to flow maldistribution. The dynamic lag between the near-wall
   water vapour and deuterated water vapour compositions were observed
   suggesting that the convective transfer which was significant near the
   wall at the start, owing to high porosity, was also effective at large
   conversions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The market for vehicular navigators boomed over the last few years.
   These navigators rely mainly on satellite based navigation systems such
   as the Global Positioning System (GPS) to assist drivers. Due to
   interruption or degradation in such systems in dense urban scenarios,
   they have to be augmented with other systems to achieve continuous and
   accurate vehicular navigation. GPS is integrated with low-cost
   micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS)-based inertial sensors. However,
   these sensors provide inadequate performance in degraded GPS
   environments because of their complex error characteristics that often
   lead to large position drift errors. This paper proposes a continuous
   and accurate solution integrating low-cost MEMS-based inertial sensors,
   the vehicle odometer, GPS, and map data from road networks. Despite the
   traditional inadequate performance of MEMS-based sensors in this
   problem, the performance is enhanced through: (i) a special combination
   of inertial sensors and odometer that has better performance for land
   vehicles than traditional solutions; (ii) The use of map information
   from road networks to constrain the positioning solution; (iii) The use
   of an advanced particle filtering (PF) technique to perform the
   integration, which work with nonlinear models and better modeling of
   inertial sensor errors, in addition to better integration with the map
   data. The performance of the proposed positioning system has been
   verified extensively on real road tests in downtown trajectories with
   degraded or totally denied GPS for long durations.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been growing emphasis on the need to provide
   transparency in the costs of engineering programs, leading to growing
   emphasis on whole-life cost modeling techniques. This has arisen largely
   due to the increased interest in longer-timescale projects and programs,
   combined with the emergence of system-of-systems and
   network-enabled-capability concepts. This change in the implementation
   and management of large-scale projects has necessitated the development
   of alternative methods of evaluating performance. This work seeks to
   address the shortfalls in current costing methodologies when applied to
   these highly flexible environments, and to propose a conceptual model
   for dealing with the encountered complexities. The approach has a
   fundamental role and potential significance in the future of whole-life

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamic forces generated by an orifice plate under low pressure
   were examined as a means of disrupting flocs, in order to improve
   disinfection of treated wastewater effluents. Changes in cavitation
   conditions were found to have little impact on the extent of particle
   breakage in this experimental setup. The rate of strain (flow rate
   divided by the hole radius cubed), however, was found to be the best
   predictor of floc breakage. Floc breakage was not affected by changes in
   floc concentration, but was very sensitive to differences between flocs
   collected from different sources. Larger flocs (90 to 106 mm) were
   broken apart to a greater extent than smaller ones (53 to 63 mm).
   Hydrodynamic treatment decreased the viability of bacteria associated
   with large flocs, and also increased the ultraviolet dose response by up
   to one log unit (i.e., a factor of ten). Subjecting final effluent
   wastewaters to hydrodynamic treatment, therefore, provides a treatment
   strategy for conditions in which the presence of flocs limits the level
   of disinfection that can be achieved. Water Environ. Res., 84, 387

Abstract = {{A resistive furnace combined with a load frame was built that allows for
   in situ neutron diffraction studies of high temperature deformation, in
   particular, creep. A maximum force of 2700 N can be applied at
   temperatures up to 1000 degrees C. A load control mode permits studies
   of, e. g., creep or phase transformations under applied uni-axial
   stress. In position control, a range of high temperature deformation
   experiments can be achieved. The examined specimen can be rotated up to
   80 degrees around the vertical compression axis allowing texture
   measurements in the neutron time-of-flight diffractometer HIPPO (High
   Pressure - Preferred Orientation). We present results from the
   successful commissioning, deforming a Zr-2.5 wt.\% Nb cylinder at 975
   degrees C. The device is now available for the user program of the HIPPO
   diffractometer at the LANSCE (Los Alamos Neutron Science Center) user

Abstract = {{A vanadium-based conversion coating is proposed as an effective
   pretreatment for electroless Ni-P deposition on AZ91D magnesium alloy.
   The magnesium alloy substrate was immersed in a NaVO3 solution with
   various parameters such as the vanadium concentration, immersion time
   and bath temperature being varied. The results reveal the quality and
   corrosion protection performance of the coating increases with
   increasing treatment time up to a limit. However, excess treatment time
   induces the formation of cracks in the coating layer, leading to reduced
   corrosion resistance of the conversion coating. Increasing bath
   temperature decreases the crack density and increases the thickness of
   the conversion layer. Electrochemical polarisation results showed that
   the vanadium treatment in a bath containing NaVO3 of concentration 30 g
   L-1 at 80 degrees C for 15-20 min gives good corrosion resistance. This
   optimum vanadium treatment was used as a pretreatment for the subsequent
   electroless Ni-P deposit and it had good passive parameters, showing
   better corrosion protection on AZ91D substrate than a chromium based
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Stable hydrogen isotopes (delta D) can help predict geographic origin of
   tissue growth but within-site variation of feather delta D (delta D-f)
   exists. Multiple hypotheses explain delta D-f variation: moult timing,
   physiology, and spatio-temporal differences in source deuterium, but
   there have been few direct tests of these factors. We assessed delta D-f
   variation within a breeding population of Wood Thrush (Hylocichla
   mustelina (Gmelin, 1789)), by sampling feathers from hatch-year birds,
   returning adults (after migration), and to eliminate confounding
   variables from newly grown adult primary feathers during moult. We
   evaluated potential mechanisms explaining delta D-f variation by
   examining intraindividual variation (different feather types),
   precipitation delta D, prey delta D, corticosterone (CORT), and breeding
   productivity. In addition, we directly compared delta D-f of newly grown
   primary feathers to delta D blood hematocrit (delta D-b). We found
   significant differences in delta D-f between years and age classes and
   observed no significant intraindividual variation. delta D-f and delta
   D-b were not significantly correlated. CORT weakly contributed to delta
   D-f, but there are other factors influencing delta D-f. Ten percent of
   all feather samples had outlying delta D-f values, and were likely grown
   away from the breeding grounds. Our results document intrapopulation and
   intraindividual variation of delta D-f at a single location and
   indicated that age class and year-to-year differences contributed to
   high delta D-f variance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the fatigue behavior of an integrated crosstie
   system for an Advanced Rapid Transit (ART). The crosstie system consists
   of steel base plates welded to a hollow structural section, and a
   concrete guideway slab. The steel-wheeled ART is operated by linear
   induction motors (LIM) and provides a unique load configuration to the
   crosstie system, including electromagnetic force and gravity load. To
   absorb dynamic effects from the ART, elastomeric pads are placed under
   the base plates. A three-dimensional finite element analysis is
   conducted to examine the fatigue performance of the crosstie, on the
   basis of cumulative damage theory. The study focuses on stress
   progression, displacements, and stress concentrations in the crosstie
   system subjected to fatigue load of up to three million cycles. The
   effect of pad deterioration on the fatigue behavior of the crosstie is
   evaluated. Design recommendations to improve the sustainability of the

Abstract = {{Self-selected walking speed is an important measure of ambulation

   the improvement of performance and decrease in cost of the miniature
   inertial sensors. With the intention of understanding the state of the
   art of current development in this area, a systematic review on the
   exiting methods was done in the following electronic engines/databases:
   PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, SportDiscus and IEEE Xplore. Sixteen
   journal articles and papers in proceedings focusing on inertial sensor

Abstract = {{Modifying the surfaces of metal nanoparticles with self-assembled
   monolayers of functionalized thiols provides a simple and direct method
   to alter their surface properties. Mixed self-assembled monolayers can
   extend this approach since, in principle, the surfaces can be tuned by
   altering the proportion of each modifier that is adsorbed. However, this
   works best if the composition and microstructure of the monolayers can
   be controlled. Here, we have modified preprepared silver colloids with
   binary mixtures of thiols at varying concentrations and modifier ratios.
   Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy was then used to determine the
   effect of altering these parameters on the composition of the resulting
   mixed monolayers. The data could be explained using a new model based on
   a modified competitive Langmuir approach. It was found that the
   composition of the mixed monolayer only reflected the ratio of modifiers
   in the feedstock when the total amount of modifier was sufficient for
   approximately one monolayer coverage. At higher modifier concentrations
   the thermodynamically favored modifier dominated, but working at near
   monolayer concentrations allowed the surface composition to be
   controlled by changing the ratios of modifiers. Finally, a positively
   charged porphyrin probe molecule was used to Investigate the
   microstructure of the mixed monolayers, i.e., homogeneous versus
   domains. In this case the modifier domains were found to be <2 nm.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a relay precoding problem in a non-regenerative
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay system, where the relay has
   the perfect channel state information of the source-relay link and only
   the covariance information of the relay-destination link. The average
   capacity seen by the relay is maximized under a relay transmit power
   constraint. The relay precoding problem is transformed to its equivalent
   power allocation problem at the relay. The optimal power allocation
   solution is then derived by formulating the optimization problem via
   difference of convex (DC) functions programming. To reduce the
   computational complexity, we also propose a suboptimal scheme by
   modifying the naive Jensen method. Furthermore, we propose the maximum
   eigenmode relaying (MER) scheme, which allocates the relay transmit
   power only to the maximum eigenmode. A necessary and sufficient
   condition for the MER to be asymptotically optimal is derived in the
   high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime of the source-relay link. The
   performance of the proposed schemes is investigated through extensive
   numerical simulations.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The thermodynamic framework for predicting the electric-field induced
   fluid like-solid like phase transition of dielectric colloids developed
   by Khusid and Acrivos {[}Phys. Rev. E. 54, 5428 (1996)] is extended to
   examine the impact of multiscattering/multiparticle effects on the
   resulting phase diagrams. This was accomplished using effective
   permittivity models suitable both over the entire composition region for
   hard spheres (0 <= c < c(max)) and for multiple types of solid packing
   structures (random close-packed structure, FCC, BCC). The Sihvola-Kong
   model and the self-consistent permittivity model of Sen et al.
   {[}Geophysics 46, 781 (1981)] were used to generate the coexistence
   (slow phase transition) and spinodal (rapid phase transition) boundaries
   for the system and compared to assuming Maxwell-Garnett permittivity. It
   was found that for larger dielectric contrasts between medium and
   particle that the impact of accounting for multiscattering effects
   increased and that there was a significant shift in the resulting phase
   diagrams. Results obtained for model colloidal systems of
   silica-dimethylsulfoxide and silica-isopropanol showed that critical
   electric field strength required for phase transitions could rise by up
   to approximately 20\% when considering multiparticle effects versus the
   isolated dipole case. The impact of multiparticle effects on the phase
   diagrams was not only limited purely to the direct effect of volume
   fraction on permittivity and particle dipoles but also on the curvature
   of the volume fraction dependence. This work stresses the importance of
   accounting for particle effects on the polarization of colloidal
   suspensions, which has large implications for predicting the behavior of
   electrorheological fluids and other electric-field driven phenomena. (C)

Abstract = {{Punching failure is the common failure mode in concrete bridge deck
   slabs when these structural components are subjected to local patch
   loads, such as tyre loads. Past research has shown that reinforced
   concrete slabs in girder slab type bridges have a load-carrying capacity
   far greater than the ultimate static loads predicted by traditional
   design methods, because of the presence of compressive membrane action.
   However, due to the instability problems from punching failure, it is
   difficult to predict ultimate capacities accurately in numerical
   analyses. In order to overcome the instability problems, this paper
   establishes an efficient non-linear finite-element analysis using the
   commercial finite-element package Abaqus. In the non-linear
   finite-element analysis, stabilisation methods were adopted and failure
   criteria were established to predict the ultimate punching behaviour of
   deck slabs in composite steel concrete bridges. The proposed non-linear
   finite-element analysis predictions showed a good correlation on
   punching capacities with experimental tests.}},

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3355-3369}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A series of in situ compression tests has been carried out at room
   temperature for three dual-phase Zr-Nb alloys with different Nb
   contents. Changes in the Nb content change the relative fraction of
   beta-phase present in the alloy. The evolution of interphase and
   intergranular strain was monitored during deformation by neutron
   diffraction. Surprisingly the strength difference between the three
   alloys is caused principally by changes in the alpha-phase strength
   rather than being due to changes in the beta-phase volume fraction; the
   yield strength of the Nb-rich beta-phase is similar to 400 MPa and is
   almost unchanged in the three alloys. The strength of the alpha-phase
   significantly changed between alloys due to the combined effects of
   increasing oxygen content and decreasing grain size. The change in
   strengthening mechanisms in the alpha-phase is crystallographically
   anisotropic, e.g. more change was observed for prismatic slip than for
   pyramidal slip. As a result, the mechanical anisotropy of the
   alpha-phase decreases with increasing strength. Depending on the
   beta/alpha strength ratio, the beta-phase can be either weaker or
   stronger than the average material strength. A soft beta-phase helps to
   produce compressive residual stresses in the alpha-phase, while a strong
   beta-phase produces tensile residual stresses in alpha-phase. A combined
   finite-element method and elastoplastic self-consistent multiscale model
   is used to interpret the experimental results. Despite the inability to
   capture the rapid stress relaxation observed, the combined method is
   shown to be effective in interpreting the deformation behavior of these
   dual-phase Zr-Nb alloys. The results are relevant to the study of other
   two-phase alloys, particularly titanium-based alloys. (C) 2012 Acta

Abstract = {{Wound healing is a natural process involving several signaling molecules
   and cell types over a significant period of time. Although current
   dressings help to protect the wound from debris or infection, they do
   little in accelerating the healing process. Insulin has been shown to
   stimulate the healing of damaged skin. We have developed an alginate
   sponge dressing (ASD) that forms a hydrogel capable of providing a moist
   and protective healing environment. By incorporating insulin-loaded
   poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles into ASD, we
   successfully stabilized and released insulin for up to 21 days. Insulin
   release and water absorption and transfer through the ASD were
   influenced by altering the levels of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in the
   dressing matrix. Bioactivity of released insulin can be maintained for
   at least 10 days, demonstrated using a human keratinocyte migration
   assay. Results showed that insulin-loaded PLGA microparticles, embedded
   within PEG-ASD, functioned as an effective long-term delivery platform
   for bioactive insulin.}},

Abstract = {{We review current ideas on the origin of galactic and extragalactic
   magnetic fields. We begin by summarizing observations of magnetic fields
   at cosmological redshifts and on cosmological scales. These observations
   translate into constraints on the strength and scale magnetic fields
   must have during the early stages of galaxy formation in order to seed
   the galactic dynamo. We examine mechanisms for the generation of
   magnetic fields that operate prior during inflation and during
   subsequent phase transitions such as electroweak symmetry breaking and
   the quark-hadron phase transition. The implications of strong primordial
   magnetic fields for the reionization epoch as well as the first
   generation of stars are discussed in detail. The exotic, early-Universe
   mechanisms are contrasted with astrophysical processes that generate
   fields after recombination. For example, a Biermann-type battery can
   operate in a proto-galaxy during the early stages of structure
   formation. Moreover, magnetic fields in either an early generation of
   stars or active galactic nuclei can be dispersed into the intergalactic
   medium.}},

Abstract = {{The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS) is a program that uses
   the 1 deg(2) MegaCam instrument on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope to
   carry out a comprehensive optical imaging survey of the Virgo cluster,
   from its core to its virial radius-covering a total area of 104
   deg(2)-in the u{*}griz bandpasses. Thanks to a dedicated data
   acquisition strategy and processing pipeline, the NGVS reaches a
   point-source depth of g approximate to 25.9mag (10 sigma) and a surface
   brightness limit of mu(g) similar to 29 mag arcsec(-2) (2 sigma above
   the mean sky level), thus superseding all previous optical studies of
   this benchmark galaxy cluster. In this paper, we give an overview of the
   technical aspects of the survey, such as areal coverage, field
   placement, choice of filters, limiting magnitudes, observing strategies,
   data processing and calibration pipelines, survey timeline, and data
   products. We also describe the primary scientific topics of the NGVS,
   which include: the galaxy luminosity and mass functions; the
   color-magnitude relation; galaxy scaling relations; compact stellar
   systems; galactic nuclei; the extragalactic distance scale; the
   large-scale environment of the cluster and its relationship to the Local
   Supercluster; diffuse light and the intracluster medium; galaxy
   interactions and evolutionary processes; and extragalactic star
   clusters. In addition, we describe a number of ancillary programs
   dealing with ``foreground{''} and ``background{''} science topics,
   including the study of high-inclination trans-Neptunian objects; the
   structure of the Galactic halo in the direction of the Virgo Overdensity
   and Sagittarius Stream; the measurement of cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy,
   and cluster lensing; and the identification of distant galaxy clusters,
   and strong-lensing events.}},

Abstract = {{In liquid-phase reaction systems, the role of the solvent is often
   limited to the simple requirement of dissolving and/or diluting
   substrates. However, the correct choice, either pure or mixed, can
   significantly influence both reaction rate and selectivity. For
   multi-phase heterogeneously catalysed reactions observed variations may
   be due to changes in mass transfer rates, reaction mechanism, reaction
   kinetics, adsorption properties and combinations thereof. The
   liquid-phase hydrogenation of 2-butanone to 2-butanol over a Ru/SiO2
   catalyst, for example, shows such complex rate behaviour when varying
   water/isopropyl alcohol (IPA) solvent ratios. In this paper, we outline
   a strategy which combines measured rate data with physical property
   measurements and molecular simulation in order to gain a more
   fundamental understanding of mixed solvent effects for this
   heterogeneously catalysed reaction. By combining these techniques, the
   observed complex behaviour of rate against water fraction is shown to be
   a combination of both mass transfer and chemical effects. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Tetrahexahedral Pt nanocrystals (THH Pt NCs) bound by well-defined high
   index crystal planes offer exceptional electrocatalytic activity, owing
   to a high density of low-coordination surface Pt sites. We report,
   herein, on methanol electrooxidation at THH Pt NC electrodes studied by
   a combination of electrochemical techniques and in situ FTIR
   spectroscopy. Pure THH Pt NC surfaces readily facilitate the
   dissociative chemisorption of methanol leading to poisoning by strongly
   adsorbed CO. Decoration of the stepped surfaces by Ru adatoms increases
   the tolerance to poisoning and thereby reduces the onset potential for
   methanol oxidation by over 100 mV. The Ru modified THH Pt NCs exhibit
   greatly superior catalytic currents and CO2 yields in the low potential
   range, when compared with a commercial PtRu alloy nanoparticle catalyst.
   These results are of fundamental importance in terms of model
   nanoparticle electrocatalytic systems of stepped surfaces and also have
   practical significance in the development of surface tailored, direct
   methanol fuel cell catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{The type high-pressure (HP) Piaxtla Suite in the Acatlan Complex of
   southern Mexico consists of retrogressed eclogite (amphibolite),
   megacrystic granitoids and high-grade meta-sedimentary rocks. Exhumation
   of these HP rocks has recently been interpreted as the result of
   extrusion into the upper plate, rather than by return flow up the
   subduction zone. Geochemical analyses of the retrograde eclogites
   indicate that they have a rift tholeiitic-transitional alkalic
   composition. These are closely associated with a megacrystic
   meta-granitoid that has yielded an intrusive age of 452 +/- 6 Ma
   (concordant U-Pb zircon analyses) with inherited zircon populations at
   ca. 800-950 Ma and 1000-1200 Ma derived from the underlying basement,
   probably the Oaxacan Complex which borders the Acatlan Complex to the
   east. The bimodal nature of these igneous rocks and their spatial and
   temporal close association with continentally-derived sedimentary rocks
   is similar to most HP rocks in the Acatlan Complex derived from a rifted
   passive margin. The youngest detrital zircon population in a
   meta-psammite sample yielded a U-Pb age of 365 +/- 15 Ma with older
   analyses distributed along a chord with an upper intercept of 1287 +/-
   29 Ma. The ca. 365 Ma age provides a maximum age for the time of
   deposition of this sample. Ar-40/Ar-39 ages from the retrogressed
   eclogites provided hornblende plateau ages of 342 +/- 2 Ma and 344 +/- 2
   Ma, whereas muscovite from the granitoid and meta-psammite yielded 334 2
   Ma plateau ages. These data constrain the subduction erosion-extrusion
   cycle to <= 35 Ma during which the rocks were taken to a depth of ca. 40
   km at a rate of 2.7 km/Ma and back to the surface at 2.4 km/Ma. Such
   exhumation rates are slower than those in continent-continent collision
   zones, but similar to those in the Iberia-Czech Variscan belt where
   tectonic interpretation also suggests extrusion into the upper plate.

Abstract = {{Percutaneous scaphoid fixation (PSF) is growing in popularity as a
   treatment option for non-displaced fractures. Success of this procedure
   demands high-precision screw placement, which can be difficult to
   achieve with standard 2D imaging. This study aimed to develop and test a
   system for computer-assisted navigation using volume slicing of 3D
   cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).
   The navigated technique involved a distinctive workflow in which a 3D
   CBCT imager was calibrated preoperatively, circumventing the need for
   intraoperative patient-based registration. Intraoperatively, a 3D CBCT
   image was acquired for both preoperative planning and direct navigation
   using volume-rendered slices. An in vitro study was conducted to compare
   the navigated approach to two conventional fluoroscopic methods for
   volar PSF. The surgical goal was to insert a guide wire to maximize both
   length and central placement.
   There was no significant difference in the mean central placement of
   guide wire, although the variance in central placement was significantly
   lower using VS navigation (P < 0.01). The lengths of the drill paths
   were significantly longer for the VS-navigated group compared with one
   2D group (P < 0.1). Each navigated trial required only one drilling
   attempt and resulted in less radiation exposure than conventional C-arm
   (P < 0.01).
   Volume-sliced navigation achieved a more repeatable and reliable central
   pin placement, with fewer drilling attempts than conventional 2D
   techniques. Volume-sliced navigation had a higher number of drill paths
   within the optimal zone maximizing both length of the path and depth
   from the surface.}},

Abstract = {{Success of mosaic arthroplasty requires that the transplanted plugs be
   positioned to reconstruct the curvature and height of the original
   articular surface. This case report demonstrates how to achieve correct
   plug positioning using patient-specific instrument guides manufactured
   on a 3D printer.
   Using a 3D computer model of bone and cartilage, the harvesting of plugs
   and their placement at the defect site was planned on the computer.
   Instrument guides were manufactured in thermoplastic on a 3D printer;
   the bottom surface of the guides fit to the contour of the knee and the
   top surface contained holes to precisely position the surgical
   instruments. The instrument guides were used on a young female patient
   to repair a large articular cartilage defect in the left knee.
   The patient showed an increased range of motion in the knee and also a
   decrease in pain and discomfort at her 2-year follow-up. A CT arthrogram
   at 2 years postoperative showed a smooth and appropriate contour of the
   reconstructed cartilage over the defect.
   Image-based preoperative planning and the use of patient-specific
   instrument guides can yield a good patient outcome without requiring
   optically tracked intraoperative guidance.}},

Abstract = {{Recent spectropolarimetric studies of seven slowly pulsating B (SPB) and
   beta Cep stars have suggested that photospheric magnetic fields are more
   common in B-type pulsators than in the general population of B stars,
   suggesting a significant connection between magnetic and pulsational
   phenomena. We present an analysis of new and previously published
   spectropolarimetric observations of these stars. New Stokes V
   observations obtained with the high-resolution ESPaDOnS and Narval
   instruments confirm the presence of a magnetic field in one of the stars
   (C Lup), but find no evidence of magnetism in five others. A re-analysis
   of the published longitudinal field measurements obtained with the
   low-resolution FORS1/2 spectropolarimeters finds that the measurements
   of all stars show more scatter from zero than can be attributed to
   Gaussian noise, suggesting the presence of a signal and/or systematic
   underestimation of error bars. Re-reduction and re-measurement of the
   FORS1/2 spectra from the ESO archive demonstrates that small changes in
   reduction procedure lead to substantial changes in the inferred
   longitudinal field, and substantially reduces the number of field
   detections at the 3 sigma level. Furthermore, we find that the published
   periods are not unique solutions to the time series of either the
   original or the revised FORS1/2 data. We conclude that the reported
   field detections, proposed periods, and field geometry models for alpha
   Pyx, 15 CMa, 33 Eri, and V1449 Aql are artifacts of the data analysis
   and reduction procedures, and that magnetic fields at the reported
   strength are no more common in SPB/beta Cep stars than in the general
   population of B stars.}},

Abstract = {{Gas absorption accompanied by an irreversible chemical reaction of
   first-order or second-order in a liquid layer of finite thickness in

   enhancement factor has been derived for the case of a first-order

   obtained via numerical simulation for the case of a second-order
   reaction. The enhancement factor in both cases is presented as a
   function of the Fourier number and tends to deviate from the prediction
   of the existing enhancement factor expressions based on the penetration
   theory at Fourier numbers above 0.1 due to the absence of a well-mixed
   bulk region in the liquid layer. Approximate enhancement factor
   expressions that describe the analytical and exact solutions with an
   accuracy of 5?\% and 9?\%, respectively, have been proposed.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method of probabilistic analysis to investigate
   the impact of stochastic uncertainty of grid-connected wind generation
   on power system small-signal stability. The proposed method is
   ``analytical{''} in contrast to the numerical method of Monte Carlo
   simulation which relies on large number of random computations. It can
   directly calculate the probabilistic density function (PDF) of critical
   eigenvalues of a large-scale power system from the PDF of grid-connected
   multiple sources of wind power generation, thus to determine the
   probabilistic small-signal stability of the power system as affected by
   the wind generation. In the paper, an example of 16-machine power system
   with three grid-connected wind farms is used to demonstrate the
   application of the proposed method. The results of probabilistic
   stability analysis of the example power system are confirmed by the
   Monte Carlo simulation. It is shown that the stochastic variation of
   grid-connected wind generation can cause the system to lose stability
   even though the system is stable deterministically. The higher the level
   of wind penetration is, the more the probability that the system becomes
   unstable could be. Hence indeed penetration of stochastically variable
   wind generation threatens stable operation of power systems as far as
   system small-signal stability is concerned.}},

Abstract = {{Fire protection of pressure vessels for transport and storage of
   dangerous goods is an active topic of research around the world. In many
   cases, organizations are conducting theoretical analysis followed by
   fire testing of thermal protection systems to determine how long they
   delay thermally induced failure, or if they eliminate failure. In most
   recent cases the organizations chose to do small scale fire testing
   because of the obvious cost savings.
   The question then is - are small scale experiments representative of
   highway tank truck and rail tank car scales? This paper discusses the
   scale issues involved. It goes on to show how identical fire heating
   conditions can give dramatically different failure times and modes of
   failure for small and large scale tanks if the conditions are not truly
   similar. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{901-911}},

Abstract = {{Heat generated by the biodegradation of waste and other chemical
   processes in a landfill can potentially affect the long-term performance
   of landfill liner system, in particular that of a high-density
   polyethylene geomembrane. In a double liner system, the difference in
   leachate exposure and temperature might improve the long-term
   performance of the secondary geomembrane compared to that of the primary
   geomembrane. However, in some cases, the temperature is likely to be
   high enough to substantially reduce the service-life of the secondary
   geomembrane. This study explores the possible effectiveness of using
   tire chips as thermal insulation between primary and secondary liners to
   reduce the temperature of secondary geomembranes as compared to
   traditional soil materials. Heat and contaminant migration analyses are
   performed for cases with no insulation and for cases in which a layer of
   soil or tire chips has been used as thermal insulation between the
   primary and secondary liners. The effect of insulation on prolonging the
   service-life of a secondary geomembrane and, consequently, on
   contaminant transport through a liner system is examined for the case of
   a volatile organic compound (dichloromethane) found in landfill
   leachate. The study suggests that the use of tire chips warrants
   consideration, however there are other practical issues that require
   consideration in the detailed design and construction of landfill
   liners. Issues such as finite service-life, low working temperature,
   excessive settlement, ability to generate internal heat, leaching of
   tire chips and limitations in performing electrical resistivity leak
   detection tests are identified. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper the performance of various turbulence models potentially
   suitable for the prediction of indoor air flow and temperature
   distributions in an atrium space was evaluated in a systematic way. The
   investigation tested these models for various thermal conditions in
   atria of different geometrical configuration in two existing buildings
   using the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) modeling approach. The
   RANS turbulence models that were rested include the one-equation model
   (the Spallart-Allamaras) and two-equation models (the standard
   k-epsilon, RNG k-epsilon, realizable k-epsilon, standard k-omega and SST
   k-omega models). The radiation exchange between the surfaces of the
   atrium space was considered using the Discrete Transfer Radiation Model
   (DTRM). The resultant steady state governing equations were solved using
   a commercial CFD solver FLUENT. The numerical results obtained for a
   particular time of the day were compared with the experimental data
   available. Relatively good agreement between the experimental and CFD
   predictions was obtained for each model. However, from the results
   obtained, it was found that the performance of two-equation turbulence
   models is better than one-equation model and among the two-equation
   models, the SST k-omega model showed relatively better prediction
   capability of the indoor environment in an atrium space than
   k-epsilon-models. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an innovative sensor system, created specifically
   for new civil engineering structural monitoring applications, allowing
   specially packaged fiber grating-based sensors to be used in harsh,
   in-the-field measurement conditions for accurate strain measurement with
   full temperature compensation. The sensor consists of two fiber Bragg
   gratings that are protected within a polypropylene package, with one of
   the fiber gratings isolated from the influence of strain and thus
   responding only to temperature variations, while the other is sensitive
   to both strain and temperature. To achieve this, the
   temperature-monitoring fiber grating is slightly bent and enclosed in a
   metal envelope to isolate it effectively from the strain. Through an
   appropriate calibration process, both the strain and temperature
   coefficients of each individual grating component when incorporated in
   the sensor system can be thus obtained. By using these calibrated
   coefficients in the operation of the sensor, both strain and temperature
   can be accurately determined. The specific application for which these
   sensors have been designed is seen when installed on an innovative
   small-scale flexi-arch bridge where they are used for real-time strain
   measurements during the critical installation stage (lifting) and
   loading. These sensors have demonstrated enhanced resilience when
   embedded in or surface-mounted on such concrete structures, providing
   accurate and consistent strain measurements not only during installation
   but subsequently during use. This offers an inexpensive and highly
   effective monitoring system tailored for the new, rapid method of the
   installation of small-scale bridges for a variety of civil engineering
   applications.}},

Title = {{Effects on amorphous silicon photovoltaic performance from
   high-temperature annealing pulses in photovoltaic thermal hybrid devices}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{199-203}},

Abstract = {{There is a renewed interest in photovoltaic solar thermal (PVT) hybrid
   systems, which harvest solar energy for heat and electricity. Typically,
   a main focus of a PVT system is to cool the photovoltaic (PV) cells to
   improve the electrical performance: however, this causes the thermal
   component to under-perform compared to a solar thermal collector. The
   low temperature coefficients of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) allow the PV
   cells to be operated at high temperatures, which are a potential
   candidate for a more symbiotic PVT system. The fundamental challenge of
   a-Si:H PV is light-induced degradation known as the Staebler-Wronski
   effect (SWE). Fortunately, SWE is reversible and the a-Si:H PV
   efficiency can be returned to its initial state if the cell is annealed.
   Thus an opportunity exists to deposit a-Si:H directly on the solar
   thermal absorber plate where the cells could reach the high temperatures
   required for annealing.
   In this study, this opportunity is explored experimentally. First a-Si:H
   PV cells were annealed for 1 h at 100 degrees C on a 12 h cycle and for
   the remaining time the cells were degraded at 50 degrees C in order to
   simulate stagnation of a PVT system for 1 h once a day. It was found
   when comparing the cells after stabilization at normal 50 degrees C
   degradation that this annealing sequence resulted in a 10.6\% energy
   gain when compared to a cell that was only degraded at 50 degrees C. (C)

Title = {{Formation and Evolution of the Centennial Unconformity-Related Uranium
   Deposit in the South-Central Athabasca Basin, Canada}},
Journal = {{ECONOMIC GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{385-400}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The Centennial U deposit is situated in the south-central Athabasca
   Basin (Canada) and straddles the unconformity between early
   Paleoproterozoic to Archean metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks and
   granitoids, and the elastic sediments of the Paleoproterozoic Athabasca
   Croup. Although it has most characteristics of an unconformity-related
   uranium deposit, the Centennial deposit is atypical in that it is not
   directly associated with an electromagnetic conductor (there is a
   paucity of graphite in the basement) or with a major reverse fault zone;
   it is distal from a major fluid conduit (ca. 300 to 400 m from the
   Dufferin Lake Fault), has low Ni, Cu, Co, Zn, and Pb contents, and
   contains an unusually large amount (up to 5\%) of secondary uranyl
   minerals. Additionally, a network of diabase dikes and sills is observed
   at Centennial, seemingly intruding the main U mineralization of massive
   uraninite, based on the relatively sharp contacts between the diabase
   dike and the high-grade U mineralization.
   The pre-U alteration assemblage at Centennial includes kaolinite,
   illite, and sudoite, which have been formed by fluids with isotopic and
   chemical compositions that are comparable with those from other
   sandstone-hosted unconformity-type U deposits in the Athabasca Basin.
   Pre-U illite-related fluids have delta O-18 of ca. 3 parts per thousand
   and delta D of ca. -40 parts per thousand, whereas pre-U
   chlorite-related fluids have delta O-18 between 1.7 and 4.3 parts per
   thousand and delta D between -18 and 1 parts per thousand.
   Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS)
   U/Pb dating of the various U phases indicates that initial
   mineralization, represented by disseminated uraninite found directly to
   the north-northeast of the Centennial deposit, occurred at ca. 1.6 Ga.
   The main U mineralization, represented by massive and strongly altered
   uraninite, followed at an unknown time. A minor (<5\%) unaltered
   uraninite formed from the local remobilization of the main massive
   uraninite at ca. 380 Ma. The main uranyl mineral, uranophane, formed
   last, at ca. 2 Ma. The recurrence of local U remobilization might have
   been facilitated by the persisting high permeability of the sandstones
   in the area due to the nearby Dufferin Lake Fault and to the emplacement
   of the diabase dikes.
   The usefulness of Pb isotopes for exploration is demonstrated at the
   Centennial deposit, with strongly radiogenic Pb isotope signatures close
   to the deposit and a common Pb signature observed at a distance of a few
   km from the deposit.}},

Title = {{Basin Evolution and Unconformity-Related Uranium Mineralization: The
   Camie River U Prospect, Paleoproterozoic Otish Basin, Quebec}},
Journal = {{ECONOMIC GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The Paleoproterozoic Otish Basin, Quebec, hosts several uranium
   prospects that until recently remained underexplored and poorly
   understood. In this study, the Camie River U prospect, which shows
   similar characteristics to high-grade unconformity-related U deposits,
   is the focus of an integrated basin analysis in the western Otish Basin.
   Conglomerate and sandstone of the Indicator Formation, which were
   deposited in at least six depositional sequences, were affected by
   insignificant early diagenetic compaction and cementation. This allowed
   the formation of regional peak diagenetic aquifers, which became
   muscovite altered due to interaction with fluids having delta O-18 and
   delta H-2 values similar to those of seawater-influenced basinal brines
   at 250 degrees C.
   U mineralization at Camie River occurred at 1721 +/- 20 Ma based on a
   Pb-207/Pb-206 date obtained by laser ablation of uraninite, which
   coincides with a phase of the Otish Gabbro intrusion that has been dated
   at ca. 1730 Ma. The intrusive event promoted circulation of U-bearing
   basinal brines, triggering U mineralization at several locations in the
   western Otish Basin. Interaction of basinal brines with the Otish Gabbro
   produced coarse-grained chlorite, tourmaline, and phengitic muscovite,
   which decreased the fluid-conducting capabilities of diagenetic aquifers
   and resulted in fault zone- and fracture-dominated fluid flow.
   Subsequent fluid alteration events produced limited U remobilization,
   sulfides, sudoite, and siderite between ca. 1670 and 1410 Ma based on
   mineral paragenesis and Ar-40/Ar-39 dates of muscovite. Metamorphic
   fluids having high delta O-18 values and temperatures around 300 degrees
   C accompanied 1.2 to 1.0 Ga Grenville orogenesis and
   subgreenschist-grade metamorphism in the Otish Basin but were present at
   low water/rock ratios at Camie River and therefore produced little
   alteration. Post-Grenville uplift of the Otish Basin likely produced
   late, low-temperature alteration minerals that have been influenced by
   recent meteoric water, suggesting that the fault zones and fractures the
   minerals occupy remain as preferential fluid-flow pathways to the
   present day.
   Radiogenic Pb and the characteristic trace elements Mo + W + Nb have
   also preferentially dispersed from the mineralization along fault zones,
   fractures, and depositional sequence boundaries, and can be used to
   explore for Camic River-style U mineralization.}},

Abstract = {{The cooling process in conventional rotomolding is relatively long due
   to poor thermal conductivity of plastics. The lack of internal cooling
   is a major limitation although rapid external cooling is possible.
   Various internal cooling methodologies have been studied to reduce the
   cycle time. These include the use of compressed air, cryogenic liquid
   nitrogen, chilled water coils, and cryogenic liquid carbon dioxide, all
   of which have limitations. However, this article demonstrates the use of
   water spray cooling of polymers as a viable and effective method for
   internal cooling in rotomolding. To this end, hydraulic, pneumatic, and
   ultrasonic nozzles were applied and evaluated using a specially
   constructed test rig to assess their efficiency. The effects of nozzle
   type and different parametric settings on water droplet size, velocity,
   and mass flow rate were analyzed and their influence on cooling rate,
   surface quality, and morphology of polymer exposed to spray cooling were
   characterized. The pneumatic nozzle provided highest average cooling
   rate while the hydraulic nozzle gave lowest average cooling rate. The
   ultrasonic nozzle with medium droplet size traveling at low velocity
   produced satisfactory surface finish. Water spray cooling produced
   smaller spherulites compared to ambient cooling whilst increasing the
   cooling rate decreases the percentage crystallinity. POLYM. ENG. SCI.,

Title = {{The Miocene Nullarbor Limestone, southern Australia; deposition on a
   vast subtropical epeiric platform}},
Journal = {{SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{253}},
Pages = {{1-16}},

Abstract = {{The early to middle Miocene Nullarbor Limestone forms the vast, karsted
   Nullarbor Plain in southern Australia, and may be the most extensive
   Miocene carbonate deposit described to date. These carbonates were
   deposited at southern paleolatitudes of similar to 40 degrees S and are
   interpreted to be subtropical to warm-temperate in character because of
   the presence of certain genera of tropical coralline algae (rhodoliths
   and articulated types), large benthic foraminifera, tropical molluscs,
   zooxanthellate corals, and micrite envelopes. Facies are dominated by
   skeletal grainstones and floatstones that accumulated in three
   interpreted paleoenvironments: (1) seagrass banks (upper photic zone),
   (2) rhodolith pavements (lower photic zone), and (3) open seafloors
   (lower photic to subphotic zone). A decrease of tropical components from
   west to east across the platform implies that warm oceanic currents
   (possibly related to a proto-Leeuwin Current), as well as a period of
   warm climate (Miocene Climatic Optimum), resulted in subtropical
   deposition at southern latitudes. The Southern Ocean extended inboard
   similar to 450 km from the shelf edge during Nullarbor Limestone
   deposition, but interpreted paleodepths did not extend much below the
   base of the photic zone. A small slope angle (similar to 0.02 degrees)
   over a wide shelf (similar to 300,000 km(2)) implies deposition on an
   epeiric platform or epeiric ramp. A Miocene barrier reef was likely
   coeval with Nullarbor Limestone deposition. Therefore, the inboard
   portion of the Nullarbor Limestone can be considered part of an
   extensive back-reef lagoon system on a rimmed epeiric platform, perhaps
   attaining a size similar to the modern Great Barrier Reef system. (C)

   differentiate sources of nitrate contamination: A review}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2023-2041}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Nitrate is naturally found within the environment as part of the
   nitrogen cycle. However, anthropogenic inputs have greatly increased
   nitrate loads within ground and surface waters. This has had a severe
   impact on aquatic ecosystems and has given rise to health considerations
   in humans and livestock. Therefore, the identification of nitrate
   sources is important in preserving water quality and achieving
   sustainability of our water resources. Nitrate sources can be determined
   based on the nitrate nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) isotopic compositions
   (delta N-15, delta O-18). However, sewage and manure have overlapping
   delta N-15 and delta O-18 values making their differentiation on this
   basis problematic. The specific differentiation between sources of
   faecal contamination is of particular importance, because the risk to
   humans is usually considered higher from human faecal contamination
   (sewage) than from animal faecal contamination. This review summarises
   the current state of knowledge in using isotope tracers to differentiate
   various nitrate sources and identifies potential chemical tracers for
   differentiating sewage and manure. In particular, an in depth review of
   the current state of knowledge regarding the necessary considerations in
   using chemical markers, such as pharmaceuticals and food additives, to
   differentiate sewage and manure sources of nitrate contamination will be
   given, through an understanding of their use, occurrence and fate, in
   order to identify the most suitable potential chemical markers. (C) 2012

Title = {{Treatment of estrogens and androgens in dairy wastewater by a
   constructed wetland system}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},

Pages = {{2333-2343}},

Abstract = {{Constructed wetland systems (CWS) have been used as a low cost
   bio-filtration system to treat farm wastewater. While studies have shown
   that CWS are efficient in removing organic compounds and pathogens,
   there is limited data on the presence of hormones in this type of
   treatment system.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the CWS to
   reduce estrogenic and androgenic hormone concentration in dairy
   wastewater. This was achieved through a year long study on dairy
   wastewater samples obtained from a surface flow CWS. Analysis of
   hormonal levels was performed using a solid phase extraction (SPE)
   sample clean-up method, combined with reporter gene assays (RGAs) which
   incorporate relevant receptors capable of measuring total estrogenic or
   androgenic concentrations as low as 0.24 ng L-1 and 6.9 ng L-1
   respectively. Monthly analysis showed a mean removal efficiency for
   estrogens of 95.2\%, corresponding to an average residual concentration
   of 3.2 ng L-1 17 beta-estradiol equivalent (EEO), below the proposed
   lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC) of 10 ng L-1. However, for
   one month a peak EEQ concentration of 115 ng L-1 was only reduced to
   18.8 ng L-1. The mean androgenic activity peaked at 360 ng L-1 and a
   removal efficiency of 92.1\% left an average residual concentration of
   32.3 ng L-1 testosterone equivalent (TEQ).
   The results obtained demonstrate that this type of CWS is an efficient
   system for the treatment of hormones in dairy wastewater. However,
   additional design improvements may be required to further enhance
   removal efficiency of peak hormone concentrations. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In cartilage tissue engineering an optimized culture system, maintaining
   an appropriate extracellular environment (e. g., pH of media), can
   increase cell proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation.
   We have previously reported on a continuous-flow bioreactor that
   improves tissue growth by supplying the cells with a near infinite
   supply of medium. Previous studies have observed that acidic
   environments reduce ECM synthesis and chondrocyte proliferation. Hence,
   in this study we investigated the combined effects of a continuous
   culture system (bioreactor) together with additional buffering agents
   (e. g., sodium bicarbonate {[} NaHCO3]) on cartilaginous tissue growth
   in vitro. Isolated bovine chondrocytes were grown in three-dimensional
   cultures, either in static conditions or in a continuous-flow
   bioreactor, in media with or without NaHCO3. Tissue constructs
   cultivated in the bioreactor with NaHCO3-supplemented media were
   characterized with significantly increased (p < 0.05) ECM accumulation
   (glycosaminoglycans a 98-fold increase; collagen a 25-fold increase) and
   a 13-fold increase in cell proliferation, in comparison with static
   cultures. Additionally, constructs grown in the bioreactor with
   NaHCO3-supplemented media were significantly thicker than all other
   constructs (p < 0.05). Further, the chondrocytes from the primary
   construct expanded and synthesized ECM, forming a secondary construct
   without a separate expansion phase, with a diameter and thickness of 4
   mm and 0.72 mm respectively. Tissue outgrowth was negligible in all
   other culturing conditions. Thus this study demonstrates the advantage
   of employing a continuous flow bioreactor coupled with NaHCO3
   supplemented media for articular cartilage tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{A multiblock soft-switched bidirectional ac-ac converter using an active
   snubber is proposed in this paper. The snubber provides zero-voltage
   switching (ZVS) for the main switches of the entire power converter

   operation, the snubber block extracts the energy of the main switch
   drain-source capacitors and delivers it to the high-voltage side.
   Moreover, the snubber switches have zero-current switching (ZCS) turn-on
   and ZVS turn-off transitions. The performance of the proposed converter
   system is evaluated on a prototype including two converter blocks of
   500W working at 150 kHz with an input-voltage range of 110V (-30\% to

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2462-2470}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the concept of the adaptive current source drivers (CSDs)
   is proposed for the high-frequency synchronous buck converters. Compared
   to the previous CSD circuits, the adaptive CSD can achieve adjustable
   drive current and drive voltage according to different load condition.
   The benefit is that higher drive current and voltage lead to lower
   switching loss and conduction loss when the load current increases.
   Therefore, the adaptive CSD is able to realize optimal design to reduce
   the switching loss, the gate drive loss, and the conduction loss in a
   wide load range. It should be noted that the adaptive concept is
   suitable for both the continuous and discontinuous CSDs regardless the
   drive circuit topologies. Through investigating the CSD circuits, one
   simple method to achieve the adaptive drive current based on the
   adaptive voltage is proposed. A 12V input, 1.3V output, and 1-MHz
   synchronous buck converter with the continuous and discontinuous CSDs
   was built, respectively, to verify the advantages of the proposed
   adaptive concept and efficiency improvement.}},

Abstract = {{A popular hypothesis for human running is that gait mechanics and
   muscular activity are optimized in order to minimize the cost of
   transport (CoT). Humans running at any particular speed appear to
   naturally select a stride length that maintains a low CoT when compared
   with other possible stride lengths. However, it is unknown if the
   nervous system prioritizes the CoT itself for minimization, or if some
   other quantity is minimized and a low CoT is a consequential effect. To
   address this question, we generated predictive computer simulations of
   running using an anatomically inspired musculoskeletal model and
   compared the results with data collected from human runners. Three
   simulations were generated by minimizing the CoT, the total muscle
   activation or the total muscle stress, respectively. While all the
   simulations qualitatively resembled real human running, minimizing
   activation predicted the most realistic joint angles and timing of
   muscular activity. While minimizing the CoT naturally predicted the
   lowest CoT, minimizing activation predicted a more realistic CoT in
   comparison with the experimental mean. The results suggest a potential
   control strategy centred on muscle activation for economical running.}},

Abstract = {{The Si(111)-7 x 7 surface reconstruction can be used to template an
   array of mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene) molecules in which each
   molecule bridges a corner Si adatom and a neighboring Si rest atom. The
   molecules adsorb in corner sites to minimize a weak steric interaction
   associated with nearest-neighbor bridging sites. We demonstrate that the
   formation of the molecular array can be blocked by adding submonolayer
   amounts of Ge to the surface. The Ge atoms block the formation of the
   array because they substitute preferentially for Si adatoms located in
   corner sites, and the Ge-C bond strength is approximate to 0.8 eV weaker
   than the Si-C bond strength.}},

Abstract = {{We have discovered a 2.5 Mpc (projected) long filament of
   infrared-bright galaxies connecting two of the three similar to 5 x
   10(14) M-circle dot clusters making up the RCS 2319+00 supercluster at z
   = 0.9. The filament is revealed in a deep Herschel Spectral and
   Photometric Imaging REceiver (SPIRE) map that shows 250-500 mu m
   emission associated with a spectroscopically identified filament of
   galaxies spanning two X-ray bright cluster cores. We estimate that the
   total (8-1000 mu m) infrared luminosity of the filament is L-IR similar
   or equal to 5 x 10(12) L-circle dot, which, if due to star formation
   alone, corresponds to a total SFR similar or equal to 900 M-circle dot
   yr(-1). We are witnessing the scene of the buildup of a >10(15) M-circle
   dot cluster of galaxies, seen prior to the merging of three massive
   components, each of which already contains a population of red, passive
   galaxies that formed at z > 2. The infrared filament demonstrates that
   significant stellar mass assembly is taking place in the moderate
   density, dynamically active circumcluster environments of the most
   massive clusters at high redshift, and this activity is concomitant with
   the hierarchical buildup of large-scale structure.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{749}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{While computing an improved near-Earth object (NEO) steady-state orbital
   distribution model, we discovered in the numerical integrations the
   unexpected production of retrograde orbits for asteroids that had
   originally exited from the accepted main-belt source regions. Our model
   indicates that similar to 0.1\% (a factor of two uncertainty) of the
   steady-state NEO population (perihelion q < 1.3 AU) is on retrograde
   orbits. These rare outcomes typically happen when asteroid orbits flip
   to a retrograde configuration while in the 3: 1 mean-motion resonance
   with Jupiter and then live for similar to 0.001 to 100 Myr. The model
   predicts, given the estimated near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population, that
   a few retrograde 0.1-1 km NEAs should exist. Currently, there are two
   known MPC NEOs with asteroidal designations on retrograde orbits which
   we therefore claim could be escaped asteroids instead of devolatilized
   comets. This retrograde NEA population may also answer a long-standing
   question in the meteoritical literature regarding the origin of
   high-strength, high-velocity meteoroids on retrograde orbits.}},

Abstract = {{A quantitative research on S and SO2 poisoning Pt/Vulcan carbon (Pt/VC)
   catalysts for fuel cells was conducted by the three-electrode method.
   Pt/VC electrodes were contaminated by submersion in a SO2-containing
   solution made up of 0.2 mM Na2SO3 and 0.5 M H2SO4 for different periods
   of time, and held at 0.05 V (vs. RHE) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions in order
   to gain zero-valence sulfur (S-0) poisoned electrodes. The sulfur
   coverage of Pt was determined from the total charge consumed as the
   sulfur was oxidized from S-0 at 0.05 V (vs. RHE) to sulfate at >1.1 V
   (vs. RHE). The summation of initial coverage of S-0 (theta(S)) and
   coverage of H (theta(H)) are approximately equal to 1 (theta(H) +
   theta(S) = 1) when 0.5 < theta(H) < 1, which gives an easy way to figure
   out the quantity of sulfur adsorbed on Pt/VC. As to SO2 poisoned Pt/VC,
   the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) decreases
   linearly with the amount of SO2 adsorbed on the Pt nanoparticles when
   0.45 < theta(H) < 0.81. When the adsorbed SO2 was reduced to S-0 the
   mass activity was greatly recovered, and the area specific activity was
   even higher than the unpoisoned Pt/VC. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Two different natural zeolites having different phase compositions were
   obtained from different regions of Turkey and modified by ion-exchange
   (0.5 M NH4NO3) and acid leaching using 1 M HCl. The natural and modified
   samples were treated at low temperature (LT), high temperature (HT) and
   steam (ST) conditions and characterised by XRF, XRD, BET, FTIR,
   DR-UV-Vis, NH3-TPD and TGA. Ion-exchange with NH4+ of natural zeolites
   results in the exchange of the Na+ and Ca2+ cations and the partial
   exchange of the Fe3+ and Mg2+ cations. However, steam and acidic
   treatments cause significant dealumination and decationisation, as well
   as loss of crystalline, sintering of phases and the formation of
   amorphous material. The presence of mordenite and quartz phases in the
   natural zeolites increases the stability towards acid treatment, whereas
   the structure of clinoptilolite-rich zeolites is mostly maintained after
   high temperature and steam treatments. The natural and modified zeolites
   treated at high temperature and in steam were found to be less stable
   compared with synthetic zeolites, resulting in a loss of crystallinity,
   a decrease in the surface area and pore volume, a decrease in the
   surface acidity as well as dealumination, and decationisation. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We present a study on the transport properties through conductivity
   (sigma), viscosity (eta), and self-diffusion coefficient (D)
   measurements of two pure protic ionic liquids-pyrrolidinium hydrogen
   sulfate, {[}Pyrr]{[}HSO4], and pyrrolidinium trifluoroacetate,
   {[}Pyrr]{[}CF3COO]-and their mixtures with water over the whole
   composition range at 298.15 K and atmospheric pressure. Based on these
   experimental results, transport mobilities of ions have been then
   ivestigated in each case through the Stokes-Einstein equation. From
   this, the proton conduction in these PILs follows a combination of
   Grotthuss and vehicle-type type mechanisms, which depends also on the
   water composition in solution. In each case, the displacement of the NMR
   peak attributed to the labile proton on the pyrrolidinium cation with
   the PILs concentration in aqueous solution indicates that this proton is
   located between the cation and the anion for a water weight fraction
   lower than 8\%. In other word, for Such compositions, it appears that
   this labile proton is not solvated by water molecules. However, for
   higher water content the labile protons are in solution as H3O+. This
   water weight fraction appears to be the solvation limit of the H+ ions
   by water molecules in these two PILs solutions. However,
   {[}Pyrr]{[}HSO4] and {[}Pyrr]{[}CF3COO] PILs present opposed comportment
   in aqueous solution. In the case of {[}Pyrr]{[}CF3COO], eta, sigma, D
   and the attractive potential, E-pov between ions indicate clearly that
   the diffusion of each ion is similar. In other words, these ions are
   tightly bound together as ion pairs, reflecting in fact the importance
   of the hydrophobicity of the trifluoroacetate anion, whereas, in the
   case of the {[}Pyrr]{[}HSO4], the strong H-bond between the HSO4- anion
   and water promotes a drastic change in the viscosity of the aqueous
   solution, as well as on the conductivity which is up to 187 mS.cm(-1)
   for water weight fraction close to 60\% at 298 K.}},

Abstract = {{The switchability and bicarbonate formation of CO2 triggered aryl
   amidine and tertiary amine switchable surfactants have been
   investigated. Despite the lower basicity of these compounds compared to
   alkylacetamidine switchable surfactants, it was found that amidinium and
   ammonium bicarbonates could be formed in sufficiently high enough
   concentrations to perform emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate
   and stabilize the resulting colloidal latexes. Particle sizes ranging
   from 80 to 470 nm were obtained, and the effects of surfactant
   concentration, surfactant basicity, initiator type, initiator
   concentration, and CO2 pressure on particle size and zeta-potential have
   been examined. Destabilization of latexes is traditionally achieved by
   addition of salts, strong acids for anionically stabilized latexes, or
   alkalis for cationically stabilized latexes. However, with CO2-triggered
   switchable surfactants, only air and heat are required to destabilize
   the latex by removing CO2 from the system and switching the active
   amidinium or ammonium bicarbonate surfactant to a surface inactive
   neutral compound. This process occurs much more rapidly in the case of
   these less basic aryl amidine and tertiary amine based surfactants
   compared to previously reported alkyl amidine surfactants.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that the force-velocity relationship of skeletal
   muscle plays a critical limiting role in the maximum speed at which
   humans can sprint. However, this theory has not been tested directly,
   and it is possible that other muscle mechanical properties play limiting
   roles as well. In this study, forward dynamics simulations of human
   sprinting were generated using a 2D musculoskeletal model actuated by
   Hill muscle models. The initial simulation results compared favorably to
   kinetic, kinematic, and electromyographic data recorded from sprinting
   humans. Muscle mechanical properties were then removed in isolation to
   quantify their effect on maximum sprinting speed. Removal of the
   force-velocity, excitation-activation, and force-length relationships
   increased the maximum speed by 15, 8, and 4\%, respectively. Removal of
   the series elastic force-extension relationship decreased the maximum
   speed by 26\%. Each relationship affected both stride length and stride
   frequency except for the force-length relationship, which mainly
   affected stride length. Removal of all muscular properties entirely
   (optimized joint torques) increased speed ( +22\%) to a greater extent
   than the removal of any single contractile property. The results
   indicate that the force-velocity relationship is indeed the most
   important contractile property of muscle regarding limits to maximum
   sprinting speed, but that other muscular properties also play important
   roles. Interactions between the various muscular properties should be
   considered when explaining limits to maximal human performance. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{This article presents a continuum-level constitutive model of a single
   crystal deforming by dislocation climb, accounting for crystallography
   and dislocation/point-defect interactions. The proposed constitutive
   description represents an improvement over a previous recent model,
   which extended the rate-sensitivity approach for single crystal
   plasticity by dislocation glide to consider the deformation geometry of
   dislocation climb under the assumption of instantaneous restoration of
   equilibrium concentration of vacancies near climbing dislocations. The
   key element of the new model is a chemical stress parameter, which
   represents the additional driving force on climbing dislocations due the
   excess vacancy concentration. The original and new versions of the
   crystallographic model of climb are compared through a simple example of
   a strongly anisotropic single crystal that illustrates the differences
   in response due to the consideration or not of the chemical driving
   force for climb. (C) 2012 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{670}},

Abstract = {{A conveniently assembled membrane-free amperometric sensor is proposed
   for the detection of oxygen in gaseous atmospheres which exploits some
   profitable properties of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), such as
   their high electrical conductivity, negligible vapour pressure and good
   thermal stability. The advantages offered by this type of medium were
   increased by adding small amounts of a further low melting salt bearing
   a quinone moiety, which allowed the reduction of O-2 to occur through an
   electrocatalytic pathway taking place at quite lower potentials than
   those required by its direct reduction. The rate constant (14,160 +/-
   370 M-1 s(-1)) of this electrocatalytic process was determined by
   resorting to linear sweep voltammetric measurements. The performance of
   this device was assayed under both flowing and static stop-flow
   conditions on synthetic O-2 + N-2 atmospheres with a controlled oxygen
   content, which was changed in a wide range (200-10(6) ppm v/v). At room
   temperature, repeatable (+/- 2.7\%) and linearly dependent current
   signals were recorded, allowing a detection limit of 140 ppm v/v
   (equivalent to 6.2 x 10(-6) mol of O-2 per L of gaseous atmosphere) to
   be inferred. At higher temperatures (100 degrees C) a lower detection
   limit (10 ppm v/v, equivalent to 4.5 x 10(-7) mol of O-2 per L of
   gaseous atmosphere) could be instead estimated. The possibility of
   profiting from this sensor for monitoring oxygen under reduced pressure
   was also assayed, in view of the growing importance attached to the
   evaluation of residual O-2 in food packaging under vacuum or controlled
   atmospheres. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Improved solutions for the porosity and specific surface of uniform
   porous media with the attached film are provided for four regular
   packing arrangements. These solutions overcome the limitations of
   previous solutions, which did not cover the full range of film
   thicknesses to complete occlusion of the pore space in the porous media.
   The void spaces within the clogged porous media are analyzed
   geometrically. The exact solutions for the volume and surface area of
   overlapping shapes and isolated void spaces are formulated in terms of
   integrals. New polynomial solutions are proposed to replace the
   numerical integration in the complete solutions to allow easy
   implementation in numerical models. With the new solutions, both the
   porosity and specific surface gradually decrease from the initial values
   to zero when the film increases to complete pore occlusion. These
   solutions have application in numerical modeling of the growth of
   organic mass and deposition of inorganic mass in leachate collection
   systems and other similar systems in which there maybe growth of a
   semipermeable film on the surface of the particles in a relatively
   uniformly graded granular porous medium. DOI:

Abstract = {{Estimation of the pulling forces during installation is an important
   step in the successful design of a horizontal directional drilling
   project. Moreover, estimation of the postinstallation loads is important
   for the prediction of the long-term performance of the installed pipe.
   An algorithm is developed to calculate the short and long-term response
   of steel (elastic) and polymeric (viscoelastic and viscoplastic) pipes
   installed using horizontal directional drilling. The program simulates
   the movement of the pulling head, calculates the installation loads, and
   employs nonlinear, time-dependent constitutive models to calculate the
   polyethylene pipe response. The program is evaluated by comparing its
   calculations with known solutions, as well as with other commonly used
   load estimation methods. After evaluation, the analysis is used to
   analyze a typical horizontal directional drilling installation. It is
   shown that the pipe experiences cyclic response during installation and
   a combination of creep and stress relaxation in the long-term. DOI:

Abstract = {{The use of carbon fibre composites is growing in many sectors but their
   use remains stronger in very high value industries such as aerospace
   where the demands of the application more easily justify the high energy

   input is returned through gains over the whole life of the product, with
   for example, longer maintenance intervals for an aircraft and lower fuel
   burn. Thermoplastic composites however have a different energy and cost
   profile compared to traditional thermosets with notable differences in
   recyclability, but this profile is not well quantified or documented.
   This study considers the key process control parameters and identifies
   an optimal window for processing, along with the effect this has on the
   final characteristics of the manufactured parts. Interactions between

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) prestressed concrete poles offer
   a durable, light-weight alternative to conventional steel-reinforced or
   prestressed concrete poles. In particular, the corrosion resistance of
   the CFRP tendons can result in lower maintenance costs and a reduction
   in the required concrete cover. For lighting poles used in pedestrian or
   low-trafficked areas, wind loading represents a dominant load case. The
   wind acts as a transient force and can blow from any direction. It is
   therefore of interest to investigate how CFRP prestressed lighting poles
   perform under repeated cyclic loads and/or load reversals. Experiments
   were carried out on pole sections tested horizontally. These included a
   static control test and a conventional fatigue test where a cyclic load
   was applied in a downwards direction for 2 million cycles. Three further
   fatigue tests where the load direction changed, either after a defined
   number of cycles or within a load cycle, were also conducted. It was
   found that all the poles performed adequately for 1-2 million cycles of
   loading and that the majority of any deflection increases occurred
   within the first 50,000 cycles. It is believed that repeated cyclic
   loading may have increased the tendon debonding at the crack locations.
   Localised debonding potentially relieves the stress in the outermost
   tendon layer which delays the onset of failure and allows the inner
   tendon layers to take up further stress thus leading to a higher load
   carrying capacity. Loading orientation reversal from a downwards to an
   upwards direction within a loading cycle did not result in a greater
   stiffness degradation when compared to the other fatigue tests. The
   initial findings suggest that in-service cyclic loading and load
   reversals will not be detrimental to the performance of CFRP prestressed
   concrete poles.}},

Abstract = {{Unlabelled single- and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA,
   respectively) has been detected at concentrations =10-9?M by
   surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Under appropriate conditions the
   sequences spontaneously adsorbed to the surface of both Ag and Au
   colloids through their nucleobases; this allowed highly reproducible
   spectra with good signal-to-noise ratios to be recorded on completely
   unmodified samples. This eliminated the need to promote absorption by
   introducing external linkers, such as thiols. The spectra of model ssDNA
   sequences contained bands of all the bases present and showed systematic
   changes when the overall base composition was altered. Initial tests
   also showed that small but reproducible changes could be detected
   between oligonucleotides with the same bases arranged in a different
   order. The spectra of five ssDNA sequences that correspond to different
   strains of the Escherichia coli bacterium were found to be sufficiently
   composition-dependent so that they could be differentiated without the
   need for any advanced multivariate data analysis techniques.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a relay precoding problem is considered in a
   non-regenerative multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) relay system,
   when multiple interferers exist near the destination. The relay has the
   perfect channel state information (CSI) of the source-relay link and
   only the covariance information of the relay-destination link. Also, we
   assume that the training signals of the interferers are known at the
   destination, and thus, the covariance information of the channels from
   the interferers to the destination can be estimated at the destination
   and the information is fed back to the relay. For this scenario, the
   structure of the optimal relay precoder is derived to maximize the
   average capacity seen by the relay under a relay transmit power
   constraint. For the derivation of the optimal relay precoder, a new
   partial ordering result for the outage probability and the ergodic
   capacity of spatially correlated MIMO channels is derived. Numerical
   results demonstrate that the proposed scheme considerably improves the
   performance. Overall, the contributions of this paper are twofold: i) a
   new partial ordering result for MIMO channels is derived and ii) the
   structure of the optimal relay precoder is derived using the partial
   ordering result.}},

Abstract = {{Acetonitrile is regarded as a key solvent in the pharmaceutical
   industry. However, the volatility in acetonitrile supply in recent
   years, coupled with its relatively poor environmental profile, has
   presented significant challenges to its use in manufacturing processes
   and laboratories. This study investigates the importance of acetonitrile
   in the pharmaceutical industry and critically examines several options
   for reducing the exposure of the industry to future supply problems
   whilst also improving its life cycle management. The physicochemical
   properties of acetonitrile were compared with other typical process
   solvents and the Conductor-like Screening Model (COSMO) surfaces and
   sigma profiles were used to help explain the favorable solvation
   behaviour of acetonitrile. Several options for the replacement or
   recovery and recycle of acetonitrile were critically examined in the
   contexts of environmental, technical, and economic feasibility.
   Azeotropic distillation was found to be the most likely approach to
   recovering acetonitrile from aqueous waste streams. Several potential
   breaking agents were assessed against a range of selection rules based
   on residue curve maps, determined using the Universal Functional
   Activity Coefficient (UNIFAC) method, and potential processing issues. A
   range of ionic liquids were screened via the predictive Conductor-like
   Screening Model for Realistic Solvation (COSMO-RS) approach and several
   promising candidates were identified. Experimental vapor liquid
   equilibria studies were carried out, confirming the feasibility of ionic
   liquid-enhanced azeotropic distillation as a novel approach to
   acetonitrile recovery.}},

Abstract = {{We show that the Si(111)-7 x 7 surface reconstruction can be used to
   template an ordered array of 1,3,5-trimethyl benzene (mesitylene)

   admissible adsorption geometries, for small aromatic molecules on 7 x 7,
   is suppressed, and the molecules are found to occupy both halves of the
   7 x 7 unit cell with equal probability. It is argued that a steric
   interaction, associated with the methyl groups, hinders nearest neighbor
   adsorption and this leads to the formation of an array that has the
   molecules at the corners of the 7 x 7 half unit cells. To understand the
   ordering kinetics we used: scanning tunneling microscopy to study site
   occupancy as a function of coverage, ab initio total energy calculation
   to study the stability of the attachment sites and kinetic Monte Carlo
   modeling to investigate the emergence of translational order in the
   overlayer.

   When two mesitylene molecules adsorb in nearest neighbor bridging
   geometries on the 7 x 7 reconstruction, the hydrogen atoms located on
   the methyl groups interact. To reduce the interaction energy, the
   molecules form an ordered array that places each molecule at the corner
   of the half cell. (C) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{A methodology is provided for the application of Light Detection and
   Ranging (LiDAR) to automated solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment analysis
   on the regional scale. Challenges in urban information extraction and
   management for solar PV deployment assessment are determined and
   quantitative solutions are offered. This paper provides the following
   contributions: (i) a methodology that is consistent with recommendations
   from existing literature advocating the integration of
   cross-disciplinary competences in remote sensing (RS), GIS, computer
   vision and urban environmental studies; (ii) a robust methodology that
   can work with low-resolution, incomprehensive data and reconstruct
   vegetation and building separately, but concurrently; (iii)
   recommendations for future generation of software. A case study is
   presented as an example of the methodology. Experience from the case
   study such as the trade-off between time consumption and data quality
   are discussed to highlight a need for connectivity between demographic
   information, electrical engineering schemes and GIS and a typical factor
   of solar useful roofs extracted per method. Finally, conclusions are
   developed to provide a final methodology to extract the most useful
   information from the lowest resolution and least comprehensive data to
   provide solar electric assessments over large areas, which can be
   adapted anywhere in the world.}},
