Abstract = {{This paper investigates the impacts of offshore wind power forecast
   error on the operation and management of a pool-based electricity market
   in 2050. The impact from offshore wind power forecast errors of up to
   2000 MW on system generation costs, emission costs, dispatch-down of
   wind, number of startups and system marginal price are analysed. The
   main findings of this research are an increase in system marginal prices
   of approximately 1\% for every percentage point rise in the offshore
   wind power forecast error regardless of the average forecast error sign.
   If offshore wind power generates less than forecasted (-13\%) generation
   costs and system marginal prices increases by 10\%. However, if offshore
   wind power generates more than forecasted (4\%) the generation costs
   decrease yet the system marginal prices increase by 3\%. The dispatch
   down of large quantities of wind power highlights the need for flexible
   interconnector capacity. From a system operator's perspective it is more
   beneficial when scheduling wind ahead of the trading period to forecast
   less wind than will be generated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The performance of a fusion-based needle deflection estimation method
   was experimentally evaluated using prostate brachytherapy phantoms. The
   accuracy of the needle deflection estimation was determined. The
   robustness of the approach with variations in needle insertion speed and
   soft tissue biomechanical properties was investigated.
   A needle deflection estimation method was developed to determine the
   amount of needle bending during insertion into deformable tissue by
   combining a kinematic deflection model with measurements taken from two
   electromagnetic trackers placed at the tip and the base of the needle.
   Experimental verification of this method for use in prostate
   brachytherapy needle insertion procedures was performed. A total of 21
   beveled tip, 18 ga, 200 mm needles were manually inserted at various
   speeds through a template and toward different targets distributed
   within 3 soft tissue mimicking polyvinyl chloride prostate phantoms of
   varying stiffness. The tracked positions of both the needle tip and base
   were recorded, and Kalman filters were applied to fuse the sensory
   information. The estimation results were validated using ground truth
   obtained from fluoroscopy images.
   The manual insertion speed ranged from 8 to 34 mm/s, needle deflection
   ranged from 5 to 8 mm at an insertion depth of 76 mm, and the elastic
   modulus of the soft tissue ranged from 50 to 150 kPa. The accuracy and
   robustness of the estimation method were verified within these ranges.
   When compared to purely model-based estimation, we observed a reduction
   in needle tip position estimation error by \% (mean SD) and the
   cumulative deflection error by \%.
   Fusion of electromagnetic sensors demonstrated significant improvement
   in estimating needle deflection compared to model-based methods. The
   method has potential clinical applicability in the guidance of needle
   placement medical interventions, particularly prostate brachytherapy.}},

Abstract = {{The Niagara Tunnel Project is a water diversion tunnel that was
   constructed in Niagara Falls, ON, Canada. The tunnel was excavated by a
   14.4-m-diameter tunnel boring machine that passed through 11 geological
   formations. The rock types included limestone, sandstone, siltstone,
   shale, and mudstone. The overbreak was divided into four zones,
   evaluated by observations as the tunnel excavation progressed. Overbreak
   within the Rochester, Neagha, and Grimsby Formations was < 0.6 m deep
   typically, measured perpendicular to the designed excavation perimeter.
   The Power Glen Formation had overbreak as deep as 2.7 m. The deepest
   overbreak was measured in the Queenston Formation, where 3-4 m was
   typical and associated with the tunnel alignment. Maximum overbreak
   occurred when the tunnel was aligned perpendicular to the maximum
   horizontal stress. The overbreak was focused in the crown and inverted,
   with only minor volumes of sidewall overbreak occurring. The deep
   overbreak within the Queenston was overcome by utilizing spiles and
   adjusting the tunnel alignment to minimize the duration of excavation in
   the Queenston Formation. The tunnel went into operation in March, 2013.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Numerous approaches have been suggested for differentiating point and
   diffuse sources of nitrate contamination, including nitrate stable
   isotopes, microbiological analyses, genetic markers and chemical
   markers. Each approach has its own strengths and limitations. As a
   result, the most appropriate approach to use largely depends upon the
   scenario and the context of the study. However, available data on
   nitrate source determination is highly fragmented and approach
   dependent, with very little if any interface between the different
   techniques. This makes it difficult for stakeholders to identify the
   most suitable approach to adopt in a specific scenario. Therefore, this
   paper examines the development and application of a decision-support
   tool to support environmental forensics studies for nitrate
   contamination. In particular, this tool can support policy makers,
   regulators and operators within the field in understanding the
   environmental hazards and processes resulting from nitrate
   contamination, and to implement appropriate actions for limiting the
   impacts that may arise from such contamination. The tool was developed
   using the IDEF0 modeling system, and evaluated by interviewing key
   stakeholders who suggested a number of important implications for
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{The time to rupture of a 1.5-mm-thick high-density polyethylene
   geomembrane aged in a typical landfill composite liner configuration is
   investigated under a pressure of 250 kPa at 85 degrees C. The
   geomembrane was underlain with a geosynthetic clay liner and had a 560
   g/m(2) needle-pinched nonwoven geotextile protection layer separating it
   from 50 mm of drainage gravel containing leachate. Seventeen
   (0.6-m-diameter) tests were conducted. In addition to 9 months required
   to deplete antioxidants (Stage I), the tests indicated a lag period
   (Stage II) of 5.5 months and a time from the start of degradation to
   rupture (Stage III) of 20 months, giving a total inferred time to
   rupture of 34.5 months (2.9 years). There were up to 61 brittle ruptures
   per sample (i.e. >2 million cracks per hectare). The ruptures were
   predominately oriented in the machine direction and located (1) directly
   beneath a gravel contact, (2) at the side of a gravel indentation, or
   (3) between gravel indentations. The ruptures between gravel
   indentations were the least frequent but largest. The calculated strains
   perpendicular to the rupture direction were 24 +/- 6\%. Rupture
   occurred, although the average stress-crack resistance for all ruptured
   geomembrane samples still was approximately 760 +/- 200 h, with a
   minimum of 360 h. These results indicate the importance of minimizing
   tensile strains in the geomembrane in the design of a liner system. (C)

   to the hot reservoir. Solar thermal collectors supplied heat to the cold
   storage and operated at a higher efficiency due to the heat pump
   reducing the temperature of the collector working fluid. The combination
   of the heat pump and solar thermal collectors allows more heat to be
   harvested at a lower temperature, and then boosted to a suitable
   temperature for domestic use via the heat pump. The IMS and the
   building's energy loads were modeled using the TRNSYS simulation
   software. A parametric study was conducted to optimize the control,
   sizing, and configuration of the system. The simulation results
   suggested that the investigated system can achieve a free energy ratio
   (FER) of about 0.583 for the high performance house designed for the
   Ottawa climate.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic and inertial measurement units (MIMUs) have been widely used as
   an alternative to traditional camera-based motion capture systems for 3D
   joint kinematics measurement. Since these sensors do not directly
   measure position, a pre-trial anatomical calibration, either with the
   assistance of a special protocol/apparatus or with another motion
   capture system is required to establish the transformation matrices
   between the local sensor frame and the anatomical frame (AF) of each
   body segment on which the sensors are attached. Because the axes of AFs
   are often used as the rotational axes in the joint angle calculation,
   any difference in the AF determination will cause discrepancies in the
   calculated joint angles. Therefore, a direct comparison of joint angles
   between MIMU systems and camera-based systems is less meaningful because
   the calculated joint angles contain a systemic error due to the
   differences in the AF determination. To solve this problem a new
   post-trial AF alignment procedure is proposed. By correcting the AF
   misalignments, the joint angle differences caused by the difference in
   AF determination are eliminated and the remaining discrepancies are
   mainly from the measurement accuracy of the systems themselves. Lower
   limb joint angles from 30 walking trials were used to validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed AF alignment procedure. This technique
   could serve as a new means for calibrating magnetic/inertial
   sensor-based motion capture systems and correcting for AF misalignment
   in scenarios where joint angles are compared directly.}},

Title = {{Offshore wind farm impacts on surface waves and circulation in Eastern
   Lake Ontario}},
Journal = {{COASTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{32-39}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A coupled wave and hydrodynamic model was applied to the Kingston Basin
   of eastern Lake Ontario, a region with bathymetric variability due to
   channels and shoals, to assess the potential impacts on surface waves
   and wind-driven circulation of an offshore wind farm. The model was used
   to simulate a series of storm events with time-varying wind forcing and
   validated against wave, current and water level observations. The wind
   farm was simulated by adding semi-permeable structures in the surface
   wave model to represent the turbine monopiles, and by adding an energy
   loss term to the fluid momentum equations in the hydrodynamic model to
   represent the added drag of the monopiles on the flow. The results
   suggest that the wind farm would have a small influence on waves and
   circulation throughout the wind farm area, with spatial variability due
   to focussing of wave energy and re-direction of the flow. Overall, the
   results indicate that the wave height in coastal areas will be minimally
   affected with changes in significant wave height predicted to be <3\%.
   Larger changes to the strength of circulation occur inside the wind farm
   region with localized changes in current magnitude of up to 8 cm s(-1).
   The results of this study may help to understand the impacts of future
   offshore wind farms and other offshore structures in the Great lakes.

Abstract = {{This paper introduces hybrid address spaces as a fundamental design
   methodology for implementing scalable runtime systems on many-core
   architectures without hardware support for cache coherence. We use
   hybrid address spaces for an implementation of MapReduce, a programming
   model for large-scale data processing, and the implementation of a
   remote memory access (RMA) model. Both implementations are available on
   the Intel SCC and are portable to similar architectures. We present the
   design and implementation of HyMR, a MapReduce runtime system whereby
   different stages and the synchronization operations between them
   alternate between a distributed memory address space and a shared memory
   address space, to improve performance and scalability. We compare HyMR
   to a reference implementation and we find that HyMR improves performance
   by a factor of 1.71 x over a set of representative MapReduce benchmarks.
   We also compare HyMR with Phoenix(++), a state-of-art implementation for
   systems with hardware-managed cache coherence in terms of scalability
   and sustained to peak data processing bandwidth, where HyMR demonstrates
   improvements of a factor of 3.1 x and 3.2x respectively. We further
   evaluate our hybrid remote memory access (HyRMA) programming model and
   assess its performance to be superior of that of message passing. (C)

Abstract = {{The use of ultrasonic sensor technology to detect incipient and evolving
   defects in rotating components such as bearings and gears is more
   desirable due to their high resolution. In a previous study, the
   sensitivity of a variety of sensors including an air-coupled ultrasound
   transducer to bearing faults was analyzed and thoroughly discussed. This
   article investigates the effectiveness of two ultrasonic sensors,
   namely, air-coupled and piezoelectric ultrasound transducers for rolling
   element bearings damage diagnostics. The former is a noncontact sensor
   and the latter is a contact sensor An accelerometer was also used as the
   baseline sensor for comparison purposes. A series of tests was carried
   out on a laboratory test rig running with defective and undamaged
   healthy bearings under variable shaft speeds and several radial loads.
   The data were analyzed using selected signal processing techniques
   covering time, frequency, and advanced joint time frequency domains. The
   results showed that certain acoustic features were responsive to the
   variation of operational condition and the damage; the detection
   capability of the sensors varied depending on the defect size, its
   location, as well as the applied signal analysis technique.}},

Abstract = {{Chondrocyte sensitization and desensitization to mechanical stimuli are
   complex phenomena that have not been fully described. In this study, we
   investigated the temporal response of chondrocytes to dynamic mechanical
   loading and whether changes in calcium signaling could be used a
   predictor of the biosynthetic response. Cell-seeded agarose gels
   pre-incubated with an intracellular Ca2+ dye (Fluo-4) were subjected to
   dynamic compressive loading under varying conditions (amplitude and
   duration). Induced changes in Ca2+ signaling were determined by confocal
   imaging and matrix biosynthesis by radioisotope incorporation. It was
   observed that chondrocytes required a minimum amount of stimulation in
   order to elicit an anabolic response and they quickly became insensitive
   to the imposed stimulus. The response appeared to be amplitude dependent
   and could be predicted by measuring resultant changes in Ca2+ signaling.
   A positive correlation between Ca2+ signaling and matrix synthesis was
   achieved when changes in Ca2+ signaling was expressed as a relative
   number of cells experiencing multiple transients. In addition, these
   changes in Ca2+ signaling were effective at determining optimal recovery
   period between successive applications of intermittent mechanical
   loading, in which full mechanosensitivity was achieved when Ca2+
   signaling was allowed to return to baseline (control) levels. The use of
   Ca2+ signaling to predict the effectiveness of a particular mechanical
   stimulus as well as to determine optimal refractory periods appears to
   be advantageous over empirical-based approaches. Future work will
   investigate the process of Ca2+ ion sequestration into intracellular

Abstract = {{a Through the use of high partial pressures of CO2 (pCO(2)) to
   facilitate temporary pH reductions in two-phase partitioning bioreactors
   (TPPBs), improved pH dependent partitioning of butyric acid was observed
   which achieved in situ product recovery (ISPR), alleviating end-product
   inhibition (EPI) during the production of butyric acid by Clostridium
   tyrobutyricum (ATCC 25755). Through high pressure pCO(2) studies, media
   buffering effects were shown to be substantially overcome at 60 bar
   pCO(2), resulting in effective extraction of the organic acid by the
   absorptive polymer Pebax (R) 2533, yielding a distribution coefficient
   (D) of 2.4 +/- 0.1 after 1 h of contact at this pressure. Importantly,
   it was also found that C. tyrobutyricum cultures were able to withstand
   60 bar pCO(2) for 1 h with no decrease in growth ability when returned
   to atmospheric pressure in batch reactors after several extraction
   cycles. A fed-batch reactor with cyclic high pCO(2) polymer extraction
   recovered 92 g of butyric acid to produce a total of 213 g compared to
   121 g generated in a control reactor. This recovery reduced EPI in the
   TPPB, resulting in both higher productivity (0.65 vs. 0.33 g L-1 h(-1))
   and yield (0.54 vs. 0.40). Fortuitously, it was also found that repeated
   high pCO(2)-facilitated polymer extractions of butyric acid during batch
   growth of C. tyrobutyricum lessened the need for pH control, and reduced
   base requirements by approximately 50\%. Thus, high pCO(2)-mediated
   absorptive polymer extraction presents a novel method for improving
   process performance in butyric acid fermentation, and this technique
   could be applied to the bioproduction of other organic acids as well.

Abstract = {{Poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) with molecular weights greater than
   100 kg/mol is known to degrade readily in vivo while PTMC of less than
   70 kg/mol is resistant to degradation. The reason for the molecular
   weight dependent degradation rate of PTMC is unclear, and may be due to
   differences in macrophage behavior or enzyme adsorption or activity.
   Macrophage number and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
   esterase were measured when cultured on 60 and 100 kg/mol PTMC.
   Cholesterol esterase and lipase were adsorbed to 60 and 100 kg/mol PTMC
   and mass and viscoelastic properties of the adsorbed enzyme layers were
   measured. No significant differences were observed in macrophage number
   or production of degradative species. Significant differences were
   measured in mass, shear modulus and viscosity of the adsorbed
   cholesterol esterase layer, suggesting that the cholesterol esterase is
   adsorbing in a different conformation on the 60 and 100 kg/mol PTMC.
   Despite similar bulk moduli, the surface modulus of 60 kg/mol PTMC was
   significantly lower than 100 kg/mol. It is proposed that the difference
   in surface stiffness and polymer chain flexibility affect the
   arrangement of water bound to and freed from the polymer chains during
   adsorption, thus affecting enzymatic adsorption, conformation, and
   activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With most recent studies being focused on the development of advanced
   chemical adsorbents, this paper investigates the possibility of using
   two natural low-cost materials for selective adsorption. Multi-adsorbent
   systems containing tea waste (TW) and dolomite (DO) have been tested for
   their effectiveness in the removal of copper and methylene blue from
   aqueous solutions. The effects of contact time, solution pH and
   adsorption isotherms on the sorption behaviour were investigated. The
   Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms adequately described the adsorption of
   copper ions and methylene blue by both materials in different systems.
   The highest adsorption capacities for Cu and MB were calculated as 237.7
   mg/g at pH 4.5 and 150.4 mg/g at pH 7 for DO and TW:DO respectively. Tea
   waste and dolomite were characterised by Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and Energy dispersive X-ray
   analysis. The removal of Cu and MB by dolomite was mainly via surface
   complexation while physisorption was responsible for most of the Cu and
   MB adsorption onto tea waste. Identifying the fundamental mechanisms and
   behaviour is a key to the development of practical multi-adsorbent
   packed columns. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Investigating the promotional effect of methanol on the low temperature

Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{356-364}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Methanol has been shown to promote the hydrocarbon selective catalytic
   reduction of NOx with octane and toluene over 2 wt\% Ag/Al2O3 catalyst
   for the first time. In order to understand its role in the reaction fast
   transient kinetic methods and in situ DRIFTS analysis have been used.
   The catalytic activity tests showed that the addition of methanol to the
   HC-SCR reaction results in a significant improvement in the low
   temperature activity of a Ag/Al2O3 catalyst, despite the fact that
   methanol on its own is not reactive for the HC-SCR reaction. This
   promotional effect of methanol is dependent on the concentration of
   added methanol and is not necessarily associated with a higher
   concentration of reductant in the SCR feed. The fast transient kinetic
   analysis has shown that at each temperature the addition of methanol
   enhances the conversions of both NOx and octane and the production of
   N-2 with high selectivity in comparison with those observed with
   n-octane or toluene alone. This phenomenon is similar to the effect of
   H-2 which may be associated with the release of hydrogen and ammonia
   during the transient switches at 250 and 300 degrees C. Together with
   the fast transient experiments, the DRIFTS results showed that -NCO
   species are formed when introducing methanol to the n-octane-SCR feed
   while -CN species are removed/consumed from the surfaces of the Ag
   catalyst. These NCO species formed by adding methanol may play a vital
   role in promoting the catalytic activity of NOx reduction and methanol
   itself can be an in situ source for hydrogen formation, which
   subsequently enhances the SCR reaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach to speech enhancement from
   single-channel measurements involving both noise and channel distortion
   (i.e., convolutional noise), and demonstrates its applications for
   robust speech recognition and for improving noisy speech quality. The
   approach is based on finding longest matching segments (LMS) from a
   corpus of clean, wideband speech. The approach adds three novel
   developments to our previous LMS research. First, we address the problem
   of channel distortion as well as additive noise. Second, we present an
   improved method for modeling noise for speech estimation. Third, we
   present an iterative algorithm which updates the noise and channel
   estimates of the corpus data model. In experiments using speech
   recognition as a test with the Aurora 4 database, the use of our
   enhancement approach as a preprocessor for feature extraction
   significantly improved the performance of a baseline recognition system.
   In another comparison against conventional enhancement algorithms, both
   the PESQ and the segmental SNR ratings of the LMS algorithm were
   superior to the other methods for noisy speech enhancement. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{There is extensive theoretical work on measures of inconsistency for
   arbitrary formulae in knowledge bases. Many of these are defined in
   terms of the set of minimal inconsistent subsets (MISes) of the base.
   However, few have been implemented or experimentally evaluated to
   support their viability, since computing all MISes is intractable in the
   worst case. Fortunately, recent work on a related problem of minimal
   unsatisfiable sets of clauses (MUSes) offers a viable solution in many
   cases. In this paper, we begin by drawing connections between MISes and
   MUSes through algorithms based on a MUS generalization approach and a
   new optimized MUS transformation approach to finding MISes. We implement
   these algorithms, along with a selection of existing measures for flat
   and stratified knowledge bases, in a tool called MIMUS. We then carry
   out an extensive experimental evaluation of MIMUS using randomly
   generated arbitrary knowledge bases. We conclude that these measures are
   viable for many large and complex random instances. Moreover, they
   represent a practical and intuitive tool for inconsistency handling. (C)

Abstract = {{Object tracking is an active research area nowadays due to its
   importance in human computer interface, teleconferencing and video
   surveillance. However, reliable tracking of objects in the presence of
   occlusions, pose and illumination changes is still a challenging topic.
   In this paper, we introduce a novel tracking approach that fuses two
   cues namely colour and spatio-temporal motion energy within a particle
   filter based framework. We conduct a measure of coherent motion over two
   image frames, which reveals the spatio-temporal dynamics of the target.
   At the same time, the importance of both colour and motion energy cues
   is determined in the stage of reliability evaluation. This determination
   helps maintain the performance of the tracking system against abrupt
   appearance changes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
   method outperforms the other state of the art techniques in the used
   test datasets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new thermography-based maximum power point
   tracking (MPPT) scheme to address photovoltaic (PV) partial shading
   faults. Solar power generation utilizes a large number of PV cells
   connected in series and in parallel in an array, and that are physically
   distributed across a large field. When a PV module is faulted or partial
   shading occurs, the PV system sees a nonuniform distribution of
   generated electrical power and thermal profile, and the generation of
   multiple maximum power points (MPPs). If left untreated, this reduces
   the overall power generation and severe faults may propagate, resulting
   in damage to the system. In this paper, a thermal camera is employed for
   fault detection and a new MPPT scheme is developed to alter the
   operating point to match an optimized MPP. Extensive data mining is
   conducted on the images from the thermal camera in order to locate
   global MPPs. Based on this, a virtual MPPT is set out to find the global
   MPP. This can reduce MPPT time and be used to calculate the MPP
   reference voltage. Finally, the proposed methodology is experimentally
   implemented and validated by tests on a 600-W PV array.}},

Title = {{A hybrid harmony search with arithmetic crossover operation for economic
   dispatch}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{237-257}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Economic dispatch (ED) problems often exhibit non-linear, non-convex
   characteristics due to the valve point effects. Further, various
   constraints and factors, such as prohibited operation zones, ramp rate
   limits and security constraints imposed by the generating units, and
   power loss in transmission make it even more challenging to obtain the
   global optimum using conventional mathematical methods. Meta-heuristic
   approaches are capable of solving non-linear, non-continuous and
   non-convex problems effectively as they impose no requirements on the
   optimization problems. However, most methods reported so far mainly
   focus on a specific type of ED problems, such as static or dynamic ED
   problems. This paper proposes a hybrid harmony search with arithmetic
   crossover operation, namely ACHS, for solving five different types of ED
   problems, including static ED with valve point effects, ED with
   prohibited operating zones, ED considering multiple fuel cells, combined
   heat and power ED, and dynamic ED. In this proposed ACHS, the global
   best information and arithmetic crossover are used to update the newly
   generated solution and speed up the convergence, which contributes to
   the algorithm exploitation capability. To balance the exploitation and
   exploration capabilities, the opposition based learning (OBL) strategy
   is employed to enhance the diversity of solutions. Further, four
   commonly used crossover operators are also investigated, and the
   arithmetic crossover shows its efficiency than the others when they are
   incorporated into HS. To make a comprehensive study on its scalability,
   ACHS is first tested on a group of benchmark functions with a 100
   dimensions and compared with several state-of-the-art methods. Then it
   is used to solve seven different ED cases and compared with the results
   reported in literatures. All the results confirm the superiority of the
   ACHS for different optimization problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A reinforcement system for short span concrete slab bridges combining
   post-tensioned carbon FRP (CFRP) tendons with non-prestressed glass FRP
   (GFRP) reinforcement can limit the stresses in the GFRP bars to
   significantly improve fatigue performance. Despite this, the failure
   mode may be governed by shear and conventional stirrups are, in general,
   not practical for the construction of slab bridges; therefore the use of
   innovative shear reinforcement methods is required. Twenty-five
   FRP-post-tensioned slabs with various types of FRP shear reinforcement
   were tested under static or fatigue loading. The main variables included
   the size, shape and type of FRP shear reinforcement used. Fatigue shear
   strengths at one million cycles were typically in the range of 50-60\%
   of the ultimate static load capacity. Double-headed shear bars were
   found to be an excellent solution for the shear reinforcement of shallow
   concrete members which were easy to install and provided high load
   capacities and good fatigue performance. The fatigue shear strengths of
   members with anchored shear reinforcement were conservatively predicted
   using the simplified modified compression field theory, accounting for
   the change in concrete tensile strength under fatigue loading. (C) 2014

   fields in the resonant structures. However, the excitation of high
   quality factor resonances in these systems has been a challenge. We
   excite an order of magnitude higher quality factor resonances in planar
   terahertz metamaterials that we exploit for ultrasensitive sensing. The
   low-loss quadrupole and Fano resonances with extremely narrow linewidths
   enable us to measure the minute spectral shift caused due to the
   smallest change in the refractive index of the surrounding media. We
   achieve sensitivity levels of 7.75 x 10(3) nm/refractive index unit
   (RIU) with quadrupole and 5.7 x 10(4) nm/RIU with the Fano resonances
   which could be further enhanced by using thinner substrates. These
   findings would facilitate the design of ultrasensitive real time
   chemical and biomolecular sensors in the fingerprint region of the
   terahertz regime. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A series of imprinted polymers targeting nucleoside metabolites,
   prepared using a template analogue approach, are presented. These were
   prepared following selection of the optimum functional monomer by
   solution association studies using 1H NMR titrations whereby methacrylic
   acid was shown to be the strongest receptor with and affinity constant
   of 621 51 L mo1-1 vs. 110 16 L mol-1 for acrylamide. The best performing
   polymers were prepared using methanol as porogenic co-solvent and
   although average binding site affinities were marginally reduced, 2.3 x
   104 L mol-1 vs. 2.7 x 104 Lmo1-1 measured for a polymer prepared in
   acetonitrile, these polymers contained the highest number of binding
   sites, 5.27 pAnol g-1 vs. 1.64 innol g-1, while they also exhibited
   enhanced selectivity for methylated guanosine derivatives. When applied
   as sorbents in the extraction of nucleoside derivative cancer biomarkers
   from synthetic urine samples, significant sample clean-up and recoveries
   of up to 90\% for 7-methylguanosine were achieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Stokes IQUV magnetic Doppler imaging of Ap stars - III. Next generation
   chemical abundance mapping of alpha(2) CVn}},

Abstract = {{In a previous paper, we presented an updated magnetic field map for the
   chemically peculiar star alpha(2) CVn using ESPaDOnS and Narval
   time-resolved high-resolution Stokes IQUV spectra. In this paper, we
   focus on mapping various chemical element distributions on the surface
   of alpha(2) CVn. With the new magnetic field map and new chemical
   abundance distributions, we can investigate the interplay between the
   chemical abundance structures and the magnetic field topology on the
   surface of alpha(2) CVn. Previous attempts at chemical abundance mapping
   of alpha(2) CVn relied on lower resolution data. With our
   high-resolution (R = 65 000) data set, we present nine chemical
   abundance maps for the elements O, Si, Cl, Ti, Cr, Fe, Pr, Nd and Eu. We
   also derive an updated magnetic field map from Fe and Cr lines in Stokes
   IQUV and O and Cl in Stokes IV. These new maps are inferred from line
   profiles in Stokes IV using the magnetic Doppler imaging code INVERS10.
   We examine these new chemical maps and investigate correlations with the
   magnetic topology of alpha(2) CVn. We show that chemical abundance
   distributions vary between elements, with two distinct groups of
   elements; one accumulates close to the negative part of the radial
   field, whilst the other group shows higher abundances located where the
   radial magnetic field is of the order of 2 kG regardless of the polarity
   of the radial field component. We compare our results with previous
   works which have mapped chemical abundance structures of Ap stars. With
   the exception of Cr and Fe, we find no clear trend between what we
   reconstruct and other mapping results. We also find a lack of agreement
   with theoretical predictions. This suggests that there is a gap in our
   theoretical understanding of the formation of horizontal chemical
   abundance structures and the connection to the magnetic field in Ap
   stars.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{The collective excitations of a zero-temperature, spin-polarized,
   harmonically trapped, two-dimensional dipolar Fermi gas are examined
   within the Thomas-Fermi-von Weizsacker hydrodynamic theory. We focus on
   repulsive interactions and investigate the dependence of the excitation
   frequencies on the strength of the dipolar interaction and particle
   number. We find that the mode spectrum can be classified according to
   bulk modes, whose frequencies are shifted upward as the interaction
   strength is increased, and an infinite ladder of surface modes, whose
   frequencies are independent of the interactions in the large particle
   limit. We argue quite generally that it is the local character of the
   two-dimensional energy density that is responsible for the insensitivity
   of surface excitations to the dipolar interaction strength and not the
   precise form of the equation of state. This property will not be found
   for the collective excitations of harmonically trapped, dipolar Fermi
   gases in one and three dimensions, where the energy density is
   manifestly nonlocal.}},

Title = {{THE NEXT GENERATION VIRGO CLUSTER SURVEY. VIII. THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION
   OF GLOBULAR CLUSTERS IN THE VIRGO CLUSTER}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{794}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{We report on a large-scale study of the distribution of globular
   clusters (GCs) throughout the Virgo cluster, based on photometry from
   the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS), a large imaging survey
   covering Virgo's primary subclusters (Virgo A = M87 and Virgo B = M49)
   out to their virial radii. Using the g(o)', (g' - i')(o) color-magnitude
   diagram of unresolved and marginally resolved sources within the NGVS,
   we have constructed two-dimensional maps of the (irregular) GC
   distribution over 100 deg(2) to a depth of g(o)' = 24. We present the
   clearest evidence to date showing the difference in concentration
   between red and blue GCs over the full extent of the cluster, where the
   red (more metal-rich) GCs are largely located around the massive
   early-type galaxies in Virgo, while the blue (metal-poor) GCs have a
   much more extended spatial distribution with significant populations
   still present beyond 83' (similar to 215 kpc) along the major axes of
   both M49 and M87. A comparison of our GC maps to the diffuse light in
   the outermost regions of M49 and M87 show remarkable agreement in the
   shape, ellipticity, and boxiness of both luminous systems. We also find
   evidence for spatial enhancements of GCs surrounding M87 that may be
   indicative of recent interactions or an ongoing merger history. We
   compare the GC map to that of the locations of Virgo galaxies and the
   X-ray intracluster gas, and find generally good agreement between these
   various baryonic structures. We calculate the Virgo cluster contains a
   total population of N-GC = 67,300 +/- 14,400, of which 35\% are located
   in M87 and M49 alone. For the first time, we compute a cluster-wide
   specific frequency SN, CL = 2.8 +/- 0.7, after correcting for Virgo's
   diffuse light. We also find a GC-to-baryonic mass fraction is an element
   of(b) = 5.7 +/- 1.1 x 10(-4) and a GC-to-total cluster mass formation
   efficiency C-t = 2.9 +/- 0.5 x 10(-5), the latter values slightly lower
   than but consistent with those derived for individual galactic halos.
   Taken as a whole, our results show that the production of the complex
   structures in the unrelaxed Virgo cluster core (including the production
   of the diffuse intracluster light) is an ongoing and continuing process.}},

Abstract = {{We employ a quasimode representation of the adjoint master equation to
   study nonlinear pair-generation dynamics via spontaneous four-wave
   mixing in coupled-cavity systems in the presence of scattering loss.
   Perturbative analytic solutions for signal and idler photon-number
   operators are derived, which enable us to examine the effect of
   scattering loss on pair-generation dynamics. In particular, for a simple
   three-mode system, we show that any loss mismatch for the signal and
   idler photons increases the probability of finding unpaired photons.
   While decreasing the loss rates for signal and idler photons increases
   the pair signal brightness, it also results in higher generation rates
   for multiple pairs in the system, which can result in lower operational
   signal-to-noise ratios.}},

Abstract = {{A relay communication system where its nodes are equipped with multiple
   antennas is considered. The relay applies a transformation matrix on its
   received signal and forwards it to the destination. The authors show
   that, given a limited relay transmit power, the transformation matrix
   which maximises the signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) is almost surely a
   rank-one matrix. Such a singular transformation matrix prevents accurate
   channel estimation. As a remedy, they impose a constraint on the
   condition number (CN) of the relay transformation matrix. They prove
   that the optimal relay matrix under this new constraint has up to two
   distinct singular values. Thus, the relay transmits some power in all
   directions, and this small energy allows better channel estimation. The
   author's simulation results show that imposing the CN constraint on the
   relay matrix results in some small loss in the SNR which is quantified
   in this study; however, the optimal relay matrix enables the receivers
   to track the channel state information.}},

Abstract = {{Linear isotactic polypropylene (PP) was chemically modified by
   solvent-free, peroxide-initiated grafting of trimethylolpropane
   trimethacrylate and triallyl trimesate. The resulting coagent-modified
   PP materials possessed bimodal molecular weight and branching
   distributions, whose populations varied with coagent structure. In
   addition to changing polymer chain architecture, these chemical
   modifications generated a small amount of well-dispersed,
   coagent-derived nanoparticles. When compared with the parent material
   and PP samples treated with peroxide alone, coagent-modified materials
   demonstrated significantly higher crystallization temperatures and
   crystallization rates, as well as a finer spherulitic structure. The
   importance of a particle-induced, heterogeneous nucleation mechanism is
   confirmed by comparative analysis of a long-chain branched PP derivative
   synthesized by homogeneous silane grafting and moisture curing
   chemistry. Crystallization studies show that whereas branching has a
   moderate effect on crystallization kinetics, heterogeneous nucleation
   effects dominate the crystallization of coagent-modified PP materials.}},

Abstract = {{OB stars exhibit various types of spectral variability associated with
   wind structures, including the apparently ubiquitous discrete absorption
   components (DACs). These are proposed to be caused by either magnetic
   fields or non-radial pulsations. In this paper, we evaluate the possible
   relation between large-scale, dipolar magnetic fields and the DAC
   phenomenon by investigating the magnetic properties of a sample of 13 OB
   stars exhibiting well-documented DACbehaviour. Using high-precision
   spectropolarimetric data acquired in part in the context of theMagnetism
   in Massive Stars project, we find no evidence for surface dipolar
   magnetic fields in any of these stars. Using Bayesian inference, we
   compute upper limits on the strengths of the fields and use these limits
   to assess two potential mechanisms by which the field may influence wind
   outflow: magnetic wind confinement and local photospheric brightness
   enhancements. Within the limits we derive, both mechanisms fail to
   provide a systematic process capable of producing DACs in all of the
   stars of our sample. Therefore, this implies that dipolar fields are
   highly unlikely to be responsible for these structures in all massive
   stars, meaning that some other mechanism must come into play.}},

Abstract = {{Yttrium triflate or triflic acid catalysed Povarov reaction of methyl
   anthranilate with ethyl vinyl ether, both as aldehyde surrogate and as
   alkene, gave the desired 2-methyl-4-ethoxytetrahydroquinoline
   diastereoisomers as the major products along with four component
   coupling von Miller adducts. A proton NMR-study, using yttrium triflate
   as catalyst, revealed that the cis-diastereoisomers were the initial
   major products in both the Povarov and von Miller reactions but that
   these isomerised to the trans-diastereoisomers under the reaction
   conditions. Two distinct pathways for forming von Miller adducts were
   uncovered with the initial Povarov products being converted to von
   Miller adducts under the reaction conditions. Replacement of the
   4-ethoxy with a 4-methoxy group under acidic conditions gave
   predominantly the trans-diastereoisomer, which was subsequently
   converted to a cis/trans mixture of the tetrahydroquinoline antibiotic
   helquinoline. It was also possible to convert the von Miller products to
   Povarov products under acidic conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This work presents the results of investigation of the primary minerals
   and their weathering products of two tailing ponds near the villages of
   Rudnany and Slovinky in eastern Slovakia. The tailings are near-neutral
   or slightly alkaline (pH = 7.2-8.8) because the acidity generated by the
   decomposition of the sulfides is efficiently neutralized by the abundant
   carbonate minerals. The most frequent primary gangue minerals are
   siderite, quartz, barite, and muscovite. The prevailing primary sulfide
   minerals in both tailing ponds are pyrite and chalcopyrite; less common
   are tetrahedrite and arsenopyrite. The most frequent secondary and
   tertiary (i.e., formed in the tailings, not in the oxidation zone of the
   deposits) minerals at both localities are iron oxides, either goethite
   or poorly crystalline hydrous ferric oxide. Other minerals (cuprite,
   malachite, delafossite; identified by X-ray microdiffraction or Raman
   spectroscopy) are minor or rare and occur only in Slovinky. The iron
   oxide minerals are enriched in a suite of elements, including Cu, Si,
   Ca, Zn, As, Mg, and Mn. The transformations of the poorly crystalline
   hydrous ferric oxide to goethite and maturation of goethite is
   controlled by both high-valence tetrahedral cations (Si, As, P) and
   lower-valence octahedral cations (Cu), as shown by the measurements of
   the size of coherently diffracting domains in goethite and the chemical
   composition of goethite. The iron oxide minerals, by virtue of their
   adsorption capacity, prevent separate minerals of many metals and
   metalloids (Cu, Ca, As, Sb) from nucleating and growing, and therefore
   control the entire neutral mine drainage (NMD) system. Geochemical
   modeling of the discharged waters shows that all common Cu and ferric
   arsenate minerals are strongly undersaturated, confirming the central
   role of iron oxide phases in the NMD system.}},

Abstract = {{A framework for the development of a stability-guaranteed telerobotic
   system with an arbitrary number of masters and slaves is considered in
   this work. The method starts from a single-master/single-slave
   force-velocity control architecture, where the lumped two-port
   master-slave network is split into a distributed system of two
   multi-port master and slave networks. Additional masters and slaves can
   be introduced by adding similar multi-port networks that are connected
   to a simple sharing protocol that exchanges kinesthetic feedback among
   them. Modular stability analysis of each master or slave network,
   regardless of the underlying sharing paradigm, is conducted using the
   notion of absolute k-stability (AKS). The entire system network is
   stable if each master and slave multi-port network is AKS. Position
   correspondence can be obtained by adding a novel auxiliary coordinating
   controller that preserves the AKS of the master and slave networks. The
   stability and kinesthetic performance of the proposed control system are
   analyzed numerically and experimentally for a dual-master/single-slave
   telerobotic system.}},

   measured at 200 kHz with a spatial resolution of 22 mm using a probe
   beam, which enters the keyhole coaxially with the process beam. Keyhole
   fluctuations limited average weld depth determination to a resolution on
   the order of 100 mm. Real time keyhole depth data are compared with the
   weld depths measured from the corresponding metallographic
   crosssections. With the exception of an aluminium alloy, the technique
   accurately measured the average weld depth with differences of less than
   5\%. The keyhole depth growth rates at the start of welding are measured
   and compare well with order of magnitude calculations. The method
   described here is recommended for the real time measurement and control
   of keyhole depth in at least five different alloys.}},

Abstract = {{A series of small-scale tests was undertaken to verify if granular
   anchors could be used as a slope stabilisation technique. The nature of
   the material used and the resulting loading configuration are described
   here. The work confirms that the inclusion of anchors within a slope
   mass, irrespective of their number or orientation, significantly
   enhances the capacity and ductility of the failure mode. The small-scale

   for regional groundwater modeling of heterogeneous aquifers: Case study
   of a sedimentary aquifer intruded by volcanic dykes in Northern Ireland}},

Abstract = {{In highly heterogeneous aquifer systems, conceptualization of regional
   groundwater flow models frequently results in the generalization or
   negligence of aquifer heterogeneities, both of which may result in
   erroneous model outputs. The calculation of equivalence related to
   hydrogeological parameters and applied to upscaling provides a means of
   accounting for measurement scale information but at regional scale. In
   this study, the Permo-Triassic Lagan Valley strategic aquifer in
   Northern Ireland is observed to be heterogeneous, if not discontinuous,
   due to subvertical trending low-permeability Tertiary dolerite dykes.
   Interpretation of ground and aerial magnetic surveys produces a
   deterministic solution to dyke locations. By measuring relative
   permeabilities of both the dykes and the sedimentary host rock,
   equivalent directional permeabilities, that determine anisotropy
   calculated as a function of dyke density, are obtained. This provides
   parameters for larger scale equivalent blocks, which can be directly
   imported to numerical groundwater flow models. Different conceptual
   models with different degrees of upscaling are numerically tested and
   results compared to regional flow observations. Simulation results show
   that the upscaled permeabilities from geophysical data allow one to
   properly account for the observed spatial variations of groundwater
   flow, without requiring artificial distribution of aquifer properties.
   It is also found that an intermediate degree of upscaling, between
   accounting for mapped field-scale dykes and accounting for one regional
   anisotropy value (maximum upscaling) provides results the closest to the
   observations at the regional scale.}},

Abstract = {{Titania and doped-titania coatings can be deposited by a wide range of
   techniques; this paper will concentrate on magnetron sputtering
   techniques, including ``conventional{''} reactive co-sputtering from
   multiple metal targets and the recently introduced high power impulse
   magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). The latter has been shown to deliver a
   relatively low thermal flux to the substrate, whilst still allowing the
   direct deposition of crystalline titania coatings and, therefore, offers
   the potential to deposit photocatalytically active titania coatings
   directly onto thermally sensitive substrates. The deposition of coatings
   via these techniques will be discussed, as will the characterisation of
   the coatings by XRD, SEM, EDX, optical spectroscopy, etc. The assessment
   of photocatalytic activity and photoactivity through the decomposition
   of an organic dye (methylene blue), the inactivation of E. coli
   microorganisms and the measurement of water contact angles will be
   described. The impact of different deposition technologies, doping and
   co-doping strategies on coating structure and activity will be also

Abstract = {{Predictive water main break models can assist municipalities in
   prioritizing the replacement and rehabilitation of water mains. The aim
   of the paper is to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model to
   forecast water main breaks in the water distribution network of the City
   of Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The ANN model includes variables of
   diameter, age, length, and soil type to forecast breaks. Historical
   break data from the 1998 to 2011 period is used to develop the ANN model
   and forecast pipe breaks over a 5 year planning period. The mean square
   error, receiver operating characteristics curves, and a confusion matrix
   are used to evaluate the ANN model training and testing. The trained
   neural network correctly classified 85\% of the data set at the
   training, validation, and testing stages. Model forecasts showed lower
   pipe break rates in Kingston West, Kingston Central, and Kingston East.
   The reduction in break rate in the Kingston system was attributed to the
   removal of old pipes, and the favourable performance of pipes that are
   in the usage phase of their life cycle. The ANN model provided Utilities
   Kingston with a tool to assist them in the planning and management of
   their water main rehabilitation program.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of superficial air velocity on lovastatin production by
   Aspergillus terreus PL10 using wheat bran and wheat straw was
   investigated in a 7 L and a 1200 L packed bed reactor. Mass transfer and
   reaction limitations on bioconversion in the 1200 L reactor was studied
   based on a central composite design of experiments constructed using the
   superficial air velocity and solid substrate composition as variables
   and lovastatin production as response. The surface response prediction
   showed a maximum lovastatin production of 1.86 mg g(-1) dry substrate on
   day 5 of the bioconversion process when the reactor was operated using
   0.19 vvm airflow rate (23.37 cm min(-1) superficial air velocity) and
   54\% substrate composition, (w(c)). Lovastatin production did not
   increase significantly with superficial air velocity in the 7 L reactor.
   Variation in temperature and exit CO2 composition was recorded, and the
   Damkohler number was calculated for lovastatin production at these two
   scales. The results showed that in larger reactors mass transfer
   limitation controlled bioconversion while in smaller reactors
   bioconversion was controlled by reaction rate limitations. In addition,
   mass transfer limitations in larger reactors reduced the rate of
   metabolic heat removal, resulting in hot spots within the substrate bed.

Abstract = {{Electrolytic capacitors are extensively used in power converters but
   they are bulky, unreliable, and have short lifetimes. This paper
   proposes a new capacitor-free high step-up dc-dc converter design for
   renewable energy applications such as photovoltaics (PVs) and fuel
   cells. The primary side of the converter includes three interleaved
   inductors, three main switches, and an active clamp circuit. As a
   result, the input current ripple is greatly reduced, eliminating the
   necessity for an input capacitor. In addition, zero voltage switching
   (ZVS) is achieved during switching transitions for all active switches,
   so that switching losses can be greatly reduced. Furthermore, a
   three-phase modular structure and six pulse rectifiers are employed to
   reduce the output voltage ripple. Since magnetic energy stored in the
   leakage inductance is recovered, the reverse-recovery issue of the
   diodes is effectively solved. The proposed converter is justified by
   simulation and experimental tests on a 1-kW prototype.}},

   systems) has proved to be insufficient for indoor navigation or when
   navigating in urban canyons due to multipath and obstruction. This
   opened the gate widely for sensor-based navigation systems to be used,
   particularly after the development of low-cost microelectromechanical
   system sensors. Heading determination is one of the most important
   aspects for navigation solutions. Magnetometer is a low-cost sensor that
   can provide an absolute heading from magnetic north by sensing the
   Earth's magnetic field. Magnetometer readings are usually affected by
   magnetic fields, other than the Earth's magnetic field, and by other
   error sources; therefore, magnetometer calibration is required. In this
   paper, a technique is proposed for fast and automatic magnetometer
   calibration that requires small space coverage. There is no user
   involvement in the calibration process, and there are no required
   specific movements. The proposed technique performs 3-D-space
   magnetometer calibration using 2-D calibration equations with pitch and
   roll sectors. The 3-D-space is divided into a group of pitch and roll
   sectors. Inside each sector, 2-D calibration can be performed for the
   leveled magnetometer readings, which make the calibration process faster
   and requiring less data. This technique makes the magnetometer useful
   for determining heading in pseudo-tethered devices, particularly when
   used while driving. Pseudo-tethered navigation devices are tethered at
   normal operation, but they can change their orientation according to
   user needs such as portable vehicle navigation devices, which can be
   placed on the dashboard of a vehicle or attached to the wind shield.}},

Abstract = {{A feasibility study in state-of-the-art multi-and monomode microwave
   cavities was conducted to outline important functionalities necessary in
   a microwave setup for continuous fine-chemicals synthesis. For multimode
   operation, the heating efficiency depends on the position as well as on
   the volume distribution of the load. For monomode operation, the heating
   efficiency does not depend on the axial position and has a maximum with
   respect to the load diameter. Based on this study, a microwave setup
   consisting of four cavities was designed and constructed. The setup
   provided a defined microwave field pattern and allowed focusing of the
   microwave power. A near-uniform distribution of microwave energy in all
   four cavities of the setup was achieved at reduced grid to applicator

Abstract = {{Biocomposites are emerging as a possible sustainable alternative in
   structural applications, and as a result, a major focus should be on
   their durability. This study focuses on the environmental aging of
   bioresin glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) through immersion in
   saltwater at elevated temperatures. The resin is furfuryl alcohol based,
   derived from renewable resources, such as corncobs and sugarcanes.
   Deterioration was quantified by tensile testing of unidirectional
   bioresin GFRP coupons at various stages of exposure, and compared to
   conventional epoxy GFRP coupons under the same conditions. A total of
   150 specimens were exposed to three different environments, namely 23
   degrees, 40 degrees, and 55 degrees C water with 3\% salt concentration,
   for up to 300 days. It was found that the bioresin GFRP retained 80, 44,
   and 39\% of its original strength at the three temperatures,
   respectively. On the other hand, the epoxy GFRP exhibited 86, 72, and
   61\% strength retentions, respectively. No reductions occurred to the
   Young's moduli. The Arrhenius model was applied, assuming environments
   with mean annual temperatures of 3 degrees, 10 degrees, and 20 degrees
   C, representing different regions in North America. It was estimated
   that bioresin GFRP strength retentions after 100 years, at the three
   mean temperatures, are 65, 61, and 50\%, respectively. (C) 2014 American

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Although the use of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforcing
   bars is gaining acceptance as an alternative to conventional steel
   reinforcement in concrete structures, little empirical data exist on the
   long-term fatigue performance of GFRP bars in concrete. Abrasion at the
   bar-concrete interface is known to have an adverse effect on bonds and
   on the overall member response under cyclic loading, although this
   effect was not adequately quantified until now. This paper presents the
   results of an experimental study comparing the fatigue performance of
   GFRP bars in air with the behavior of similar bars embedded in concrete.
   The experimental findings showed that the GFRP bars tested in air
   survived fatigue lives that were approximately a full order of magnitude
   longer than similar bars in concrete beams. The results were used to
   calibrate a statistical fatigue life model and a residual stiffness
   model for GFRP bars in reinforced concrete flexural members. (C) 2014

   gas-rich interacting galaxy group NGC 871/NGC 876/NGC 877 (hereafter NGC
   871/6/7). Our H Igh-resolution data sets provide a census of the H I and
   stellar properties of the detected gas-rich group members. In addition
   to a handful of spiral, irregular and dwarf galaxies, tH Is group
   harbours an intriguing H I feature, AGC 749170, that has a gas mass of
   similar to 10(9.3)M circle dot, a dynamical-to-gas mass ratio of similar
   to 1 (assuming that the cloud is rotating and in dynamical equilibrium)
   and no optical counterpart in previous imaging. Our observations have
   revealed a faint feature in the CFHT g' and r' bands; if it is
   physically associated with AGC 749170, the latter has M/L-g > 1000M
   circle dot/L circle dot as well as a H Igher metallicity (estimated
   using photometric colours) and a significantly younger stellar
   population than the other low-mass gas-rich group members. These
   properties, as well as its spectral and spatial location with respect to
   its suspected parent galaxies, strongly indicate a tidal origin for AGC
   749170. Overall, the H I properties of AGC 749170 resemble those of
   other optically dark/dim clouds that have been found in groups. These
   clouds could represent a class of relatively long-lived H I-rich tidal
   remnants that survive in intermediate-density environments.}},

Abstract = {{In the efforts to find an anti-viral treatment for dengue, a simple
   tryptophan fluorescence-screening assay aimed at identifying dengue
   domain III envelope (EIII) protein inhibitors was developed. Residue
   Trp391 of EIII was used as an intrinsic probe to monitor the change in
   fluorescence of the tryptophan residue upon binding to a peptide. The
   analysis was based on the electron excitation at 280nm and fluorescence
   emission at 300-400nm of EIII, followed by quenching of fluorescence in
   the presence of potential peptidic inhibitors coded DS36wt, DS36opt,
   DN58wt and DN58opt. The present study found that the fluorescence of the
   recombinant EIII was quenched following the binding of DS36opt, DN58wt
   and DN58opt in a concentration-dependent manner. Since the lambda(max)
   for emission remained unchanged, the effect was not due to a change in
   the environment of the tryptophan side chain. In contrast, a minimal
   fluorescence-quenching effect of DS36wt at 20 and 40 mu m suggested that
   the DS36wt does not have any binding ability to EIII. This was supported
   by a simple native-page gel retardation assay that showed a band shift
   of EIII domain when incubated with DS36opt, DN58wt and DN58opt but not
   with D536wt. We thus developed a low-cost and convenient
   spectrophotometric binding assay for the analysis of EIII peptide
   interactions in a drug screening application.}},

Abstract = {{The creation of idealised, dimensionally reduced meshes for preliminary
   design and optimisation remains a time-consuming, manual task. A
   dimensionally reduced model is ideal for assessing design changes
   through modification of element properties without the need to create a

   creation of mixed dimensional meshes is presented. The input to the
   process is a solid model which has been decomposed into a non-manifold
   assembly of smaller volumes with different meshing significance.
   Associativity between the original solid model and the dimensionally
   reduced equivalent is maintained. The approach is validated by means of
   a free-free modal analysis on an output mesh of a gas turbine engine
   component of industrial complexity. Extensions and enhancements to this

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the uplink achievable rates of massive
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems in Ricean fading
   channels, using maximal-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF)
   receivers, assuming perfect and imperfect channel state information
   (CSI). In contrast to previous relevant works, the fast fading MIMO
   channel matrix is assumed to have an arbitrary-rank deterministic
   component as well as a Rayleigh-distributed random component. We derive
   tractable expressions for the achievable uplink rate in the
   large-antenna limit, along with approximating results that hold for any
   finite number of antennas. Based on these analytical results, we obtain
   the scaling law that the users' transmit power should satisfy, while
   maintaining a desirable quality of service. In particular, it is found
   that regardless of the Ricean K-factor, in the case of perfect CSI, the
   approximations converge to the same constant value as the exact results,
   as the number of base station antennas,, grows large, while the transmit
   power of each user can be scaled down proportionally to. If CSI is
   estimated with uncertainty, the same result holds true but only when the
   Ricean K-factor is non-zero. Otherwise, if the channel experiences
   Rayleigh fading, we can only cut the transmit power of each user
   proportionally to 1 root M. In addition, we show that with an increasing
   Ricean K-factor, the uplink rates will converge to fixed values for both
   MRC and ZF receivers.}},

Abstract = {{The initial composition of acrylic bone cement along with the mixing and
   delivery technique used can influence its final properties and therefore
   its clinical success in vivo. The polymerisation of acrylic bone cement
   is complex with a number of processes happening simultaneously. Acrylic
   bone cement mixing and delivery systems have undergone several design
   changes in their advancement, although the cement constituents
   themselves have remained unchanged since they were first used. This
   study was conducted to determine the factors that had the greatest
   effect on the final properties of acrylic bone cement using a pre-filled
   bone cement mixing and delivery system. A design of experiments (DoE)
   approach was used to determine the impact of the factors associated with
   this mixing and delivery method on the final properties of the cement
   produced. The DoE illustrated that all factors present within this study
   had a significant impact on the final properties of the cement. An
   optimum cement composition was hypothesised and tested. This optimum
   recipe produced cement with final mechanical and thermal properties
   within the clinical guidelines and stated by ISO 5833 (International
   Standard Organisation (ISO), International standard 5833: implants for
   surgery-acrylic resin cements, 2002), however the low setting times
   observed would not be clinically viable and could result in
   complications during the surgical technique. As a result further
   development would be required to improve the setting time of the cement
   in order for it to be deemed suitable for use in total joint replacement
   surgery.}},

Abstract = {{The environmental quality of land can be assessed by calculating
   relevant threshold values, which differentiate between concentrations of
   elements resulting from geogenic and diffuse anthropogenic sources and
   concentrations generated by point sources of elements. A simple process
   allowing the calculation of these typical threshold values (TTVs) was
   applied across a region of highly complex geology (Northern Ireland) to
   six elements of interest; arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, nickel and
   vanadium. Three methods for identifying domains (areas where a readily
   identifiable factor can be shown to control the concentration of an
   element) were used: k-means cluster analysis, boxplots and empirical
   cumulative distribution functions (ECDF). The ECDF method was most
   efficient at determining areas of both elevated and reduced
   concentrations and was used to identify domains in this investigation.
   Two statistical methods for calculating normal background concentrations
   (NBCs) and upper limits of geochemical baseline variation (ULBLs),
   currently used in conjunction with legislative regimes in the UK and
   Finland respectively, were applied within each domain. The NBC
   methodology was constructed to run within a specific legislative
   framework, and its use on this soil geochemical data set was influenced
   by the presence of skewed distributions and outliers. In contrast, the
   ULBL methodology was found to calculate more appropriate TTVs that were
   generally more conservative than the NBCs. TTVs indicate what a
   ``typical{''} concentration of an element would be within a defined
   geographical area and should be considered alongside the risk that each
   of the elements pose in these areas to determine potential risk to
   receptors.}},

Title = {{Investigation of the Temperature Homogeneity of Die Melt Flows in

Journal = {{POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{54}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Polymer extrusion is fundamental to the processing of polymeric
   materials and melt flow temperature homogeneity is a major factor which
   influences product quality. Undesirable thermal conditions can cause
   problems such as melt degradation, dimensional instability, weaknesses
   in mechanical/optical/geometrical properties, and so forth. It has been
   revealed that melt temperature varies with time and with radial position
   across the die. However, the majority of polymer processes use only
   single-point techniques whose thermal measurements are limited to the
   single point at which they are fixed. Therefore, it is impossible for
   such techniques to determine thermal homogeneity across the melt flow.
   In this work, an extensive investigation was carried out into melt flow
   thermal behavior of the output of a single extruder with different
   polymers and screw geometries over a wide range of processing
   conditions. Melt temperature profiles of the process output were
   observed using a thermocouple mesh placed in the flow and results
   confirmed that the melt flow thermal behavior is different at different
   radial positions. The uniformity of temperature across the melt flow
   deteriorated considerably with increase in screw rotational speed while
   it was also shown to be dependent on process settings, screw geometry,
   and material properties. Moreover, it appears that the effects of the
   material, machine, and process settings on the quantity and quality of
   the process output are heavily coupled with each other and this may
   cause the process to be difficult to predict and variable in nature. (C)

Abstract = {{Mathematical models are useful tools for simulation, evaluation, optimal
   operation and control of solar cells and proton exchange membrane fuel
   cells (PEMFCs). To identify the model parameters of these two type of
   cells efficiently, a biogeography-based optimization algorithm with
   mutation strategies (BBO-M) is proposed. The BBO-M uses the structure of
   biogeography-based optimization algorithm (BBO), and both the mutation
   motivated from the differential evolution (DE) algorithm and the chaos
   theory are incorporated into the BBO structure for improving the global
   searching capability of the algorithm. Numerical experiments have been
   conducted on ten benchmark functions with 50 dimensions, and the results
   show that BBO-M can produce solutions of high quality and has fast
   convergence rate. Then, the proposed BBO-M is applied to the model
   parameter estimation of the two type of cells. The experimental results
   clearly demonstrate the power of the proposed BBO-M in estimating model
   parameters of both solar and fuel cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An investigation into the influence of seemingly analogous kinematics
   (plunge versus tow) for rapidly accelerating, low-aspect-ratio plates

   system. Despite identical effective shear-layer velocities and effective

   complete, as originally reported on by Kriegseis et al. (J. Fluid Mech.,

   curious discrepancy between the two analogous cases a vortex force
   decomposition is implemented. It is shown that the interplay between

   vortical hydrodynamic impulse and vortex force, and thus the net lift on

Title = {{Seismic assessment of a steel braced plan mass symmetric/asymmetric
   building structure}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a seismic response investigation into a code
   designed concentrically braced frame structure that is subjected to but
   not designed for in-plan mass eccentricity. The structure has an
   accidental uneven distribution of mass in plan resulting in an increased
   torsional component of vibration. The level of inelasticity that key
   structural elements in plan mass asymmetric structures are subjected to
   is important when analysing their ability to sustain uneven seismic
   demands. In-plan mass asymmetry of moment resisting frame and shear wall
   type structures have received significant investigation, however, the
   plan asymmetric response of braced frame type structures is less well
   understood. A three-dimensional non-linear time history analysis model
   is created to capture the torsional response of the plan mass asymmetric
   structure to quantify the additional ductility demand, interstorey
   drifts and floor rotations. Results show that the plan mass asymmetric
   structure performs well in terms of ductility demand, but poorly in
   terms of interstorey drifts and floor rotations when compared to the
   plan mass symmetric structure. New linear relationships are developed
   between the normalised ductility demand and normalised slenderness of
   the bracing on the sides of the plan mass symmetric/asymmetric
   structures that the mass is distributed towards and away from. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{With the development of multifunctional radar and radio frequency (RF)
   stealth technology, modern radar needs to save as much operating time as
   possible. During the process of radar target tracking, with interacting
   multiple models (IMM), this paper proposes an adaptive Markov transition
   matrix to update the last step for existing radar target tracking
   algorithms. First, we take interacting multiple models as the main
   algorithm frame. Then, using gray relation and particle swarm
   optimization (PSO), multiple-target adaptive sampling interval algorithm
   is adopted. After the PSO process, we study two methods to update a
   Markov transition matrix in real time. One is with the ratio of
   likelihood function, and the other is with the compression ratio of
   estimation error. Simulations illustrate that our method is effective in
   reducing operating time for radars.}},

Title = {{Mixed mode peeling of spinnable carbon nanotube webs}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{7-13}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the study on interaction behaviour of spinnable
   carbon nanotubes by the peel test technique. Spinnable nanotube webs are
   used as macro scale experimental specimens to determine the mixed mode
   interaction behaviour between them. Numerical simulations are conducted
   to determine and compare the interfacial fracture energy of the
   interfaces in different orientations peeled at the same peel angle. The
   numerical model simulates the Van der Waals energy between nanotube webs
   through implementation of a cohesive law. The peeling process is
   simulated by considering a failure criterion based on continuum damage
   mechanics. It is shown that the interfacial energy varied with the
   orientation angle and the peel angle. Interfacial energy for parallel
   nanotube configuration is much higher than the crossed nanotube
   configuration. Increase in peel angle reduces the phase angle magnitudes
   so that the loading condition transforms from mode - II to mode - I
   resulting into reduction of the forces required to detach spinnable
   nanotubes. Hence, this study explores the spinnable nanotube interaction
   mechanics through which slippage may easily occur among them. Thus, the
   reason behind nanotube yarn failure before reaching large macroscopic
   stresses is better understood even though individual spinnable nanotube
   found to be very strong. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Correction and Lamp Power Regulation}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{With the global concerns on the issue of how to conserve the limited
   energy resources, compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) have been forced in a
   lot of countries to replace the power-hungry incandescent lamps to
   reduce the energy cost. However, conventional passive power factor
   corrected electronic ballasts used in CFLs suffer two major drawbacks:
   1) they are unable to achieve close-to-unity power factor and 2) they
   are unable to provide the same amount of light intensity under
   fluctuating line voltage. This paper proposed a simple lamp power
   regulation method for a very high-power factor single-switch electronic
   ballast, which allows the electronic ballast to maintain almost constant
   lamp power at its full-power condition for a wide range of the input
   voltage by controlling the dc-link voltage of the ballast power circuit
   through duty ratio control. When a TRIAC phase-cut dimmer is used to dim
   the CFL, the dc-link voltage regulation control loop is deactivated; so
   that the lamp power decreases accordingly during dimming. The analysis
   and operating principles of the controller are discussed in this paper.
   MATLAB, PSIM simulation, and experimental results are provided to
   highlight the merits of the proposed work.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the extraction of C-5-C-8 linear alpha-olefins from
   olefin/paraffin mixtures of the same carbon number via a reversible
   complexation with a silver salt (silver
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, Ag{[}Tf2N]) to form room temperature
   ionic liquids {[}Ag(olefin)(x)]{[}Tf2N]. From the experimental (liquid +
   liquid) equilibrium data for the olefin/paraffin mixtures and
   Ag{[}Tf2N], 1-pentene showed the best separation performance while C-7
   and C-8 olefins could only be separated from the corresponding mixtures
   on addition of water which also improves the selectivity at lower carbon
   numbers like the C-5 and C-6, for example. Using infrared and Raman
   spectroscopy of the complex and Ag{[}Tf2N] saturated by olefin, the
   mechanism of the extraction was found to be based on both chemical
   complexation and the physical solubility of the olefin in the ionic
   liquid ({[}Ag(olefin)(x)]{[}Tf2N]). These experiments further support
   the use of such extraction techniques for the separation of olefins from

Abstract = {{Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) provide much promise in
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions and, thus, are a focal point of
   research and development. Existing on-board charging capacity is
   effective but requires the use of several power conversion devices and
   power converters, which reduce reliability and cost efficiency. This
   paper presents a novel three-phase switched reluctance (SR) motor drive
   with integrated charging functions (including internal combustion engine
   and grid charging). The electrical energy flow within the drivetrain is
   controlled by a power electronic converter with less power switching
   devices and magnetic devices. It allows the desired energy conversion
   between the engine generator, the battery, and the SR motor under
   different operation modes. Battery-charging techniques are developed to
   operate under both motor-driving mode and standstill-charging mode.
   During the magnetization mode, the machine's phase windings are
   energized by the dc-link voltage. The power converter and the machine
   phase windings are controlled with a three-phase relay to enable the use
   of the ac-dc rectifier. The power converter can work as a
   buck-boost-type or a buck-type dc-dc converter for charging the battery.
   Simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments on a 3-kW SR motor
   validate the effectiveness of the proposed technologies, which may have
   significant economic implications and improve the PHEVs' market
   acceptance.}},

Title = {{Combining multi-scale geophysical techniques for robust hydro-structural
   characterisation in catchments underlain by hard rock in post-glacial

Abstract = {{Accurate conceptual models of groundwater systems are essential for
   correct interpretation of monitoring data in catchment studies. In
   surface-water dominated hard rock regions, modern ground and surface
   water monitoring programmes often have very high resolution chemical,
   meteorological and hydrological observations but lack an equivalent
   emphasis on the subsurface environment, the properties of which exert a
   strong control on flow pathways and interactions with surface waters.
   The reasons for this disparity are the complexity of the system and the
   difficulty in accurately characterising the subsurface, except locally
   at outcrops or in boreholes. This is particularly the case in maritime
   north-western Europe, where a legacy of glacial activity, combined with
   large areas underlain by heterogeneous igneous and metamorphic bedrock,
   make the structure and weathering of bedrock difficult to map or model.
   Traditional approaches which seek to extrapolate information from
   borehole to field-scale are of limited application in these environments
   due to the high degree of spatial heterogeneity. Here we apply an
   integrative and multi-scale approach, optimising and combining standard
   geophysical techniques to generate a three-dimensional geological
   conceptual model of the subsurface in a catchment in NE Ireland.
   Available airborne LiDAR, electromagnetic and magnetic data sets were
   analysed for the region. At field-scale surface geophysical methods,
   including electrical resistivity tomography, seismic refraction, ground
   penetrating radar and magnetic surveys, were used and combined with
   field mapping of outcrops and borehole testing. The study demonstrates
   how combined interpretation of multiple methods at a range of scales
   produces robust three-dimensional conceptual models and a stronger basis
   for interpreting groundwater and surface water monitoring data. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Electrokinetic phenomena play an important role in the electrical
   characterization of surfaces. In terms of planar or porous substrates,
   streaming potential and/or streaming current measurements can be used to
   determine the zeta potential of the substrates in contact with aqueous
   electrolytes. In this work, we perform electrical impedance spectroscopy
   measurements to infer the electrical resistance in a microchannel with
   the same conditions as for a streaming potential experiment. Novel
   correlations are derived to relate the streaming current and streaming
   potential to the Reynolds number of the channel flow. Our results not
   only quantify the influence of surface conductivity, and here especially
   the contribution of the stagnant layer, but also reveal that channel
   resistance and therefore zeta potential are influenced by the flow in
   the case of low ionic strengths. We conclude that convection can have a
   significant impact on the electrical double layer configuration which is
   reflected by changes in the surfaces conductivity.}},

   Semi-empirical modeling and minimum confinement requirements}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{743-751}},

Abstract = {{The use of steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) is becoming more and
   more common. Concerning bond of rebars to concrete, fibers provide
   passive confinement and not only improve bond performance but also
   affect the mode of bond failure. To analyze these aspects, a series of
   prismatic specimens have been subjected to the Pull Out Test, and an
   accurate model for predicting the mode of bond failure has been
   developed. The following factors have been considered: concrete
   compressive strength (30-50 MPa), rebar diameter (8-20 mm), concrete
   cover (between 30 mm and 5 times rebar diameter), fiber content (up to
   70 kg/m(3)), and fiber slenderness and length. This model relates
   splitting probability to the factors considered. It has been proved that
   increasing fiber content restrains the risk of splitting failure. The
   favorable effect of fibers when preventing splitting failures has been
   revealed to be more important for higher concrete compressive strength
   values, which require higher concrete cover/diameter ratios for
   splitting failure to be prevented. Fiber slenderness and fiber length
   modify the effect of fiber content on splitting probability and
   therefore on minimum cover/diameter ratios required to prevent splitting
   failures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Three photocatalyst inks based on the redox dyes, Resazurin (Rz), Basic
   Blue 66 (BB66) and Acid Violet 7 (AV7), are used to assess the
   photocatalytic activities of a variety of different materials, such as
   commercial paint, tiles and glass and laboratory made samples of sol-gel
   coated glass and paint, which collectively exhibit a wide range of
   activities that cannot currently be probed by any one of the existing
   ISO tests. Unlike the ISO tests, the ink tests are fast (typically <10
   min), simple to employ and inexpensive. Previous work indicates that the
   Rz ink test at least correlates linearly with other photocatalytic tests
   such as the photomineralisation of stearic acid. The average time to
   bleach 90\% of the key RGB colour component of the ink, red for Rz and
   BB66 inks and green for AV7 ink, is determined, ttb(90), for eight
   samples of each of the different materials tested. Five laboratories
   conducted the tests and the results revealed an average repeatability
   and reproducibility of: ca. 11\% and ca 21\%, respectively, which
   compare well with those reported for the current ISO tests. Additional
   work on commercial self-cleaning glass using an Rz ink showed that the
   change in the red component of the RGB image of the ink correlated
   linearly with that of the change of absorbance at 608 nm, as measured
   using UV/vis spectroscopy, and the change in the a{*} component of the
   Lab. colour analysis of the ink, as measured using diffuse reflectance
   spectroscopy. As a consequence, all three methods generate the same
   ttb(90). The advantages of the RGB digital image analysis method are
   discussed briefly. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The electroless nickel composite (ENC) with various silicon carbide
   contents was deposited onto aluminium alloy (LM24) substrate. The wear
   behaviour and the microhardness of the composite coating samples were
   investigated and compared with particles free and aluminium substrate
   samples using micro-scale abrasion tester and microhardness tester
   respectively. The wear scar marks and wear volume were analysed by
   optical microscope. The wear tracks were further studied using scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). The embedded particles were found to get
   pressed into the matrix which helps resisting further wearing process
   for composite samples. However, random orientation of microcuts and
   microfallow were seen for ENC sample but more uniform wearing was
   observed for EN sample. The composite coating with low content of SiC
   was worn minimum. Early penetration into the substrate was seen for
   samples with higher SiC content. Microhardness was improved after heat
   treatment for all the samples containing various SiC content. Under dry
   sliding condition, inclusion of particles in the matrix did not improve
   the wearing resistance performance in as-deposited state. The wearing
   worsened as the content of the particles increased generally. However,
   on heat treatment, the composite coatings exhibited improved wear
   resistance and the best result was obtained from the one with low
   particle contents. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The design of a non-viral gene delivery vehicle capable of delivering
   and releasing a functional nucleic acid cargo intracellularly remains a
   formidable challenge. For systemic gene therapy to be successful a
   delivery vehicle is required that protects the nucleic acid cargo from
   enzymatic degradation, extravasates from the vasculature, traverses the
   cell membrane, disrupts the endosomal vesicles and unloads the cargo at
   its destination site, namely the nucleus for the purposes of gene
   delivery. This manuscript reports the extensive investigation of a novel
   amphipathic peptide composed of repeating RALA units capable of
   overcoming the biological barriers to gene delivery both in vitro and in
   vivo. Our data demonstrates the spontaneous self-assembly of cationic
   DNA-loaded nanoparticles when the peptide is complexed with pDNA.
   Nanoparticles were <100 nm, were stable in the presence of serum and
   were fusogenic in nature, with increased peptide alpha-helicity at a
   lower pH. Nanoparticles proved to be non-cytotoxic, readily traversed
   the plasma membrane of both cancer and fibroblast cell lines and
   elicited reporter-gene expression following intravenous delivery in
   vivo. The results of this study indicate that RALA presents an exciting
   delivery platform for the systemic delivery of nucleic acid
   therapeutics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{China Low Activation Martensitic (CLAM) steel is considered to be the
   main candidate material for the first wall components of future fusion
   reactors in China. In this paper, the low cycle fatigue (LCF) behavior
   of CLAM steel is studied under fully reversed tension-compression
   loading at 823 K in air. Total strain amplitude was controlled from
   0.14\% to 1.8\% with a constant strain rate of 2.4 x 10(-3) s(-1). The
   corresponding plastic strain amplitude ranged from 0.023\% to 1.613\%.
   The CLAM steel displayed continuous softening to failure at 823 K. The
   relationship between strain, stress and fatigue life was obtained using
   the parameters obtained from fatigue tests. The LCF properties of CLAM
   steel at 823 K followed Coffin-Manson relationship. Furthermore,
   irregular serration was observed on the stress-strain hysteresis loops
   of CLAM steel tested with the total strain amplitude of 0.45-1.8\%,
   which was attributed to the dynamic strain aging (DSA) effect. During
   continuous cyclic deformation, the microstructure and precipitate
   distribution of CLAM steel changed gradually. Many tempered martensitic
   laths were decomposed into subgrains, and the size and number of M23C6
   carbide and MX carbonitride precipitates decreased with the increase of
   total strain amplitude. The response cyclic stress promoted the recovery
   of martensitic lath, while the thermal activation mainly played an
   important role on the growth of precipitates in CLAM steel at 823 K. In
   order to have a better understanding of high-temperature LCF behavior,
   the potential mechanisms controlling stress-strain response, DSA
   phenomenon and microstructure changes have also been evaluated. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Relative global positioning system (GPS) positioning is used to cancel
   common-mode errors such as satellite/receiver clock biases and
   atmospheric effects. The common approach is to use differential GPS
   (DGPS) carrier-phase measurements to provide centimeter-meter level
   accuracy. However, carrier-phase-based DGPS positioning requires
   resolution of integer ambiguities (IA) and is sensitive to cycle-slip,
   which are too frequent for land-vehicle navigation. This paper
   investigates the feasibility of using DGPS code-phase measurements
   integrated with land-vehicle's motion sensors to provide highly accurate
   navigation system without the overhead of IA resolution or cycle-slip
   detection and correction, which are complex and time consuming
   processes. To reduce the effect of noise associated with differential
   code-phase measurements, a reduced set of vehicle's sensors are used in
   an extended Kalman filter (EKF) employing tightly coupled integration
   scheme (termed as EKF-DD). Owing to bias estimation of motion sensors,
   the proposed system flywheels through GPS outages and mitigates
   multipath. The performance of the proposed system was compared, using
   carrier-phase based reference, with two similar integration schemes
   employing undifferenced GPS measurements, where atmospheric effects are
   mitigated using either Klobuchar model (called EKF-BC) or dual frequency
   receivers (designated as EKF-IF). Based on three real road tests
   performed in challenging GPS environments and forced GPS outages, it was
   found that in 2-D positioning, the proposed system performed 46\%
   superior than EKF-BC and 21\% better than EKF-IF. In altitude, EKF-DD
   showed 66\% improvement over EKF-BC and 14\% over EKF-IF. In GPS
   outages, the overall performance of the proposed system was 21\% and
   10\% better than EKF-BC and EKF-IF, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a multipair decode-and-forward relay channel, where multiple
   sources transmit simultaneously their signals to multiple destinations
   with the help of a full-duplex relay station. We assume that the relay
   station is equipped with massive arrays, while all sources and
   destinations have a single antenna. The relay station uses channel
   estimates obtained from received pilots and zero-forcing (ZF) or
   maximum-ratio combining/maximum-ratio transmission (MRC/MRT) to process
   the signals. To significantly reduce the loop interference effect, we
   propose two techniques: i) using a massive receive antenna array; or ii)
   using a massive transmit antenna array together with very low transmit
   power at the relay station. We derive an exact achievable rate
   expression in closed-form for MRC/MRT processing and an analytical
   approximation of the achievable rate for ZF processing. This
   approximation is very tight, particularly for a large number of relay
   station antennas. These closed-form expressions enable us to determine
   the regions where the full-duplex mode outperforms the half-duplex mode,
   as well as to design an optimal power allocation scheme. This optimal
   power allocation scheme aims to maximize the energy efficiency for a
   given sum spectral efficiency and under peak power constraints at the
   relay station and sources. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of
   the optimal power allocation scheme. Furthermore, we show that, by
   doubling the number of transmit/receive antennas at the relay station,
   the transmit power of each source and of the relay station can be
   reduced by 1.5 dB if the pilot power is equal to the signal power, and
   by 3 dB if the pilot power is kept fixed, while maintaining a given
   quality of service.}},

Abstract = {{This paper sets out in the context of three strands of knowledge;
   disaster management, strategic management and project management and
   builds upon the authors' (2009) theory for the delivery of post-disaster
   reconstruction (PDR) projects. With the expected increase in the
   magnitude and frequency of natural disasters in coming years, more
   people than ever will be faced with PDR scenarios. In many cases,
   non-government organisations (NGOs) are in a position to make
   interventions to improve conditions for people facing the impacts of
   disasters and it is essential that responding agencies deploy
   appropriate configurations of competencies to mitigate project barriers.
   Using a mixed-methods approach, a study incorporated four case studies
   in post-tsunami Sri Lanka and four case studies in post-cyclone Sidr
   Bangladesh. Exploratory interviews with expert NGO participants were
   combined with direct observations and the collection of quantitative
   survey data. The mechanisms and phenomena observed within the case
   studies contributed to the development of a conceptual theoretical
   framework. The study reveals that NGOs face barriers in seven key areas
   and that they must deploy certain configurations of organisational and
   operational competencies in order to effectively develop and implement
   strategies to address these barriers. The theoretical framework
   demonstrates how the utilisation of these competencies, deployed in
   targeted clusters, has the potential to create positive outcomes for
   beneficiaries as measured by PDR Project Success Indicators (PDRPSIs).
   If dynamic tools can be developed that effectively model competency and
   predict success, all organisations involved in disaster response and
   recovery could benefit. In addition, the knowledge is highly
   transferable to other sectors and environments.}},

Abstract = {{Linear precoding and cooperative jamming for multiuser broadcast channel

   different users for linear precoding and the cooperative jamming at the

   rate, provided that a minimum communication rate to the users is
   guaranteed. The optimal solution is obtained when the number of antennas
   at the friendly jammer is no less than the total number of antennas at
   the users and eavesdropper. Moreover, a suboptimal algorithm is

Abstract = {{Design charts to estimate the factor of safety for simple slopes with
   cohesive-frictional (c-phi) soils are now available in the literature;
   however, the factor of safety is an imperfect measure for quantifying
   the margin of safety of a slope because nominal identical slopes with
   the same factor of safety can have different probabilities of failure
   due to variability in soil properties. In this study, simple circular
   slip slope stability charts for phi = 0 soils by Taylor in 1937 and
   c-phi soils published by Steward et al. in 2011 are extended to match
   estimates of factors of safety to corresponding probabilities of
   failure. A series of new charts are provided that consider a practical
   range of coefficient of variation for cohesive and frictional strength
   parameters of the soil. The data to generate the new charts were
   produced using conventional probabilistic concepts together with
   closed-form solutions for cohesive soil cases, and Monte Carlo
   simulation in combination with conventional limit equilibrium-based
   circular slip analyses using the SVSlope program for c-phi soil cases.
   The charts are a useful tool for geotechnical engineers when making a
   preliminary estimate of the probability of failure of a simple slope
   without running Monte Carlo simulations.}},

Abstract = {{While the solar water disinfection (SODIS) method of treating
   microbiologically contaminated water at the household level has proven
   to be effective at reducing incidence of diarrhea, its effectiveness is
   limited to waters of low turbidity. This study investigates the use of
   table salt (NaCl) to reduce turbidity in water containing dispersed
   colloidal clay particles as a means of expanding the user base of SODIS.
   Jar tests were performed on solutions of a low-activity clay, simulating
   the general composition of soils of the Vertisol type, which are found
   in key developing regions. Results show that dispersions exhibited as
   high as 92\% particle removal efficiency. The results of this study
   suggest that NaCl in combination with as little as 30\% bentonite by
   mass may be used to produce a small-scale jumpstart effect by reducing
   turbidity to a level suitable for SODIS treatment. Soil type was mapped
   and overlaid with population estimates in a GIS environment to highlight
   geographic areas where salt + SODIS may be most viable in the case study
   of South Sudan. Findings suggest that the NaCl method could expand
   access to SODIS technology by about 1.56 million people who currently
   lack access to an improved water source in the case study. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Objective: Bisphosphonates are commonly used anti-osteoporotic drugs
   which have controversial effects on joint diseases including
   osteoarthritis. Certain bisphosphonates have been shown to have anabolic
   effects on cartilage which could have important ramifications for their
   proposed effects in vivo; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly
   understood. Thus, the purpose of this study was to characterize the
   effects of clodronate on primary articular chondrocyte metabolism and to
   determine the underlying signaling pathways responsible.
   Design: The effects of clodronate and pamidronate on extracellular
   matrix (ECM) biosynthesis, accumulation and MMP-13 activity were
   observed in high density, 3D cultures of bovine articular chondrocytes
   for up to 4 weeks were evaluated. Mechanisms were delineated by
   measuring intracellular Ca2+ signaling and the effects of pharmacologic
   inhibition of the purinergic receptor pathway.
   Results: Clodronate (100 mu M) induced an anabolic effect (increased
   biosynthesis by 13-14\%) which resulted in an 89-90\% increase in ECM
   accumulation after 4 weeks of culture and without an associated effect
   on matrix turn-over. Stimulation by clodronate resulted in a 3.3-fold
   increase in Ca2+ signaling and pharmacological inhibitor experiments
   suggested that the anabolic effects exerted by clodronate are transduced
   through the purinergic receptor pathway.
   Conclusions: These findings support the previous notion that certain
   bisphosphonates may be useful as adjunctive therapies to potentially
   ameliorate progression of cartilage degeneration and improve arthritis
   management. (C) 2014 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

Title = {{Block copolymers as sequestering phases in two-phase biotransformations:
   effect of constituent homopolymer properties on solute affinity}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDA Block copolymers can be effective extractants in
   solid-liquid two-phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs) when selected on
   the basis of their partition coefficient toward target solutes, and
   their thermo-mechanical properties. A series of Pebax (R) block
   copolymers, containing varying proportions of soft poly(tetramethylene
   oxide) and hard poly(amide-12), was evaluated to determine the effect of
   hard segment proportion on solute affinity toward two biotransformation
   target molecules, carveol and carvone. Subsequently, representative
   homopolymers comprising the copolymers' soft segment were examined
   individually for the effects of molecular weight, crystallinity, and
   polymer end group polarity on affinity.
   RESULTS: Partition coefficients decreased with greater proportions of
   copolymer hard segments and homopolymer crystallinity, both of which act
   as non-absorptive domains, but which impart mechanical strength to the
   polymer. Partition coefficients increased with decreasing homopolymer
   molecular weight, which was ascribed to increased entropy of mixing.
   Hydroxyl vs. ether end group functionality had a variable effect on the
   partitioning of polar and non-polar solutes, providing a basis for the
   rational design of selective oligomeric absorbents.
   CONCLUSION: Block copolymers can provide an attractive, low-cost option
   for polymeric sequestering phases in TPPBs, but commercial grades of
   these materials are not optimized for these applications. TPPB
   performance can be improved by selecting/fabricating polymers that
   minimize the molecular weight of the soft component, the proportion of
   hard segment, and by considering the effects of end group composition.

Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{24-36}},

Abstract = {{The effective remediation of chlorinated solvent source zones using in
   situ thermal treatment requires successful capture of gas that is
   produced. Replicate electrical resistance heating experiments were
   performed in a thin bench-scale apparatus, where water was boiled and
   pooled dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) trichloroethene (TCE) and
   water were co-boiled in unconsolidated silica sand. Quantitative light
   transmission visualization was used to assess gas production and
   transport mechanisms. In the water boiling experiments, nucleation,
   growth and coalescence of the gas phase into connected channels were
   observed at critical gas saturations of S-gc = 0.233 +/- 0.017, which
   allowed for continuous gas transport out of the sand. In experiments
   containing a colder region above a target heated zone, condensation
   prevented the formation of steam channels and discrete gas clusters that
   mobilized into colder regions were trapped soon after discontinuous
   transport began. In the TCE water experiments, co-boiling at immiscible
   fluid interfaces resulted in discontinuous gas transport above the DNAPL
   pool. Redistribution of DNAPL was also observed above the pool and at
   the edge of the vapor front that propagated upwards through colder
   regions. These results suggest that the subsurface should be heated to
   water boiling temperatures to facilitate gas transport from specific
   locations of DNAPL to extraction points and reduce the potential for
   DNAPL redistribution. Decreases in electric current were observed at the
   onset of gas phase production, which suggests that coupled electrical
   current and temperature measurements may provide a reliable metric to
   assess gas phase development. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Recovery of cellulose fibres from paper mill effluent has been studied
   using common polysaccharides or biopolymers such as Guar gum, Xanthan
   gum and Locust bean gum as flocculent. Guar gum is commonly used in
   sizing paper and routinely used in paper making. The results have been
   compared with the performance of alum, which is a common coagulant and a
   key ingredient of the paper industry. Guar gum recovered about 3.86 mg/L
   of fibre and was most effective among the biopolymers. Settling velocity
   distribution curves demonstrated that Guar gum was able to settle the
   fibres faster than the other biopolymers; however, alum displayed the
   highest particle removal rate than all the biopolymers at any of the
   settling velocities. Alum, Guar gum, Xanthan gum and Locust bean gum
   removed 97.46\%, 94.68\%, 92.39\% and 92.46\% turbidity of raw effluent
   at a settling velocity of 0.5 cm/min, respectively. The conditions for
   obtaining the lowest sludge volume index such as pH, dose and mixing
   speed were optimised for guar gum which was the most effective among the
   biopolymers. Response surface methodology was used to design all
   experiments, and an optimum operational setting was proposed. The test
   results indicate similar performance of alum and Guar gum in terms of
   floc settling velocities and sludge volume index. Since Guar gum is a
   plant derived natural substance, it is environmentally benign and offers
   a green treatment option to the paper mills for pulp recycling. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Achieving end-to-end goals of Wireless Machine to Machine Networks (M2M)
   is a highly challenging task. These goals include guaranteeing
   connectivity and maximizing throughput while satisfying application
   layer Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Moreover, the problem
   becomes more complicated in the context of emerging dynamic allocation
   of application layer software components. This paper presents a
   collaborative framework for communications in M2M wireless networks.
   This framework is composed of a context-aware and application-aware
   software platform and a reasoning machine for network management. The
   software platform uses multi-level adaptation mechanisms to support
   dynamic collaboration activities. The platform is also capable of
   installing the required software components on the appropriate nodes. On
   the other hand, the reasoning machine for network management is designed
   using the tool known as Weighted Cognitive Map (WCM). The inference
   properties of WCMs allow the system to self-organize while considering
   multiple objectives and constraints. Methods for achieving different
   objectives using WCMs are illustrated, as well as how system processes
   can operate coherently to achieve end-to-end goals. Computer simulations
   show that the system achieves excellent performance results in metrics
   of call dropping and blocking probabilities and achieving the required
   Quality of Service (QoS) parameters of the applications. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The batch solution copolymerization of styrene and n-butyl acrylate over

   Both the terminal and penultimate models, using rate coefficients taken
   from the literature, fail to predict the full extent of the reduced
   overall copolymerization rate observed when the styrene composition in
   the feed is increased. After estimation of uncertain model parameters,
   the terminal model provides a good representation of the experimental
   dataset. The estimated overall efficiency of the initiator decreases
   (from the typically employed 0.65 to 0.35) and the cross-termination
   increases from the values corresponding to the geometric mean of the
   homopolymerization termination rate coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{This study identifies and analyzes the effect that aging time and
   temperature have on the CO light-off activity of three-way catalyst
   samples, aged in a static air (oxidizing) atmosphere. The bench aging
   time (BAT) equation proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency
   (EPA), which describes aging as dependent upon time at temperature, was
   used to calculate a range of oven aging times and temperatures based on
   a RAT-A engine bench aging cycle.
   CO light-off tests carried out on cores aged between 800 and 900 degrees
   C have shown that it is the aging temperature that has the greatest
   effect on catalyst deterioration for static aging testing, with aging
   time having little effect. These results were in contradiction to the
   BAT equation, an industry norm for the aging of catalysts. This
   demonstrates that static aging, whilst showing how temperature affects
   aging, gives little or no time effects. The results have shown that
   static aging is not representative of actual aging on a vehicle.
   Progressive aging conducted at a temperature of 1000 degrees C was shown
   to cause a decrease in catalyst activity as the aging time increased.
   However, even in these extreme conditions, static aging gave a slower
   rate of aging with time when compared to engine aging as defined by the
   BAT equation. Overall, static aging in air has been shown to produce a
   greater increase in aging due to temperature than predicted by the BAT
   equation, but less aging due to aging time.}},

Abstract = {{Many kinetic models have appeared in literature in past decades using
   two main approaches: the traditional global kinetics approach, or the
   more complex micro-kinetics approach. Whether global or micro-kinetics,
   kinetic models have been based on experimental data obtained at the end
   of the monolith. The experimental procedure using end pipe analysis may
   give an accurate overview of the reaction mechanisms that occur;
   however, the lack of information from within the catalyst can ultimately
   lead to inaccuracies in the kinetic model and parameters used.
   Using SpaciMS, a spatially resolved experimental technique developed at
   the Queen's University Belfast, information from within the catalyst can
   be obtained. This minimally invasive technique provides detailed
   information of the gas concentration and temperature profile from inside
   the catalytic monolith. This paper presents a kinetic model and
   simulations validated against experimental data obtained from three
   positions inside the catalyst monolith at 2, 14, and 26 mm in, using
   data from the SpaciMS. Also, simulations of end pipe analysis, using a
   commercial reactor, for the CO oxidation are presented and analyzed. The
   simulations presented are for varying concentrations of both CO and O-2
   (0.5\% and 1\% CO, 0.5\% and 2\% O-2) for both the global and
   micro-kinetic approach.}},

Abstract = {{Biosorption of Cr(VI) onto date pit biomass has been investigated via
   kinetic studies as functions of initial Cr(VI) concentration, solution
   temperature and date pit particle size. Kinetic experiments indicated
   that chromate ions accumulate onto the date pits and then reduce to less
   toxic Cr(III) compounds. The Lopez-Garcia, Escudero and Park Cr(VI)
   biosorption kinetic models, which take into consideration the direct
   reduction, the passivation process and the follow-on decrease of the
   active surface area of reaction, were applied to the kinetic data. The
   models represented the experimental data accurately at low Cr(VI)
   concentration (0.480mM) and small particle size (0.11-0.22 mm) at which
   the Cr(VI) was completely removed from the aqueous solution and
   completely reduced to Cr(III) after 420 mm. Date pit biomass thus offers
   a green chemical process for the remediation of chromium from
   wastewater. This investigation will help researchers employ the
   adsorption-coupled reduction of Cr(VI) models and simplify their
   application to kinetic experimental data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   part and the assembly as the change in clash volume due to a change in
   each parameter value. These sensitivities give an indication of
   important parameters and are used to predict the optimum combination of
   changes in each parameter to eliminate the clash. Consideration is given
   to the fact that it is sometimes preferable to modify some components in
   an assembly rather than others and that some components in an assembly
   cannot be modified as the designer does not have control over their
   shape. Successful elimination of clashes has been demonstrated in a
   number of example assemblies.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of
   laser-induced surface features on the morphology, attachment and
   viability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) at different periods of time,
   and to evaluate the biocompatibility of different zones: laser-melted
   zone (MZ), heat-affected zone (HAZ) and base metal (BM) in laser-treated
   NiTi alloy. The surface morphology and composition were studied by
   scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
   (XPS), respectively. The cell morphology was examined by SEM while the
   cell counting and viability measurements were done by hemocytometer and
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
   colorimetric assay. The results indicated that the laser-induced surface
   features, such as surface roughening, presence of anisotropic dendritic
   pattern and complete surface Ni oxidation were beneficial to improve the
   biocompatibility of NiTi as evidenced by the highest cell attachment (4
   days of culture) and viability (7 days of culture) found in the MZ. The
   biocompatibility of the MZ was the best, followed by the BM with the HAZ
   being the worst. The defective and porous oxide layer as well as the
   coarse grained structure might attribute to the inferior cell attachment
   (4 days of culture) and viability (7 days of culture) on the HAZ
   compared with the BM which has similar surface morphology. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper presents the background rationale and key findings for a
   model-based study of supercritical waste heat recovery organic Rankine
   cycles. The paper's objective is to cover the necessary groundwork to
   facilitate the future operation of a thermodynamic organic Rankine cycle
   model under realistic thermodynamic boundary conditions for performance
   optimisation of organic Rankine cycles. This involves determining the
   type of power cycle for organic Rankine cycles, the circuit
   configuration and suitable boundary conditions. The study focuses on
   multiple heat sources from vehicles but the findings are generally
   applicable, with careful consideration, to any waste heat recovery
   system. This paper introduces waste heat recovery and discusses the
   general merits of organic fluids versus water and supercritical
   operation versus subcritical operation from a theoretical perspective
   and, where possible, from a practical perspective. The benefits of
   regeneration are investigated from an efficiency perspective for
   selected subcritical and supercritical conditions. A simulation model is
   described with an introduction to some general Rankine cycle boundary
   conditions. The paper describes the analysis of real hybrid vehicle data
   from several driving cycles and its manipulation to represent the
   thermal inertia for model heat input boundary conditions. Basic theory
   suggests that selecting the operating pressures and temperatures to
   maximise the Rankine cycle performance is relatively straightforward.
   However, it was found that this may not be the case for an organic
   Rankine cycle operating in a vehicle. When operating in a driving cycle,
   the available heat and its quality can vary with the power output and
   between heat sources. For example, the available coolant heat does not
   vary much with the load, whereas the quantity and quality of the exhaust
   heat varies considerably. The key objective for operation in the vehicle
   is optimum utilisation of the available heat by delivering the maximum
   work out. The fluid selection process and the presentation and analysis
   of the final results of the simulation work on organic Rankine cycles
   are the subjects of two future publications.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study of inert particle dispersion in an isothermal
   concentric air jet near field was conducted for cases of standard
   non-staggered and alternative staggered jet nozzles, each taken from a
   polymer powder flame deposition gun. The experimental work consisted of
   analysis of high speed digital images of the inert two phase isothermal
   jet flow, illuminated by a laser light sheet along and across the jet
   axis. The analysis of particle spread in the jet, represented by
   families of particle density distributions, clearly showed that the
   staggered nozzles resulted in a better-focused flow, with narrower
   distributions in the near field, and in the elimination of the
   recirculation zone that disrupted the particle flow in a non-staggered
   nozzle arrangement. In all cases, histograms of the cross-sectional
   particle area density were found to be approximately Gaussian. It was
   also found that there was a wide variation in the size and shape of the
   ground polymer particles used and these two characteristics caused a
   wide variation in the radial and axial velocities of the particles.
   Despite the differences between single-phase numerical simulations and
   experimental results, reported in Payne et al. {[}1], the introduction
   of particles into a numerical model produced satisfactory agreement with
   the particle velocities found experimentally.}},

Title = {{The evolution of offshore wind power in the United Kingdom}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{599-612}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In the United Kingdom wind power is recognised as the main source of
   renewable energy to achieve the European Union 2020 renewable energy
   targets. Currently over 50\% of renewable power is generated from
   onshore wind with a large number of offshore wind projects in
   development. Recently the government has re-iterated its commitment to
   offshore wind power and has announced that offshore wind subsidies are
   to increase from 135 pound/MWh to 140 pound/MWh until 2019. This paper
   provides a detailed overview of the offshore wind power industry in the
   United Kingdom in terms of market growth, policy development and
   offshore wind farm costs. The paper clearly shows that the United
   Kingdom is the world leader for installed offshore wind power capacity
   as pro-active policies and procedures have made it the most attractive
   location to develop offshore wind farm arrays. The key finding is that
   the United Kingdom has the potential to continue to lead the world in
   offshore wind power as it has over 48 GW of offshore wind power projects
   at different stages of operation and development. The growth of offshore
   wind power in the United Kingdom has seen offshore wind farm costs rise
   and level off at approximately 3 million/MW, which are higher than
   onshore wind costs at 1.5-2 pound million/MW. Considering the recent
   increase in offshore wind power subsidies and plans for 48 GW of
   offshore wind power could see more offshore wind power becoming
   increasingly financially competitive with onshore wind power. Therefore
   offshore wind power is likely to become a significant source of
   electricity in the United Kingdom beyond 2020. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Electrokinetic process is a potential in situ soil remediation process
   which transports the contaminants via electromigration and
   electroosmosis. For organic compounds contaminated soil, Fenton's
   reagent is utilized as a flushing agent in electrokinetic process
   (Electrokinetic-Fenton) so that removal of organic contaminants could be
   achieved by in situ oxidation/destruction. However, this process is not
   applied widely in industries as the stability issue for Fenton's reagent
   is the main drawback. The aim of this mini review is to summarize the
   developments of Electrokinetic-Fenton process on enhancing the stability
   of Fenton's reagent and process efficiency in past decades. Generally,
   the enhancements are conducted via four paths: (1) chemical
   stabilization to delay H2O2 decomposition, (2) increase of oxidant
   availability by monitoring injection method for Fenton's reagent, (3)
   electrodes operation and iron catalysts and (4) operating conditions
   such as voltage gradient, electrolytes and H2O2 concentration. In
   addition, the types of soils and contaminants are also showing
   significant effect as the soil with low acid buffering capacity,
   adequate iron concentration, low organic matter content and low aromatic
   ring organic contaminants generally gives better efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an investigation of the effect of fill factor; on
   the compaction behaviour of the granules during tabletting and hence
   mechanical properties of tablets formed. The fill factor; which is the
   ratio of volume of wet powder material to vessel volume of the
   granulator, was used as an indicator of batch size. It has been
   established previously that in high shear granulation the batch size
   influences the size distribution and granule mechanical properties
   {[}1]. The work reported in this paper is an extension to the work
   presented in {[}1], hence granules from the same batches were used in
   production of tablets. The same tabletting conditions were employed
   during tabletting to allow a comparison of their properties. The
   compaction properties of the granules are inferred from the data
   generated during the tabletting process. The tablet strength and
   dissolution properties of the tablets were also measured. The results
   obtained show that the granule batch size affects the strength and
   dissolution of the tablets formed. The tablets produced from large
   batches were found to be weaker and had a faster dissolution rate. The
   fill factor was also found to affect the tablet to tablet variation of a
   non-functional active pharmaceutical ingredient included in the feed
   powder. Tablets produced from larger batches show greater variation
   compared to those from smaller batches. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The scene dynamics can provide useful statistical information for
   adjusting parameters of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in video
   surveillance. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, an
   adaptive scene dynamics estimation approach is proposed. Second, we
   propose a scene-dynamics based method to adjust two types of GMMs'
   parameters, i.e., the learning rates and number of Gaussian components.
   For the learning rates, the scene dynamics are integrated into different
   kinds of pixel-type feedback schemes to control different kinds of
   learning rates. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
   method can effectively improve the performance of GMMs in surveillance
   scenes with complex dynamic backgrounds.}},

Title = {{A Single-Switch Valley-Fill Power-Factor-Corrected Electronic Ballast

Abstract = {{Although compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) have been on the market for a
   long time, many of them do not achieve the same power factor as the
   incandescent lamps do, which presents a significant problem for the
   utility with the current widespread use of CFLs for household lightings.
   A simple single-switch electronic ballast with passive valley-fill power
   factor correction is proposed in this paper for CFL application. The
   proposed single-switch ballast circuit is able to achieve zero current
   switching to maximize the circuit efficiency. A simple feedback circuit
   with duty ratio control is also proposed to improve the high lamp
   current crest factor caused by the valley-fill circuit. Detailed
   descriptions and analysis of the circuit operating principles are
   provided in this paper. Simulation and experimental results are given on
   a 13-W CFL tube from Osram Sylvania to highlight the merits of the
   proposed work.}},

Title = {{Probing the transition from an uncoupled to a strong near-field coupled
   regime between bright and dark mode resonators in metasurfaces}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},

Abstract = {{The coupling of multiple plasmonic resonators that sustain bright or
   dark modes provide intriguing spectral signatures. However, probing the
   onset of coupling effects while engaging the resonators with an
   increasing proximity has not yet been studied experimentally in detail.
   Nevertheless, this is of utmost importance to bridge the
   phenomenological understanding with the peculiarities of
   real-world-samples. Here, we take advantage of the ability to control
   spatial dimensions of THz metasurfaces deep in the sub-wavelength domain
   to study different regimes that occur while coupling
   split-ring-resonators that sustain a bright and a dark mode with
   increasing strength. We identify the length scales at which the
   resonators are uncoupled and then enter the regimes of weak, moderate,
   and strong coupling. It is shown that a strong coupling takes place only
   at distances smaller than one hundredth of the resonance wavelength.
   Understanding the features that emerge from such hybridization is
   important to take advantage of fundamental effects in metamaterials such
   as classical analogs of electromagnetically induced transparency, lasing
   spaser, near-field manipulation, and sensing with dark mode resonances.

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{791}},

Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{We present far-UV spectroscopy from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on
   the Hubble Space Telescope of a cool, star-forming filament in the core
   of A1795. These data, which span 1025 angstrom < lambda(rest) < 1700
   angstrom, allow for the simultaneous modeling of the young stellar
   populations and the intermediate-temperature (10(5.5) K) gas in this
   filament, which is far removed (similar to 30 kpc) from the direct
   influence of the central active galactic nucleus. Using a combination of
   UV absorption line indices and stellar population synthesis modeling, we
   find evidence for ongoing star formation, with the youngest stars having
   ages of 7.5(-2.0)(+2.5) Myr and metallicities of 0.4(-0.1)(+0.2)
   Z(circle dot). The latter is consistent with the local metallicity of
   the intracluster medium. We detect the O VI lambda 1038 line, measuring
   a flux of f(OVI,1038) = 4.0 +/- 0.9 x 10(-17) erg s(-1) cm(-2). The O VI
   lambda 1032 line is redshifted such that it is coincident with a strong
   Galactic H-2 absorption feature, and is not detected. The measured O VI
   lambda 1038 flux corresponds to a cooling rate of 0.85 +/- 0.2 (stat)
   +/- 0.15 (sys) M-circle dot yr(-1) at similar to 10(5.5) K, assuming
   that the cooling proceeds isochorically, which is consistent with the
   classical X-ray luminosity-derived cooling rate in the same region. We
   measure a star formation rate of 0.11 +/- 0.02 M-circle dot yr(-1) from
   the UV continuum, suggesting that star formation is proceeding at
   13(-2)(+3)\% efficiency in this filament. We propose that this
   inefficient star formation represents a significant contribution to the
   larger-scale cooling flow problem.}},

Abstract = {{Large, thin (50 mu m) dry polymer sheets containing numerous
   surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) active Ag nanopartide
   aggregates have been prepared by drying aqueous mixtures of
   hydroxyethylcelloulose (HEC) and preaggregated Ag colloid in 10 x 10 cm
   molds. In these dry films, the particle aggregates are protected from
   the environment during storage and are easy to handle; for example, they
   can be cut to size with scissors. When in use, the highly swellable HEC
   polymer allowed the films to rapidly absorb aqueous analyte solutions
   while simultaneously releasing the Ag nanoparticle aggregates to
   interact with the analyte and generate large SERS signals. Either the
   films could be immersed in the analyte solution or 5 mu L droplets were
   applied to the surface; in the latter method, the local swelling caused
   the active area to dome upward, but the swollen film remained physically
   robust and could be handled as required. Importantly, encapsulation and
   release did not significantly compromise the SERS performance of the
   colloid; the signals given by the swollen films were similar to the very
   high signals obtained from the parent citrate-reduced colloid and were
   an order of magnitude larger than a commercially available nanoparticle
   substrate. These ``Poly-SERS{''} films retained 70\% of their SERS
   activity after being stored for 1 year in air. The films were
   sufficiently homogeneous to give a standard deviation of 3.2\% in the
   absolute signal levels obtained from a test analyte, primarily due to
   the films' ability to suppress ``coffee ring{''} drying marks, which
   meant that quantitative analysis without an internal standard was
   possible. The majority of the work used aqueous thiophenol as the test
   analyte; however, preliminary studies showed that the Poly-SERS films
   could also be used with nonaqueous solvents and for a range of other
   analytes including theophylline, a therapeutic drug, at a concentration
   as low as 1.0 x 10(-5) mol dm(-3) (1.8 mg/dm(3)), well below the
   sensitivity required for theophylline monitoring where the target range
   is 10-20 mg/dm(3).}},

Abstract = {{In-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction has been used to study the
   influence of the heat treatment temperature on the subsequent
   micromechanical behavior of nitinol wire. It was found that increase in
   the heat treatment temperature rotated the austenite texture from the
   \{332\}(B2) fiber towards the \{111\}(B2) fiber, and the texture of the
   Stress-Induced Martensite phase changed from the ((1) over bar 40)(B19')
   to the ((1) over bar 20)(B19') fiber accordingly. Heat treatment at a
   low temperature reduces the internal residual strains in the austenite
   during super-elastic deformation and therefore improves the materials
   fatigue performance. The development of internal residual strains in
   austenite is controlled by transformation induced plasticity and the
   reversal martensite to austenite transformation. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

   constructs appeared to adopt the structural appearance of native
   auricular cartilage, the constructs displayed limited expression and
   poor localization of elastin. In the present study, the effect of growth
   factor supplementation (insulin, IGF-1, or TGF-beta 1) was investigated
   to stimulate elastogenesis as well as to improve overall tissue
   formation. Using rabbit auricular chondrocytes, bioreactor-cultivated
   constructs supplemented with either insulin or IGF-1 displayed increased
   deposition of cartilaginous ECM, improved mechanical properties, and
   thicknesses comparable to native auricular cartilage after 4 weeks of
   growth. Similarly, growth factor supplementation resulted in increased
   expression and improved localization of elastin, primarily restricted
   within the cartilaginous region of the tissue construct. Additional
   studies were conducted to determine whether scaffold-free engineered
   auricular cartilage constructs could be developed in the 3D shape of the
   external ear. Isolated auricular chondrocytes were grown in
   rapid-prototyped tissue culture molds with additional insulin or IGF-1
   supplementation during bioreactor cultivation. Using this approach, the
   developed tissue constructs were flexible and had a 3D shape in very
   good agreement to the culture mold (average error <400 mu m). While
   scaffold-free, engineered auricular cartilage constructs can be created
   with both the appropriate tissue structure and 3D shape of the external
   ear, future studies will be aimed assessing potential changes in
   construct shape and properties after subcutaneous implantation.}},

Title = {{Gossan Hill, Victoria Island, Northwest Territories: An analogue for
   mine waste reactions within permafrost and implication for the
   subsurface mineralogy of Mars}},
Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{400}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Gossan Hill is located within the Minto Inlier in central Victoria
   Island, Northwest Territories (N 71.36697 degrees, W 114.95155 degrees).
   A study of the mineralogical associations and geological setting of this
   deposit indicates that it is an arrested hydrothermal system frozen in
   permafrost. From above, the hill stands out because of the topographic
   relief of 75 m and the orange-brown color of the surficial material. The
   surface of the hill is marked by areas of concentric color zonation up
   to 3 m across, with light gray centers surrounded by a yellow-orange
   ring that is surrounded by an orange-brown color that covers the rest of
   the surface of the hill. Trenches dug into these areas reveal that the
   central zone contains quartz and pyrite +/- native sulfur in a loose
   aggregate of sand-sized grains. This central area is surrounded by a
   zone dominated by gypsum and quartz with some jarosite. Beyond this, the
   surrounding surface consists of quartz, hematite, and amorphous iron
   oxides. The radial arrangement of the mineral assemblage indicates an
   increase in oxidation of sulfur from the center outward. Analysis of
   isotopic composition of the sulfur indicates the source of sulfur could
   be the underlying strata. The hill is underlain by inter-bedded
   carbonate and sulfate-evaporite sedimentary rocks of the Kilian
   formation in the upper part of the Neoproterozoic Shaler Super group.
   The sedimentary rocks were intruded by diabase sills of the 720 Ma
   Franklin igneous event, which crop out 2 km to the south of Gossan Hill.
   The soft friable nature of the deposit and the topographic relief of the
   hill indicate a post-glacial (Pleistocene) age of formation. Permafrost
   has maintained the disequilibrium mineral assemblage since the cessation
   of fluid flow. Extraction of the permafrost ice from the central zone
   yields a liquid with a pH of 23. The observed long-term persistence of
   pyrite encased within the acidic permafrost indicates that oxidation and
   dissolution reactions common in mine waste are slowed, if not stopped,
   in such an environment. The predicted rise of Arctic temperatures will
   cause the active layer to move deeper and result in the release of the
   acidic solutions frozen in the permafrost. Water ice or frozen CO2 just
   below the Martian surface would also preserve such mineral
   disequilibrium for very long periods of time. No region exists on Earth
   where ice has existed continuously for millions of years, but the Gossan
   Hill deposit is an excellent terrestrial analogue. On Mars, the
   subsurface ice may be very old. Ancient reactive Martian mineral
   assemblages and the fluids associated with them will reflect conditions
   that existed in the past. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicles powered with internal combustion engines (ICEs) are one of the
   main pollutant sources in large cities. Most of large cities (e.g.
   Amman, capital of Jordan) suffer from frequent traffic jams. This leads
   to frequent stops and starts, and hence, an increase in tailpipe
   emissions. One way to minimize emissions is to use electric motors in
   the powertrain configuration. In this study, the performance of a hybrid
   fuel cell (FC)/battery vehicle is investigated utilizing different
   worldwide driving cycles. Initially, a model of a mid-sized ICE vehicle
   is developed and validated against experimental tests. The ICE vehicle
   validated model is then modified to be driven with only an electric
   motor powered by a hybrid FC/battery system. The effect of driving
   pattern, which varies from city to city and from region to region, is
   investigated. A driving cycle that represents the driving patterns in
   Amman city is developed based on experimental data and then used to
   evaluate the performance of both ICE and hybrid FC/battery vehicle
   configurations. It is found that the performance of the hybrid
   FC/battery configuration is much better than the ICE version in terms of
   emissions, fuel economy, efficiency, and speed tracking error. (C) 2014

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{30}},
Pages = {{4763-4774}},
Month = {{AUG 13}},
Abstract = {{Thin films of ion-conducting polymers are an important area of study due
   to their function in many electrochemical devices and as analogues for
   interfacial phenomena that occur in bulk films. In this paper, the
   properties of Nafion, a prototypical ionomer, are investigated as thin
   films (4 to 300 nm) on carbon, gold, and platinum substrates that are
   fabricated using different casting methods and thermal histories.
   Specifically, water uptake, swelling, and morphology are investigated by
   quartz-crystal microbalance, ellipsometry, and grazing-incidence X-ray
   scattering to develop structure/property/ processing relationships. For
   all substrates, as the films' thickness decreased, there is an initial
   decrease in swelling followed by a subsequent increase for film
   thicknesses below approximate to 20 nm due to a disordering of the film
   hydrophilic/hydrophobic structure. Decreased swelling and less
   structural order is observed on gold for spin-cast films compared to
   self-assembled films; the opposite effect is observed for films on
   carbon. The presented systematic data set and analyses represent a
   thorough study of the behavior of Nafion thin films on model substrates
   of interest in metal catalyst/carbon electrodes, and these insights help
   to elucidate the underlying polymer physics and confinement effects in
   these and related systems.}},

Abstract = {{Since its introduction, in the early 1970s, large eddy simulations (LES)
   have advanced considerably, and their application is transitioning from
   the academic environment to industry. Several landmark developments can

   simulations of wall-bounded flows, the development of advanced models
   for the unresolved scales that adapt to the local flow conditions and
   the hybridization of LES with the solution of the Reynolds-averaged
   Navier-Stokes equations. Thanks to these advancements, LES is now in
   widespread use in the academic community and is an option available in
   most commercial flow-solvers. This paper will try to predict what
   algorithmic and modelling advancements are needed to make it even more
   robust and inexpensive, and which areas show the most promise.}},

Abstract = {{An improved approximate maximum likelihood algorithm is developed for
   estimating measurement noise variances along with model parameters and
   disturbance intensities in nonlinear stochastic differential equation
   (SDE) models. This algorithm uses a Laplace approximation and B-spline
   basis functions for approximating the likelihood function of the
   parameters given the measurements. The resulting Laplace approximation
   maximum likelihood estimation (LAMLE) algorithm is tested using a
   nonlinear continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) model. Estimation
   results for four model parameters, two process disturbance intensities
   and two measurement noise variances are obtained using LAMLE and are
   compared with results from two other maximum-likelihood-based methods,
   the continuous-time stochastic method (CTSM) of Kristensen and Madsen
   (2003) and the Fully Laplace Approximation Estimation Method (FLAEM)
   (Karimi and McAuley, 2014). Parameter estimations using 100 simulated
   data sets reveal that the LAMLE estimation results tend to be more
   precise and less biased than corresponding estimates obtained using CTSM
   and FLAEM. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   that communicates with local CDMPC controllers. With the assistance of
   the coordinator, the local CDMPC controllers adjust their calculated
   control actions iteratively to achieve the optimal plant-wide operation.
   A `prediction-driven' algorithm is used to coordinate the local CDMPC
   controllers. Convergence of the prediction-driven algorithm is shown
   along with a stability analysis of the closed-loop system under
   coordinated-distributed control. A simulation example is used to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed coordinated-distributed
   control scheme.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the analysis of the stability of delayed
   recurrent neural networks. In contrast to the widely used
   Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, a new method is developed
   within the integral quadratic constraints framework. To achieve this,
   several lemmas are first given to propose integral quadratic separators
   to characterize the original delayed neural network. With these, the
   network is then reformulated as a special form of
   feedback-interconnected system by choosing proper integral quadratic
   constraints. Finally, new stability criteria are established based on
   the proposed approach. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the
   effectiveness of the new approach.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile media has undoubtedly become the predominant source of traffic in
   wireless networks. The result is not only congestion and poor quality of
   experience, but also an unprecedented energy drain at both the network
   and user devices. In order to sustain this continued growth, novel
   disruptive paradigms of media delivery are urgently needed. We envision
   that two key contemporary advancements can be leveraged to develop
   greener media delivery platforms: The proliferation of navigation
   hardware and software in mobile devices has created an era of location
   awareness, where both the current and future user locations can be
   predicted; and the rise of context-aware network architectures and
   self-organizing functionalities is enabling context signaling and
   in-network adaptation. With these developments in mind, this article
   investigates the opportunities of exploiting location awareness to
   enable green end-to-end media delivery. In particular, we discuss and
   propose approaches for location-based adaptive video quality planning,
   in-network caching, content prefetching, and long-term radio resource
   management. To provide insights on the energy savings, we then present a
   cross-layer framework that jointly optimizes resource allocation and
   multi-user video quality using location predictions. Finally, we
   highlight some of the future research directions for location-aware
   media delivery in the conclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific variation in gamete compatibility among male/female pairs
   causes variation in the concentration of sperm required to achieve
   equivalent fertilization levels. Gamete compatibility is therefore
   potentially an important factor controlling mating success. Many
   broadcast-spawning marine invertebrates, however, also live in a dynamic
   environment where hydrodynamic conditions can affect the concentration
   of sperm reaching eggs during spawning. Thus flow conditions may
   moderate the effects of gamete compatibility on fertilization. Using the
   green sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis as a model system, we
   assessed the relative effects of gamete compatibility (the concentration
   of sperm required to fertilize 50\% of the eggs in specific male/female
   pairs; F-50) and the root-mean-square of total velocity (urms; 0.01-0.11
   m s(-1)) on fertilization in four locations near a spawning female
   (water column, wake eddy, substratum, and aboral surface) in both
   unidirectional and oscillatory flows. Percent fertilization decreased
   significantly with increasing urms at all locations and both flow
   regimes. However, although gamete compatibility varied by almost 1.5
   orders of magnitude, it was not a significant predictor of fertilization
   for most combinations of position and flow. The notable exception was a
   significant effect of gamete compatibility on fertilization on the
   aboral surface under unidirectional flow. Our results suggest that
   selection on variation in gamete compatibility may be strongest in eggs
   fertilized on the aboral surface of sea urchins and that hydrodynamic
   conditions may add environmental noise to selection outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of NOx storage and reduction over 1.5 wt\% Pt/20 wt\%
   KNO3/K2Ti8O17 and 1.5 wt\% Pt/K2Ti8O17 catalysts has been investigated
   using combined fast transient kinetic switching and isotopically
   labelled (NO)-N-15 at 350 degrees C. The evolution of product N-2 has
   revealed two significant peaks during 60 s lean/1.3 s rich switches. It
   also found that the presence of CO2 in the feed affects the release of
   N-2 in the second peak. Regardless of the presence/absence of water in
   the feed, only one peak of N-2 was observed in the absence of CO2.
   Gas-phase NH3 was not observed in any of the experiments. However, in
   the presence of CO2 the results obtained from in situ DRIFTS-MS analysis
   showed that isocyanate species are formed and stored during the rich
   cycles, probably from the reaction between NOx and CO, in which CO was
   formed via the reverse water-gas shift reaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

   EFFECT OF UNSTEADY STATOR-ROTOR INTERACTIONS}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Unsteady simulations were performed to investigate time dependent
   behaviors of the leakage flow structures and heat transfer on the rotor
   blade tip and casing in a single stage gas turbine engine. This paper
   mainly illustrates the unsteady nature of the leakage flow and heat
   transfer, particularly, that caused by the stator-rotor interactions. In
   order to obtain time-accurate results, the effects of varying the number
   of time steps, sub iterations, and the number of vane passing periods
   was firstly examined. The effect of tip clearance height and rotor
   speeds was also examined. The results showed periodic patterns of the
   tip leakage flow and heat transfer rate distribution for each vane
   passing. The relative position of the vane and vane trailing edge shock
   with respect to time alters the flow conditions in the rotor domain, and
   results in significant variations in the tip leakage flow structures and
   heat transfer rate distributions. It is observed that the trailing edge
   shock phenomenon results in a critical heat transfer region on the blade
   tip and casing. Consequently, the turbine blade tip and casing are
   subjected to large fluctuations of Nusselt number (about Nu = 2000 to
   6000 and about Nu = 1000 to 10000, respectively) at a high frequency
   (coinciding with the rotor speed).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{164}},
Pages = {{49-58}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In situ thermal treatment technologies, such as electrical resistance
   heating and thermal conductive heating, use subsurface temperature
   measurements in addition to the analysis of soil and groundwater samples
   to monitor remediation performance. One potential indication of
   non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) removal is an increase in temperature
   following observations of a co-boiling plateau, during which subsurface
   temperatures remain constant as NAPL and water co-boil. However,
   observed co-boiling temperatures can be affected by the composition of
   the NAPL and the proximity of the NAPL to the temperature measurement
   location. Results of laboratory heating experiments using
   single-component and multi-component NAPLs showed that local-scale
   temperature measurements can be mistakenly interpreted as an indication
   of the end of NAPL water co-boiling, and that significant NAPL
   saturations (1\% to 9\%) remain despite observed increases in
   temperature. Furthermore, co-boiling of multi-component NAPL results in
   gradually increasing temperature, rather than a co-boiling plateau.
   Measurements of gas production can serve as a complementary metric for
   assessing NAPL removal by providing a larger-scale measurement
   integrated over multiple smaller-scale NAPL locations. Measurements of
   the composition of the NAPL condensate can provide ISTT operators with
   information regarding the progress of NAPL removal for multi-component
   sources. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Gifford Creek Ferrocarbonatite Complex (GFC), located in the
   Neoarchean-Palaeoproterozoic Gascoyne Province, Western Australia,
   comprises sills, dykes, and veins of ferrocarbonatite intruding the
   Pimbyana Granite and Yangibana Granite of the Durlacher Supersuite and
   metasedimentary rocks of the Pooranoo Metamorphics. The
   ferrocarbonatites are associated with complex and irregularly
   distributed zones of fenitic alteration. These ferrocarbonatites and
   fenites are also associated with a swarm of ironstone veins, containing
   magnetite, hematite and goethite. The GFC and associated fenite outcrops
   are distributed within a similar to 700 km(2) area, north of the Lyons
   River Fault. Ferrocarbonatite sills and dykes are predominant in a
   northwest-trending belt, along the southern margin of the complex;
   whereas ferrocarbonatite veins tend to be distributed in a series of
   sub-parallel west-northwest-trending linear belts, generally associated
   with the Fe oxide veins with sinuous trends. These veins have margins of
   Fe-rich carbonates associated with zones of alteration that have a
   fenitic character. The fenitic haloes are characterised by the presence
   of Na-K-feldspars and/or Na-amphiboles and magnetite. In some cases
   monomineralic feldspar zones (orthodasite) are present. Fenitic
   alteration is spatially associated with the carbonatites, but it can
   also form discrete veins and veinlets in basement granitic rocks
   (Pimbyana and Yangibana Granites). Petrographic, XRD and SEM analyses
   show that the ferrocarbonatites are dominantly composed of
   ankerite-dolomite, magnetite, arfvedsonite-riebeckite, and lesser
   calcite. Alkali amphibole has compositions ranging from potassian
   magnesio-arfvedsonite to magnesio-riebeckite. Sills and dykes north of
   the Lyons River, are characterised by a carbonate-rich matrix,
   containing >50 vol.\% ankerite-dolomite, with accessory quantities of
   apatite, barite, monazite, and phlogopite. In-situ U-Pb age
   determination of apatite grains by LA-ICP-MS on a sample of
   ferrocarbonatite was performed and an average age of 1075 +/- 35 Ma was
   obtained. This age is within the range of ages (similar to 1078-1070 Ma)
   of the Warakurna Large Igneous Province (WLIP) and we suggest that the
   GFC is related to the mantle plume event that generated the WLIP. This
   is a significant outcome, because it may lead to the recognition or
   discovery of other carbonatites within the area covered by the WLIP. In

   enhances the nonlinear interactions in the stacks, especially at the

Abstract = {{A new experimental procedure based on attenuated total reflection
   infrared spectroscopy has been developed to investigate surface species
   under liquid phase reaction conditions. The technique has been tested by
   investigating the enhanced selectivity in the hydrogenation of
   alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde citral over a 596 Pt/SiO2 catalyst
   toward unsaturated alcohols geraniol/nerol, which occurs when
   citronellal is added to the reaction. The change in selectivity is
   proposed to be the result of a change in the citral adsorption mode in
   the presence of citronellal. Short time on stream attenuated total
   internal reflection infrared spectroscopy has allowed identification of
   the adsorption modes of citral. With no citronellal, citral adsorbs
   through both the C=C and C=O groups; however, in the presence of
   citronellal, citral adsorption occurs through the C=O group only, which
   is proposed to be the cause of the altered reaction selectivity.}},

   has focused on the control of specific types of DPS, such as those

   systems) have also been studied extensively; however, additional
   techniques are required to deal with boundary control problems. In this
   article, a discrete 2-D state space model for boundary control problems

Abstract = {{In this article, we consider the problem of parameter identification and
   state estimation of an uncertain continuous-time linearly parameterized
   nonlinear system with output dependent nonlinearities subject to
   exogenous disturbances. A set-based adaptive estimation is proposed in
   which the parameters and the states of the system are estimated along
   with an uncertainty set guaranteed to contain the true unknown values.
   The set-update approach is such that the sets are updated only when an
   improvement in the precision of the parameter estimates and the state
   estimates can be guaranteed. The formulation provides robustness to
   parameter estimation error and bounded disturbances. The adaptive
   estimation technique can be viewed as an adaptive interval observer.
   Simulation examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the
   developed procedure and ascertain the theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{Gas-to-liquid processes are generally used to convert natural gas or
   other gaseous hydrocarbons into liquid fuels via an intermediate syngas
   stream. This includes the production of liquid fuels from
   biomass-derived sources such as biogas. For example, the dry reforming
   of methane is done by reacting CH4 and CO2, the two main components of
   natural biogas, into more valuable products, i.e., CO and H-2. Nickel
   containing perovskite type catalysts can promote this reaction, yielding
   good conversions and selectivities; however, they are prone to coke
   laydown under certain operating conditions. We investigated the addition
   of high oxygen mobility dopants such as CeO2, ZrO2, or YSZ to reduce
   carbon laydown, particularly using reaction conditions that normally
   result in rapid coking. While doping with YSZ, YDC, GDC, and SDC did not
   result in any improvement, we show that a Ni perovskite catalyst
   (Na0.5La0.5Ni0.3Al0.7O2.5) doped with 80.9 ZrO2 15.2 CeO2 gave the
   lowest amount of carbon formation at 800 degrees C and activity was
   maintained over the operating time. (C) 2014, Dalian Institute of

Abstract = {{The incorporation of carboxyl functionalised multi-walled carbon
   nanotube (MWCNT-COOH) into a leading proprietary grade orthopaedic bone
   cement (Simplex P) at 0.1wt\% has been investigated. Resultant static
   and fatigue mechanical properties, in addition to thermal and
   polymerisation properties, have been determined. Significant
   improvements (p0.001) in bending strength (42\%), bending modulus (55\%)
   and fracture toughness (22\%) were demonstrated. Fatigue properties were
   improved (p0.001), with mean number of cycles to failure and fatigue
   performance index being increased by 64\% and 52\%, respectively.
   Thermal necrosis index values at 44? and 55? were significantly reduced
   (p0.001) (28\% and 27\%) versus the control. Furthermore, the onset of
   polymerisation increased by 58\% (p<0.001), as did the duration of the
   polymerisation reaction (52\%). Peak energy during polymerisation
   increased by 672\% (p<0.001). Peak area of polymerisation increased by
   116\% (p<0.001) indicating that the incorporation of MWCNT-COOH reduced
   the rate of polymerisation significantly. A non-significant reduction
   (8\%) in percentage monomer conversion was also recorded. Raman
   spectroscopy clearly showed that the addition of MWCNT-COOH increased
   the ratio between normalised intensities of the G-Band and D-Band
   (I-G/I-D), and also increased the theoretical compressive strain
   (-1.72\%) exerted on the MWCNT-COOH by the Simplex P cement matrix.
   Therefore, demonstrating a level of chemical interactivity between the
   MWCNT-COOH and the Simplex P bone cement exists and consequently a more
   effective mechanism for successful transfer of mechanical load. The
   extent of homogenous dispersion of the MWCNT-COOH throughout the bone
   cement was determined using Raman mapping.}},

Title = {{Splices of FRP Stay-in-Place Structural Forms in Concrete Bridge Decks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This experimental study focuses on the design and spacing of splices of
   fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) stay-in-place structural forms used in
   concrete bridge decks. The ribbed FRP panels, which span the gap between
   girders, are typically of limited width, and therefore are spliced by
   overlapping. A total of 23 auxiliary lap splice tension tests addressed
   various bond systems including adhesive and/or mechanical fasteners of
   various diameters and spacing. Seven scaled bridge deck systems were
   built with FRP panels of various widths, some with bonded splices and
   some with no bond at all at the overlap region. The study showed that
   using narrow FRP plates of small width-to-deck thickness (b/t) ratio
   significantly reduces deck capacity when no splice bond is provided
   because narrow panels may force the punching shear crack to terminate at
   a splice, at a steeper angle, thereby reducing punching shear capacity.
   The deck with b/t = 1.9 exhibited a 24\% lower capacity than that with
   b/t = 7.2. In bonded-splice decks, plate width has no effect on
   strength. Generally, ultimate failure loads ranged from 5.7 to 8.8 times
   the equivalent service load. For an overlap splice of a length equal to
   4.3 times plate thickness, the optimal splice was by combined adhesive
   and fasteners of diameter equal to plate thickness, spaced at 1.8 times
   the overlap length. It developed 68\% of plate tensile strength, whereas
   fasteners alone developed only 14-45\% strength depending on their
   diameter and spacing. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Two different prerepair loading histories were simulated in 3,000 x 300
   x 150 mm reinforced concrete beams, namely cracking within the elastic
   range, and overloading in the plastic range. After unloading, the beams
   were repaired with either high or ultrahigh modulus (210 or 400 GPa)
   carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates, or a hybrid system, and
   then reloaded to failure. It was shown that the level of preexisting
   damage has insignificant effect on strengthening effectiveness and
   failure mode at ultimate. The 210 and 400 GPa CFRP of reinforcement
   ratio rho(f) = 0.17\% increased the yielding load by 33 and 60\%,
   respectively, whereas the ultimate strength was increased by up to 29
   and 51\%, respectively. Doubling r(f) of the 400 GPa CFRP to 0.34\%
   resulted in a 63\% overall gain in flexural strength, which is only an
   8\% increase over rho(f) = 0.17\%, because of change in failure mode
   from rupture to concrete cover delamination. The beam retrofitted by
   hybrid CFRP showed remarkable pseudoductility and warning signs. The
   parametric study revealed a critical balance in proportioning the areas
   of hybrid CFRP to achieve reliable pseudoductility. A maximum of 30\%
   rho(f) of 400 GPa CFRP is recommended. A higher percentage would lead to
   a final ultimate load lower than the first failure peak load. (C) 2013

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Under some circumstances, leaving a composite geomembrane/geosynthetic
   clay liner (GCL) exposed to solar radiation in the field has been shown
   to cause shrinkage of the underlying GCL. Recent field studies have
   shown that leaving a composite liner exposed can also lead to erosion of
   bentonite from the GCL due to downslope moisture migration. This paper
   reports an experimental technique that reproduced similar erosion in the
   laboratory on a typical landfill side slope of 3H:1V. The test method
   simulates the features that occur with the erosion of bentonite caused
   by downslope migration of evaporative water in the field. The laboratory
   tests demonstrate that erosion features can be present but may not be
   visible unless the appropriate back lighting is used. Erosion features
   measuring over 25 mm in width were produced. The test method simulated
   the features that were observed with bentonite erosion in the field and
   has the potential for use in examining other factors that may affect
   this type of erosion. The test method developed can be used for
   examining the response of GCLs when part of a composite liner that will
   be left exposed. The findings from this laboratory study provide
   additional motivation for timely covering of composite liner systems as
   recommended by GCL manufacturers. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{In recent years, wind power industry has been flourishing and in China
   the focus has been gradually shifted from land-based to offshore wind
   farms. There are many advantages for offshore wind farms, such as
   abundant wind energy reserves, high utilization of the wind turbine
   capacity, not taking up land resources and so on. As wind turbine
   technology improves, offshore wind farms have been expanding quickly and
   are located further away from the onshore grid. The power transmission
   problem has become one of the key issues for restricting the development
   of offshore wind farms. For example, the technology of high voltage
   direct current transmission based on voltage source converter
   (VSC-HVDC), suitable for long-distance transmission of offshore wind
   energy, has become one of the current research focuses. This has
   resulted in higher requirements on the aspects of converter voltage
   level, system dynamic performance, and network power quality. The paper
   first discusses converter topology for offshore wind farm grid
   integration. Two VSC-HVDC projects for connecting offshore wind farms,
   which are located in Shanghai and Dalian of China, are presented in
   detail. Based on the two projects, the structure, control methods and
   application of modular multi-level converter are presented. The control
   strategies of VSC-HVDC are then discussed, focusing on double
   closed-loop vector control, direct power control, deadbeat control and
   the control methods for unbalanced grid voltage. This can provide good
   theoretical foundation for the grid integration of large offshore wind
   farms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   two-site elasto-plastic self-consistent model (EPSC) assisted in the
   interpretation of the elastic lattice strain response. In addition, the
   microstructures of the deformed specimens were analysed by (scanning)

   between the EPSC and STEM results regarding a joint deformation of the
   gamma and gamma' phase in the fine gamma' microstructures and for low
   plastic strains in the medium gamma' microstructures. With increasing
   gamma' size and increasing degree of plastic deformation, both

Abstract = {{The irradiation induced defects in CANDU Inconel X-750 spacers, which

   locations with different estimated irradiation temperatures were tested:
   (1) similar to 480 degrees C at 6 o'clock position and (2) >= 300
   degrees C at 12 o'clock position. Obvious temperature effects were
   observed. In the similar to 180 degrees C irradiated sample, a high
   density of small lattice defects (1-3 nm) developed during irradiation,
   including stacking fault tetrahedra and both 1/3 < 111 > and 1/2 < 110 >
   type dislocation loops. A uniform distribution of small cavities
   (similar to 1-3 nm) was observed. In >300 degrees C irradiated sample,
   apart from small point defect clusters, large Frank type interstitial
   loops presented. The sizes of the cavities were also greater than those
   in the similar to 480 degrees C irradiated sample. The distribution of
   cavities was more heterogeneous and an obvious agglomeration of cavities
   to grain boundaries and phase boundaries were observed. In both samples,
   dissolution of the primary strengthening phase gamma' was noted. (C)

   milling with magnesium particles for 20 h. Mechanical and metallurgical
   bonds have been found in YAl2/Mg interfaces without any interface
   reactions. Both the refining and mechanical activation efficiencies for
   YAl2 particles are enhanced, which may be related to the addition of

Abstract = {{A practical sequence detector of differential phase-shift keying (DPSK)
   is developed in closed-form for amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative
   networks. This detector is applicable for general M-DPSK (M >= 2) with
   arbitrary sequence length N-s >= 1, which includes a single-by-symbol
   detector as a special case N-s = 1. In contrast to the maximum
   likelihood detector (MLD) and the best-known diversity combiner (DC),
   the proposed detector does not require the knowledge of the channel
   statistics (which are unknown a priori in practice) and yet, still
   achieving significant performance improvement. Specifically, for N-s =
   1, the proposed detector outperforms DC by 1.7 dB and achieves near ML
   performance. For N-s >= 2, the proposed detector outperforms MLD and the
   performance gain compared with MLD increases as N-s increases; this
   performance gain is approximately 1 dB for N-s = 4.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work has shown that high-temperature short-term spike thermal
   annealing of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) photovoltaic
   thermal (PVT) systems results in higher electrical energy output. The
   relationship between temperature and performance of a-Si:H PVT is not
   simple as high temperatures during thermal annealing improves the
   immediate electrical performance following an anneal, but during the
   anneal it creates a marked drop in electrical performance. In addition,
   the power generation of a-Si:H PVT depends on both the environmental
   conditions and the Staebler-Wronski Effect kinetics. In order to improve
   the performance of a-Si:H PVT systems further, this paper reports on the
   effect of various dispatch strategies on system electrical performance.
   Utilizing experimental results from thermal annealing, an annealing
   model simulation for a-Si:H-based PVT was developed and applied to
   different cities in the U.S. to investigate potential geographic effects
   on the dispatch optimization of the overall electrical PVT systems
   performance and annual electrical yield. The results showed that spike
   thermal annealing once per day maximized the improved electrical energy
   generation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{LLC converters face challenges in high-current applications, where the
   high conduction loss limits the maximum load capacity and reduces
   efficiency. Interleaving technique can be used to solve this problem,
   but the component tolerances of the resonant tanks will cause severe
   load sharing problem. The SCC-LLC converter was proposed to solve the
   load sharing problem. However, due to its constant switching frequency
   operation, it has some limitations over complete line and load variation
   compared to conventional LLC converters. In this paper, a new control
   strategy is proposed for the SCC-LLC converter, which enables variable
   switching frequency operation; thus, it provides uncompromised
   performance while achieving interleaved operation. Analyses and a design
   method are provided, and a 600-W two-phase interleaved SCC-LLC prototype
   is built to verify the feasibility.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{Ultracold hybrid ion-atom traps offer the possibility of microscopic
   manipulation of quantum coherences in the gas using the ion as a probe.
   However, inelastic processes, particularly charge transfer can be a
   significant process of ion loss and has been measured experimentally for
   the Yb+ ion immersed in a Rb vapour. We use first-principles quantum
   chemistry codes to obtain the potential energy curves and dipole moments
   for the lowest-lying energy states of this complex. Calculations for the
   radiative decay processes cross sections and rate coefficients are
   presented for the total decay processes; Yb+(6s S-2) + Rb(5s S-2) ->
   Yb(6s(2) S-1) + Rb+(4p(6) S-1) + h nu and Yb+(6s S-2) + Rb(5s S-2) ->
   YbRb+(X-1 Sigma(+)) + h nu. Comparing the semi-classical Langevin
   approximation with the quantum approach, we find it provides a very good
   estimate of the background at higher energies. The results demonstrate
   that radiative decay mechanisms are important over the energy and
   temperature region considered. In fact, the Langevin process of ion-atom
   collisions dominates cold ion-atom collisions. For spin-dependent
   processes {[}1] the anisotropic magnetic dipole-dipole interaction and
   the second-order spin-orbit coupling can play important roles, inducing
   coupling between the spin and the orbital motion. They measured the
   spin-relaxing collision rate to be approximately five orders of
   magnitude higher than the charge-exchange collision rate {[}1].
   Regarding the measured radiative charge transfer collision rate, we find
   that our calculation is in very good agreement with experiment and with
   previous calculations. Nonetheless, we find no broad resonances features
   that might underly a strong isotope effect. In conclusion, we find, in
   agreement with previous theory that the isotope anomaly observed in
   experiment remains an open question.}},

Abstract = {{The study was conducted to enhance exopolysaccharide (EPS) antioxidant
   formation (as measured by Trolox-Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity, TEAC)
   by Phellinus sp. P0988 through medium studies, while jointly increasing
   EPS yield. Out of seven medium components, four significant variables
   were identified based on linear models with statistical significance (p
   < 0.05), namely rutin, FeSO4, and aspartate, which influenced TEAC, and
   malt extract, which influenced yield. Based on regression analysis of
   the experimental results from central composite design in response
   surface models, two second-order polynomial models adequately
   representing the relationship between these variables and EPS TEAC and
   yield were obtained, and the optimum concentration of these variables
   were determined and validated. Variable combinations for high EPS TEAC
   and yield were optimized through a desirability function test. The
   maximum EPS TEAC and yield reached 8.49 +/- 0.32 mM and 10.92 +/- 0.68
   g/L, respectively, in a 7 L bioreactor under the optimum variable
   combinations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the relationship between constant false alarm rate (CFAR)
   and invariant tests. We introduce the minimal invariant group (MIG). We
   show that for a family of distributions, the unknown parameters are
   eliminated from the distribution of the maximal invariant statistic
   under the MIG while the maximum information of the observed signal is
   preserved. We prove that any invariant test with respect to MIG is CFAR
   and conversely, for any CFAR test an invariant statistic exists with
   respect to an MIG under some mild conditions. Moreover for a given CFAR
   test, we propose a systematic method for deriving an enhanced test,
   i.e., a function of observations exists such that the likelihood ratio
   (LR) of the maximal invariant of its MIG gives an enhanced test.
   Furthermore, we introduce the uniformly most powerful-CFAR (UMP-CFAR)
   test as the optimal CFAR bound among all CFAR tests. We then prove that
   the UMP-CFAR test for the minimally invariant hypothesis testing problem
   is given by the LR of the maximal invariant under MIG. For some
   problems, this test (MP-CFAR) depends on the unknown parameters of the
   alternative hypothesis, however, provides an upper-performance bound for
   all suboptimal CFAR tests. We also propose three suboptimal novel CFAR
   tests among which one is asymptotically optimal.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents novel advances in the deformation behaviour of
   polycrystalline and single crystal silicon using molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulation and validation of the same via nanoindentation experiments.
   In order to unravel the mechanism of deformation, four simulations were
   performed: indentation of a polycrystalline silicon substrate with a (i)
   Berkovich pyramidal and a (ii) spherical (arc) indenter, and (iii and
   iv) indentation of a single crystal silicon substrate with these two
   indenters. The simulation results reveal that high pressure phase
   transformation (HPPT) in silicon (Si-I to Si-II phase transformation)
   occurred in all cases; however, its extent and the manner in which it
   occurred differed significantly between polycrystalline silicon and
   single crystal silicon, and was the main driver of differences in the
   nanoindentation deformation behaviour between these two types of
   silicon. Interestingly, in polycrystalline silicon, the HPPT was
   observed to occur more preferentially along the grain boundaries than
   across the grain boundaries. An automated dislocation extraction
   algorithm (DXA) revealed no dislocations in the deformation zone,
   suggesting that HPPT is the primary mechanism in inducing plasticity in
   silicon.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, we present the formulation and the characterization of novel
   adiponitrile-based electrolytes as a function of the salt structure,
   concentration, and temperature for supercapacitor applications using
   activated carbon based electrode material. To drive this study two salts
   were selected, namely, the tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate and the
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide. Prior
   to determination of their electrochemical performance, formulated
   electrolytes were first characterized to quantify their thermal,
   volumetric, and transport properties as a function of temperature and
   composition. Then, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy techniques were used to investigate their electrochemical
   properties as electrolyte for supercapacitor applications in comparison
   with those reported for the currently used model electrolyte based on
   the dissolution of 1 mol-dm(-3) of tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate
   in acetonitrile. Surprisingly, excellent electrochemical performances
   were observed by testing adiponitrile-based electrolytes, especially
   those containing the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide room-temperature molten salt.
   Differences observed on electrochemical performances between the
   selected adiponitrile electrolytes based on high-temperature
   (tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate) and the room-temperature
   (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide)
   molten salts are mainly driven by the salt solubility in adiponitrile,
   as well as by the charge and the structure of each involved species.
   Furthermore, in comparison with classical electrolytes, the selected
   adiponitrile +1ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide solution exhibits almost similar
   specific capacitances and lower equivalent serial resistance. These
   results demonstrate in fact that the adiponitrile
   1-1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide
   mixture can be used for the formulation of safer electrolytes presenting
   a very low vapor pressure even at high temperatures to design
   acetonitrile-free supercapacitor devices with comparable performances.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of wind power in some power systems is hampered by the system
   requirement for emergency reserve to cover loss of the biggest infeed.
   The study demonstrates that reserve provision from the wind sector
   itself has economic and operational benefits. A heuristic algorithm has
   been developed that can model the relevant aspects of emergency reserve
   provision in a system with both thermal and wind generations. The
   proposed algorithm is first validated by comparing its performance with
   established economic scheduling methods applied to a representative
   power system. The algorithm is then used to demonstrate the economic
   benefit of reserve provision from the wind sector. It is shown that such
   provision reduces wind energy curtailment and thermal unit ramping.
   Finally, it is shown that a wind sector capable of providing emergency
   reserve can expand economically beyond the capacity limit that would
   otherwise apply.}},

Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial laser scanning, also known as Light Detection and Ranging
   (LiDAR) is an emerging technology that has many proven uses in the
   geotechnical engineering community including rockmass characterization,
   discontinuity measurement and landslide monitoring. One of the newer
   applications of LiDAR scanning is deformation monitoring and change
   detection. In tunnels, deformation is traditionally measured using a
   series of five or more control points installed around the diameter of
   the tunnel with measurements recorded at regular time intervals. LiDAR
   provides the ability to obtain a more complete characterization of the
   tunnel surface, allowing for determination of the mechanism and
   magnitude of tunnel deformation, as the entire surface of the tunnel is
   being modeled rather than a fixed set of points. This paper discusses
   terrestrial LiDAR scanning for deformation mapping of a surface and for
   cross-sectional closure measurements within an active tunnel using an
   elliptical fit to data for profile analysis. The methods were found to
   be accurate to within a few millimeters when measuring 58 mm of
   diametric difference over an 18.3 m diameter circular profile, even when
   some sections of the data were removed from the analysis. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Natural gas extracted from hydraulically fractured shale formations
   potentially has a big impact on the global energy landscape. However,
   there are concerns of potential environmental impacts of hydraulic
   fracturing of the shale formations, particularly those related to water
   quality. To evaluate the potential impact of hydraulically fractured
   shale on overlying aquifers, we conduct realizations of numerical
   modeling simulations to assess fluid flow and chloride transport from a
   synthetic Bowland Shale over a period of 11,000 years. The synthetic
   fractured shale was represented by a three-dimensional discrete fracture
   model that was developed by using the data from a Bowland Shale gas
   exploration in Lancashire, UK. Chloride mass exchange between fractures
   and the rock matrix was fully accounted for in the model. The assessment
   was carried out to investigate fluid and chloride mass fluxes before,
   during, and after hydraulic fracturing of the Bowland Shale. Impacts of
   the upward fracture height and aperture, as well as hydraulic
   conductivity of the multilayered bedrock system, are also included this
   assessment. This modeling revealed that the hydraulically fractured
   Bowland Shale is unlikely to pose a risk to its overlying groundwater
   quality when the induced fracture aperture is <= 200 mu m. With the
   fracture aperture >= 1000 mu m, the upward chloride flux becomes very
   sensitive to the upward fracture height growth and hydraulic
   conductivity of the multilayered bedrock system. In the extremely
   unlikely event of the upward fracture growth directly connecting the
   shale formation to the overlying Sherwood Sandstone aquifer with the
   fracture aperture >1000 mu m, the upward chloride mass flux could
   potentially pose risks to the overlying aquifer in 100 years. The model
   study also revealed that the upward mass flux is significantly
   intercepted by the horizontal mass flux within a high permeable layer
   between the Bowland Shale and its overlying aquifers, reducing further
   upward flux toward the overlying aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the performance of dual-hop two-way amplify-and-forward
   relaying in the presence of in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance
   (IQI) at the relay node. In particular, two power allocation schemes,
   namely, fixed power allocation and instantaneous power allocation, are
   proposed to improve the system reliability and robustness against IQI
   under a total transmit power constraint. For each proposed scheme, the
   outage probability is investigated over independent, non-identically
   distributed Nakagami-m fading channels, and exact closed-form
   expressions and bounds are derived. Our theoretical analysis indicates
   that, without IQI compensation, IQI can create fundamental performance
   limits on two-way relaying. However, these limits can be avoided by
   performing IQI compensation at source nodes. Compared with the equal
   power allocation scheme, our numerical results show that the two
   proposed power allocation schemes can significantly improve the outage
   performance, thus reducing the IQI effects, particularly when the total
   power budget is large.}},

Abstract = {{The building sector is widely recognized as having a major impact on
   sustainable development. Both in developed and developing countries,
   sustainability in buildings approaches are growing. Laterite dimension
   stone (LDS) is a building material that was traditionally used in

   characterization of LDS exploited in Burkina Faso for building purposes.
   The measured average thermal conductivity is 0.51 W= mK, which increases
   with water content and evolves with the specific gravity and with
   porosity. Rock mineral phases (quartz, goethite, hematite, magnetite)
   are cemented by kaolinite. The porosity of the material is high (30\%),
   with macropores visible on the surface and found in the rock inner
   structure as well. Results from the hygrothermal monitoring of a pilot

Abstract = {{Sludge is a semi-solid residue produced from wastewater treatment
   processes. It contains biodegradable and recalcitrant organic compounds,
   as well as pathogens, heavy metals, and other inorganic constituents.
   Sludge can also be considered a source of nutrients and energy, which

   paper, several commonly used sludge treatment processes including land
   application, composting, landfilling, anaerobic digestion, and
   combustion are reviewed, along with their potentials for energy and
   product recovery. In addition, some innovative thermo-chemical
   techniques in pyrolysis, gasification, liquefaction, and wet oxidation
   are briefly introduced. Finally, a brief summary of selected published
   works on the life cycle assessment of a variety of sludge treatment and
   end-use scenarios is presented in order to better understand the overall
   energy balance and environmental burdens associated with each sludge
   treatment pathway. In all scenarios investigated, the reuse of bioenergy
   and by-products has been shown to be of crucial importance in enhancing
   the overall energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrous cerium oxide (HCO) was synthesized by intercalation of solutions
   of cerium(III) nitrate and sodium hydroxide and evaluated as an
   adsorbent for the removal of hexavalent chromium from aqueous solutions.
   Simple batch experiments and a 2(5) factorial experimental design were
   employed to screen the variables affecting Cr(VI) removal efficiency.
   The effects of the process variables; solution pH, initial Cr(VI)
   concentration, temperature, adsorbent dose and ionic strength were
   examined. Using the experimental results, a linear mathematical model
   representing the influence of the different variables and their
   interactions was obtained. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated
   that Cr(VI) adsorption significantly increases with decreased solution
   pH, initial concentration and amount of adsorbent used (dose), but
   slightly decreased with an increase in temperature and ionic strength.
   The optimization study indicates 99\% as the maximum removal at pH 2, 20
   degrees C, 1.923 mM of metal concentration and a sorbent dose of 4
   g/dm(3). At these optimal conditions, Langmuir, Freundlich and
   Redlich-Peterson isotherm models were obtained. The maximum adsorption
   capacity of Cr(VI) adsorbed by HCO was 0.828 mmol/g, calculated by the
   Langmuir isotherm model. Desorption of chromium indicated that the HCO
   adsorbent can be regenerated using NaOH solution 0.1 M (up to 85\%). The
   adsorption interactions between the surface sites of HCO and the Cr(VI)
   ions were found to be a combined effect of both anion exchange and
   surface complexation with the formation of an inner-sphere complex.

Abstract = {{The Himalaya is the result of the on-going convergence and collision of
   India and Asia. The internal configuration and processes that govern the
   rise of the Himalayan Mountains and Tibetan Plateau are crucial to
   understand continental collision zones. However, knowledge of the prior
   configuration of the colliding plates is equally important, since
   inherited (pre-orogenic/basement) structures can undeniably influence
   the development of the orogenic architecture throughout the orogen's
   cycle of collision and eventual collapse. Three northeast-trending
   palaeotopographic ridges of faulted Precambrian Indian basement underlie
   the Ganga basin south of the Himalaya. Our paper illustrates a
   crustal-scale fault origin for these ridges and succeeds in determining
   how far north beneath the Himalayan system they extend and how they
   ultimately govern the location of upper crustal faults in southern
   Tibet. Spectrally filtered EGM2008 Bouguer gravity data and edges in its
   horizontal gradient at different source depths ('gravity worms') over
   northern Peninsular India, the Himalaya and southern Tibet reveal
   several continuous Himalayan cross-strike discontinuities interpreted to
   represent crustal faults. Gravity lineaments in Peninsular India
   coincide with edges of the Precambrian basement ridges and megakinks up
   to 100 km wide develop in foreland cover sequences between the
   interpreted basement faults. The interpreted basement faults project
   northward beneath the Himalayan system and southern Tibet. Our results
   suggest that several active Himalayan cross-strike faults, such as the
   ones related to many graben in southern Tibet, are rooted in the
   underplated Indian lower crust or step en echelon along interpreted
   basement faults. Our interpretation thus suggests that south Tibet
   graben are spatially related to deep-seated crustal-scale faults rooted
   in the underplated Indian crust. These major discontinuities partition
   the Himalayan range into distinct zones, and could ultimately contribute
   to lateral variability in tectonic evolution along the orogen's strike.}},

Abstract = {{To develop a chemical inhibitor that can efficiently suppress coal
   oxidation, nine tetraalkylphosphonium-based ionic liquids (ILs) and one
   imidazolium-based IL {[}1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride
   ({[}AMIm]Cl)] were examined as additives. These ILs were used to treat
   and investigate the inhibitory effect on the oxidation activity and the
   structure of lignite coal. Characterization using thermogravimetric
   analysis showed that phosphonium-based ILs are able to inhibit coal
   oxidation up to 400 degrees C with the tributylethylphosphonium
   diethylphosphate ({[}P-4,P-4,P-4,P-2]{[}DEP]) found to be the most
   effective. In contrast to the tetraalkylphosphonium-based ILs,
   inhibition using {[}AMIm]Cl was only found to be effective at
   temperatures below 250 degrees C, indicating that the
   tetraallcylphosphonium-based ILs may be more suitable for the future
   application of suppressing coal spontaneous combustion over a wide range
   of temperatures. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic data showed
   that the various functional groups change in the coal following IL
   treatment, which are a decrease in the minerals and hydrogen bonds in
   all treated coals, while decreased aliphatic hydrocarbon and increased
   carbonyl bonds only appeared in some samples. During the oxidation of
   coal, the decomposition of aliphatic hydrocarbon groups is inhibited and
   the formation of carbonyl groups is delayed, so that the evolved gas
   concentration decreased, as shown by the temperature-programmed
   oxidation-mass spectrometry results. The deployment of the
   {[}P-4,P-4,P-4,P-2]{[} DEP] and tributylmethylphosphonium methylsulfate
   Its as additives also show good inhibitory effect on coal oxidation over
   the temperature range studied, and a relatively stronger interaction
   between {[}P-4,P-4,P-4,P-2] {[}DEP] and coal is demonstrated by the
   additive model.}},

   However, the translation of in vitro tissue engineering into clinical

   is possible to circumvent the complexity of developing functional
   tissues in vitro by taking an in situ tissue engineering approach that
   uses the body as a native bioreactor to regenerate tissues. This
   approach harnesses the innate regenerative potential of the body and
   directs the appropriate cells to the site of injury. This review surveys
   the biomaterial-, cell-, and chemical factor-based strategies to

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate an adaptive decomposition and ordering
   strategy that automatically divides examinations into difficult and easy
   sets for constructing an examination timetable. The examinations in the
   difficult set are considered to be hard to place and hence are listed
   before the ones in the easy set in the construction process. Moreover,
   the examinations within each set are ordered using different strategies
   based on graph colouring heuristics. Initially, the examinations are
   placed into the easy set. During the construction process, examinations
   that cannot be scheduled are identified as the ones causing
   infeasibility and are moved forward in the difficult set to ensure
   earlier assignment in subsequent attempts. On the other hand, the
   examinations that can be scheduled remain in the easy set. Within the
   easy set, a new subset called the boundary set is introduced to
   accommodate shuffling strategies to change the given ordering of
   examinations. The proposed approach, which incorporates different
   ordering and shuffling strategies, is explored on the Carter benchmark
   problems. The empirical results show that the performance of our
   algorithm is broadly comparable to existing constructive approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Guyanaite, naturally occurring beta-CrOOH, has been identified in a
   xenolith of Cr-rich omphacitite from the Moses Rock diatreme in the
   Navajo Volcanic Field of the southwestern United States. It occurs as
   the dominant phase in small clusters of accessory minerals, intergrown
   with kosmochlor-rich omphacite, zincian chromite, eskolaite, and
   carmichaelite. The assemblage is interpreted as the result of
   metasomatism of chromite-bearing serpentinite by slab-derived fluids
   during subduction of the Farallon Plate in Laramide time. At the time of
   entrainment of the xenolith, the rock was undergoing prograde
   metamorphism, with guyanaite dehydrating to eskolaite plus water. This
   reaction, and the coeval dehydration of the inferred accompanying host
   serpentinites (which would have been much more volumetrically
   significant), provided water for hydration of the subcontinental upper
   mantle, contributing to uplift of the Colorado Plateau. Recognition of
   guyanaite as a component of a subducted slab supports recent proposals,
   based on laboratory experiments, that high-pressure polymorphs of other
   common crustal oxy-hydroxide minerals such as boehmite and goethite
   (i.e., high-pressure delta-AlOOH and epsilon-FeOOH) can also transport
   and store water in the mantle.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel approach to automatically sub-divide a complex
   geometry and apply an efficient mesh is presented. Following the
   identification and removal of thin-sheet regions from an arbitrary solid
   using the thick/thin decomposition approach developed by Robinson et al.
   {[}1], the technique here employs shape metrics generated using local
   sizing measures to identify long-slender regions within the thick body.
   A series of algorithms automatically partition the thick region into a
   non-manifold assembly of long-slender and complex sub-regions. A
   structured anisotropic mesh is applied to the thin-sheet and
   long-slender bodies, and the remaining complex bodies are filled with
   unstructured isotropic tetrahedra. The resulting semi-structured mesh
   possesses significantly fewer degrees of freedom than the equivalent
   unstructured mesh, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. The
   accuracy of the efficient meshes generated for a complex geometry is
   verified via a study that compares the results of a modal analysis with
   the results of an equivalent analysis on a dense tetrahedral mesh.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, large direct current is applied through the tool to
   improve formability while forming 6061-T6 Al using single-point
   incremental forming. Special attention is paid to the direct effect of
   current density, as opposed to bulk resistive heating, to determine
   whether the electroplastic effect is significant in raising the
   formability without requiring temperature rise. Tests are performed to
   determine the maximum wall angle that can be formed for a variety of
   current and tool settings. The area of contact between the tool and
   sheet is modeled, and a control system is proposed and tested to vary
   the current to maintain a constant current density during tests. The
   phenomenon of current threshold density is observed at a current density
   range agreeing with previous studies forming the same material in
   different loading cases. A significant formability increase is observed
   at a range of current density values that agree with previously
   published work with this material in different loading cases. Surface
   roughness and spalling are also shown to be directly affected by

Title = {{A framework to predict and experimentally evaluate polymer-solute
   thermodynamic affinity for two-phase partitioning bioreactor (TPPB)
   applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Selection of a polymer for two-phase partitioning bioreactor
   (TPPB) applications has previously been limited to heuristic approaches.
   However, recent interest has focused on first principles' selection
   methods based on polymer crystallinity, glass transition temperature and
   polymer-solute thermodynamic affinity. In this work, a framework is
   proposed to evaluate and predict polymer-solute thermodynamic affinity
   via the polymer-phase activity coefficient.
   RESULTS: Polymer screening via thermodynamic affinity was shown to be
   most effective at very dilute concentrations, where partition
   coefficients can be estimated using infinite dilution activity
   coefficients. In the absence of published values, UNIFAC-vdW-FV or
   Flory-Huggins based activity models can provide very good predictions
   for the polymer-phase activity coefficient, significantly improving upon
   previous approaches using Hildebrand and Hansen solubility parameter
   differences. For non-dilute systems, however, the activity models failed
   to consider the full effects of concentration on partition coefficient.
   Additionally, a reduction in polymer molecular weight resulted in
   improved partition coefficients, a phenomena well described by the
   activity models.
   CONCLUSION: Predicting and experimentally quantifying polymer-solute
   thermodynamic affinity at very dilute concentrations will aid future
   attempts at TPPB polymer selection. Furthermore, experimental partition
   coefficient data at a range of operational concentrations will indicate
   how TPPB effectiveness will change throughout the fermentation course.
   Finally, reduction of polymer molecular weight to improve solute
   partitioning should be investigated further for a range of polymers. (C)

Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A robust multiscale scheme referred to as micro-macro method has been
   developed for the prediction of localized damage in fiber reinforced
   composites and implemented in a finite element framework. The
   micro-macro method is based on the idea of partial homogenization of a
   structure. In this method, the microstructural details are included in a
   small region of interest in the structure and the rest is modeled as a
   homogeneous continuum. The solution to the microstructural fields is
   then obtained on solving the two different domains, simultaneously. This
   method accurately predicts local stress fields in stress concentration
   regions and is computationally efficient as compared with the solution
   of a full scale microstructural model. This scheme has been applied to
   obtain localized damage at high and low stress zones of a V-notched rail
   shear specimen. The prominent damage mechanisms under shear loading,
   namely, matrix cracking and interfacial debonding, have been modeled
   using Mohr-Coulomb plasticity and traction separation law, respectively.
   The average stress at the notch has been found to be 44\% higher than
   the average stresses away from the notch for a 90 N shear load. This
   stress rise is a direct outcome of the geometry of the notch. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{The effect of fully reversed loading (R = -1) on high cycle fatigue
   performance of sandwich panels composed of polyurethane foam core and
   Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) skins is studied and compared to
   that of similar panels tested under fully unloaded (R = 0) conditions.
   Fatigue life curves are established and compared based on maximum loads
   of 30-70\% of the ultimate monotonic strength (P-ult). It was shown that
   panels consistently fail in shear of the foam core. The fatigue life
   reduces significantly at R = -1, to about 10\% of that at R = 0. In
   order to achieve at least 2 million cycles - the commonly acceptable
   fatigue life in structural engineering - the maximum service loads

Abstract = {{Phase stability of Ni-3(Al, Ti) precipitates in Inconel X-750 under
   cascade damage was studied using heavy ion irradiation with transmission
   electron microscope (TEM) in situ observations. From 333 K to 673 K (60
   A degrees C to 400 A degrees C), ordered Ni-3(Al, Ti) precipitates
   became completely disordered at low irradiation dose of 0.06
   displacement per atom (dpa). At higher dose, a trend of precipitate
   dissolution occurring under disordered state was observed, which is due
   to the ballistic mixing effect by irradiation. However, at temperatures
   greater than 773 K (500 A degrees C), the precipitates stayed ordered up
   to 5.4 dpa, supporting the view that irradiation-induced
   disordering/dissolution and thermal recovery reach a balance between 673
   K and 773 K (400 A degrees C and 500 A degrees C). Effects of Ti/Al
   ratio and irradiation dose rate are also discussed. (C) The Minerals,

Abstract = {{We investigated the complete stress-strain response of artificially
   jointed granitic rock specimens with two joint sets. A series of
   confined compressive tests on these jointed rock specimens were
   performed in a fully servo-controlled press. Elastic, strength and
   post-failure parameters were calculated and analysed, with special
   attention paid to the dilation angle. The results were compared to those
   for corresponding intact specimens investigated in a previous study.
   Although the peak strength of the jointed cores was much lower than that
   for the intact cores, the residual strength envelopes were practically
   equal. The apparent elastic and drop moduli tended to be lower for
   jointed specimens than that for intact specimens. At low confining
   stress levels, the jointed rock tended to dilate less than the intact
   rock, but at higher confinement dilation behaviour converged. Another
   finding with respect to post-yield behaviour was that the dilation angle
   of the jointed specimens could adequately be represented by an existing
   plastic-shear-strain and confinement-dependent model developed for
   intact specimens. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) require polymers such as
   epoxies that are not biodegradable, which have a significant impact on
   the environment. This study aims at replacing conventional polymers with
   bio-polymers which are more sustainable. The study investigates the
   tensile mechanical properties of glass-FRP (GFRP) laminates fabricated
   by wet layup using two types of organic furfuryl alcohol bio-resins
   extracted renewable resources, such as corncobs. Results are compared to
   control specimens fabricated using conventional epoxy resin. The study
   investigates the effects of catalyst type and dosage as well as the
   curing time on the tensile strength and modulus of the GFRP. The study
   also investigates the optimal overlap splice of the laminates. It was
   shown that by careful selection of viscosity of bio-resin, and type and
   dosage of catalyst similar mechanical properties to epoxy-GFRP can be
   achieved. The optimal catalyst proportion was 3 \% by weight. Full
   strength occurred after 13 days curing but 84 \% occurred in 2 days. The
   optimal lap splice length was 200 mm, however, the maximum strength was
   only 68 \% of the full ultimate tensile strength as bond failure always
   governs at the splice.}},

Abstract = {{A resazurin (Rz) based photocatalyst indicator ink is used to test the
   activity of a commercial self-cleaning glass, using UV-vis spectroscopy
   and digital photography to monitor the photocatalyst-driven change in
   colour of the ink. UV-vis spectroscopy allows the change in film
   absorbance, Delta Abs, to be monitored as a function of irradiation
   time, whereas digital photography is used to monitor the concomitant
   change in the red component of the RGB values, i.e. Delta RGB (red).
   Initial work reveals the variation in Delta Abs, and Delta RGB (red), as
   a function of irradiation time, t, are linearly correlated. The rates of
   change of these parameters are also linearly correlated to the rates of
   oxidative destruction of stearic acid on self-cleaning glass under
   different irradiances. This work demonstrates that a measure of
   photocatalyst activity of self-cleaning glass, i.e. the time taken to
   change the colour of an Rz photocatalyst indicator ink, can be obtained
   using inexpensive digital photography, as alternative to more expensive
   lab-based techniques, such as UV-vis spectrophotometry.}},

Abstract = {{NMR was used to study the semiconductor photocatalytic (SPC) C C
   coupling of phenoxyacetic acid (PAA) with acrylamide (ACM) in an NMR
   tube photoreactor. Using an NMR tube with a sol-gel titania inner
   coating as a photoreactor, this reaction is relatively clean, forming
   only 1 product, 4-phenoxybutanamide (4-PB), in yields up to 78\%. This
   SPC reaction is used to assess the activity of the sol-gel titania
   coating as a function of their annealing temperature, which alters the
   surface area and phase of the titania, and the general reusability of
   the TiO2 coated NMR tubes. The optimum temperature range for annealing
   the sol-gel titania films is between 450 degrees C and 800 degrees C,
   with the maximum yield and rate attained at 450 C. Despite a decrease in
   the initial rates of formation of 4-PB above an annealing temperature of
   450 degrees C, the final product yields remained similar, giving maximum
   yields within 60 min of irradiation. The reusability study reveals that
   the activity of the sol-gel titania can quickly deteriorate with
   repeated use due to the adsorption of yellow/brown coloured, insoluble,
   most likely organic polymeric, material and its screening effect on the
   underlying photocatalyst. The titania can, however, be restored to its
   original activity by a simple heat treatment at 450 degrees C for 30
   min. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Mangabeira deposit is the only known Brazilian tin mineralization
   with indium. It is hosted in the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic Mangabeira
   within-plate granitic massif, which has geochemical characteristics of
   NYF fertile granites. The granitic massif is hosted in Archean to
   Paleoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks (Ticunzal formation),
   Paleoproterozoic peraluminous granites (Aurumina suite) and a
   granite-gneiss complex. The mineralized area comprises evolved
   Li-siderophyllite granite, topaz-albite granite, Li-F-rich mica greisens
   and a quartz-topaz rock, similar to topazite. Two types of greisens are
   recognized in the mineralized area: zinnwaldite greisen and Li-rich
   muscovite greisen, formed by metasomatism of topaz-albite granite and
   Li-siderophyllite granite, respectively. Cassiterite occurs in the
   quartz-topaz rock and in the greisens. Indium minerals, such as
   roquesite (CuInS2), yanomamite (InAsO4 center dot 2H(2)O) and
   dzhalindite (In(OH3)), and In-rich cassiterite, sphalerite, stannite
   group minerals and scorodite are more abundant in the quartz-topaz rock,
   and are also recognized in albitized biotite granite and in Li-rich
   muscovite greisen. The host rocks and mineralized zones were
   subsequently overprinted by the Brasiliano orogenic event.
   Primary widespread two-phase aqueous and rare coeval aqueous-carbonic
   fluid inclusions are preserved in quartz from the topaz-albite granite,
   in quartz and topaz from the quartz-topaz rock and in cassiterite from
   the Li-rich muscovite greisen. Eutectic temperatures are -25 degrees C
   to -23 degrees C, allowing modeling of the aqueous fluids in the system
   H2O-NaCl(-KCl). Rare three-phase H2O-NaCl fluid inclusions (45-50 wt.\%
   NaCl equiv.) are restricted to the topaz-albite granite. Salinities and
   homogenization temperatures of the aqueous and aqueous-carbonic fluid
   inclusions decrease from the topaz-albite granite (15-20 wt.\% NaCl
   equiv.; 400 degrees C-450 degrees C), to the quartz-topaz rock (10-15
   wt.\% NaCl equiv.; 250 degrees C-350 degrees C) and to the greisen (0-5
   wt.\% NaCl equiv.; 200 degrees C-250 degrees C). Secondary fluid
   inclusions have the same range of salinities as the primary fluid
   inclusions, and homogenize between 150 and 210 degrees C.

   quartz-mica pairs are 610-680 degrees C for the topaz-albite granite and
   285-370 degrees C for the Li-rich muscovite greisens. These data are
   coherent with measured fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures.
   Temperatures estimated using arsenopyrite geothermometry yield
   crystallization temperatures of 490-530 degrees C for the quartz-topaz
   rock and 415-505 degrees C for the zinnwaldite greisens. The fluids in
   equilibrium with the topaz-albite granite have calculated delta O-18 and
   delta D values of 5.6-7.5 parts per thousand and -67 to -58 parts per
   thousand, respectively. Estimated delta O-18 and delta D values are
   mainly 4.8-7.9 parts per thousand and -60 to -30 parts per thousand,
   respectively, for the fluids in equilibrium with the quartz-topaz rock
   and zinnwaldite greisen; and 3.4-3.9 parts per thousand and -25 to -17
   parts per thousand, respectively, for the Li-rich muscovite greisen
   fluid. delta S-34 data on arsenopyrite from the quartz-topaz rock vary
   from -1.74 to -0.74 parts per thousand, consistent with a magmatic
   origin for the sulfur. The integration of fluid inclusion with oxygen
   isotopic data allows for estimation of the minimum crystallization
   pressure at ca. 770 bar for the host topaz-albite granite, which is
   consistent with its evolved signature.
   Based on petrological, fluid inclusion and isotope data it is proposed
   that the greisens and related Mangabeira Sn-In mineralization had a
   similar hydrothermal genesis, which involved exsolution of F-rich,
   Sn-In-bearing magmatic fluids from the topaz-albite granite, early
   formation of the quartz-topaz rock and zinnwaldite greisen, progressive
   cooling and Li-rich muscovite greisen formation due to interaction with
   meteoric water. The quartz-topaz rock is considered to have formed in
   the magmatic-hydrothermal transition. The mineralizing saline and
   CO2-bearing fluids are interpreted to be of magmatic origin, based on
   the isotopic data and paragenesis, which has been documented as
   characteristic of the tin mineralization genetically related to
   Proterozoic within-plate granitic magmatism in the Goias Tin Province,
   Central Brazil. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is a useful probe of excitonic
   interactions in optically excited nanostructures. Under intense optical
   excitation, the diffusion-annihilation of excitons in single-walled
   carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) results in strong nonlinear PL. This behavior
   has been observed in a number of samples and has, until recently, been
   believed to be independent of excitation pathway. Contrary to this
   assumption, recent studies show that nonlinear PL in encapsulated
   SWCNTs, excited resonant to E-22, is not dominated by
   diffusion-annihilation but instead by laser induced quenching sites. In
   this paper, we show that, unlike encapsulated SWCNTs, air-suspended
   SWCNT PL saturation is independent of excitation pathway, validating the
   use of a diffusion model for excitons generated via E-22 excitation. In
   addition, we show that the diffusion of excitons in air-suspended SWCNTs
   is independent of atmospheric adsorbates, strengthening the assertion
   that in this system exciton diffusion is intrinsic and not disorder
   limited.}},

Title = {{The current understanding on the diamond machining of silicon carbide}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{The Glenn Research Centre of NASA, USA (www. grc. nasa. gov/WWW/SiC/,
   silicon carbide electronics) is in pursuit of realizing bulk
   manufacturing of silicon carbide (SiC), specifically by mechanical
   means. Single point diamond turning (SPDT) technology which employs
   diamond (the hardest naturally-occurring material realized to date) as a
   cutting tool to cut a workpiece is a highly productive manufacturing
   process. However, machining SiC using SPDT is a complex process and,
   while several experimental and analytical studies presented to date aid
   in the understanding of several critical processes of machining SiC, the
   current knowledge on the ductile behaviour of SiC is still sparse. This
   is due to a number of simultaneously occurring physical phenomena that
   may take place on multiple length and time scales. For example,
   nucleation of dislocation can take place at small inclusions that are of
   a few atoms in size and once nucleated, the interaction of these
   nucleations can manifest stresses on the micrometre length scales. The
   understanding of how these stresses manifest during fracture in the
   brittle range, or dislocations/phase transformations in the ductile
   range, is crucial to understanding the brittle-ductile transition in
   SiC. Furthermore, there is a need to incorporate an appropriate
   simulation-based approach in the manufacturing research on SiC, owing
   primarily to the number of uncertainties in the current experimental
   research that includes wear of the cutting tool, poor controllability of
   the nano-regime machining scale (effective thickness of cut), and
   coolant effects (interfacial phenomena between the tool, workpiece/chip
   and coolant), etc. In this review, these two problems are combined
   together to posit an improved understanding on the current theoretical
   knowledge on the SPDT of SiC obtained from molecular dynamics
   simulation.}},

Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{446-458}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the gene selection problem for microarray data
   with small samples and variant correlation. Most existing algorithms
   usually require expensive computational effort, especially under
   thousands of gene conditions. The main objective of this paper is to
   effectively select the most informative genes from microarray data,
   while making the computational expenses affordable. This is achieved by
   proposing a novel forward gene selection algorithm (FGSA). To overcome
   the small samples' problem, the augmented data technique is firstly
   employed to produce an augmented data set. Taking inspiration from other
   gene selection methods, the L-2-norm penalty is then introduced into the
   recently proposed fast regression algorithm to achieve the group
   selection ability. Finally, by defining a proper regression context, the
   proposed method can be fast implemented in the software, which
   significantly reduces computational burden. Both computational
   complexity analysis and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of
   the proposed algorithm in comparison with other approaches. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Gene flow in macroalgal populations can be strongly influenced by spore
   or gamete dispersal. This, in turn, is influenced by a convolution of
   the effects of current flow and specific plant reproductive strategies.
   Although several studies have demonstrated genetic variability in
   macroalgal populations over a wide range of spatial scales, the
   associated current data have generally been poorly resolved spatially
   and temporally. In this study, we used a combination of population
   genetic analyses and high-resolution hydrodynamic modelling to
   investigate potential connectivity between populations of the kelp
   Laminaria digitata in the Strangford Narrows, a narrow channel
   characterized by strong currents linking the large semi-enclosed sea
   lough, Strangford Lough, to the Irish Sea. Levels of genetic structuring
   based on six microsatellite markers were very low, indicating high
   levels of gene flow and a pattern of isolation- by-distance, where
   populations are more likely to exchange migrants with geographically
   proximal populations, but with occasional long-distance dispersal. This
   was confirmed by the particle tracking model, which showed that, while
   the majority of spores settle near the release site, there is potential
   for dispersal over several kilometres. This combined population genetic
   and modelling approach suggests that the complex hydrodynamic
   environment at the entrance to Strangford Lough can facilitate dispersal
   on a scale exceeding that proposed for L. digitata in particular, and
   the majority of macroalgae in general. The study demonstrates the
   potential of integrated physical-biological approaches for the
   prediction of ecological changes resulting from factors such as
   anthropogenically induced coastal zone changes.}},

Abstract = {{In this work PEGylated polyester-based nanoparticles (NPs) for drug
   delivery applications were synthetized through emulsion free radical
   polymerization. These NPs are produced starting from functionalized
   macromonomers whose average chain length can be tuned in a controlled
   way. Since the degradation of these NPs occurs through the hydrolysis of
   side chains, by tuning their length it is possible to obtain NPs with a
   controllable degradation time, comparable to data obtained with NPs
   internalized into cells. The long-term colloidal stability of these NPs
   in isotonic environment has been assessed through dynamic light
   scattering measurements and their degradation rate in cell medium has
   been proved to be fast and controllable. The NP behavior in gastric and
   intestinal solution was also studied.}},

Abstract = {{Segment estimates of mass, center of mass and moment of inertia are
   required input parameters to analyze the forces and moments acting
   across the joints. The objectives of this study were to propose a new
   geometric model for limb segments, to evaluate it against criterion
   values obtained from DXA, and to compare its performance to five other
   popular models. Twenty five female and 24 male college students
   participated in the study. For the criterion measures, the participants
   underwent a whole body DXA scan, and estimates for segment mass, center
   of mass location, and moment of inertia (frontal plane) were directly
   computed from the DXA mass units. For the new model, the volume was
   determined from two standing frontal and sagittal photographs. Each
   segment was modeled as a stack of slices, the sections of which were
   ellipses if they are not adjoining another segment and sectioned
   ellipses if they were adjoining another segment (e.g. upper arm and
   trunk). Length of axes of the ellipses was obtained from the
   photographs. In addition, a sex-specific, non-uniform density function
   was developed for each segment. A series of anthropometric measurements
   were also taken by directly following the definitions provided of the
   different body segment models tested, and the same parameters determined
   for each model. Comparison of models showed that estimates from the new
   model were consistently closer to the DXA criterion than those from the
   other models, with an error of less than 5\% for mass and moment of
   inertia and less than about 6\% for center of mass location. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Large-eddy simulations are carried out in turbulent open-channel flows
   to determine the roughness function and the equivalent sand-grain

   Reynolds numbers and mean roughness heights is chosen, leading to both
   transitionally and fully rough regimes. The start of the fully rough
   regime is shown to depend on the roughness type, and k(s) depends
   strongly on the surface topography. We then examine several existing
   correlations that predict k(s) based on the information of the surface
   geometry. In the cases where the surface slope is an important
   parameter, the moments of surface height statistics do not predict the
   roughness function, while the existing forms of slope-based correlations
   perform well. The range of applicability of various correlations is
   shown to vary with the roughness topography, as the critical value of
   the effective slope, separating the waviness and roughness regimes, is
   shown to be higher for a realistic surface, compared to the value for
   the more regular types of roughness that were previously studied.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental data describing the mechanical performance of Portland
   cement-hydrated lime mortars used for straw bale construction is
   presented. Straw bale construction uses stacked straw bales plastered on
   each side to form load-bearing elements. Mortars used have slumps of
   approximately 50 mm, compared to slumps up to 279 mm for conventional
   masonry mortars. Cylinder and cube tests of a range of typical straw
   bale mortar mixes were carried out. The mortars had compressive
   strengths ranging between 0.3 MPa and 13 MPa. Empirical equations
   describing the relationships between compressive strength and curing
   time, w/cm ratio, proportions of lime, cement and sand, and modulus of
   elasticity are presented. The data show that cement-lime mortars for
   straw bale construction will have a higher modulus of elasticity and
   lower failure strain than a conventional mortar of equivalent
   compressive strength. The Modulus of Elasticity is on average 818 times
   the compressive strength of a straw bale mortar, compared to 100 to 200
   times as reported in the literature for conventional mortar. The average

Abstract = {{Itsiite, ideally Ba2Ca(BSi2O7)(2), is a new mineral from the Gun claim,
   just south of the Itsi Range, Yukon Territory, Canada. The new mineral
   occurs in low temperature, late-stage veins in direct association with
   cerchiaraite-(Fe), diopside, pyrite, quartz, sphalerite, and witherite.
   Itsiite occurs as colorless and light blue to medium greenish-blue
   tetragonal plates up to 1 mm across. The plates are flattened on \{001\}
   and exhibit the forms \{001\}, \{101\}, and \{112\}. The mineral is
   transparent, has a vitreous luster, and is non-fluorescent. It has a
   white streak and Mohs hardness of approximately 51/2. It is brittle,
   with splintery fracture, and one perfect cleavage on \{001\}. The
   calculated density based upon the empirical formula and single-crystal
   unit cell is 3.644 g/cm(3). The mineral is optically uniaxial (-), with
   omega = 1.623(1) and epsilon = 1.619(1) (white light). The mineral is
   nonpleochroic. Electron-microprobe compositions (average of 3) provided:
   Na2O 0.06, BaO 46.35, CaO 7.35, FeO 0.15, Al2O3 0.17, TiO2 0.06, SiO2
   34.91, B2O3 10.41 (from structure), total 99.46 wt.\%. The empirical
   formula (based on 14 O apfu) is Ba-2.06(Ca0.89Al0.02Na0.01Fe0.01
   Ti-0.01)(Sigma 0.94)(Si3.96B2.04)(Sigma 6.00)O-14. Itsiite is
   tetragonal, I42m, a 10.9515(5), c 10.3038(7) angstrom, V 1235.79(11)
   angstrom(3), and Z = 4. The nine most intense lines in the X-ray powder
   diffraction pattern are {[}d(obs) in angstrom(I)(hkl)]: 5.50(42)(200);
   3.746(100)(202); 3.446(60)(301); 3.100(51)(222); 2.899(96)(321,312);

   1.7584(43)(532,523). The crystal structure (R-1 = 1.8\% for 992 F-o > 4
   sigma F) is based upon a zeolite-like tetrahedral framework of
   corner-sharing tetrahedra consisting of four-membered silicate rings
   alternating with four-membered borate rings. The framework contains
   channels along each axis that host Ba2+ in ninefold coordination and
   Ca2+ in sixfold coordination. The structure is very similar to those of
   hyalotekite and kapitsaite-(Y).}},

Abstract = {{We describe a sample of Proterozoic banded iron-formation from the inner
   contact aureole of the Duluth complex near Babbitt, Minnesota, that
   contains a compositionally unique Fe-rich monoclinic ferromagnesian
   amphibole. Its content of Al-T (1.3 atoms per 23 anhydrous oxygens) and
   Na-A (0.55) places it in a compositional field (with the label
   clinoferrogedrite) outside those recognized in the IMA nomenclature for
   amphiboles. With declining Al, it grades into Al-rich grunerite, and
   finally to Al-poor grunerite at the crystal margins. While spot-to-spot
   compositional trends define basic gedrite substitutions, they differ
   systematically from the well-established anthophyllite-gedrite trends
   found in amphibolites. They resemble instead two instances of sodic
   gedrite described in the literature that are enriched in Na-A apfu and
   depleted in octahedral Al. These unusual trends may be the result of
   very high temperatures of formation, or a high activity ratio of Fe + Mg
   to Si. Associated minerals in our sample include orthopyroxene FS74-76,
   olivine Fa(85-91), almandine, quartz, plagioclase, and accessories

   kbar, with fO(2) close to FMQ-2 log(10) units. Clinogedrite should be
   considered extremely rare, but not non-existent. In the monoclinic
   structure the symmetry of the double Si-O chains limits the uptake of
   gedritic components to amounts lower than found in the orthorhombic
   structure, where Al is distributed across three of the four distinct
   tetrahedral sites. We also present electron microprobe data for a highly
   aluminous cummingtonite grading compositionally into clinogedrite (Na-A
   = 0.3, Al-M2 + Fe3+ + 2Ti = 1.0, Al-T = 1.1) that was grown from fused
   and S-augmented Pinatubo dacite in the laboratory at 780 degrees C, 2.2
   and 3.9 kbar. Growth of this MgFe-clinoamphibole was enabled by the
   capture of Ca into anhydrite away from potential hornblende.}},

Title = {{Abiotic methanogenesis from organosulphur compounds under ambient
   conditions}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Methane in the environment is produced by both biotic and abiotic
   processes. Biomethanation involves the formation of methane by microbes
   that live in oxygen-free environments. Abiotic methane formation
   proceeds under conditions at elevated temperature and/or pressure. Here
   we present a chemical reaction that readily forms methane from
   organosulphur compounds under highly oxidative conditions at ambient
   atmospheric pressure and temperature. When using iron(II/III), hydrogen
   peroxide and ascorbic acid as reagents, S-methyl groups of organosulphur
   compounds are efficiently converted into methane. In a first step,
   methyl sulphides are oxidized to the corresponding sulphoxides. In the
   next step, demethylation of the sulphoxide via homolytic bond cleavage
   leads to methyl radical formation and finally to methane in high yields.
   Because sulphoxidation of methyl sulphides is ubiquitous in the
   environment, this novel chemical route might mimic methane formation in
   living aerobic organisms.}},

Abstract = {{The air-sea exchange of two legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs),
   gamma-HCH and PCB 153, in the North Sea, is presented and discussed
   using results of regional fate and transport and shelf-sea hydrodynamic
   ocean models for the period 1996-2005. Air-sea exchange occurs through
   gas exchange (deposition and volatilization), wet deposition and dry
   deposition. Atmospheric concentrations are interpolated into the model
   domain from results of the EMEP MSC-East multi-compartmental model
   (Gusev et al, 2009). The North Sea is net depositional for gamma-HCH,
   and is dominated by gas deposition with notable seasonal variability and
   a downward trend over the 10 year period. Volatilization rates of
   gamma-HCH are generally a factor of 2-3 less than gas deposition in
   winter, spring and summer but greater in autumn when the North Sea is
   net volatilizational. A downward trend in fugacity ratios is found,
   since gas deposition is decreasing faster than volatilization. The North
   Sea is net volatilizational for PCB 153, with highest rates of
   volatilization to deposition found in the areas surrounding polluted
   British and continental river sources. Large quantities of PCB 153
   entering through rivers lead to very high local rates of volatilization.}},

Abstract = {{The buried oxide (BOX) layer in silicon on insulator (SOI) was replaced
   by a compound buried layer (CBL) containing layers of SiO2,
   polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon), and SiO2. The undoped polysilicon
   in the CBL acted as a dielectric with a higher thermal conductivity than
   SiO2. CBL provides a reduced thermal resistance with the same equivalent
   oxide thickness as a standard SiO2 buried layer. Thermal resistance was
   further reduced by lateral heat flow through the polysilicon. Reduction
   in thermal resistance by up to 68\% was observed, dependent on
   polysilicon thickness. CBL SOI substrates were designed and manufactured
   to achieve a 40\% reduction in thermal resistance compared with an
   1.0-mu m SiO2 BOX. Power bipolar transistors with an active silicon
   layer thickness of 13.5 mu m manufactured on CBL SOI substrates showed a
   5\%-17\% reduction in thermal resistance compared with the standard SOI.
   This reduction was dependent on transistor layout geometry. Between 65\%
   and 90\% of the heat flow from these power transistors is laterally
   through the thick active silicon layer. Analysis confirmed that CBL SOI
   provided a 40\% reduction in the vertical path thermal resistance.
   Devices employing thinner active silicon layers will achieve the greater
   benefit from reduction in vertical path thermal resistance offered by
   CBL SOI.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting chatter mark vibration in rolling mills operating under normal
   working conditions is difficult. A novel characteristic recognition
   method of chatter mark vibration, where the non-dimensional parameters
   are calculated with time varying signals and kurtosis under normal
   rolling mill operating conditions, is presented in this paper. The
   character of the chatter mark vibration signal is obtained by
   calculating the kurtosis value of each vibration signal segment obtained
   by subdividing the raw time varying vibration signal. The probability
   density function is utilized to reveal obvious differences between
   signals with respect to the normal and chatter conditions. The method
   overcomes the limitation of traditional spectrum analysis, which is
   sensitive to working conditions. Numerical simulation and experimental
   results show that the proposed method has better recognition capability
   than traditional spectrum analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The unprecedented growth of mobile video traffic is adding significant
   pressure to the energy drain at both the network and the end user.
   Energy-efficient video transmission techniques are thus imperative to
   cope with the challenge of satisfying user demand at sustainable costs.
   In this paper, we investigate how predicted user rates can be exploited
   for energy-efficient video streaming with the popular Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP)-based adaptive streaming (AS) protocols {[}e. g.,
   dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH)]. To this end, we develop an
   energy-efficient predictive green streaming (PGS) optimization framework
   that leverages predictions of wireless data rates to achieve the
   following objectives: 1) Minimize the required transmission airtime
   without causing streaming interruptions; 2) minimize total downlink base
   station (BS) power consumption for cases where BSs can be switched off
   in deep sleep; and 3) enable a tradeoff between AS quality and energy
   consumption. Our framework is first formulated as mixed-integer linear
   programming (MILP) where decisions on multiuser rate allocation, video
   segment quality, and BS transmit power are jointly optimized. Then, to
   provide an online solution, we present a polynomial-time heuristic
   algorithm that decouples the PGS problem into multiple stages. We
   provide a performance analysis of the proposed methods by simulations,
   and numerical results demonstrate that the PGS framework yields
   significant energy savings.}},

Abstract = {{Performance evaluation of parallel software and architectural
   exploration of innovative hardware support face a common challenge with
   emerging manycore platforms: they are limited by the slow running time
   and the low accuracy of software simulators. Manycore FPGA prototypes
   are difficult to build, but they offer great rewards. Software running
   on such prototypes runs orders of magnitude faster than current
   simulators. Moreover, researchers gain significant architectural insight
   during the modeling process. We use the Formic FPGA prototyping board
   {[}1], which specifically targets scalable and cost-efficient
   multi-board prototyping, to build and test a 64-board model of a
   512-core, MicroBlaze-based, non-coherent hardware prototype with a full
   network-on-chip in a 3D-mesh topology. We expand the hardware
   architecture to include the ARM Versatile Express platforms and build a
   520-core heterogeneous prototype of 8 Cortex-A9 cores and 512 MicroBlaze
   cores. We then develop an MPI library for the prototype and evaluate it
   extensively using several bare-metal and MPI benchmarks. We find that
   our processor prototype is highly scalable, models faithfully
   single-chip multicore architectures, and is a very efficient platform
   for parallel programming research, being 50,000 times faster than
   software simulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to compare computed tomography density
   (rho(CT)) obtained using typical clinical computed tomography scan
   parameters to ash density (rho(ash)), for the prediction of densities of
   femoral head trabecular bone from hip fracture patients. An experimental
   study was conducted to investigate the relationships between rho(ash)
   and rho(CT) and between each of these densities and rho(bulk) and
   rho(dry). Seven human femoral heads from hip fracture patients were
   computed tomography-scanned ex vivo, and 76 cylindrical trabecular bone
   specimens were collected. Computed tomography density was computed from
   computed tomography images by using a calibration Hounsfield units-based
   equation, whereas rho(bulk), rho(dry) and rho(ash) were determined
   experimentally. A large variation was found in the mean Hounsfield units
   of the bone cores (HUcore) with a constant bias from rho(CT) to rho(ash)
   of 42.5 mg/cm(3). Computed tomography and ash densities were linearly
   correlated (R-2 = 0.55, p < 0.001). It was demonstrated that rho(ash)
   provided a good estimate of rho(bulk) (R-2 = 0.78, p < 0.001) and is a
   strong predictor of rho(dry) (R-2 = 0.99, p < 0.001). In addition, the
   rho(CT) was linearly related to rho(bulk) (R-2 = 0.43, p < 0.001) and
   rho(dry) (R-2 = 0.56, p < 0.001). In conclusion, mineral density was an
   appropriate predictor of rho(bulk) and rho(dry), and rho(CT) was not a
   surrogate for rho(ash). There were linear relationships between rho(CT)
   and physical densities; however, following the experimental protocols of
   this study to determine rho(CT), considerable scatter was present in the
   rho(CT) relationships.}},

Abstract = {{A simplified risk and cost-benefit analysis is presented for the
   application of thermal protection (TP) on propane and LPG highway tanker
   trucks operating in North America. A risk analysis is performed to
   determine the benefits of risk reduction by TP, relative to the costs of
   applying and maintaining TP on a tanker truck. The results show that TP
   is cost effective if the tanker truck spends enough time (or travels
   enough distance) in areas of moderate or high population density. The
   analysis is very sensitive to a number of inputs, including: (i) value
   of life, (ii) hot boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion frequency,
   (iii) public exposure to severe hazards, and (iv) life cost of TP. With
   this simplified analysis, it is possible to generate tanker truck
   exposure times to the public that justify the application of TP based on
   cost and benefit considerations.}},

   orientations on Van Der Waals energies between carbon nanotubes is
   obtained through the peel test. It is shown that the energy for crossed

   nanotubes at 0 degrees angle. This experimental observation was

Abstract = {{This paper investigates camera control for capturing bottle cap target

   The main purpose is to identify the targeted bottle caps accurately in
   real time from the images. This is achieved by combining iterative
   learning control and Kalman filtering to reduce the effect of various
   disturbances introduced into the detection system. A mathematical model,
   together with a physical simulation platform is established based on the
   actual production requirements, and the convergence properties of the
   model are analyzed. It is shown that the proposed method enables
   accurate real-time control of the camera, and further, the gain range of
   the learning rule is also obtained. The numerical simulation and
   experimental results confirm that the proposed method can not only
   reduce the effect of repeatable disturbances but also non-repeatable
   ones.}},

Abstract = {{A low-cost leaky-wave antenna using cylindrical surface waves
   propagating on a grounded dielectric slab is proposed. The excited

   Various surface-wave modes may be considered, however, we desire to
   achieve radiation from the fundamental TM0 mode due to its zero cutoff
   frequency and possibility for efficient excitation. A comprehensive
   design strategy is detailed in the paper. It is based on both an
   accurate knowledge of the modal spectrum, obtained with the method of
   moments, and an analysis of the resonant modes supported by the
   constituent microstrip rings. To further support our methodology,
   numerical calculations, full-wave simulations, and antenna measurements
   are reported for the basic structure. Also, additional designs for
   enhanced gain at broadside, reduced cross-polarization levels, and
   improved wide-angle frequency beam scanning are presented.}},

   Fairfield water network, and results suggest that applying a budget
   constraint prohibits early investment in pipe rehabilitation with a
   resulting increase in leakage, pipe breaks, and energy costs. Applying
   pipe discounts decreases capital and operation costs and favors pipe
   lining over pipe replacement and duplication in the Fairfield network. A
   sensitivity analysis suggests that uncertainties in demand, leakage, and
   break growth rate have a moderate to significant impact on capital and
   operation costs. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Determination of geographical origin of distillers dried grains and

Journal = {{FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},

Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{In recent years distillers dried grains and solubles (DDGS), co-products
   of the bin-ethanol and beverages industries, have become globally traded
   commodity for the animal feed sector. As such it is becoming
   increasingly important to be able to trace the geographical origin of
   commodities in case of a contamination incident or authenticity issue
   arise. In this study, 137 DDGS samples from a range of different
   geographical origins (China, USA, Canada and European Union) were
   collected and analyzed. Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IBMS) was used
   to analyze the DOGS for H-2/H-1,C-13/C-12,N-15/N-14,O-18/O-16 and
   S-34/S-32 isotope ratios which can vary depending on geographical origin
   and processing. Univariate and multivariate statistical techniques were
   employed to investigate the feasibility of using the IRMS data to
   determine botanical and geographical origin of the DDGS. The results
   indicated that this commodity could be differentiated according to their
   place of origin by the analysis of stable isotopes of hydrogen, carbon,
   nitrogen and oxygen but not with sulfur. By adding data to the models
   produced in this study, potentially an isotope databank could be set up
   for traceability procedures for DDGS, similar to the one established
   already for wine which will help in feed and food security issues
   arising worldwide. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A bond model for DEM simulation of cementitious materials and deformable
   structures}},
Journal = {{GRANULAR MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{299-311}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{There is an increasing use of the discrete element method (DEM) to study
   cemented (e.g. concrete and rocks) and sintered particulate materials.
   The chief advantage of the DEM over continuum based techniques is that
   it does not make assumptions about how cracking and fragmentation
   initiate and propagate, since the DEM system is naturally discontinuous.
   The ability for the DEM to produce a realistic representation of a
   cemented granular material depends largely on the implementation of an
   inter-particle bonded contact model. This paper presents a new bonded
   contact model based on the Timoshenko beam theory which considers axial,
   shear and bending behaviour of the bond. The bond model was first
   verified by simulating both the bending and dynamic response of a simply
   supported beam. The loading response of a concrete cylinder was then
   investigated and compared with the Eurocode equation prediction. The
   results show significant potential for the new model to produce
   satisfactory predictions for cementitious materials. A unique feature of
   this model is that it can also be used to accurately represent many
   deformable structures such as frames and shells, so that both particles
   and structures or deformable boundaries can be described in the same DEM
   framework.}},

Year = {{2014}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{383-400}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{An adhesive elasto-plastic contact model for the discrete element method
   with three dimensional non-spherical particles is proposed and
   investigated to achieve quantitative prediction of cohesive powder
   flowability. Simulations have been performed for uniaxial consolidation
   followed by unconfined compression to failure using this model. The
   model has been shown to be capable of predicting the experimental flow
   function (unconfined compressive strength vs. the prior consolidation
   stress) for a limestone powder which has been selected as a reference
   solid in the Europe wide PARDEM research network. Contact plasticity in
   the model is shown to affect the flowability significantly and is thus
   essential for producing satisfactory computations of the behaviour of a
   cohesive granular material. The model predicts a linear relationship
   between a normalized unconfined compressive strength and the product of
   coordination number and solid fraction. This linear relationship is in
   line with the Rumpf model for the tensile strength of particulate
   agglomerate. Even when the contact adhesion is forced to remain
   constant, the increasing unconfined strength arising from stress
   consolidation is still predicted, which has its origin in the contact
   plasticity leading to microstructural evolution of the coordination
   number. The filled porosity is predicted to increase as the contact
   adhesion increases. Under confined compression, the porosity reduces
   more gradually for the load-dependent adhesion compared to constant
   adhesion. It was found that the contribution of adhesive force to the
   limiting friction has a significant effect on the bulk unconfined
   strength. The results provide new insights and propose a micromechanical
   based measure for characterising the strength and flowability of
   cohesive granular materials.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we set out a framework for the analysis of coupled

   for asymptotic stability of a network terminated by passive impedances,
   the extended version allows for poles on the imaginary axis, which makes
   it applicable to a larger class of systems, such as robotic applications
   with position feedback. The extended theorem includes conditions on the
   Laurent expansion of the elements and the principal minors of the
   network immittance matrix. A novel dual-user shared control paradigm,
   realizing a three-way gearbox mechanism, is presented. A numerical
   analysis of absolute stability of the three-port network, representing

Abstract = {{Uniaxial compression tests were carried out at room temperature and at
   strain rates of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 s(-1) on samples of high-purity
   titanium. The initial texture was favorably oriented for contraction
   twinning. The double-differentiation method was employed to detect the
   initiation of twinning as well as of dynamic recrystallization. Critical
   strains of about -0.24 and -0.65 were determined, respectively, for
   these two mechanisms. The relevant mechanisms were identified by means
   of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) techniques. At a true strain
   of epsilon = -0.3, two main kinds of primary twins, \{1 1 (2) over bar
   2\} contraction and \{1 0 (1) over bar 2\} extension, were observed and
   second-generation twins were also identified by means of the EBSD
   analysis. The presence of low Schmid factor (SF) (<0.2) twins was
   established as well as the absence of potential high SF (>0.4) twins.
   The appearance of the low SF twins is explained in terms of the low
   accommodation work required in the neighboring grains; this involves
   prismatic glide in the present case. The absence of the potential high
   SF twins, on the other hand, is justified as requiring the operation of
   a combination of several difficult deformation modes: basal glide,
   pyramidal glide, and twinning. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Abstract = {{This study introduces a numerical tool to generate virtual diffraction
   peaks from known elastic displacement or strain fields arising in the
   presence of discrete straight or curved dislocations in continuous
   media. The tool allows for the generation of diffraction peaks according
   to three methods: the displacement-based Fourier method of Warren, the
   Stokes-Wilson approximate method and a new average-strain-based Fourier
   method. The trade-off between the accuracy and the demand for
   computational power of the three methods is discussed. The work is
   applied to the cases of single-crystal microstructures containing (i)
   straight dislocations, (ii) low-angle symmetric tilt grain boundaries,
   (iii) a restrictedly random distribution of dislocations and (iv)
   complex microstructures generated by discrete dislocation dynamics, to
   illustrate the differences and domains of validity of the aforementioned
   methods. Dissimilar diffraction profiles reveal that peak broadening
   from dislocated crystals has additional contributions coming from strain
   gradients - a feature that is rejected in the Stokes-Wilson
   approximation. The problem of dealing with multi-valued displacement
   fields faced in the displacement-based Fourier method is overcome by the
   new average-strain-based Fourier method.}},

Abstract = {{The offshore regions of large temperate lakes are characterized by
   strong summer temperature stratification that limits vertical mass flux,
   and enables near-inertial internal wave motions. Here, we investigate
   the contribution of near-inertial baroclinic velocity shear on enhancing
   the vertical transport of dissolved oxygen (DO) through the thermocline
   of the central basin of Lake Erie. The lake is prone to severe annual
   hypoxia in the hypolimnion and also has strong near-inertial Poincare
   wave activity. Using field measurements, analytical arguments and a
   numerical model under idealized conditions, we show that the
   near-inertial waves drive baroclinic shear instabilities that enhance
   the vertical turbulent diffusivity and reduce the rate of DO depletion
   in the hypolimnion by up to 12\% over the entire basin. Results from
   modeling large-spatial variability in the enhanced thermocline flux to
   match the distribution of near-inertial wave energy density, indicate
   that the observed oxygen budgets will vary as a function of location of
   sampling. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Abstract = {{We analyse a set of collisionless disc galaxy simulations to study the
   consequences of bar formation and evolution on the M-aEuro cent-sigma(e)
   relation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The redistribution of
   angular momentum driven by bars leads to a mass increase within the
   central region, raising the velocity dispersion of the bulge, sigma(e),
   on average by similar to 12 per cent and as much as similar to 20 per
   cent. If a disc galaxy with an SMBH satisfying the M-aEuro cent-sigma(e)
   relation forms a bar, and the SMBH does not grow in the process, then
   the increase in sigma(e) moves the galaxy off the M-aEuro cent-sigma(e)
   relation. We explore various effects that can affect this result
   including contamination from the disc and anisotropy. The displacement
   from the M-aEuro cent-sigma(e) relation for individual model barred
   galaxies correlates with both the bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio,
   M(B)/M(B + D), and the 2D anisotropy, beta(I center dot)(B + D), both
   measured within the effective radius of the bulge. Overall, this process
   leads to an M-aEuro cent-sigma(e) for barred galaxies offset from that
   of unbarred galaxies, as well as an increase in its scatter. We assemble
   samples of observed unbarred and barred galaxies with classical bulges
   and find tentative hints of an offset between the two consistent with
   the predicted. Including all barred galaxies, rather than just those
   with a classical bulge, leads to a significantly larger offset, which is
   mostly driven by the significantly larger offset of pseudo bulges.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental study conducted on a
   multi-tank thermal storage. The purpose of the study was to investigate
   the thermal behaviour of the stratified tank system when subjected to
   standard draw profiles. The experimental setup consisted of a charge
   loop to simulate a solar collector input, three commercially available
   270 L domestic hot water tanks and three side-arm, natural convection
   heat exchangers. The system was charged using two 3 kW electric heaters
   which produced a variable input power to simulate the variation in
   output of a typical fixed orientation solar collector. Realistic hot
   water draws were conducted according to the specifications of the
   Canadian Standard Association, CSA-F379.1, for Solar Domestic Hot Water
   Systems. Experimental tests were conducted over 2 days for three
   different plumbing configurations, and compared with simulation results
   produced in the TRNSYS simulation environment. The plumbing
   configurations which were considered include: series charge and series
   discharge, parallel charge and parallel discharge, and series charge and
   parallel discharge. Comparisons between system configurations were based
   on stratification levels, hot water delivery temperatures, and solar
   fractions. Results of the study showed that charging and discharging the
   system in parallel produced the highest solar fraction when compared to
   the other multi-tank configurations, with solar fractions of 0.62 and
   0.67 from experimental testing and TRNSYS simulation, respectively. When
   compared to a single tank configuration, the parallel charge and
   parallel discharge configuration achieved 97.7\% of the delivered solar
   energy of a stratified single tank system with the same storage volume
   and heat exchanger performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We have obtained radial velocity measurements for 51 new globular
   clusters around the Sombrero galaxy. These measurements were obtained
   using spectroscopic observations from the AAOmega spectrograph on the
   Anglo-Australian Telescope and the Hydra spectrograph at WIYN. Combining
   our own past measurements and velocity measurements obtained from the
   literature, we have constructed a large database of radial velocities
   that contains a total of 360 confirmed globular clusters. Previous
   studies' analyses of the kinematics and mass profile of the Sombrero
   globular cluster system have been constrained to the inner similar to 9'
   (similar to 24 kpc or similar to 5R(e)), but our new measurements have
   increased the radial coverage of the data, allowing us to determine the
   kinematic properties of M104 out to similar to 15' (similar to 41 kpc or
   similar to 9R(e)). We use our set of radial velocities to study the GC
   system kinematics and to determine the mass profile and V-band
   mass-to-light profile of the galaxy. We find that M/L-V increases from
   4.5 at the center to a value of 20.9 at 41 kpc (similar to 9R(e) or
   15'), which implies that the dark matter halo extends to the edge of our
   available data set. We compare our mass profile at 20 kpc (similar to
   4R(e) or similar to 7.'4) to the mass computed from X-ray data and find
   good agreement. We also use our data to look for rotation in the
   globular cluster system as a whole, as well as in the red and blue
   subpopulations. We find no evidence for significant rotation in any of
   these samples.}},

Abstract = {{The fatigue performance of concrete bridge decks with glass
   fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) stay-in-place structural forms replacing
   the bottom layer of rebar is studied. The forms were either flat plate
   with T-up ribs joined using lap splices or corrugated forms joined
   through pin-and-eye connections. The decks were supported by simulated
   precast girders, AASHTOType III, spaced at 1,775 mm. Two surface
   preparations were examined for each GFRP form, either using adhesive
   coating that bonds to freshly cast concrete, or just cleaning the
   surface before casting. For the bonded deck with flat-ribbed forms,
   adhesive bond and mechanical fasteners were used at the lap splice,
   whereas lap splice of the unbonded deck had no adhesive or mechanical
   fasteners. All decks survived 3 million cycles at 123 kN service load of
   the CL625 design truck of the Canadian standard. The bonded
   flat-ribbed-form deck further survived additional 2 million cycles at a
   higher load simulating a larger girder spacing of 2,365 mm. Stiffness
   degradations were 9-33\% with more reduction in unbonded specimens.
   Nonetheless, live load deflections of all specimens remained below
   span/1,600. The residual ultimate strengths after fatigue were reduced
   by 5\% and 27\% for the flat-ribbed and corrugated forms, respectively.
   However, these strengths remain 7 and 3 times higher than service load,
   respectively. Both the lap-splice and pin-and-eye connection survived
   fatigue. Concrete crack width at the top surface over the girders
   remained below the AASHTO limit of 0.3 mm. (C) 2013 American Society of

Abstract = {{Silicon carbide (SIC) is an important orthopedic material due to its
   inert nature and superior mechanical and tribological properties. Some
   of the potential applications of silicon carbide include coating for
   stents to enhance hemocompatibility, coating for prosthetic-bearing
   surfaces and uncemented joint prosthetics. This study is the first to
   explore nanomechanical response of single crystal 4H-SiC through
   quasistatic nanoindentation. Displacement controlled quasistatic
   nanoindentation experiments were performed on a single crystal 4H-SiC
   specimen using a blunt Berkovich indenter (300 nm tip radius) at
   extremely fine indentation depths of 5 nm, 10 nm, 12 nm, 25 nm, 30 nm
   and 50 nm. Load-displacement curve obtained from the indentation
   experiments showed yielding or incipient plasticity in 4H-SiC typically
   at a shear stress of about 21 GPa (similar to an indentation depth of
   33.8 nm) through a pop-in event. An interesting observation was that the
   residual depth of indent showed three distinct patterns: (i) positive
   depth hysteresis above 33 nm, (ii) no depth hysteresis at 12 nm, and
   (iii) negative depth hysteresis below 12 nm. This contrasting depth
   hysteresis phenomenon is hypothesized to originate due to the existence
   of compressive residual stresses (upto 143 MPa) induced in the specimen
   by the polishing process prior to the nanoindentation. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{Optimized population synthesis provides an empirical method to extract
   the relative mix of stellar evolutionary stages and the distribution of
   atmospheric parameters within unresolved stellar systems, yet a robust
   validation of this method is still lacking. We here provide a
   calibration of population synthesis via non-linear bound-constrained
   optimization of stellar populations based upon optical spectra of mock
   stellar systems and observed Galactic globular clusters (GGCs). The
   MILES stellar library is used as a basis for mock spectra as well as
   templates for the synthesis of deep GGC spectra from Schiavon et al.
   Optimized population synthesis applied to mock spectra recovers mean
   light-weighted stellar atmospheric parameters within a mean uncertainty
   of 240 K, 0.04 dex, and 0.03 dex for T-eff, log g, and {[}Fe/H],
   respectively. We use additional information from Hubble Space Telescope
   (HST)/Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) deep colour-magnitude diagrams
   (CMDs) from Sarajedini et al. and literature metallicities to validate
   our optimization results on GGCs. Decompositions of both mock and GGC
   spectra confirm the method's ability to recover the expected mean
   light-weighted metallicity in dust-free conditions (E(B - V) less than
   or similar to 0.15) with uncertainties comparable to evolutionary
   population synthesis methods. Dustier conditions require either
   appropriate dust modelling when fitting to the full spectrum, or fitting
   only to select spectral features. We derive light-weighted fractions of
   stellar evolutionary stages from our population synthesis fits to GGCs,
   yielding on average a combined 25 +/- 6 per cent from main-sequence and
   turn-off dwarfs, 64 +/- 7 per cent from subgiant, red giant, and
   asymptotic giant branch stars, and 15 +/- 7 per cent from horizontal
   branch stars and blue stragglers. Excellent agreement is found between
   these fractions and those estimated from deep HST/ACS CMDs. Overall,
   optimized population synthesis remains a powerful tool for understanding
   the stellar populations within the integrated light of galaxies and
   globular clusters.}},

Abstract = {{The use of seaweed fertilisers in sports green maintenance has become a
   common practice across the globe due to its image as an
   ``eco-friendly{''} alternative to chemical fertilisers. The aim of this
   study was to characterise the risk of human exposure to arsenic (As),
   via dermal absorption, from golfing activities on a private golf course
   in the UK, where As contaminated seaweed fertiliser (similar to 100
   mg/kg d.wt) is applied. This was fulfilled by, 1) determining As
   concentrations in shallow soils with GIS geo-statistical analysis, 2)
   measuring As concentrations from an on-site borehole groundwater well,
   and (3) developing a risk assessment calculation for golfing activities
   based on field and questionnaire data. Total As concentrations in
   shallow soils were less than the UK threshold for domestic soils,
   however, frequent and sustained dermal contact between site-users and
   surface soil attributed to a maximum carcinogenic risk value of 2.75 x
   10(-4), which is in the upper limit of the acceptable risk range.
   Arsenic concentrations in underlying groundwater exceeded the WHO's
   permissible drinking water standard, demonstrating the risk of
   groundwater contamination following the application of seaweed
   fertiliser to golf course soils. This is the first risk study on dermal
   As absorption via the application of a seaweed fertiliser. (C) 2014

Volume = {{44}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Human-produced waste is a major environmental concern, with communities
   considering various waste management practices, such as increased
   recycling, landfilling, incineration, and waste-to-energy technologies.
   This article is concerned with how and why publics assemble around waste
   management issues. In particular, we explore Noortje Marres and Bruno
   Latour's theory that publics do not exist prior to issues but rather
   assemble around objects, and through these assemblages, objects become
   matters of concern that sometimes become political. The article
   addresses this theory of making things public through a study of a small
   city in Ontario, Canada, whose landfill is closed and waste diversion
   options are saturated, and that faces unsustainable costs in shipping
   its waste to the United States, China, and other regions. The city's
   officials are undertaking a cost-benefit assessment to determine the
   efficacy of siting a new landfill or other waste management facility. We
   are interested in emphasizing the complexity of making (or not making)
   landfills public, by exploring an object in action, where members of the
   public may or may not assemble, waste may or may not be made into an
   issue, and waste is sufficiently routinized that it is not typically
   transformed from an object to an issue. We hope to demonstrate Latour's
   third and fifth senses of politics best account for waste management's
   trajectory as a persistent yet inconsistent matter of public concern.}},

   of high performance concretes}},
Journal = {{NDT \& E INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{30-40}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Although several in situ techniques, including the Autoclam Permeability
   System, are available to examine normal concretes (NCs) for this
   purpose, none are sufficiently sensitive to quantify and distinguish
   relative high performance concrete (HPC) performance. Therefore, to
   assess the HPC performance characteristics using the Autoclam air
   permeability test methodology, two key modifications were investigated
   and a new test protocol developed. The first modification considered a
   reduced volume of compressed air applied to the test area (named LV
   test), and the second an increased test area (named A-75). The
   reliability of the proposed modifications was investigated by comparing
   against a laboratory-based gas permeability test method (RILEM air
   permeability test). Surface resistivity and relative humidity were
   assessed to evaluate the influence of moisture conditions on in situ air
   permeability test results. A strong correlation between LV test and
   RILEM air permeability test results was found when the free moisture
   near concrete surface regions (up to 20 mm) was removed. It was
   concluded that the LV test exhibits strong potential to become an
   established method for assessing in situ HPC permeability. Crown

   the components. Addition of PHO improved the thermal stability of the
   blends, reduced their crystallinity and resulted in shifts in their
   melting and crystallization temperatures. The blends had improved
   tensile strain at break. The unnotched impact strength showed a
   threefold increase at 30 wt\% PHO content. Cross-linking of PHO using a
   peroxide initiator increased its viscosity, thus improving the

Abstract = {{Polystyrene (PS) latexes prepared with either C12N (N'-dodecyl-N,
   N-dimethylacetamidinium bicarbonate) or C12E2N (N'(2-(2-(dodecyloxy)

   surfactants are stable when CO2 is present, aggregate when CO2 is
   removed and can be redispersed by readdition of CO2. The surface
   coverage of the latex with surfactant drops significantly when CO2 is
   removed. For PS latexes with C12N, the surface coverage does not return
   to the original value when CO2 is reintroduced, but the coverage of the
   latex with C12E2N does return to the initial value. The redispersion
   process of the PS latex with C12E2N occurs much more rapidly when
   sparging with CO2. Both C12N and C12E2N behave as surfactants in the
   presence of CO2, but in the absence of CO2, only C12E2N continues to
   have some surface activity. Due to their different molecular structures,
   their solid surface adsorption behaviors differ. With or without CO2,

Abstract = {{A multiscale methodology is presented to analyze the transport and

   three-dimensional simulations of methane steam reforming at both reactor
   level (macroscale) and catalyst microstructure level (microscale).
   Hypothetical catalyst microstructures are generated using an in-house
   particle packing code. Based on the generated structures, the effective
   transport properties of the porous catalyst and the average reaction
   rates in the microstructure are determined to be applied in the
   pseudohomogeneous model used in the macroscale simulation. Parametric
   study is done to demonstrate the significant effect of the catalyst
   intraparticle and interparticle porosity as well as the particle size on
   the reaction effectiveness factor and methane conversion. This study
   shows that an optimal catalyst coating has a decreasing porosity along
   the reformer length based on the difference in the degree of diffusion

Abstract = {{The characteristics of network formation of multiwall carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNTs) inside ethylene-octene copolymer (EOC) melts under an
   alternating current (AC) electric field and the resulting electrical
   conductivity improvements are studied by combining dynamic and steady
   state resistivity measurements. Fine MWCNT dispersion during melt
   compounding of the samples is accomplished by means of a novel
   non-specific, non-covalent functionalization method. It is found that
   the electrified composite films exhibit nanotube assembly into columnar
   structures parallel to the electric field, accompanied by dramatic
   increases in electrical conductivity up to eight orders of magnitude.
   Experimentally acquired resistivity data are used to derive correlations
   between the characteristic insulator-to-conductor transition times of
   the composites and process parameters, such as electric field strength
   (E), polymer viscosity (eta) and nanotube volume fraction (phi).
   Finally, a criterion for the selection of (eta, E, C) conditions that
   enable MWCNT assembly under an electric field controlled regime (i.e.,
   minimal Brownian motion-driven aggregation effects) is developed. The
   correlations presented herein not only provide insights in the MWCNT
   assembly process, but can also guide the experimental design in future
   studies on electrified composites or assist in the selection of process
   parameters in composites manufacturing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs) have recently been proposed as
   a way to bring cognitive radio (CR) technology to traditional ad hoc
   networks. An important problem is to design a medium access control
   (MAC) protocol that addresses the decentralized control and local
   observation for spectrum management. In this paper, we propose a
   cognitive MAC protocol with mobility support (CM-MAC) based on carrier
   sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) technique, where our
   protocol can respond to the vicinity state of CR nodes to primary
   exclusive regions. This paper analyzes the throughput performance for
   the proposed MAC protocol with the consideration of multiple PU
   activities and CR nodes. Our analytical results show that the proposed
   MAC protocol outperforms the throughput performance of the classical
   CSMA/CA MAC and statistical channel allocation (SCA) MAC protocols. (C)

Abstract = {{The interleaving technique is necessary for LLC resonant converters to
   achieve high power level. The advantages include expanded power
   capacity, lower output ripple current, and higher light-load efficiency
   by using phase shedding. However, conventional frequency-controlled LLC
   converters will lose regulation in individual phases if all the phases
   are operating at the same switching frequency, causing load sharing
   problem. Existing load sharing solutions for interleaved LLC converters
   all have limitations. In this paper, a switch-controlled capacitor (SCC)
   modulated LLC converter (SCC-LLC) is presented to solve the load-sharing
   problem. With constant switching frequency, interleaving and phase
   shedding can be achieved. A 600-W, two-phase interleaved constant
   frequency SCC-LLC prototype is built to verify the feasibility and
   demonstrate the advantages.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{As switching frequency increases, to reduce the gate drive loss combined
   with the zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) technique is meaningful for the
   widely used full-bridge (FB) converters. A dual-channel isolated
   resonant gate driver (RGD) is proposed in this paper. The proposed RGD
   is able to provide two isolated complementary drive signals for a pair
   of power MOSFETs in one bridge leg. Furthermore, the proposed RGD
   reduces about 79\% gate drive loss compared to the conventional voltage
   source driver (VSD). In addition, the negative gate drive voltage
   provided by the proposed RGD prevents the false trigger problem in the
   FB converters. The comparison to the conventional VSDs demonstrates the
   power loss reduction achieved by the proposed RGD. The principle of
   operation and optimum design of the proposed RGD are given in detail. A
   200-VDC input, 48-V/20-A output, and 500-kHz phase-shift ZVS FB
   converter with the proposed RGD was built to verify the advantages and

Abstract = {{Hot compression tests were carried out on 9Cr-Nb-V heat resistant steels
   in the temperature range of 600-1200 degrees C and the strain rate range
   of 10(-2)-10(0) s(-1) to study their deformation characteristics. The
   full recrystallization temperature and the carbon-free bainite phase
   transformation temperature were determined by the slope-change points in
   the curve of mean flow stress versus the inverse of temperature. The
   parameters of the constitutive equation for the experimental steels were
   calculated, including the stress exponent and the activation energy. The
   lower carbon content in steel would increase the fraction of
   precipitates by increasing the volume of dynamic strain-induced (DSIT)
   ferrite during deformation. The In(e) versus In(Z) and the ln(sigma(c))
   versus In(Z) plots for both steels have similar trends. The efficiency
   of power dissipation maps with instability maps merged together show
   excellent workability from the strain of 0.05 to 0.6. The microstructure
   of the experimental steels was fully recrystallized upon deformation at
   low Z value owing to the dynamic recrystallization (DRX), and exhibited
   a necklace structure under the condition of 1050 degrees C/0.1 s(-1) due
   to the suppression of the secondary flow of DRX. However, there were
   barely any DRX grains but elongated pancake grains under the condition
   of 1000 degrees C/1 s(-1) because of the suppression of the metadynamic
   recrystallization (MDRX). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Late Quaternary carbonate deposition at the bottom of the world}},
Journal = {{SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{305}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Carbonate sediments on polar shelves hold great potential for improving
   understanding of climate and oceanography in regions of the globe that
   are particularly sensitive to global change. Such deposits have,
   however, not received much attention from sedimentologists and thus
   remain poorly understood. This study investigates the distribution,
   composition, diagenesis, and stratigraphic context of Late Quaternary
   calcareous sediments recovered in 15 piston cores from the Ross Sea
   shelf, Antarctica. Results are used to develop a depositional model for
   carbonate deposition on glaciated, polar shelves. The utility of the
   deposits as analogs for the ancient record is explored. In the Ross Sea,
   carbonate-rich lithofacies, consisting of poorly sorted skeletal sand
   and gravel, are concentrated in the west and along the outer reaches of
   the continental shelf and upper slope. Analysis of fossil assemblages
   shows that deposits were produced by numerous low-diversity benthic
   communities dominated locally by stylasterine hydrocorals, barnacles, or
   bryozoans. Radiocarbon dating indicates that carbonate sedimentation was
   episodic, corresponding to times of reduced siliciclastic deposition.
   Most accumulation occurred during a time of glacial expansion in the
   lead-up to the Last Glacial Maximum. A more recent interval of carbonate
   accumulation postdates the early Holocene sea level rise and the
   establishment of the modem grounding line for the Ross Ice Shelf. When
   carbonate factories were inactive, fossil debris was subjected to
   infestation by bioeroders, dissolution, fragmentation, and physical
   reworking. This study reveals the episodic nature of carbonate
   deposition in polar settings and a reciprocal relationship with
   processes that deliver and redistribute siliciclastic debris. Carbonate
   production is most active during colder periods of the
   glacial-interglacial cycle, a potential new sedimentological paradigm
   for polar carbonate systems. Low accumulation rates and long residence
   times on the seafloor leave sediments vulnerable to significant
   post-depositional modification, processes that profoundly affect the
   appearance of deposits as they enter the rock record. Comparison with
   other examples of polar carbonates highlights the utility of these Late
   Quaternary deposits as a well-constrained analog that can aid in the
   recognition and interpretation of similar deposits from the ancient
   record. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Composites of the poorly water soluble drug ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal
   anti-inflammatory commonly used for pain relief, with layered silicates
   (nanoclays) and a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) were prepared by hot melt
   extrusion. A highly intercalated and partially exfoliated morphology was
   determined using wide-angle x-ray diffraction, field emission scanning
   electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron
   microscopy. The crystalline content of PEG was significantly reduced, as
   shown by differential scanning calorimetry studies, as a consequence of
   the large surface area of clay platelets physically hindering polymer
   chain dynamics and, in the case of montmorillonite, by tethering of PEG
   via hydrogen bonding. Addition of layered silicate retarded the release
   of ibuprofen from the PEG matrix, even though the crystalline content of
   PEG was reduced. This study therefore indicates that drug release in
   solid dispersion systems may be modified or indeed tailored by the
   inclusion of layered silicates. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

Abstract = {{Radical copolymerizations of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) with
   n-butyl methacrylate (BMA) and n-butyl acrylate (BA) were carried out in
   xylene, DMF, and n-butanol solutions. Solvent effects on
   copolymerization propagation kinetics were investigated using pulsed
   laser polymerization (PLP) combined with size exclusion chromatography
   (SEC) as well as proton NMR, while starved-feed higher temperature
   semibatch reactions were carried out in different solutions to simulate
   industrial production. Solvent choice, through its influence on hydrogen
   bonding of HEMA monomer, has a significant impact on the copolymer
   composition and propagation rate coefficient and thus influences the
   semibatch polymerization behavior of BMA/HEMA, as previously found for
   the styrene/HEMA system. The presence of HEMA leads to increased polymer
   molecular weight, a result attributed to branching reactions involving
   dimethacrylate impurity. Although H-bonding (and solvent choice)
   influences BA/HEMA kinetics, its relative effect is negligible on
   semibatch operation under the conditions studied.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of hydrodeoxygenation of waste cooking oil (WCO) is
   investigated with unsupported CoMoS catalysts. A kinetic model is
   established and a comprehensive analysis of each reaction pathway is
   carried out. The results show that hydrodecarbonylation/decarboxylation
   (HDC) routes are the predominant reaction pathways in the elimination of
   oxygen, with the rate constant three times as high as that of
   hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). However, the HDC activity of the CoMoS
   catalyst deactivates due to gradual loss of sulfur from the catalyst.
   HDO process is insensitive to the sulfur deficiency. The kinetic
   modeling shows that direct hydrodecarbonylation of fatty acids dominates
   the HDC routes and, in the HDO route, fatty acids are transferred to
   aldehydes/alcohols and then to C-18 hydrocarbons, a final product, and
   the reduction of acids is the rate limiting step. The HDO route via
   alcohols is dominant over aldehydes due to a significantly higher
   reaction rate constant. The difference of C-18/C-17 ratio in unsupported
   and supported catalysts show that a support with Lewis acid sites may
   play an important role in the selectivity for the hydrodeoxygenation
   pathways and promoting the final product quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This study focuses on assessing groundwater potability in a highly
   complex and heterogeneous fractured bedrock aquifer having variable
   overburden cover. Eight monitoring wells were installed in a privately
   serviced lakeside village, and groundwater was routinely sampled over a
   2-year timeframe for concentration analysis of nitrate, fecal indicator
   bacteria, stable isotopes, and a total of 41 pharmaceutical compounds.
   While pollutant concentrations remained low throughout the study, the
   presence of fecal indicator bacteria and pharmaceuticals was noted at
   least once (but not always consistently) in most sampling intervals. An
   interpretation based on the integration of chemical, bacterial, and site
   characterization datasets suggests that: (1) the fracture network is
   complex and heterogeneous with limited vertical connectivity; (2)
   existing pathways are sufficient for the quick and widespread migration
   of surface contaminants to depth; (3) anthropogenic contaminants from
   both septic systems and agriculture are likely sourced in the
   surrounding uplands where overburden is thin; and (4) fecal
   contamination, as observed over the long term, is ubiquitous at the
   village scale. Groundwater quality is continually changing in this
   hydrogeologic environment and the determination of potability on the
   larger scale is not likely to be adequately captured with infrequent
   domestic well sampling (i.e., voluntary annual sampling by homeowners).}},

Abstract = {{A multiuser dual-hop relaying system over mixed radio
   frequency/free-space optical (RF/FSO) links is investigated.
   Specifically, the system consists of m single-antenna sources, a relay
   node equipped with n >= m receive antennas and a single photo-aperture
   transmitter, and one destination equipped with a single photo-detector.
   RF links are used for the simultaneous data transmission from multiple
   sources to the relay. The relay operates under the decode-and-forward
   protocol and utilizes the popular V-BLAST technique by successively
   decoding each user's transmitted stream. Two common norm-based orderings
   are adopted, i.e., the streams are decoded in an ascending or a
   descending order. After V-BLAST, the relay retransmits the decoded
   information to the destination via a point-to-point FSO link in m
   consecutive timeslots. Analytical expressions for the end-to-end outage
   probability and average symbol error probability of each user are
   derived, while closed-form asymptotic expressions are also presented.
   Capitalizing on the derived results, some engineering insights are
   manifested, such as the coding and diversity gain of each user, the
   impact of the pointing error displacement on the FSO link and the
   V-BLAST ordering effectiveness at the relay.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of channel estimation for OFDM-based
   amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relay networks (TWRNs). While previous
   works have adopted a pilot-based approach, we propose a semi-blind
   approach that exploits both the transmitted pilots as well as the
   received data samples to improve the estimation performance. Our
   proposed semi-blind estimator is based on the Gaussian maximum
   likelihood (GML) criterion which treats that data symbols as
   Gaussian-distributed nuisance parameters. The GML estimates are obtained
   using an iterative quasi-Newton method. To assist in the estimation of
   the individual channels, we adopt a superimposed training strategy at
   the relay. We design the pilot vectors of the terminals and the relay to
   optimize the estimation performance. Furthermore, we derive the
   semi-blind and pilot-based Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) to use as
   performance benchmarks. Finally, we use simulation studies to show that
   the proposed method provides substantial improvements in estimation
   accuracy over the conventional pilot-based estimation and that it
   approaches the semi-blind CRB as SNR increases. These improvements are
   possible using only a limited number of OFDM data blocks, which
   demonstrates the practicality of the semi-blind approach.}},

Abstract = {{For highly viscous fluids that slip in parallel sliding plate
   rheometers, we want to use a slightly converging flow to suppress this
   wall slip. In this work, we first attack the steady shear flow of a
   highly viscous Newtonian fluid between two gently converging plates with
   no slip boundaries using the equation of motion in cylindrical
   coordinates, which yields no analytical solution. Then we treat the same
   problem using the lubrication approximation in Cartesian coordinates to
   yield exact, explicit solutions for dimensionless velocity, pressure and
   shear stress. This work deepens our understanding of a drag flow through
   a gently converging slit of arbitrary convergence angle. We also employ
   the corotational Maxwell model to explore the role of viscoelasticity in
   this converging shear flow. We then compare these analytical solutions
   to finite element calculations for both Newtonian and corotational
   Maxwell cases. A worked example for determining the Newtonian viscosity
   using a converging shear rheometer is also included. With this work, we
   provide the framework for exploring other constitutive equations or
   other boundary conditions in future work. Our results can also be used
   to design the linear bearings used for the parallel sliding plate
   rheometer (SPR). This work can also be used to evaluate the error in the
   shear stress that is caused by bearing misalignment and specify the
   parallelism tolerance for the linear bearings incorporated into a SPR.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) liner as it spans a

   old pipe as well as the orthotropic material properties of the liner are
   investigated. Failure pressures and unconfined hoop displacements are
   calculated using failure criteria from ASTM F2207-06 and it is concluded
   that the liner response is dominated by uniaxial rather than multiaxial
   strength properties. Lastly, it is recommended that the maximum stress

Abstract = {{As buried infrastructure assets reach the end of their service lives,
   better methods to assess these assets are required in order to optimize
   infrastructure budgets and management programs. As a first step towards
   developing these more accurate methods, the results of four currently
   available culvert modelling approaches were compared with the results of
   experiments on a deteriorated culvert as well as two buried culverts
   (one with significant deterioration and poor backfill, and one with
   limited deterioration and well compacted backfill) subjected to
   simulated vehicle loading. Two finite element analysis programs were
   used: CANDE, a commonly used software package specifically for culverts,
   and ABAQUS, a more robust general use package. Three different live load
   spreading factors were used with these programs to determine which one
   most accurately modelled the three dimensional live loading effects in
   two dimensions. The capacity of the culverts was also estimated using
   the design equations given in the Canadian and American bridge design
   codes. All the finite element models were unable to capture the
   non-linear behaviour of the deteriorated culvert with poor backfill as
   well as both culverts at high surface loading due to the use of linear
   elastic models. CANDE was found to provide very poor estimates of
   culvert diameter change but good estimates of culvert performance for
   the culvert with limited deterioration and well compacted backfill.
   ABAQUS could be used to predict culvert diameter change and thrust force
   with good accuracy in the linear elastic region or provide an upper
   bound estimate depending on the surface load spreading model that was
   employed. Both the Canadian and American design code equations
   underestimated the thrust forces in the culverts, suggesting that these
   approaches could be unconservative. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The hydromechanical effects of Pleistocene glacial loading on the
   Michigan Basin are assessed using numerical analysis based on coupled
   stress and pore-water pressure. The two-dimensional model domain
   included the Basin cross section and extended 10km into the Precambrian.
   In the analysis, we considered the effects of the number of glacial
   loading cycles, the presence and connectedness of a deep Cambrian
   aquifer, the direction of glacial advance, the effect of a wet versus
   dry glacier/soil interface, topographic effects, density-driven flow
   effects, and lithosphere flexure on the development of anomalous
   pressures. The modeling results were compared with data collected from
   highly instrumented wells completed in the eastern margin of the Basin.
   The present-day results define regions of significant underpressure in
   the upper Ordovician and lower Silurian formations characterized by very
   low hydraulic conductivity and regions of overpressure where hydraulic
   conductivity is higher. To achieve the degree of underpressure observed
   in the instrumented wells using the model, a specific loading cycle
   applied over 100000years was repeated four times. As the number of
   loading cycles increased, the Paleozoic formations reached a state where
   the underpressures remain constant. Our results also illustrate the
   difference in poroelastic modeling between the application of mechanical
   loads on the land surface and the application of an equivalent hydraulic
   head, where the latter developed overpressures rather than the observed
   underpressures. The modeling also shows that the overpressures observed
   in the Cambrian formations are most likely to be the result of
   density-driven flow. Finally, the simulations show that the effects of
   lithosphere flexure in the hydromechanical models results in the
   development of lateral stresses that generate overpressures rather than
   underpressures in the southern half of the domain. As there are no
   suitable observation points, these results remain unconfirmed, and
   further study is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Drilling is a key factor in the manufacturing of holes required for the
   assemblies of composite laminates in aerospace industry. The quality of
   holes can be controlled by the choice of tool geometry and process
   parameters. Simulation of drilling process is an effective method in
   optimizing the drill geometry and process parameters in order to improve
   hole quality and reduce the drill wear. In this research, we have
   developed three-dimensional finite element model for drilling carbon
   fiber-reinforced. A three-dimensional progressive intra-laminar failure
   model based on the Hashin's theory is considered. Also, an inter-laminar
   delamination model which includes the onset and growth of delamination
   by using cohesive contact zone was developed. It is shown that the
   induced thrust force, torque, damaged area and delamination are
   predicted very well with the given drill geometry and process
   parameters. The delamination area resulted from drilling of carbon
   fiber-reinforced polymer was predicted successfully using the developed
   model. The current finite element model using three-dimensional elements
   and improved damage models showed much better capability in simulation
   of the drilling process of CFC compared to the previous model using
   shell elements.}},

   severely constrained by the lack of a reliable obstacle detection and

   proposed, which performs obstacle detection, risk assessment and path
   planning (avoidance) tasks autonomously in an integrated manner. The
   detection system is based on a vision-LIDAR (light detection and
   ranging) system, whereas a heuristic path planner is utilised. A unique
   property of the path planner is its compliance with the marine collision
   regulations. It is demonstrated through hardware-in-the-loop simulations
   that the proposed system can be useful for both uninhabited and manned

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to prepare a fibrous scaffold that possesses a
   crimped morphology using a photo-cross-linkable biodegradable copolymer.
   To obtain the crimped morphology, the polymer was first electrospun onto
   a rotating wire mandrel to obtain aligned straight fibers.
   Postprocessing by immersion in aqueous buffer at 37 degrees C generated
   a crimplike pattern in the fibers. It was reasoned that cross-linking
   the fibers following formation of the crimped structure would endow the
   scaffolds with a recoverable crimp pattern and mechanical properties
   similar to that of the collagen fibers in the anterior cruciate ligament
   (ACL). To achieve this aim, a trimethylene carbonate based monomer
   bearing an acrylate pendant group was synthesized and copolymerized with
   L-lactide. The copolymer was electrospun and photo-cross-linked yielding
   fibrous scaffolds possessing a substantial increase in tensile modulus
   and crimp stability compared to the uncross-linked fibrous scaffolds.
   The crimp-stabilized scaffolds also showed good cytocompatibility toward
   3T3 fibroblasts, which attached and grew along the crimped fibers. These
   findings suggest that these cross-linked fiber scaffolds may be useful
   for the generation of cultured ligament tissue.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{496-507}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{For the deviatoric strain-softening associated with static liquefaction
   to occur in a landslide, the soil must be contractile, be subjected to a
   monotonic loading trigger, and be sufficiently saturated to permit the
   generation of excess pore-water pressures upon loading. It is
   hypothesized in this paper that static liquefaction might preferentially
   occur in the saturated granular soil located at the base of the
   landslide in certain circumstances rather than the well-drained inclined
   portion of the slope. This hypothesis was tested using the technique of
   geotechnical centrifuge modelling with a loose granular slope, which was
   brought to failure under a step-wise increase in groundwater flux. The
   rising pore-water pressures eventually led to a small localized failure
   at the toe of the slope. This toe failure acted as the monotonic loading
   trigger to shear the loose contractile saturated sand at the base of the
   slope and cause liquefaction to occur in the base region. A
   back-analysis of the landslide indicates that these types of analyses
   should be viewed with great caution as the progressive nature of the
   event following triggering will be likely to lead to erroneous
   back-calculations of mobilized strength.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the use of two coupled loops as an alternative
   method of connection for high-frequency signals between passive elements
   on microwave laminates and integrated circuits (ICs) replacing
   traditional interconnect methods such as wire bonds and solder bumps,
   which require costly post back-end-of-line processing. The loops harness
   both electric and magnetic fields in order to create the
   interconnection. Additionally, they can be placed around the perimeter
   of the IC where they would not occupy space that may be required for
   other components such as spiral inductors. In order to test the
   chip-to-antenna system, the interconnect was fabricated with one
   metallic loop on a low-loss microwave laminate and another on a 0.13-mu
   m CMOS IC. These loops were then stacked in order to couple the signal
   from an IC onto a planar antenna array (printed on the laminate). This
   antenna-to-chip system was measured to have a center frequency near 23
   GHz, with fractional bandwidth of 15\%, and a peak antenna gain over 5
   dBi; the transmission loss in the loop coupling is estimated to be 0.5
   dB at 19 GHz (89\% power transfer). The radiation pattern from the
   antenna (a four-element uniform array of bow-tie dipoles) has a 3-dB
   beamwidth of 16 in the elevation plane and 90 degrees in the azimuth
   plane, making it potentially useful for application in mass-produced
   automotive radar systems, where harsh conditions create demand for a
   more robust interconnect method than wire bonding.}},

Abstract = {{Inert condensing agents (ICAs) are used principally to cool down
   gas-phase fluidized bed reactors used to polymerize ethylene over

   that they might nevertheless increase the polymerization rate. n-Hexane
   is used as an ICA, and an enhancement in the instantaneous rate of
   ethylene polymerization in the gas phase is observed. This is attributed
   to a rise in the local ethylene concentration in the amorphous polymer
   phase surrounding the active sites, due to increases in both the
   solubility and diffusivity of ethylene in the amorphous polymer. In
   addition, the polymer particles have a smoother surface with less
   formation of fiber-like substructures as the n-hexane concentration
   increases.}},

Abstract = {{A new precast concrete insulated sandwich wall panel with glass
   fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) shear connectors is investigated. The
   GFRP connectors, which connect the,two outer concrete wythes, are

   260 mm (94.5 x 61 x 10.2 in.) panels were tested in four-point bending
   to examine the effects of varying the sizes and spacing of GFRP
   connectors, as well as the contribution of adhesion and friction bond
   between concrete and insulation. As the reinforcement ratio of GFRP
   connectors increased from 0.026 to 0.098\% in these partially composite
   panels, the ultimate loads increased from 58 to 80\% of the strength of
   an equivalent fully composite panel. Within this range, adhesion and
   friction contributed 44 to 59\% of the ultimate loads. Despite the small
   embedment lengths of the sand-coated GFRP straight connectors in the
   wythes, no pullout failure occurred and all connectors fractured during

Abstract = {{The relationship between varying processing variables, rotor speed (50
   to 200rpm) and mixing time (10 to 30min), and MWCNT loading (0.5 to
   2.0wt\%), on MWCNT dispersion in a poly(propylene) during batch melt
   mixing was investigated. MWCNT dispersion was improved by increasing
   rotor speed and/or mixing time, 200rpm and 30min being optimum, although
   composites prepared employing 100rpm and 20min were the most
   electrically conducting, (<100 Scm(-1)). PP shear viscosity increased
   with increasing MWCNT loading yielding a rheological percolation of
   approximate to 0.5wt\% MWCNTs. Volume resistivity of the composites
   decreased with increasing rotor speed and for mixing times up to 20min
   only, the former yielding an electrical percolation of approximate to
   0.65wt\% MWCNTs at 200rpm.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer extrusion is regarded as an energy-intensive production process,
   and the real-time monitoring of both energy consumption and melt quality
   has become necessary to meet new carbon regulations and survive in the
   highly competitive plastics market. The use of a power meter is a simple
   and easy way to monitor energy, but the cost can sometimes be high. On
   the other hand, viscosity is regarded as one of the key indicators of
   melt quality in the polymer extrusion process. Unfortunately, viscosity
   cannot be measured directly using current sensory technology. The
   employment of on-line, in-line or off-line rheometers is sometimes
   useful, but these instruments either involve signal delay or cause flow
   restrictions to the extrusion process, which is obviously not suitable
   for real-time monitoring and control in practice. In this paper, simple
   and accurate real-time energy monitoring methods are developed. This is
   achieved by looking inside the controller, and using control variables
   to calculate the power consumption. For viscosity monitoring, a
   `soft-sensor' approach based on an RBF neural network model is
   developed. The model is obtained through a two-stage selection and
   differential evolution, enabling compact and accurate solutions for
   viscosity monitoring. The proposed monitoring methods were tested and
   validated on a Killion KTS-100 extruder, and the experimental results
   show high accuracy compared with traditional monitoring approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of transformation conditions such as
   initial pH, the initial concentration of glucose and yeast extract in
   the medium, and the separate addition of ferulic acid and vanillic acid,
   on the production of vanillin through an analysis of competing
   by-product formation by Amycolatopsis sp. ATCC 39116. The extent and
   nature of by-product formation and vanillin yield were affected by
   initial pH and different initial concentrations of glucose and yeast
   extract in the medium, with a high yield of vanillin and high cell
   density obtained at pH 8.0, 10 g/l glucose, and 8 g/l yeast extract.
   High concentrations of ferulic acid were found to negatively affect cell
   density. Additional supplementation of 100 mg/l vanillic acid, a
   metabolically linked by-product, was found to result in a high
   concentration of vanillin and guaiacol, an intermediate of vanillin. Via
   an analysis of the effect of these transformation conditions on
   competing by-product formation, high concentrations of ferulic acid were
   transformed with a molar yield to vanillin of 96.1 and 95.2 \%, by
   Amycolatopsis sp. ATCC 39116 and Streptomyces V1, respectively, together
   with a minor accumulation of by-products. These are among the highest

Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{111-116}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Although the spectral effects of direct and diffuse radiation on solar
   photovoltaic (PV) performance are relatively well understood, recent
   investigations have shown that there can be a spectral bias introduced
   due to albedo from common ground surfaces that can impact the optimal
   selection of PV materials for a known location. This paper extends
   analysis to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular
   reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both man-made
   and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven
   PV materials covering three common PV system topologies: industrial
   (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched roof
   applications. An effective albedo is found for each surface material and
   PV material combination, which can be used in lieu of broadband albedo
   values in PV simulations. These results enable PV material selection for
   specific environments enabling geographic optimization for the
   micro-environment, while at the same time assisting optimal surface
   selection in the vicinity of existing or planned PV arrays. This
   analysis is of particular significance for the modeling of performance
   of bi-facial PV modules and vertical BIPV. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We present wide-field near-infrared J and K-s images of the Andromeda
   Galaxy (M31) taken with WIRCam at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope as
   part of the Andromeda Optical and Infrared Disk Survey. This data set
   allows simultaneous observations of resolved stars and near-infrared
   (NIR) surface brightness across M31's entire bulge and disk (within R =
   22 kpc), permitting a direct test of the stellar composition of
   near-infrared light in a nearby galaxy. Here we develop NIR observation
   and reduction methods to recover a uniform surface brightness map across
   the 3 degrees x 1 degrees disk of M31 with 27 WIRCam fields. Two
   sky-target nodding strategies are tested, and we find that strictly
   minimizing sky sampling latency cannot improve background subtraction
   accuracy to better than 2\% of the background level due to
   spatio-temporal variations in the NIR skyglow. We fully describe our
   WIRCam reduction pipeline and advocate using flats built from night-sky
   images over a single night, rather than dome flats that do not capture
   the WIRCam illumination field. Contamination from scattered light and
   thermal background in sky flats has a negligible effect on the surface
   brightness shape compared to the stochastic differences in background
   shape between sky and galaxy disk fields, which are similar to 0.3\% of
   the background level. The most dramatic calibration step is the
   introduction of scalar sky offsets to each image that optimizes surface
   brightness continuity. Sky offsets reduce the mean surface brightness
   difference between observation blocks from 1\% to <0.1\% of the
   background level, though the absolute background level remains
   statistically uncertain to 0.15\% of the background level. We present
   our WIRCam reduction pipeline and performance analysis to give specific
   recommendations for the improvement of NIR wide-field imaging methods.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{North America is traversed by many high-pressure oil and gas
   transmission pipes and the stability of that essential buried
   infrastructure must be maintained under a variety of earth-loading
   conditions. In the research reported in this paper, a series of
   pipe-bending experiments have been conducted on 105-mm (4.1-in.) outside
   diameter and 1,830-mm (6-ft) long steel pipes buried in dense sand
   placed in a 4,000 x 2,000 x 2,000-mm (157.5 x 78.7 x 74.7-in:) test pit.
   The pipe ends were pulled by two parallel cables attached to a spreader
   beam outside the test region, which was pulled by a hydraulic actuator.
   The research reported in this paper investigated burial
   depth-to-diameter ratios of 3, 5, and 7 as well as two horizontal
   extents for the soil behind the pipe distances of 3D and 9.5D. Special
   consideration was made to assess the influence of friction between the
   pulling-cables and soil. This friction is significant and may contribute
   about 20\% of the maximum pulling load for the case of a
   depth-to-diameter ratio of 3. Consistency of results was established
   using four test repetitions for some cases. Whereas the horizontal
   extent of soil behind the pipe tested in the research reported in this
   paper had an insignificant influence on the pulling forces, the burial
   depths significantly influenced the ultimate pulling forces for the
   system. The failure mechanism controlling the limiting pulling force in
   these tests was consistently governed by the soil and the pipe remained
   elastic. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, calcium phosphate (CaP) powders were blended with a
   three-dimensional printing (3DP) calcium sulfate (CaSO4)-based powder
   and the resulting composite powders were printed with a water-based
   binder using the 3DP technology. Application of a water-based binder
   ensured the manufacture of CaP:CaSO4 constructs on a reliable and
   repeatable basis, without long term damage of the printhead.
   Printability of CaP:CaSO4 powders was quantitatively assessed by
   investigating the key 3DP process parameters, i.e. in-process powder bed
   packing, drop penetration behavior and the quality of printed solid
   constructs. Effects of particle size, CaP:CaSO4 ratio and CaP powder
   type on the 3DP process were considered. The drop penetration technique
   was used to reliably identify powder formulations that could be
   potentially used for the application of tissue engineered bone scaffolds
   using the 3DP technique.
   Significant improvements (p < 0.05) in the 3DP process parameters were
   found for CaP (30-110 mu m):CaSO4 powders compared to CaP (<20 mu
   m):CaSO4 powders. Higher compressive strength was obtained for the
   powders with the higher CaP:CaSO4 ratio. Hydroxyapatite (HA):CaSO4
   powders showed better results than beta-tricalcium phosphate
   (beta-TCP):CaSO4 powders. Solid and porous constructs were manufactured
   using the 3DP technique from the optimized CaP:CaSO4 powder
   formulations. High-quality printed constructs were manufactured, which
   exhibited appropriate green compressive strength and a high level of
   printing accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present updated magnetic field maps of the chemically peculiar B9p
   star alpha(2) CVn created using a series of time-resolved observations
   obtained using the high-resolution spectropolarimeters ESPaDOnS and
   Narval. We compare these new magnetic field maps with the original
   magnetic Doppler imaging maps based on spectra recorded with the MuSiCoS
   spectropolarimeter and taken a decade earlier. These new maps are
   inferred from line profiles in all four Stokes parameters using the
   magnetic Doppler imaging code INVERS10. With the addition of new lines
   exhibiting Stokes IQUV signatures, we have a unique insight into how the
   derived magnetic surface structure may be affected by the atomic lines
   chosen for inversion. We report new magnetic maps of alpha(2) CVn
   created using strong iron lines (directly comparable to the published
   MuSiCoS maps), weak iron lines and chromium lines, all of which yield a
   magnetic field structure roughly consistent with that obtained
   previously.
   We then derive an updated magnetic structure map for alpha(2) CVn based
   on the complete sample of Fe and Cr lines, which we believe to produce a
   more representative model of the magnetic topology of alpha(2) CVn. In
   agreement with the previous mapping, this new updated magnetic map shows
   a dipolar-like field which has complex sub-structure which cannot be
   explained by a simple low-order multipolar geometry. Our new maps show
   that regardless of the atomic line or species choice, the reconstructed
   magnetic field is consistent with that published previously, suggesting
   that the reconstructed field is a realistic representation of the
   magnetic field of alpha(2) CVn. alpha(2) CVn is the first Ap star for
   which multiple, high-resolution magnetic maps have been derived,
   providing important observational evidence for the stability of both the
   large- and small-scale magnetic field.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the hypothesis that a passing satellite or dark matter
   subhalo has excited coherent oscillations of the Milky Way's stellar
   disc in the direction perpendicular to the Galactic mid-plane. This work
   is motivated by recent observations of spatially dependent bulk vertical
   motions within similar to 2 kpc of the Sun. A satellite can transfer a
   fraction of its orbital energy to the disc stars as it plunges through
   the Galactic mid-plane, thereby heating and thickening the disc. Bulk
   motions arise during the early stages of such an event when the disc is
   still in an unrelaxed state. We present simple toy-model calculations
   and simulations of disc-satellite interactions, which show that the
   response of the disc depends on the relative velocity of the satellite.
   When the component of the satellite's velocity perpendicular to the disc
   is small compared with that of the stars, the perturbation is
   pre-dominantly a bending mode. Conversely, breathing and higher order
   modes are excited when the vertical velocity of the satellite is larger
   than that of the stars. We argue that the compression and rarefaction
   motions seen in three different surveys are in fact breathing-mode
   perturbations of the Galactic disc.}},

Title = {{Ultra stable self-assembled monolayers of N-heterocyclic carbenes on

Journal = {{NATURE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Since the first report of thiol-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)
   30 years ago, these structures have been examined in a huge variety of
   applications. The oxidative and thermal instabilities of these systems
   are widely known, however, and are an impediment to their widespread
   commercial use. Here, we describe the generation of N-heterocyclic
   carbene (NHC)-based SAMs on gold that demonstrate considerably greater
   resistance to heat and chemical reagents than the thiol-based
   counterparts. This increased stability is related to the increased
   strength of the gold-carbon bond relative to that of a gold-sulfur bond,
   and to a different mode of bonding in the case of the carbene ligand.
   Once bound to gold, NHCs are not displaced by thiols or thioethers, and
   are stable to high temperatures, boiling water, organic solvents, pH
   extremes, electrochemical cycling above 0 V and 1\% hydrogen peroxide.
   In particular, benzimidazole-derived carbenes provide films with the
   highest stabilities and evidence of short-range molecular ordering.
   Chemical derivatization can be employed to adjust the surface properties
   of NHC-based SAMs.}},

Title = {{An approximate expectation maximisation algorithm for estimating

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic terms are included in fundamental dynamic models of chemical
   processes to account for disturbances, input uncertainties and model
   mismatch. The resulting equations are called stochastic differential
   equations (SDEs). An approximate expectation maximisation (AEM)
   algorithm using B-splines is developed for estimating parameters in SDE
   models when the magnitude of the disturbances and model mismatch is
   unknown. The AEM method is evaluated using a two-state nonlinear
   continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) model. The proposed algorithm is
   compared with two other maximum-likelihood-based methods (continuous
   time stochastic modelling (CTSM) {[}Kristensen and Madsen, Continuous
   Time Stochastic Modelling: CTSM 2.3 User's Guide, 2003; Kristensen et
   al., Automatica 2004; 40: 225] and extended approximate maximum
   likelihood estimation (AMLE) {[}Varziri et al., Can. J. Chem. Eng. 2008;
   86: 828]). For the CSTR examples studied, the AEM algorithm provides
   more accurate estimates of model parameters, unknown initial conditions
   and disturbance intensities. SDE models and associated parameter
   estimates obtained using AEM will be helpful to engineers who
   subsequently implement on-line state estimation and process monitoring
   schemes because the two types of uncertainties that are considered (i.e.
   measurement noise and stochastic process disturbances) are consistent
   with the error structure used in extended Kalman filters.}},

Abstract = {{A design methodology is proposed to maintain gas and liquid flow
   nonuniformities below an acceptable limit in a parallel
   micro/millichannels reactor by determining the maximum allowed
   temperature deviation in each part of the reactor. The effect of
   temperature deviation on flow distribution was quantified using a
   hydraulic resistive network model. The effect of flow rate on
   temperature deviation was demonstrated using a one-dimensional energy
   balance model. Experiments were conducted using the barrier-based
   micro/millichannels reactor (BMMR). Flow distribution in the BMMR is
   based on placing hydraulic resistances (barrier channels) in the gas and
   liquid manifolds to regulate the flows. Temperature deviation in the
   barrier channels affects flow nonuniformity by 10 times more than in the
   reaction channels. Above a certain critical liquid residence time, flow
   rate has no significant effect on the temperature deviation which
   depends on the liquid used, reactor material of construction, and its
   geometrical dimensions. (c) 2014 American Institute of Chemical

Volume = {{243}},
Pages = {{225-233}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{A near-isothermal micro-trickle bed reactor operated under radio
   frequency heating was developed. The reactor bed was packed with nickel
   ferrite micro-particles of 110 mu m diameter, generating heat by the
   application of RF field at 180 kHz. Hydrodynamics in a co-current
   configuration was analysed and heat transfer rates were determined at
   temperature ranging from 55 to 100 degrees C. A multi-zone reactor bed
   of several heating and catalytic zones was proposed in order to achieve
   near-isothermal operations. Exact positioning, number of the heating
   zones and length of the heating zones composed of a mixture of nickel
   ferrite and a catalyst were determined by solving a one dimensional
   model of heat transfer by conduction and convection. The conductive
   losses contributed up to 30\% in the total thermal losses from the
   reactor. Three heating zones were required to obtain an isothermal
   length of 50 mm with a temperature non-uniformity of 2 K. A good
   agreement between the modelling and experimental results was obtained
   for temperature profiles of the reactor. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{An exergy analysis was performed to compare a conventional (1) two panel
   photovoltaic solar thermal hybrid (PVT x2) system, (2) side by side
   photovoltaic and thermal (PV + T) system, (3) two module photovoltaic
   (PV) system and (4) a two panel solar thermal (T x2) system with
   identical absorber areas to determine the superior technical solar
   energy systems for applications with a limited roof area. Three
   locations, Detroit, Denver and Phoenix, were simulated due to their
   differences in average monthly temperature and solar flux. The exergy
   analysis results show that PVT systems outperform the PV + T systems by
   69\% for all the locations, produce between 6.5\% and 8.4\% more exergy
   when matched against the purely PV systems and created 4 times as much
   exergy as the pure solar thermal system. The results clearly show that
   PVT systems, which are able to utilize all of the thermal and electrical
   energy generated, are superior in exergy performance to either PV + T or
   PV only systems. These results are discussed and future work is outlined
   to further geographically optimize PVT systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{MARINE POLICY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{152-160}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Marine spatial planning (MSP) is a fast evolving discipline signified by
   the European Commission's proposed directive to create a common
   framework for MSP and integrated coastal management in EU waters and
   coastal areas. The Shetland Islands' Marine Spatial Plan (SMSP) first
   developed in 2006 is one of the most advanced in the UK. With seven
   years' experience of MSP and integrated coastal zone management (ICZM)
   in Shetland's waters, and the pending statutory implementation of the
   SMSP in 2014, Shetland represents an exemplar case study for the
   monitoring and evaluation of this discipline in practice. A review was
   carried out in 2012 to evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of the
   SMSP to date. This exercise highlighted achievements to date, future
   challenges and opportunities and helped to guide the development of the
   forthcoming edition of the SMSP. The sharing of knowledge and practical
   experiences of MSP and ICZM ensures an adaptive approach in addressing
   uncertainty over time. It is also imperative to understand that early
   `pioneers' in this discipline may not get it exactly right on the first
   attempt but by developing initial precedents and processes, these can be
   built upon in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A cognitive framework for WSN based on weighted cognitive maps and
   Q-learning}},
Journal = {{AD HOC NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{46-69}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Due to the rising popularity of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), there
   has been an increasing demand for more challenging applications.
   Generally speaking, such applications demand the support of Quality of
   Service (QoS) constraints and often multiple conflicting objectives. To
   address these requirements, network management becomes a critical task.
   However, single layer and cross-layer techniques will probably not be
   sufficient. Fortunately, cognitive techniques have shown great potential
   in improving network performance and achieving the end-to-end goals. In
   this paper, cognitive solutions for resource management in WSN are
   proposed to address the needs of challenging applications. The solutions
   proposed include a reasoning machine designed for the first time using
   the mathematical tool known as Weighted Cognitive Maps (WCM), and a
   learning protocol designed using the Q-learning algorithm. The WCM has
   powerful inference properties and can model complex systems using their
   underlying causal relationships. Thus, it can consider multiple
   conflicting objectives with low complexity. On the other hand, the
   learning protocol uses Q-learning to build a knowledge base that is used
   to enhance the performance of the WCM reasoning machine and address the
   end-to-end goals of the applications directly. Extensive computer
   simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the cognitive
   framework. The results show that it can efficiently consider multiple
   conflicting goals and constraints, thus outperforming its
   state-of-the-art counterparts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{DRYING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{631-643}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{There has been much debate in the literature over the past 60 years
   regarding an appropriate oven-drying temperature for water content
   determinations in peat and other organic soils. For inorganic soils, the
   water content is usually based on the equilibrium dry mass corresponding
   to drying temperatures in the range 100-110 degrees C. However, for peat
   and other organic soils, several researchers have recommended lower
   drying temperatures in the range 60-90 degrees C in an attempt to
   prevent possible charring, oxidation, and/or vaporization of substances
   other than pore water. However, all of the relevant water is not fully
   evaporated at too low a temperature, and because specimen dry mass is a
   function of drying temperature, the resulting water content values are
   lower than those determined for the temperature range 100-110 degrees C.
   Experimental data reported in this article show that oven drying of peat
   and other organic soils at 100-110 degrees C using either
   gravity-convection or forced-draft ovens is acceptable for routine water
   content determinations. Because a standardized oven temperature is
   desirable when correlating water content with other material properties,
   it is recommended that oven drying of peat and other organic soils be
   performed over temperature ranges of either 105-110 degrees C or 105 +/-
   5 degrees C, in line with standardized ranges for inorganic soils.}},

Abstract = {{Suitably functionalised carboxylic acids undergo a previously unknown
   photoredox reaction when irradiated with UVA in the presence of
   maleimide. Maleimide was found to synergistically act as a radical
   generating photoxidant and as a radical acceptor, negating the need for
   an extrinsic photoredox catalyst. Modest to excellent yields of the
   product chromenopyrroledione, thiochromenopyrroledione and
   pyrroloquinolinedione derivatives were obtained in thirteen preparative
   photolyses. In situ NMR spectroscopy was used to study each reaction.
   Reactant decay and product build-up were monitored, enabling reaction
   profiles to be plotted. A plausible mechanism, whereby photo-excited
   maleimide acts as an oxidant to generate a radical ion pair, has been
   postulated and is supported by UV/Vis. spectroscopy and DFT
   computations. The radical-cation reactive intermediates were also
   characterised in solution by EPR spectroscopy.}},

   osteoarthritis subjects does not unload medial knee condyle}},

Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{1409-1415}},

Abstract = {{There is some debate in the literature regarding the role of
   quadriceps-hamstrings co-contraction in the onset and progression of
   knee osteoarthritis. Does co-contraction during walking increase knee
   contact loads, thereby causing knee osteoarthritis, or might it be a
   compensatory mechanism to unload the medial tibial condyle? We used a
   detailed musculoskeletal model of the lower limb to test the hypothesis
   that selective activation of lateral hamstrings and quadriceps, in
   conjunction with inhibited medial gastrocnemius, can actually reduce the
   joint contact force on the medial compartment of the knee, independent
   of changes in kinematics or external forces. ``Baseline{''} joint loads
   were computed for eight subjects with moderate medial knee
   osteoarthritis (OA) during level walking, using static optimization to
   resolve the system of muscle forces for each subject's scaled model.
   Holding all external loads and kinematics constant, each subject's model
   was then perturbed to represent non-optimal ``OA-type{''} activation
   based on mean differences detected between electromyograms (EMG) of
   control and osteoarthritis subjects. Knee joint contact forces were
   greater for the ``OA-type{''} than the ``Baseline{''} distribution of
   muscle forces, particularly during early stance. The early-stance
   increase in medial contact load due to the ``OA-type{''} perturbation
   could implicate this selective activation strategy as a cause of knee
   osteoarthritis. However, the largest increase in the contact load was
   found at the lateral condyle, and the ``OA-type{''} lateral activation
   strategy did not increase the overall (greater of the first or second)
   medial peak contact load. While ``OA-type{''} selective activation of
   lateral muscles does not appear to reduce the medial knee contact load,
   it could allow subjects to increase knee joint stiffness without any
   further increase to the peak medial contact load. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have reported the CO2 solubility in different pure
   alkyl carbonate solvents (EC, DMC, EMC, DEC) and their binary mixtures
   as EC/DMC, EC/EMC, and EC/DEC and for electrolytes {[}solvent + lithium
   salt] LiX (X = LiPF6, LiTFSI, or LiFAP) as a function of the temperature
   and salt concentration. To understand the parameters that influence the
   structure of the solvents and their ability to dissolve CO2, through the
   addition of a salt, we first analyzed the viscosities of EC/DMC + LiX
   mixtures by means of a modified Jones Dole equation. The results were
   discussed considering the order or disorder introduced by the salt into
   the solvent organization and ion solvation sphere by calculating the
   effective solute ion radius, r(s). On the basis of these results, the
   analysis of the CO2 solubility variations with the salt addition was
   then evaluated and discussed by determining specific ion parameters H-i
   by using the Setchenov coefficients in solution. This study showed that
   the CO2 solubility has been affected by the shape, charge density, and
   size of the ions, which influence the structuring of the solvents
   through the addition of a salt and the type of solvation of the ions.}},

Abstract = {{A mean-squared-error-based forward selection methodology is proposed for

   r(CCW) {[}Eghtesadi, Z.; Wu, S.; McAuley, K. B. hid. Eng. Chem. Res,
   2013, 52, 12297]. This new technique employs information in the
   available data set and the operating region of interest to determine the
   best model with the lowest mean square prediction error. This technique
   involves relatively simple computations and avoids overfitting of noisy
   data. This new approach is valuable when data available for parameter
   estimation arise from correlated experimental designs that make accurate
   estimation of all the parameters difficult. It is particularly
   beneficial when the predictions are desired in an operating region that
   is different from where the data are already available. Monte Carlo
   simulations of a linear regression example and a nonlinear case study
   are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method,
   demonstrating that results from simulated data agree with theoretical
   results.}},

Title = {{Decoupled luminance decay and voltage drift in polymer light-emitting
   electrochemical cells: Forward bias vs. reverse bias operation}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Sandwich polymer light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) with low
   electrolyte loading have been investigated. The LECs can be turned on to
   emit light at low voltages by applying either a forward- or reverse-bias
   current. The reverse operation, however, displays significantly higher
   luminance, frozen-junction behavior, and voltage instability. Moreover,
   the LECs display de-coupled luminance decay and voltage drift. Under
   forward-current operation, the luminance decreases for most of the test
   duration, while the operating voltage remains nearly unchanged. Under
   reverse-current operation, the luminance remains constant for over 200 h
   while the operating voltage more than doubles. The highly asymmetric
   device characteristics between forward and reverse operation can be
   explained by the different doping profiles created when the initial
   charge injection barriers are different. Under forward-current
   operation, the LEC film is predominantly p-doped. This leads to heavy
   luminescence quenching but a stable operating voltage. Under reverse
   operation, a predominately n-doped film is responsible for the higher
   luminance, frozen-junction behavior, and voltage drift. The anomalous
   device characteristics offer additional insights into the complex
   operating mechanism of LECs and the behaviours of a doped luminescent
   polymer. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{CO and C3H6 oxidation have been carried out in the absence and presence
   of water over a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. It is clear that water promotes CO
   and, as a consequence, C3H6 oxidation takes place at much lower
   temperatures compared with the dry feed. The significant increase in the
   catalyst's activity with respect to CO oxidation is not simply
   associated with changes in surface concentration as a result of
   competitive adsorption effects. Utilising O-18(2) as the reactant allows
   the pathways whereby the oxidation due to gaseous dioxygen and where the
   water activates the CO and C3H6 to be distinguished. In the presence of
   water, the predominant pathway is via water activation with (CO2)-O-16
   and (COO)-O-16-O-18 being the major species formed and oxidation with
   dioxygen plays a secondary role. The importance of water activation is
   further supported by the significant decrease in its effect when using
   D2O versus H2O. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The ability of a gold palladium bimetallic catalyst to selectively
   oxidise toluene has been used to enhance the hydrocarbon selective
   catalytic reduction of NOx, a reaction in which the interaction of
   partial oxidation intermediates is considered important. The combination
   of gold with palladium has a synergistic effect, producing a catalyst
   that is more active for NOx conversion than the arithmetic sum of the
   corresponding mono-metallic materials. Three regimes in the conversion
   profile of the AuPd catalyst are proposed relating to production and
   consumption of toluene derived species, such as benzaldehyde and
   benzonitrile. The possible role of these reaction intermediates in the
   toluene HC-SCR reaction is examined. Using (NO)-N-15, the formation of
   N-2 and N2O is observed via the direct interaction between the nitrogen
   atom of benzonitrile and (NO)-N-15. The higher activity of the
   bimetallic catalyst for the NOx reduction reaction by toluene is
   discussed in the context of these partial oxidation intermediates. (C)

Abstract = {{In the last decade, mobile phones and mobile devices using mobile
   cellular telecommunication network connections have become ubiquitous.
   In several developed countries, the penetration of such devices has
   surpassed 100 percent. They facilitate communication and access to large
   quantities of data without the requirement of a fixed location or
   connection. Assuming mobile phones usually are in close proximity with
   the user, their cellular activities and locations are indicative of the
   user's activities and movements. As such, those cellular devices may be
   considered as a large scale distributed human activity sensing platform.
   This paper uses mobile operator telephony data to visualize the regional
   flows of people across the Republic of Ireland. In addition, the use of
   modified Markov chains for the ranking of significant regions of
   interest to mobile subscribers is investigated. Methodology is then
   presented which demonstrates how the ranking of significant regions of
   interest may be used to estimate national population, results of which
   are found to have strong correlation with census data.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonally averaged wind stress of the Great Australian Bight (GAB)
   during the austral winter is directed to the east along the shelf and
   results in downwelling that extends to depths of 250 m. This downwelling
   is enhanced in the eastern GAB through the outflow of cold saline water
   formed in the broad shallow regions of the GAB and gulfs. During the
   austral summer, the averaged wind stress field of the GAB is
   anticyclonic with upwelling favorable winds along much of the coastline.
   In general however, significant slope upwelling is only observed in the
   eastern and western GAB where the shelf is narrow. Upwelling there
   provides nutrients to support the planktic and pelagic communities and
   the observed distribution of benthic invertebrate communities that lead
   to the formation of neritic carbonate sediments. At the shelf break of
   the central GAB where the shelf is very wide, the observed cross-shelf
   distributions of temperature, salinity, and sediments indicate that
   downwelling occurs year round. The implied lack of nutrients is argued
   to explain the smaller communities of invertebrates found at the shelf
   edge (100-250 m) in these areas. A previous numerical study is cited to
   show that summer downwelling very likely results from a convergence of
   the deep ocean and poleward Sverdrup transports. The unique aspect of
   this integrated oceanographic-sedimentological investigation is to tie
   outcomes of that numerical study with extant observations and benthic
   habitat to provide a consistent picture of how cross-shelf exchange
   regulates water properties and benthos in the GAB.

Title = {{Unravelling the migration decision-making process: English early
   retirees moving to rural mid-Wales}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{161-171}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{There are established migrant reasons to explain rural in-migration.
   These include quality of life, rural idyll and lifestyle motivations.
   However, such one-dimensional sound bites portray rural in-migration in
   overly simplistic and stereotypical terms. In contrast, this paper
   distinguishes the decision to move from the reason for moving and in
   doing so sheds new light on the interconnections between different
   domains (family, work, finance, health) of the migrant's life which
   contribute to migration behaviour. Focussing on early retirees to
   mid-Wales and adopting a life course perspective the overall decision to
   move is disaggregated into a series of decisions. Giving voices to the
   migrants themselves demonstrates the combination of life events
   necessary to lead to migration behaviour, the variable factors (and
   often economic dominance) considered in the choice of destination
   (including that many are reluctant migrants to Wales), and the perceived
   `accidental' choice of location and/or property. It is argued that
   quality of life, rural idyll and lifestyle sound bites offer an
   inadequate understanding of rural in-migration and associated
   decision-making processes. Moreover, they disguise the true nature of
   migrant decision making. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a biogeography-based optimization (BBO) method
   augmented with a Kalman filter, which is called KFBBO, for PID parameter
   tuning in a wireless networked learning control system (WNLCS). Because
   of unreliable transmission of data and commands in wireless networks,
   the control system is noisy and prone to errors, which results in poor
   performance by the conventional PID method for wireless networked
   control in real-world applications. BBO as a new evolutionary
   optimization is proposed to solve this problem by dynamically optimizing
   the PID control parameters. Because the wireless network environment is
   noisy, we also use a Kalman filter to counteract the negative effects of
   noise and to improve the optimization ability of BBO. Simulation
   experiments are conducted to evaluate our proposed KFBBO, and the
   results indicate that the control performance obtained by the improved
   PID method is better than the conventional PID method. Furthermore, this
   proposed method is applied to a steam turbine power generation system
   based on a WNLCS, and the results show its feasibility and

Title = {{A new dual-plate slipometer for measuring slip between molten polymers
   and extrusion die materials}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we study the slip behaviors common to plastics die
   extrusion metals or platings using a new instrument called a dual-plate
   slipometer. By dual-plate, we mean that whereas the stationary plate
   incorporates a local shear stress transducer, the moving plate does not.
   The stationary plate and transducer are made of one stainless steel, but
   the moving plate is made from, or plated with, different extrusion die
   materials under study. This new instrument allows slip velocity to be
   measured without having to build a new shear stress transducer from each
   extrusion metal or plating under study. We explore the effect of
   extrusion die composition and die metal surface morphology on the slip
   properties of polyolefins using a sliding plate rheometer. In this work,
   we studied the slip behaviors of polyolefins on four common plastics die
   extrusion metals or platings, without having to build a new shear stress
   transducer from each. Specifically, our new method replaces the moving
   plate; with each of the four die metals or platings under study without
   changing the stainless steel material of the shear stress transducer and
   its stationary plate. Our experiments include high-density polyethylene,
   low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene (PP) on four different die
   metals or platings. We use steady simple shear to obtain shear stress
   versus nominal shear rate for different gaps, from which we can then
   deduce the slip velocity using the Mooney analysis. We then fit four
   slip models to our experimental measurements, and we find the
   Hatzikiriakos hyperbolic sine model to be accurate, even for the
   measured inflections in the slip velocity as a function of shear stress
   curves. Our analysis includes detailed characterization of the die metal
   plating surfaces, including measurements of the composition of the
   sliding plates by energy dispersive spectroscopy, surface energy by
   contact angle goniometry, and surface roughness by both white light
   interference and stylus profilometries. We use our slip measurements to
   evaluate the Allal-Vergnes equation for the critical shear stress for
   slip {[}A. Allal and B. Vergnes, ``Effect of die surface on the onset of
   stick-slip transition in the flow of molten linear polymers,{''}
   J.Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 167-168, 46-49 (2012)]. We conclude our
   analysis by dedimensionalizing slip, and we then use these dimensionless
   groups to analyze slip. This paper provides a set of reference data for
   extrusion die designers for polyolefins. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a cooperation scenario between primary users and untrusted
   secondary users in cognitive radio networks. The secondary users are
   willing to help the primary users to relay the primary users' messages
   in reward for being allowed to share the primary users' spectrum bands.
   However, the primary users might be reluctant to accept this help, since
   the secondary users are untrustworthy and may try unauthorized decoding
   of the primary users' messages. This paper will answer the question:
   when is this cooperation mutually beneficial for primary and secondary
   users? Taking an approach of information-theoretic secrecy, such as
   coding techniques for wiretap channels, the primary users can allow the
   secondary users to sense and relay the message, while ensuring that the
   secondary users are ignorant of the primary users' messages. We
   characterize an achievable secrecy rate of primary users with a rate of
   the secondary users' communication. From the derived rate pairs, an
   optimization problem is formulated such that the secondary transmitter
   distributes its transmit power to maximize its data rate while providing
   a higher secrecy rate to the primary users. We demonstrate that this
   cooperation can provide a positive secrecy rate, even when a
   non-cooperative scheme achieves a zero secrecy rate.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a model based on partial least squares (PLS)
   regression for dynamic line rating (DLR). The model has been verified
   using data from field measurements, lab tests and outdoor experiments.
   Outdoor experimentation has been conducted both to verify the model
   predicted DLR and also to provide training data not available from field
   measurements, mainly heavily loaded conditions. The proposed model,
   unlike the direct measurement based DLR techniques, enables prediction
   of line rating for periods ahead of time whenever a reliable weather
   forecast is available. The PLS approach yields a very simple statistical
   model that accurately captures the physical performance of the conductor
   within a given environment without requiring a predetermination of
   parameters as required by many physical modelling techniques. Accuracy
   of the PLS model has been tested by predicting the conductor temperature
   for measurement sets other than those used for training. Being a linear
   model, it is straightforward to estimate the conductor ampacity for a
   set of predicted weather parameters. The PLS estimated ampacity has
   proven its accuracy through an outdoor experiment on a piece of the line
   conductor in real weather conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, density functional theory calculations have been performed
   to study the geometric, electronic, and energetic properties of
   two-phase TiO2 composites built by joining two single-phase TiO2 slabs,
   aiming at verifying possible improvement of the photo-activities of the
   composites through phase separation of excitons. We find that such
   desired electronic properties can be determined by several factors. When
   both the HOMO and LUMO levels of one of the two single-phase TiO2 slabs
   are higher than the corresponding ones of the other, the composite may
   have native electronic structures with phase-separated HOMO-LUMO states,
   especially when the two slabs exhibit highly matched surface lattices.
   For those pairs of TiO2 slabs with the HOMO and LUMO levels of one phase
   being within the range of those of the other, though the energetically
   favored composite give HOMO-LUMO states within one phase, one may still
   be able to separate them and move the HOMO state to the interface region
   by destabilizing the interactions between the two slabs.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a framework for modelling the Milky Way using stellar streams
   and a wide range of photometric and kinematic observations. Through the
   use of mock data we demonstrate that a standard suite of Galactic
   observations leads to degeneracies in the inferred halo parameters. We
   then incorporate a GD-1-like stream into this suite using the
   orbit-fitting technique and show that the streams reduce the
   uncertainties in these parameters provided all observations are fit
   simultaneously. We also explore how the assumption of a disc-halo
   alignment can lead unphysical models. Our results may explain why some
   studies based on the Sagittarius stream find that the halo's
   intermediate axis is parallel to the disc spin axis even though such a
   configuration is highly unstable. Finally we show that both longer
   streams and multiple streams lead to improvements in our ability to
   infer the shape of our dark halo.}},

Abstract = {{Thiol-modified nanoparticles have potential applications in
   mucoaclhesive drug delivery and have been examined in this regard for
   topical ocular delivery. In this paper we provide a simple method for
   the synthesis of a dithiol terminated amphiphilic diblock copolymer.
   Bidentate dithiolpoly(ethylene glycol)-poly(D,L-lactide) (SH2-PEG-PDLLA)
   was synthesized and micelles with dithiol-containing coronas were
   prepared from this block copolymer via the emulsion method. In vitro
   release studies indicated that the presence of the thiol groups at the
   surface did not affect the rate of release of dexamethasone, used as a
   representative ocular drug. The micelles also showed low cytotoxicity to
   human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) and murine fibroblast cells (3T3
   cells). A hydrophobic red fluorophore, Nile red, was loaded into the
   core of micelles and confocal microscopy was used to study HCEC uptake
   and retention of the micelles. The micelles were rapidly endocytosed by
   the HCEC, with intracellular micelle levels remaining unchanged with
   incubation times from 5 to 120 min. Interestingly, Nile red was
   eliminated significantly more slowly from HCECs treated with the
   thiolated micelles. These results suggest that these dithiolated
   micelles may be effective for topical ocular drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of mortality
   worldwide and is associated with irreversible cardiomyocyte death and
   pathological remodeling of cardiac tissue. In the past 15 years, several
   animal models have been developed for pre-clinical testing to assess the
   potential of stem cells for functional tissue regeneration and the
   attenuation of left ventricular remodeling. The promising results
   obtained in terms of improved cardiac function, neo-angiogenesis and
   reduction in infarct size have motivated the initiation of clinical
   trials in humans. Despite the potential, the results of these studies
   have highlighted that the effective delivery and retention of viable
   cells within the heart remain significant challenges that have limited
   the therapeutic efficacy of cell-based therapies for treating the
   ischemic myocardium. In this review, we discuss key elements for
   designing clinically translatable cell delivery approaches to promote
   myocardial regeneration. Key topics addressed include cell selection,
   with a focus on mesenchymal stem cells derived from the bone marrow
   (bMSCs) and adipose tissue (ASCs), including a discussion of their
   potential mechanisms of action. Natural and synthetic biomaterials that
   have been investigated as injectable cell delivery vehicles for cardiac
   applications are critically reviewed, including an analysis of the role
   of the biomaterials themselves in the therapeutic scheme. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The degradation of three high density polyethylene geomembranes (GMBs)
   (denoted xA, xB and xC) when immersed in simulated landfill leachate at
   85 C is examined. All three GMBs met the requirements of the generic
   industry specification GRI-GM13 with respect to their performance
   properties. The large high-pressure oxidative induction time (HP-01T)
   (i.e., 790 min for xB and 960 min for xC) combined with the relatively
   high level of trace nitrogen detected, suggest the presence of hindered
   amine light stabilizers (HALS) as part of the antioxidant package in
   these GMBs, whereas, the relatively low initial HPOils (i.e., 260 min)
   and the low level of trace nitrogen for xA, suggest the absence of HALS
   in xA. Although xA had the lowest initial standard Std-OIT (Std-OIT was
   115, 158 and 175 min for xA, xB and xC, respectively) it exhibited the
   longest time to antioxidant depletion based on Std-OIT. For the three
   GMBs, the HP-OIT depleted following exponential decay model until
   reaching a residual value. xB had the slowest HP-OIT depletion (0.016
   month(-1)) and was still depleting without reaching a residual value at
   the end of this study (after 46 months). xA experienced the fastest
   HP-OIT depletion (similar to 62 times faster than of xB) and reached a
   residual value of 78 min. For xC, HP-OIT depleted 40 times faster than
   for xB reaching a residual value (similar to 610 mm) that was still
   higher than the HP-OIT of 400 min specified by GRIGM13 for a new GMB. xB
   had the longest time to nominal failure despite having the lowest
   initial SCR value (330 h for xB compared to 910 and 800 h for xA and xC,
   respectively) and not having the highest OlTs values. Although xC had a
   residual HP-OIT of 610 min, the SCR, melt index (MI) and tensile
   properties for xC had decreased to the point that xC was at nominal
   failure, indicating that the degradation can take place without the
   total depletion of antioxidants/stabilizers captured by the HP-01T. (C)

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to develop a new generation of extruder control
   system for recycled materials which has ability to automatically
   maintain constant a polymer melt viscosity of mixed recycled polymers
   during extrusion, regardless of variations in the Melt Flow Index (MFI)
   of recycled mixed grade high density polyethylene (HOPE) feedstock. The
   variations in MFI are due to differences in the source of the recycled
   material used. The work describes how melt viscosity for specific
   extruder/die system is calculated in real time using the theological
   properties of the materials, the pressure drop through the extruder die
   and the actual throughput measurements using a gravimetric
   loss-in-weight hopper feeder. A closed-loop controller is also developed
   to automatically regulate screw speed and barrel temperature profile to
   achieve constant viscosity and enable consistent processing of variable
   grade recycled HDPE materials. Such a system will improve processability
   of mixed MFI polymers may also reduce the risk of polymer melt
   degradation, reduce producing large volumes of scrap/waste and lead to
   improvement in product quality. The experimental results of real time
   viscosity measurement and control using a 38 mm single screw extruder
   with different recycled HDPEs with widely different MFIs are reported in
   this work. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many graph datasets are labelled with discrete and numeric attributes.
   Most frequent substructure discovery algorithms ignore numeric
   attributes; in this paper we show how they can be used to improve search
   performance and discrimination. Our thesis is that the most descriptive
   substructures are those which are normative both in terms of their
   structure and in terms of their numeric values. We explore the
   relationship between graph structure and the distribution of attribute
   values and propose an outlier-detection step, which is used as a
   constraint during substructure discovery. By pruning anomalous vertices
   and edges, more weight is given to the most descriptive substructures.
   Our method is applicable to multi-dimensional numeric attributes; we
   outline how it can be extended for high-dimensional data. We support our
   findings with experiments on transaction graphs and single large graphs
   from the domains of physical building security and digital forensics,
   measuring the effect on runtime, memory requirements and coverage of
   discovered patterns, relative to the unconstrained approach.}},

   Number of Simultaneous Active Users Using the Burst Error Loss Rate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The technical superiority of spectral-amplitude coding optical
   code-division multiple-access (SAC-OCDMA) systems over traditional
   wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems in optical burst switched
   (OBS) networks is mainly attributed to the former's better medium access
   control (MAC) layer performance. Nevertheless, in order to conduct an
   accurate comparison, a thorough study of the physical layer performance
   should be involved, especially because in many cases the physical layer
   noise would affect the maximum achievable number of simultaneously
   active users. Hence, in this work, we develop a novel assessment
   approach that combines both MAC and physical layer capabilities by
   introducing a new burst error loss rate parameter. In particular, the
   approach targets cases with limitations on the number of simultaneous
   active users. Next, as an example of a noisy physical layer, the effect
   of phase-induced intensity noise on the number of active users in
   OBS/SAC-OCDMA systems is analyzed. Our analysis shows that this effect
   introduces a burst error rate (BurstER) in the multiple-access
   interference cancellation operation (not investigated before). This
   BurstER is an increasing function of the number of active users and
   hence would suppress the system MAC layer performance. Finally, assuming
   an ideal WDM physical layer, we employ the developed approach to present
   an illustrative performance comparison between OBS/SAC-OCDMA and OBS/WDM
   systems. The results show that OBS/SAC-OCDMA performance outperforms
   that of OBS/WDM when the number of tolerated bits in error per burst
   exceeds a certain value.}},

Abstract = {{The change of friction force on both sides of the pitch plane and the
   change of contact stiffness induced by tooth spalling defect cause the
   change of the dynamic characteristics of helical gears. However, there
   is no good solution for the modeling and calculation of the internal
   excitation in helical gears with spalling defect to reveal the change of
   the dynamic characteristics. In this study, the calculation methods of
   friction excitations and contact stiffness are proposed based on the
   time-varying length of contact line in helical gears. By considering the
   change of the mesh position and the loss of length of contact line
   induced by tooth spalling defect, the time-varying friction force is
   obtained by subtracting the length of spalling defect at the mesh
   position from the length of the normal contact line, and the
   time-varying contact stiffness is obtained by Hertz contact algorithm. A
   six-degree-of-freedom analytical helical gear pair model is developed by
   incorporating the time-varying sliding friction and mesh stiffness based
   on the changes of friction force and mesh stiffness. Dynamic
   characteristics are simulated via helical gear pair examples with
   spalling defects. The results show that the oscillations of the dynamic
   responses become more significant at both the beginning and the end of
   the spalling area, especially with the growth of the spalling size. The
   developed analytical model provides a new method for the study of
   excitation characteristics in helical gears with tooth spalling defect.

Abstract = {{The composite microstructure of two-phase (alpha/omega) shocked
   zirconium was studied in situ during heating (constant heating rate and
   isothermally) with high-energy X-ray diffraction techniques. The volume
   fraction of the metastable omega phase was monitored as the reverse
   phase transformation occurred: the start and finish temperatures being
   470 and 550 K, respectively, during heating at 3 K min(-1). Moreover,
   isothermal transformation was observed when the shocked material was
   held at fixed temperatures from 420 to 525 K. Phase strains in each
   phase were monitored and separated in terms of thermal expansion and
   mechanical strains due to local phase constraints. Stresses in the alpha
   Zr were estimated to be a superposition of a hydrostatic component (of
   order -50 MPa) and uniaxial component (of order 600 MPa) along the
   c-axis. These stresses were relaxed during the reverse transformation. A
   high dislocation density was observed in both the a and omega phases in
   the as-shocked state. The dislocation density of the omega phase
   decreased preceding the reverse transformation, suggesting that it is
   the presence of the high concentration of defects in the omega phase
   which retarded the reverse transformation to the stable a phase and
   prevented the system from approaching equilibrium after the completion
   of the shock. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Basement rocks exposed in the Acatlan Complex of the Mixteca terrane in
   southern Mexico record two tectonothermal events: (1) a Devonian-
   Mississippian (ca. 365-318 Ma) event, recording extrusion and exhumation
   of high-pressure rocks; and (2) an Early to Middle Permian (ca. 289-263
   Ma) event, involving N-S dextral shearing, transtensional deformation,
   and local S-vergent thrusting in a magmatic arc environment. We document
   an additional, regionally significant, tectonothermal event during the
   Middle to Late Triassic recorded by Ar-40/Ar-39 step-heating laser-probe
   ages ranging from ca. 239 and 219 Ma (equivalent to cooling from ca. 525
   degrees C to 300 degrees C) for amphibole, muscovite, and biotite from:
   (1) the Carboniferous Amarillo unit, consisting of medium-grade,
   metasedimentary rocks intruded by mafic dikes; and (2) the
   Pennsylvanian-Middle Permian, low-grade, clastic-calcareous, arc-related
   Tecomate Formation. U-Pb laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass
   spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) data yield an age of 339 +/- 6 Ma for the
   youngest population of detrital zircon grains in the Amarillo unit.
   Lithogeochemical and Sm-Nd isotopic data for the Amarillo unit dikes are
   very similar to those of other Carboniferous meta-igneous rocks in the
   eastern and southwestern part of the Acatlan Complex, displaying
   affinities transitional between mid-ocean-ridge basalt (MORB) and
   continental tholeiites, and initial epsilon(Nd) (t = 339 Ma) values from
   -6.6 to +6.4, indicating both depleted and enriched mantle sources, as
   well as variable contamination by continental crust or by
   subduction-derived fluids. The Ar-40/Ar-39 cooling ages coincide with an
   apparent hiatus in magmatic activity in southern Mexico, which is
   inferred to record a change from steep to flat subduction.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to use a computational and experimental
   approach to evaluate, compare and predict the ability of calcium
   phosphate (CaP) and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) augmentation
   cements to restore mechanical stability to traumatically fractured
   vertebrae, following a vertebroplasty procedure. Traumatic fractures (n
   = 17) were generated in a series of porcine vertebrae using a
   drop-weight method. The fractured vertebrae were imaged using mu CT and
   tested under axial compression. Twelve of the fractured vertebrae were
   randomly selected to undergo a vertebroplasty procedure using either a
   PMMA (n = 6) or a CaP cement variation (n = 6). The specimens were
   imaged using mu CT and re-tested. Finite element models of the fractured
   and augmented vertebrae were generated from the mu CT data and used to
   compare the effect of fracture void fill with augmented specimen
   stiffness. Significant increases (p < 0.05) in failure load were found
   for both of the augmented specimen groups compared to the fractured
   group. The experimental and computational results indicated that neither
   the CaP cement nor PMMA cement could completely restore the vertebral
   mechanical behavior to the intact level. The effectiveness of the
   procedure appeared to be more influenced by the volume of fracture
   filled rather than by the mechanical properties of the cement itself.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1529-1535}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Our previous analytical solution gives sag advancing implicitly as
   Theta=12{[}arctan sigma-\{sigma/(sigma 2+1)\}], or for sigma <= 25, sag
   advances with the cube root of time for a thin wide rectangular
   Newtonian isothermal sheet. This previous analytical work applies to
   sheets that are pinned along just two edges, and not all the way around.
   Corresponding sagometer experimental results confirmed this cube root
   relation. This work compares the Theta=12{[}arctan sigma-\{sigma/(sigma
   2+1)\}] prediction with measured commercial thermoforming behavior on
   rectangular sheets that are, of course, pinned all the way around. Then
   sag parallel superposition is used to extend Theta=12{[}arctan
   sigma-\{sigma/(sigma 2+1)\}] for a sheet pinned all the way around. We
   evaluate sag parallel superposition using a finite element method (FEM)
   employing ANSYS Polyflow.
   The equation Theta=12{[}arctan sigma-\{sigma/(sigma 2+1)\}] assumes
   sagging sheet cylindricity, and from our FEM we find that this
   assumption is reliable when sigma <= 32. We compare sag measured in
   commercial thermoforming, using high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) sheets
   that are pinned all the way around, by extending Theta=12{[}arctan
   sigma-\{sigma/(sigma 2+1)\}] with parallel superposition. It is found
   that the time evolution of the commercial sag follows nearly exactly the
   same shape as the isothermal prediction. We measure sag runaway, and
   although the isothermal analysis Theta=12{[}arctan sigma-\{sigma/(sigma
   2+1)\}], predicts the sag runaway time accurately, our isothermal theory
   overpredicts the amount of sag in the nonisothermal commercial operation
   by as much as a factor of 14. It is also shown how to use sheet sag
   measurements from commercial thermoforming to deduce the Newtonian
   viscosity of a thermoforming resin at a temperature that is above its
   softening point.

Abstract = {{One of the major challenges in regenerative medicine is the ability to
   recreate the stem cell niche, which is defined by its signaling
   molecules, the creation of cytokine gradients, and the modulation of
   matrix stiffness. A wide range of scaffolds has been developed in order
   to recapitulate the stem cell niche, among them hydrogels. This paper
   reports the development of a new silk-alginate based hydrogel with a
   focus on stem cell culture. This biocomposite allows to fine tune its
   elasticity during cell culture, addressing the importance of
   mechanotransduction during stem cell differentiation. The silk alginate
   scaffold promotes adherence of mouse embryonic stem cells and cell
   survival upon transplantation. In addition, it has tunable stiffness as
   function of the silk alginate ratio and the concentration of crosslinker

Abstract = {{Sandwich panels composed of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) skins
   and low-density polyurethane core are investigated for potential
   structural applications such as lightweight insulated roofing or
   cladding systems. Ten 1,220x318x78-mm panels, including three control
   specimens, were tested under high-cycle fatigue at maximum load levels
   of 45-70\% of the ultimate static load. Fatigue tests were carried out
   to failure, thereby enabling the development of the complete fatigue
   life (S-N) curve and stiffness degradation. Digital imaging correlation
   was used to map shear deformations and showed that shear contributes
   about 90\% of the deflection. Both static and fatigue failure modes were
   due to core shear failure. The study showed that fatigue threshold was
   37\% of the ultimate static capacity, and that to sustain at least 2
   million cycles, service load should be limited to 45\% of ultimate. The
   maximum design service live and snow loads, as well as wind load based
   on the most critical conditions in Canada, were all below the fatigue
   threshold of the panel. The panels had a strength safety factor of 2.1
   relative to the factored maximum design live and snow load, and 6.5
   relative to the factored maximum wind load. Deflection limits may govern
   for some service load conditions, but is not critical when only wind
   load considered. Stiffness degradation reached a maximum of 15-20\%, but
   residual deflections upon unloading were insignificant.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{183-188}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A fundamental study on the effective conductivity in random porous media
   is presented in this paper. Porous media are distinguished based on the
   convexity of the insulating porous phase: microstructures with convex
   porosity are representative of foams and sponges, while non-convex
   porosity includes granular and particulate materials. This distinction
   allows us to identify two limit cases within which the effective
   conductivity of an isotropic porous medium lies. The effective
   conductivity is evaluated through a random walk method, applied on
   structures numerically reconstructed with packing algorithms which use
   spheres to represent convex elements. Simulation results are compared
   with theoretical relations and experimental data in a range of 0-40\% in
   porosity, wherein the solid phase is entirely connected and not
   suspended in the porous phase.
   This study shows that, given the porosity, structures with convex
   porosity are more conducting than structures with non-convex pores,
   because the bottlenecks for conduction are narrower in the second case.
   These situations identify two limit cases for the effective conductivity
   in a random isotropic porous medium, as confirmed by experimental data
   of structures with partly convex and partly non-convex porosity. In
   addition, for convex porosity the effective conductivity is larger when
   pores are isolated, attaining the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bound, while
   when pores are overlapped the effective conductivity is well described
   by the Archie power law. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{480-486}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Titanium has good biocompatibility and so its alloys are used as implant
   materials, but they suffer from having poor wear resistance. This
   research aims to improve the wear resistance and the tensile strength of
   titanium alloys potentially for implant applications. Titanium alloys
   Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-7Nb were subjected to shotpeening process to study
   the wear and tensile behavior. An improvement in the wear resistance has
   been achieved due to surface hardening of these alloys by the process of
   shotpeening. Surface microhardness of shotpeened Ti-6Al-4V and
   Ti-6Al-7Nb alloys has increased by 113 and 58 HV(0.5), respectively.
   After shotpeening, ultimate tensile strength of Ti-6Al-4V increased from
   1000 MPa to 1150 MPa, higher than improvement obtained for heat treated
   titanium specimens. The results confirm that shotpeening pre-treatment
   improved tensile and sliding wear behavior of Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al7Nb
   alloys. In addition, shotpeening increased surface roughness. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, a newly proposed machining method named ``surface defect
   machining{''} (SDM) was explored for machining of nanocrystalline beta
   silicon carbide (3C-SiC) at 300K using MD simulation. The results were
   compared with isothermal high temperature machining at 1200 K under the
   same machining parameters, emulating ductile mode micro laser assisted
   machining (l-LAM) and with conventional cutting at 300 K. In the SDM
   simulation, surface defects were generated on the top of the (010)
   surface of the 3C-SiC work piece prior to cutting, and the workpiece was
   then cut along the < 100 > direction using a single point diamond
   cutting tool at a cutting speed of 10 m/s. Cutting forces, subsurface
   deformation layer depth, temperature in the shear zone, shear plane
   angle and friction coefficient were used to characterize the response of
   the workpiece. Simulation results showed that SDM provides a unique
   advantage of decreased shear plane angle which eases the shearing
   action. This in turn causes an increased value of average coefficient of
   friction in contrast to the isothermal cutting (carried at 1200 K) and
   normal cutting (carried at 300 K). The increase of friction coefficient,
   however, was found to aid the cutting action of the tool due to an
   intermittent dropping in the cutting forces, lowering stresses on the
   cutting tool and reduced operational temperature. Analysis shows that
   the introduction of surface defects prior to conventional machining can
   be a viable choice for machining a wide range of ceramics, hard steels
   and composites compared to hot machining.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the problem of sending a Gaussian source over a Rayleigh

   between the source and the channel, we show that among all single-letter

   distortion under full correlation between source and interference, and
   hence it is optimal. To benefit from nonlinear strategies for other
   scenarios, we derive the necessary conditions for optimality and propose
   an iterative algorithm based on joint optimization between the encoder
   and the decoder. A reduced-complexity approach for the implementation of
   the design algorithm is presented based on Monte-Carlo (at the encoder
   side) and importance sampling (at the decoder side) techniques.
   Furthermore, the scalability of our low-latency scheme is improved by
   modifying the search process at the encoder side using a targeted search

Abstract = {{A new driving method for synchronous rectifier (SR) in LLC resonant

   issue caused by the trace inductance of the MOSFET package. Only three
   passive components are needed in the proposed filter, which makes it
   reliable and easy to implement. Simulation and experimental results show
   that the ZCNF can significantly improve the reliability as well as the
   efficiency of the power circuit. A prototype of 400 V to 12 V 600-W

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a low-complexity dual-voltage-loop digital control
   architecture is presented for voltage regulators (VRs), delivering power
   to processors. The proposed digital control architecture uses low speed
   and less complex digital-to-analog converters instead of high-speed
   analog-to-digital converters, thus significantly reducing the system
   complexity and cost. In this control architecture, there are two voltage
   loops, and the voltage reference is dynamically generated to selectively
   track one of them, as compared to other control methods where the output
   voltage tracks the voltage reference. Moreover, a straightforward
   control law is used, which does not require any compensator, making the
   proposed digital architecture simple and easy to implement. The
   dual-voltage-loop architecture breaks dependence between the system
   transient response and the system control bandwidth. One voltage loop is
   designed for the stable system operation, and the other is dedicated for
   the load transient response. Thus, the digital controller can be
   designed in such a way that the VR operates at a relatively low
   switching frequency to reduce power losses, and at the same time, it is
   also able to provide fast transient response. The proposed small signal
   model reveals that the inner current loop is analog and the voltage loop
   is digital. The proposed controller thus can benefit from both: having
   valuable features of digital control but without limitations such as
   limit cycle, which is eliminated by the inherent dithering
   characteristic. Theoretical, simulation and experimental results prove
   the effective operation and excellent dynamic performance of the
   low-complexity digital controller, thus making it a valuable candidate
   for a high-volume, low-cost digital controller for processors' VRs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the construction of linear-in-the-parameters
   (LITP) models for multi-output regression problems. Most existing
   stepwise forward algorithms choose the regressor terms one by one, each
   time maximizing the model error reduction ratio. The drawback is that
   such procedures cannot guarantee a sparse model, especially under highly
   noisy learning conditions. The main objective of this paper is to
   improve the sparsity and generalization capability of a model for
   multi-output regression problems, while reducing the computational
   complexity. This is achieved by proposing a novel multi-output two-stage
   locally regularized model construction (MTLRMC) method using the extreme
   learning machine (ELM). In this new algorithm, the nonlinear parameters
   in each term, such as the width of the Gaussian function and the power
   of a polynomial term, are firstly determined by the ELM. An initial
   multi-output LITP model is then generated according to the termination
   criteria in the first stage. The significance of each selected regressor
   is checked and the insignificant ones are replaced at the second stage.
   The proposed method can produce an optimized compact model by using the
   regularized parameters. Further, to reduce the computational complexity,
   a proper regression context is used to allow fast implementation of the
   proposed method. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the
   proposed technique. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Computational study of the rovibrational spectrum of CO2- CS2}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},

Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{A new intermolecular potential energy surface, rovibrational transition
   frequencies, and line strengths are computed for CO2- CS2. The potential
   is made by fitting energies obtained from explicitly correlated coupled-
   cluster calculations using an interpolating moving least squares method.
   The rovibrational Schrdinger equation is solved with a symmetry-adapted
   Lanczos algorithm and an uncoupled product basis set. All four
   intermolecular coordinates are included in the calculation. In agreement
   with previous experiments, the global minimum of the potential energy
   surface (PES) is cross shaped. The PES also has slipped- parallel
   minima. Rovibrational wavefunctions are localized in the cross minima
   and the slipped- parallel minima. Vibrational parent analysis was used
   to assign vibrational labels to rovibrational states. Tunneling occurs
   between the two cross minima. Because more than one symmetry operation
   interconverts the two wells, the symmetry (-oo) of the upper component
   of the tunneling doublet is different from the symmetry (-ee) of the
   tunneling coordinate. This unusual situation is due to the
   multidimensional nature of the double well tunneling. For the cross
   ground vibrational state, calculated rotational constants differ from
   their experimental counterparts by less than 0.0001 cm(-1). Most
   rovibrational states were found to be incompatible with the standard
   effective rotational Hamiltonian often used to fit spectra. This appears
   to be due to coupling between internal and overall rotation of the
   dimer. A simple 2D model accounting for internal rotation was used for
   two cross-shaped fundamentals to obtain good fits. (c) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{First principles calculations with molecular dynamics are utilized to
   simulate a simplified electrical double layer formed in the active
   electric potential region during the electrocatalytic oxidation of
   ethanol on Pd electrodes running in an alkaline electrolyte. Our
   simulations provide an atomic level insight into how ethanol oxidation
   occurs in fuel cells: New mechanisms in the presence of the simplified
   electrical double layer are found to be different from the traditional
   ones; through concerted-like dehydrogenation paths, both acetaldehyde
   and acetate are produced in such a way as to avoid a variety of
   intermediates, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained
   from in situ FTIR spectroscopy. Our work shows that adsorbed OH on the
   Pd electrode rather than Pd atoms is the active center for the
   reactions; the dissociation of the C-H bond is facilitated by the
   adsorption of an OH- anion on the surface, resulting in the formation of
   water. Our calculations demonstrate that water dissociation rather than
   H desorption is the main channel through which electrical current is
   generated on the Pd electrode. The effects of the inner Helmholtz layer
   and the outer Helmholtz layer are decoupled, with only the inner
   Helmholtz layer being found to have a significant impact on the
   mechanistics of the reaction. Our results provide atomic level insight
   into the significance of the simplified electrical double layer in
   electrocatalysis, which may be of general importance.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, we present a facile method for the formation of monodispersed
   metal nanoparticles (NPs) at room temperature from (MCl3)-Cl-(III) (with
   M = Au, Ru, Mn, Fe or V) in different media based on
   N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or water solutions containing a protic ionic
   liquid (PIL), namely the octylammonium formate (denoted OAF) or the
   bis(2-ethyl-hexyl)ammonium formate (denoted BEHAF). These two PILs
   present different structures and redox-active structuring properties
   that influence their interactions with selected molecular compounds (DMF
   or water), as well as the shape and the size of formed metal NPs in
   these solutions. Herein, the physical properties, such as the thermal,
   transport and micellar properties, of investigated PIL solutions were
   firstly investigated in order to understand the relation between PILs
   structure and their properties in solutions with DMF or water. The
   formation of metal NPs in these solutions was then characterized by
   using UV-vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   measurements. From our investigations, it appears that the PILs
   structure and their aggregation pathways in selected solvents affect
   strongly the formation, growths, the shape and the size of metal NPs. In
   fact by using this approach, the shape-/size-controlled metal NPs can be
   generated under mild condition. This approach suggests also a wealth of
   potential for these designer nanomaterials within the biomedical,
   materials, and catalysis communities by using designer and safer media
   based on PILs. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{242}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to investigate the mechanism of nanoscale
   fatigue using nano-impact and multiple-loading cycle nanoindentation
   tests, and compare it to previously reported findings of nanoscale
   fatigue using integrated stiffness and depth sensing approach. Two
   different film loading mechanisms, loading history and indenter shapes
   are compared to comprehend the influence of test methodology on the
   nanoscale fatigue failure mechanisms of a DLC film. An amorphous 100 nm
   thick DLC film was deposited on a 500 mu m silicon substrate using
   sputtering of graphite target in pure argon atmosphere. Nano-impact and
   multiple-load cycle indentations were performed in the load range of 100
   mu N to 1000 mu N and 0.1 mN to 100 mN, respectively. Both test types
   were conducted using conical and Berkovich indenters. Results indicate
   that for the case of a conical indenter, the combination of nano-impact
   and multiple-loading cycle nanoindentation tests provides information on
   the life and failure mechanism of the DLC film, which is comparable to
   the previously reported findings using the integrated stiffness and
   depth sensing approach. However, the comparison of results is sensitive
   to the applied load, loading mechanism, test-type and probe geometry.
   The loading mechanism and load history are therefore critical which also
   lead to two different definitions of film failure. The choice of exact
   test methodology, load and probe geometry should therefore be dictated
   by the in-service tribological conditions, and where necessary both test
   methodologies can be used to provide better insights of failure
   mechanism. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the elastic response
   of nanoindentation are reported, which indicate that the elastic modulus
   of the film measured using MD simulation was higher than that
   experimentally measured. This difference is attributed to the factors
   related to the presence of material defects, crystal structure, residual
   stress, indenter geometry and loading/unloading rate differences between
   the MD and experimental results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In the current investigation, TEM in-situ heavy ion (1 MeV Kr2+)
   irradiation with helium pre-injected at elevated temperature (400
   degrees C) was conducted to simulate in-reactor neutron irradiation
   induced damage in CANDU spacer material Inconel X-750, in an effort to
   understand the effects of helium on irradiation induced cavity
   microstructures. Three different quantities of helium, 400 appm, 1000
   appm, and 5000 appm, were pre-injected directly into TEM foils at 400
   degrees C. The samples containing helium were then irradiated in-situ
   with 1 MeV Kr2+ at 400 degrees C to a final dose of 5.4 dpa
   (displacement per atom). Cavities were formed from the helium injection
   solely and the cavity density and size increased with increasing helium
   dosage. In contrast to previous heavy ion irradiations with cold
   pre-injected helium, heterogeneous nucleation of cavities was observed.
   During the ensuing heavy ion irradiation, dynamical observation showed
   noticeable size increase in cavities which nucleated close to the grain
   boundaries. A ``bubble-void{''} transformation was observed after Kr2+
   irradiation to high dose (5.4 dpa) in samples containing 1000 appm and
   5000 appm helium. Cavity distribution was found to be consistent with
   in-reactor neutron irradiation induced cavity microstructures. This
   implies that the distribution of helium is greatly dependent on the
   injection temperature, and helium pre-injection at high temperature is
   preferred for simulating the migration of the transmutation produced
   helium. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In order to understand radiation damage in the nickel based superalloy
   Inconel X-750 in thermal reactors, where (n, alpha) transmutation
   reaction also occurred in addition to fast neutron induced atomic
   displacement, heavy ion (1 MeV Kr2+) irradiation with pre-injected
   helium was performed under in-situ observations of an intermediate
   voltage electron microscope at Argonne National Laboratory. By comparing
   to our previous studies using 1 MeV Kr2+ irradiation solely, the
   pre-injected helium was found to be essential in cavity nucleation.
   Cavities started to be visible after Kr2+ irradiation to 2.7 dpa at >=
   200 degrees C in samples containing 200 appm, 1000 appm, and 5000 appm
   helium, respectively, but not at lower temperatures. The cavity growth
   was observed during the continuous irradiation. Cavity formation
   appeared along with a reduced number density of stacking fault
   tetrahedra, vacancy type defects. With higher pre-injected helium
   amount, a higher density of smaller cavities was observed. This is
   considered to be the result of local trapping effect of helium which
   disperses vacancies. The average cavity size increases with increasing
   irradiation temperatures; the density reduced; and the distribution of
   cavities became heterogeneous at elevated temperatures. In contrast to
   previous characterization of in-reactor neutron irradiated Inconel
   X-750, no obvious cavity sink to grain boundaries and phase boundaries
   was found even at high doses and elevated temperatures. MC-type carbides
   were observed as strong sources for agglomeration of cavities due to
   their enhanced trapping strength of helium and vacancies. (C) 2014 AIP

Title = {{Automated Detection and Measurement of Isolated Retinal Arterioles by a
   Combination of Edge Enhancement and Cost Analysis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Pressure myography studies have played a crucial role in our
   understanding of vascular physiology and pathophysiology. Such studies
   depend upon the reliable measurement of changes in the diameter of
   isolated vessel segments over time. Although several software packages
   are available to carry out such measurements on small arteries and
   veins, no such software exists to study smaller vessels (<50 mu m in
   diameter). We provide here a new, freely available open-source
   algorithm, MyoTracker, to measure and track changes in the diameter of
   small isolated retinal arterioles. The program has been developed as an
   ImageJ plug-in and uses a combination of cost analysis and edge
   enhancement to detect the vessel walls. In tests performed on a dataset
   of 102 images, automatic measurements were found to be comparable to
   those of manual ones. The program was also able to track both fast and
   slow constrictions and dilations during intraluminal pressure changes
   and following application of several drugs. Variability in automated
   measurements during analysis of videos and processing times were also
   investigated and are reported. MyoTracker is a new software to assist
   during pressure myography experiments on small isolated retinal
   arterioles. It provides fast and accurate measurements with low levels
   of noise and works with both individual images and videos. Although the
   program was developed to work with small arterioles, it is also capable
   of tracking the walls of other types of microvessels, including venules
   and capillaries. It also works well with larger arteries, and therefore
   may provide an alternative to other packages developed for larger
   vessels when its features are considered advantageous.}},

Abstract = {{Study of nanomechanical response of iron carbides is important because
   presence of iron carbides greatly influences the performance and
   longevity of steel components. This work contributes to the literature
   by exploring nanoindentation of Fe3C and tetrahedral-Fe4C using
   molecular dynamics simulation. The chemical interactions of iron and
   carbon were described through an analytical bond order inter-atomic
   potential (ABOP) energy function. The indentations were performed at an
   indentation speed of 50 m/s and a repeat trial was performed at 5 m/s.
   Load-displacement (P-h) curve for both these carbides showed residual
   indentation depth and maximum indentation depth (h(f)/h(max)) ratio to
   be higher than 0.7 i.e. a circumstance where Oliver and Pharr method was
   not appropriate to be applied to evaluate the material properties.
   Alternate evaluation revealed Fe3C to be much harder than Fe4C. Gibbs
   free energy of formation and radial distribution function, coupled with
   state of the average local temperature and von Mises stresses indicate
   the formation of a new phase of iron-carbide. Formation of this newer
   phase was found to be due to deviatoric strain rather than the high
   temperature induced in the substrate during nanoindentation. Crown

Abstract = {{Clean and renewable energy generation and supply has drawn much
   attention worldwide in recent years, the proton exchange membrane (PEM)
   fuel cells and solar cells are among the most popular technologies.
   Accurately modeling the PEM fuel cells as well as solar cells is
   critical in their applications, and this involves the identification and
   optimization of model parameters. This is however challenging due to the
   highly nonlinear and complex nature of the models. In particular for PEM
   fuel cells, the model has to be optimized under different operation
   conditions, thus making the solution space extremely complex. In this
   paper, an improved and simplified teaching-learning based optimization
   algorithm (STLBO) is proposed to identify and optimize parameters for
   these two types of cell models. This is achieved by introducing an elite
   strategy to improve the quality of population and a local search is
   employed to further enhance the performance of the global best solution.
   To improve the diversity of the local search a chaotic map is also
   introduced. Compared with the basic TLBO, the structure of the proposed
   algorithm is much simplified and the searching ability is significantly
   enhanced. The performance of the proposed STLBO is firstly tested and
   verified on two low dimension decomposable problems and twelve large
   scale benchmark functions, then on the parameter identification of PEM
   fuel cell as well as solar cell models. Intensive experimental
   simulations show that the proposed STLBO exhibits excellent performance
   in terms of the accuracy and speed, in comparison with those reported in
   the literature. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{An inverse CeO2/CuO catalyst has been investigated by operando
   steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) in combination
   with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy

   determining intermediates involved in the water gas shift reaction at
   relatively low temperatures. Among the various species detected in the
   infrared spectra which may be involved in the reaction, i.e. formates,
   copper carbonyls and carbonates, a particular type of carbonate species
   is identified as a reaction intermediate on the basis of detailed
   analysis of the spectra during isotopic exchange in comparison with the
   change in the corresponding isotopically labelled CO2 product. Copyright

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{186-207}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{Large-eddy simulations were carried out to study the effects of surface
   roughness on a plane wall-jet using the Lagrangian dynamic
   eddy-viscosity subgrid-scale model, at Re = 7500 (based on the jet bulk
   velocity and height). Results over both smooth and rough surfaces were
   validated by experimental data at the same Reynolds number. As the jet
   is injected into the still environment, large-scale rollers are
   generated in the shear layer between the high-momentum fluid of the jet
   and the surrounding and are convected downstream with the flow. To
   understand the extent to which the outer-layer structures modify the
   flow in the inner layer and the extent to which the effect of roughness
   spreads away from the wall, both instantaneous and mean flow fields were
   investigated. The results revealed that, for the Reynolds number and
   roughness height considered in this study, the effect of roughness is
   mostly confined to the near-wall region of the wall jet. There is no
   structural difference between the outer layer of the wall jet over the
   smooth and rough surfaces. Roughness does not affect the size of the
   outer-layer structures or the scaling of the profiles of Reynolds
   stresses in the outer layer. However, in the inner layer, roughness
   redistributes stresses from streamwise to wall-normal and spanwise
   directions toward isotropy. Contours of joint probability-density
   function of the streamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations at the
   bottom of the logarithmic region match those of the turbulent boundary
   layer at the same height; while the traces of the outer-layer structure
   were detected at the top of the logarithmic region, indicating that they
   do not affect the flow very close to the wall, but still modify a major
   portion of the inner layer. This modification must be taken into
   consideration when the inner layer of a wall jet is compared with the
   conventional turbulent boundary layer.}},

Title = {{Facies architecture and depositional model of a macrotidal
   incised-valley succession (Qiantang River estuary, eastern China), and
   differences from other macrotidal systems}},
Journal = {{GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Filling of the modern coastal-zone portion of the Qiantang River (QR) in
   eastern China was initiated by marine inundation during the
   transgression after the Last Glacial Maximum and has continued during
   the Holocene sea-level stillstand. The early part of the fill is
   transgressive in character, while the younger part is regressive. This
   paper deals with the sedimentary facies, surfaces, architecture, and
   depositional model of the QR incised-valley fill based on the detailed
   analysis of the newly drilled core SE2 and its correlation with more
   than 800 boreholes. The incised-valley deposits are grouped into five
   stacked facies: amalgamated channel, flood-plain and channel,
   paleo-estuary, offshore shallow marine, and present-day estuary. A
   paleo-estuary facies had never been identified before, making these
   observations novel. This facies is characterized by a sedimentary
   succession and sediment distribution that are distinct from those of the
   present-day estuary because of a change in sediment supply from the sea
   floor beyond the estuary mouth. It also contains large numbers of
   tidal-channel sand bodies that are significant reservoirs for shallow
   biogenic gas.
   Since the last glaciation, there have been three stages in the
   development of the QR incised-valley fill sequence: (1) a formation
   stage associated with sea-level fall, (2) a filling stage during the
   early transgression with rapid sea-level rise, and (3) a burial stage
   corresponding to the slowing of sea-level rise and the onset of
   progradation. This fill consists of four longitudinal segments, each of
   which is distinguished by a distinct stratigraphic succession and
   different degrees of marine and fluvial influence. The basal erosion
   surface and sidewalls of the incised valley, the top of stiff clay on
   the interfluves, and the top of falling-stage fluvial-terrace deposits
   compose the sequence boundary. The initial flooding surface and maximum
   flooding surface are located within the amalgamated channel and offshore
   shallow-marine sediments, respectively.
   These observations indicate that: (1) relative sea-level changes
   determine the stratal stacking patterns, but local environmental
   factors, such as physical processes, accommodation, sediment supply, and
   coastal configuration control the nature of the facies, surfaces, and
   sediment-distribution patterns; and (2) the tripartite facies
   organization and wave ravinement surfaces typifying wave-dominated or
   mixed-energy (wave and tide) incised-valley fills are absent in the
   macrotidal QR succession, and the tidal ravinement and erosion surfaces
   of the macrotidal QR incised valley are more extensive and numerous than
   those of the wave-dominated or mixed-energy succession.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers blocking and scheduling for the design and
   implementation of field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based
   floating-point parallel matrix multiplication in the presence of a
   memory hierarchy. For high performance, on-chip memory holds data that
   are reused when the computation is divided into blocks, and multiple
   arithmetic units perform independent operations within each block in
   parallel. The first contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of
   the design space to characterize performance based on the amount of
   on-chip memory used and the approaches considered for blocking and
   scheduling of the computation. A comparison is also made to prior work
   with a unified view. The second contribution is a flexible
   high-performance implementation for the Altera Stratix IV EP4SGX530C2
   FPGA with an interface to external double-data-rate synchronous dynamic
   RAM (DDR2 SDRAM) memory. Various configuration options support
   optimization of different objectives, and the resulting configurations
   have been verified in simulation and in hardware. For double-precision
   floating-point, a performance of 16 giga-floating-point operations per
   second (GFLOPS) is achievable with 64 arithmetic units at 160 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{Peak knee joint contact forces ({''}loads{''}) in running are much
   higher than they are in walking, where the peak load has been associated
   with the initiation and progression of knee osteoarthritis. However,
   runners do not have an especially high risk of osteoarthritis compared
   with nonrunners. This paradox suggests that running somehow blunts the
   effect of very high peak joint contact forces, perhaps to provide a load
   per unit distance (PUD) traveled that is relatively low. Purpose This
   study aimed to compare peak and PUD knee joint loads between human
   walking and running. Methods Fourteen healthy adults walked and ran at
   self-selected speeds. Ground reaction force and motion capture data were
   measured and combined with inverse dynamics and musculoskeletal modeling
   to estimate the peak knee joint loads, PUD knee joint loads, and the
   impulse of the knee joint contact force for each gait with a
   matched-pair (within-subject) design. Results The peak load was three
   times higher in running (8.02 vs 2.72 body weight, P < 0.001), but the
   PUD load did not differ between running and walking (0.80 vs 0.75 body
   weight per meter, P = 0.098). The impulse of the joint contact force was
   greater for running than for walking (1.30 vs 1.04 body weight per
   second, P < 0.001). The peak load increased with increasing running
   speed, whereas the PUD load decreased with increasing speed. Conclusions
   Compared with walking, the relatively short duration of ground contact
   and relatively long length of strides in running seem to blunt the
   effect of high peak joint loads, such that the PUD loads are no higher
   than that in walking. Waveform features other than or in addition to the
   peak value should be considered when studying joint loading and
   injuries.}},

Abstract = {{The benefits provided by natural (e.g., non-engineered) tundra wetlands
   for the treatment of municipal wastewater in the Canadian Arctic are
   largely under-studied and, therefore, undervalued in regard to the
   treatment service wetlands provide to small remote Arctic communities.
   In this paper we present case studies on two natural tundra systems
   which at the time of study had different management practices, in which
   one consisted of a facultative lake system continuously discharging into
   a tundra wetland, while the second system had wastewater discharged
   directly into a tundra wetland. We also examine the utility of the
   SubWet 2.0 wetland model and how it can be used to: (i) predict the
   outcomes of management options; and (ii) to assess treatment capacity
   within individual tundra wetlands to meet future needs associated with
   population growth and to help municipalities determine the appropriate
   actions required to achieve the desired level of treatment, both
   currently, and in a sustainable long-term manner. From this examination
   we argue that tundra wetlands can significantly augment common treatment
   practices which rely on waste stabilization ponds, by recognizing the
   services that wetlands already provide. We suggest that treatment
   targets could be more achievable if tundra wetlands are formally
   recognized as part of a hybridized treatment system that incorporates
   the combined benefits of both the waste stabilization pond and the
   tundra wetland. Under this scenario tundra wetlands would be recognized
   as part of the treatment process and not as the receiving' environment,
   which is how most tundra wetlands are currently categorized.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the solution of a real-time optimization problem
   using adaptive extremum seeking control for a class of unknown
   discrete-time nonlinear systems. It is assumed that the equations
   describing the dynamics of the nonlinear system and the cost function to
   be minimized are unknown and that the objective function is measured.
   The main contribution of the paper is to formulate the extremum-seeking
   problem as a time-varying discrete-time estimation problem. The proposed
   approach is shown to avoid the need for averaging results which
   minimizes the impact of the choice of dither signals on the performance
   of the extremum seeking control system. Several examples are used to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{External ear reconstruction with autologous cartilage still remains one
   of the most difficult problems in the fields of plastic and
   reconstructive surgery. As the absence of tissue vascularization limits
   the ability to stimulate new tissue growth, relatively few surgical
   approaches are currently available (alloplastic implants or sculpted
   autologous cartilage grafts) to repair or reconstruct the auricle (or
   pinna) as a result of traumatic loss or congenital absence (e.g.,
   microtia). Alternatively, tissue engineering can offer the potential to
   grow autogenous cartilage suitable for implantation. While
   tissue-engineered auricle cartilage constructs can be created, a
   substantial number of cells are required to generate sufficient
   quantities of tissue for reconstruction. Similarly, as routine cell
   expansion can elicit negative effects on chondrocyte function, we have
   developed an approach to generate large-sized engineered auricle
   constructs (>= 3 cm(2)) directly from a small population of donor cells
   (20,000-40,000 cells/construct). Using rabbit donor cells, the developed
   bioreactor-cultivated constructs adopted structural-like characteristics
   similar to native auricular cartilage, including the development of
   distinct cartilaginous and perichondrium-like regions. Both alterations
   in media composition and seeding density had profound effects on the
   formation of engineered elastic tissue constructs in terms of
   cellularity, extracellular matrix accumulation, and tissue structure.
   Higher seeding densities and media containing sodium bicarbonate
   produced tissue constructs that were closer to the native tissue in
   terms of structure and composition. Future studies will be aimed at
   improving the accumulation of specific tissue constituents and
   determining the clinical effectiveness of this approach using a
   reconstructive animal model.}},

Abstract = {{A robust particle filter (PF)-based multi-target tracking solution for
   passive sonar systems able to track an unknown time-varying number of
   multiple targets, while keeping continuous tracks of such targets, is
   presented in this article. PF is a nonlinear filtering technique that
   can accommodate arbitrary sensor characteristics, motion dynamics and
   noise distributions. An enhanced version of PF is employed and is called
   Mixture PF. The commonly used sampling/importance resampling PF samples
   from the prior importance density, while Mixture PF samples from both
   the prior and the observation likelihood. In order to be able to track
   an unknown time-varying number of multiple targets, two Mixture PFs are
   used, one for target detection and the other for tracking multiple
   targets, and a density-based clustering technique is used after the
   first filter. This article demonstrates the applicability of the
   proposed technique for the passive problem, which suffers from the lack
   of measurements and the small detection range of the buoys, especially
   for weak signals. A contact-level simulation was used to generate
   different scenarios and the performance of the proposed technique called
   Clustered-Mixture PF was examined with either bearing measurement only
   or bearing and Doppler measurements, and it demonstrated its high
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel real-time power-device temperature
   estimation method that monitors the power MOSFET's junction temperature
   shift arising from thermal aging effects and incorporates the updated
   electrothermal models of power modules into digital controllers.
   Currently, the real-time estimator is emerging as an important tool for
   active control of device junction temperature as well as online health
   monitoring for power electronic systems, but its thermal model fails to
   address the device's ongoing degradation. Because of a mismatch of
   coefficients of thermal expansion between layers of power devices,
   repetitive thermal cycling will cause cracks, voids, and even
   delamination within the device components, particularly in the solder
   and thermal grease layers. Consequently, the thermal resistance of power
   devices will increase, making it possible to use thermal resistance (and
   junction temperature) as key indicators for condition monitoring and
   control purposes. In this paper, the predicted device temperature via
   threshold voltage measurements is compared with the real-time estimated
   ones, and the difference is attributed to the aging of the device. The
   thermal models in digital controllers are frequently updated to correct
   the shift caused by thermal aging effects. Experimental results on three
   power MOSFETs confirm that the proposed methodologies are effective to
   incorporate the thermal aging effects in the power-device temperature
   estimator with good accuracy. The developed adaptive technologies can be
   applied to other power devices such as IGBTs and SiC MOSFETs, and have
   significant economic implications.}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Lip separation is one of the primary sources of inlet distortion, which
   can result in a loss in fan stability. High angles of incidence are one
   of several critical causes of lip separation. There have been many
   studies into inlet performance at high incidence, including the
   resulting distortion levels when lip separation occurs. However, the
   vast majority of these investigations have been carried out
   experimentally, with little in the way of computational results for
   inlet performance at high incidence. The flow topology within an inlet
   when lip separation has occurred is also not well understood. This work
   aims to demonstrate a suitable model for the prediction of inlet flows
   at high incidence using ANSYS CFX, looking at both the performance of
   the inlet and the separated flow topology within the inlet. The
   attenuating effect of the fan is also investigated, with particular
   emphasis on the flow redistribution ahead of the fan. The results show
   that the model used is suitable for predicting inlet performance in
   adverse operating conditions, showing good agreement with experimental
   results. In addition, the attenuation of the distortion by the fan is
   also captured by the numerical model.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments conducted on corrugated steel, PVC, and
   high-density polyethylene pipes have demonstrated that deformations in
   flexible pipes resulting, say, from surface live loads, attenuate
   rapidly away from the location of load application. As a result, while
   surface loads in the vicinity of a joint connecting two shallow buried
   pipe segments influence that joint, the deformations become negligible
   at the other ends of the two pipe segments. Therefore, solutions for
   shear, moment, and rotation have been developed assuming that the two
   pipes are very long, and that the response is not affected by the
   location or the characteristics of those other joints. This paper
   presents the formulations of the simplified design equations for
   flexible pipes, for both moment-transfer and moment-release joints. The
   design equations are developed using various closed-form solutions for
   beams on elastic foundations. A parametric study is then presented to
   examine the factors controlling the structural response of joints in
   flexible pipes, and comparisons are made to the laboratory experimental
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the performance of amplify-and forward dual-hop relaying
   systems in the presence of in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI)
   at the relay node. In particular, an exact analytical expression for and
   tight lower bounds on the outage probability are derived over
   independent, non- identically distributed Nakagami-m fading channels.
   Moreover, tractable upper and lower bounds on the ergodic capacity are
   presented at arbitrary signal-to- noise ratios (SNRs). Some special
   cases of practical interest (e.g., Rayleigh and Nakagami 0.5 fading) are
   also studied. An asymptotic analysis is performed in the high SNR
   regime, where we observe that IQI results in a ceiling effect on the
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), which depends only on
   the level of I/Q impairments, i.e., the joint image rejection ratio.
   Finally, the optimal I/Q amplitude and phase mismatch parameters are
   provided for maximizing the SINR ceiling, thus improving the system
   performance. An interesting observation is that, under a fixed total
   phase mismatch constraint, it is optimal to have the same level of
   transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) phase mismatch at the relay node,
   while the optimal values for the TX and RX amplitude mismatch should be
   inversely proportional to each other.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The beginning of the Cambrian was a time of marked biological and
   sedimentary changes, including the replacement of Proterozoic-style
   microbial matgrounds by Phanerozoic-style bioturbated mixgrounds. Here
   we show that Ediacaran-style matground-based ecology persisted into the
   earliest Cambrian. Our study in the type section of the basal Cambrian
   in Fortune Head, Newfoundland, Canada reveals widespread microbially
   induced sedimentary structures and typical Ediacaran-type matground
   ichnofossils. Ediacara-type body fossils are present immediately below
   the top of the Ediacaran but are strikingly absent from the overlying
   Cambrian succession, despite optimal conditions for their preservation,
   and instead the microbial surfaces are marked by the appearance of the
   first abundant arthropod scratch marks in Earth evolution. These
   features imply that the disappearance of the Ediacara biota represents
   an abrupt evolutionary event that corresponded with the appearance of
   novel bilaterian clades, rather than a fading away owing to the gradual
   elimination of conditions appropriate for Ediacaran preservation.}},

   Correcting for over-calculation due to rockmass convergence}},
Journal = {{TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{234-240}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The benchmark method of measuring shotcrete thickness from 3D LiDAR and
   photogrammetry data involves scanning sequential blast rounds, aligning
   the data in a 3D environment, and calculating the spatial difference
   between the two models. The calculated difference between the two 3D
   surface models is measured as the thickness of the sprayed concrete.
   This methodology does not account for the convergence of the rockmass
   that naturally occurs between the scanning protocols, nor is it included
   in the difference equation, and resultantly the user over-measures the
   thickness of the sprayed concrete. The over-measurement can be corrected
   through changing the time of scanning with respect to the excavation
   sequence or calibrating the solution based on known rockmass convergence
   rates or numerical modelling. The use of 3D imaging data for the
   calculation of shotcrete thickness will remain a useful tool for
   geotechnical engineers, but corrections must made to the
   state-of-practice methodology in order to achieve accurate results. (C)

Abstract = {{The biotransformation of levulinic acid to 4-valerolactone (4VL) is
   pH-dependent and equilibrium limited, distinct from the more common
   irreversible biotransformations that are constrained by product toxicity
   or biocatalyst inhibition. Our processing strategy for this system was
   to selectively remove the product, 4VL, which is in equilibrium with its
   precursor, 4-hydroxyvalerate (4HV), to pull the reaction to a greater
   extent of conversion. 4VL is challenging to separate from the aqueous
   phase due to its water miscibility, necessitating the use of
   water-absorbing polymers to provide affinity toward the hydrophilic
   product. Manipulating the composition of copolymers, thereby varying the
   architecture of polymer chains, conferred drastically different extents
   of water absorption and caused different biotransformation outcomes. A
   custom-synthesized random copolymer designed to maximize the proportion
   of material with affinity for the solute had high water uptake, which
   resulted in the poor selectivity for the target molecule relative to its
   precursor. Conversely, a moderately water-absorbing commercial segmented
   block copolymer, Hytrel(A (R)) 8206, demonstrated selectivity toward 4VL
   relative to its precursor, 4HV, and increased 4VL production by
   approximately 30 \% by shifting the equilibrium toward the product. This
   work has shown that water absorption is an important, previously
   neglected criterion in evaluating polymer affinity and selectivity
   toward hydrophilic target molecules.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the performance of multiple input/multiple output (MIMO)
   communications systems employing spatial multiplexing and zero-forcing
   detection (ZF). The distribution of the ZF signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   is characterized when either the intended stream or interfering streams
   experience Rician fading, and when the fading may be correlated on the
   transmit side. Previously, exact ZF analysis based on a well-known SNR
   expression has been hindered by the noncentrality of the Wishart
   distribution involved. In addition, approximation with a central-Wishart
   distribution has not proved consistently accurate. In contrast, the
   following exact ZF study proceeds from a lesser-known SNR expression
   that separates the intended and interfering channel-gain vectors. By
   first conditioning on, and then averaging over the interference, the ZF
   SNR distribution for Rician-Rayleigh fading is shown to be an infinite
   linear combination of gamma distributions. On the other hand, for
   Rayleigh-Rician fading, the ZF SNR is shown to be gamma-distributed.
   Based on the SNR distribution, we derive new series expressions for the
   ZF average error probability, outage probability, and ergodic capacity.
   Numerical results confirm the accuracy of our new expressions, and
   reveal effects of interference and channel statistics on performance.}},

Title = {{Activity and coke formation of nickel and nickel carbide in dry

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{311}},

Abstract = {{Dry reforming is a promising reaction to utilise the greenhouse gases
   CO2 and CH4. Nickel-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for
   the reaction, and the coke formation on the catalysts is the main
   obstacle to the commercialisation of dry reforming. In this study, the
   whole reaction network of dry reformation on both flat and stepped
   nickel catalysts (Ni(111) and Ni(211)) as well as nickel carbide (flat:
   Ni3C(001); stepped: Ni3C(111)) is investigated using density functional
   theory calculations. The overall reaction energy profiles in the free
   energy landscape are obtained, and kinetic analyses are utilised to
   evaluate the activity of the four surfaces. By careful examination of
   our results, we find the following regarding the activity: (i) flat
   surfaces are more active than stepped surfaces for the dry reforming and
   (ii) metallic nickel catalysts are more active than those of nickel
   carbide, and therefore, the phase transformation from nickel to nickel
   carbide will reduce the activity. With respect to the coke formation,
   the following is found: (i) the coke formation probability can be
   measured by the rate ratio of CH oxidation pathway to C oxidation
   pathway (r(CH)/r(C)) and the barrier of CO dissociation, (ii) on
   Ni(111), the coke is unlikely to form, and (iii) the coke formations on
   the stepped surfaces of both nickel and nickel carbide can readily
   occur. A deactivation scheme, using which experimental results can be
   rationalised, is proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the numerous advantages of continuous processing, high-value

   paper, we investigate options for the continuous dehydrogenation of
   1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole using a trickle bed reactor operating under
   realistic liquid velocities with and without the addition of a hydrogen
   acceptor. Here, a commercial 5 wt \% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst was observed to
   slowly deactivate, hence proving unsuitable for continuous use. This
   deactivation was attributed to the strong adsorption of a byproduct on
   the surface of the support. Application of a base washing technique
   resolved this issue and a stable continuous reaction has been
   demonstrated. As was previously shown for the batch reaction, the
   addition of a hydrogen acceptor gas (propene) can increase the overall
   catalytic activity of the system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an integrated design and costing method for large

   interaction of lay-up technology and production rate on manufacturing
   cost. A series of wing cover panels (approximate to 586kg, 19.9m(2))
   have been sized with realistic requirements considering manual and
   automated lay-up routes. The integrated method has enabled the
   quantification of component unit cost sensitivity to changes in annual
   production rate and employed equipment maximum deposition rate. Moreover
   the results demonstrate the interconnected relationship between lay-up
   process and panel design, and unit cost. The optimum unit cost solution
   when using automated lay-up is a combination of the minimum deposition
   rate and minimum number of lay-up machines to meet the required
   production rate. However, the location of the optimum unit cost, at the
   boundaries between the number of lay-up machines required, can make unit
   cost very sensitive to small changes in component design, production
   rate, and equipment maximum deposition rate.}},

Abstract = {{The separation of inhibitory compounds as they are produced in
   biotransformation and fermentation systems is termed in situ product
   removal (ISPR). This review examines recent ISPR strategies employing
   several classes of extractants including liquids, solids, gases, and
   combined extraction systems. Improvement through the simple application
   of an auxiliary phase are tabulated and summarized to indicate the
   breadth of recent ISPR activities. Studies within the past 5 years that
   have highlighted and have discussed ``second phase{''} properties, and
   that have an effect on fermentation performance, are particular focus of
   this review. ISPR, as a demonstrably effective processing strategy,
   continues to be widely adopted as more applications are explored;
   however, focus on the properties of extractants and their rational
   selection based on first principle considerations will likely be key to
   successfully applying ISPR to more challenging target molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional navigated surgery relies on placement of a reference marker
   on the anatomy of interest. However, placement of such a marker is not
   readily feasible in small anatomic regions such as the scaphoid bone of
   the wrist. This study aimed to develop an alternative mechanism for
   patient tracking that could be used to perform navigated percutaneous
   scaphoid fixation.
   A prototype wrist stabilization device was developed to immobilize the
   scaphoid relative to a reference marker attached to the device. A
   position measurement system and 3D fluoroscopy were used to study the
   accuracy and limitations of wrist stabilization during simulated
   clinical usage with a cadaver specimen. Reference markers mounted on the
   device were used to measure intra-device motion. Radiometallic beads
   implanted in the scaphoid were used to measure patient-device motion.
   Navigated planning and guidance of scaphoid fixation were performed in
   five cadaver and eight ``ideally immobilized{''} plastic specimens.
   Postoperative 3D fluoroscopy was used to assess the accuracy of
   navigated drilling.
   The average intra-device motion was 1.9 mm during load application,
   which was elastically recovered upon release of the load. Scaphoid
   motion relative to the reference marker was predominately rotational
   with an average displacement of 1.25 mm and . There was no significant
   difference in the accuracy of navigated drilling between the cadaver
   specimens and the ideally immobilized group.
   The prototype wrist stabilization device meets the criteria for
   effective wrist stabilization. This study provides insight concerning
   proper use of the device to minimize scaphoid displacement and design
   recommendations to improve immobilization.}},

Abstract = {{Many unit operations required in microfluidics can be realised by
   electrokinetic phenomena. Electrokinetic phenomena are related to the
   presence of electrical surface charges of microfluidic substrates in
   contact with a liquid. As surface charges cannot be directly measured,
   the zeta potential is considered as the relevant parameter instead. PMMA
   is an attractive microfluidic substrate since micron-sized features can
   be manufactured at low costs. However, the existence of PMMA surface
   charges is not well understood and the zeta potential data found in the
   literature show significant disagreement. In this article, we present a
   thorough investigation on the zeta potential of PMMA. We use
   computations of the potential distribution in the electrical double
   layer to predict the influence of various electrolyte parameters. The
   generated knowledge is compared to extensive experiments where we
   investigate the influence of ionic strength, pH, temperature and the
   nature of the electrolyte. Our findings imply that two different
   mechanisms influence the zeta potential depending on the pH value. We
   propose pure shielding in the acidic and neutral milieus while
   adsorption of co-ions occurs along with shielding in the alkaline
   milieu.}},

Abstract = {{Lovastatin biosynthesis depends on the relative concentrations of
   dissolved oxygen and the carbon and nitrogen resources. An elucidation
   of the underlying relationship would facilitate the derivation of a
   controller for the improvement of lovastatin yield in bioprocesses. To
   achieve this goal, batch submerged cultivation experiments of lovastatin
   production by Aspergillus flavipusBICC 5174, using both lactose and
   glucose as carbon sources, were performed in a 7-L bioreactor and the
   data used to determine how the relative concentrations of lactose,
   glucose, glutamine, and oxygen affected lovastatin yield. A model was
   developed based on these results and its prediction was validated using
   an independent set of batch data obtained from a 15-L bioreactor using
   five statistical measures, including the Willmott index of agreement. A
   non-linear controller was designed considering that dissolved oxygen and
   lactose concentrations could be measured online, and using the lactose
   feed rate and airflow rate as process inputs. Simulation experiments
   were performed to demonstrate that a practical implementation of the
   non-linear controller would result in satisfactory outcomes. This is the
   first model that correlates lovastatin biosynthesis to carbon-nitrogen
   proportion and possesses a structure suitable for implementing a
   strategy for controlling lovastatin production.}},

Abstract = {{Since the first launch of the new engineering contract (NEC) in 1993,
   early warning of problems has been widely recognized as an important
   approach of proactive management during a construction or engineering
   project. Is early warning really effective for the improvement of
   problem solving and project performance? This is a research question
   that still lacks a good answer. For this reason, an empirical
   investigation was made in the United Kingdom (U.K.) to answer the
   question. This study adopts a combination of literature review, expert
   interview, and questionnaire survey. Nearly 100 questionnaire responses
   were collected from the U.K. construction industry, based on which the
   use of early warning under different forms of contract is compared in
   this paper. Problem solving and project performance are further compared
   between the projects using early warning and the projects not using
   early warning. The comparison provides clear evidence for the
   significant effect of early warning on problem solving and project
   performance in terms of time, cost, and quality. Subsequently, an
   input-process-output model is developed in this paper to explore the
   relationship among early warning, problem solving, and project
   performance. All these help construction researchers and practitioners
   to better understand the role of early warning in ensuring project
   success.}},

Abstract = {{Impressions of soft-bodied Ediacaran megafossils are common in
   deep-water slope deposits of the June beds at Sekwi Brook in the
   Mackenzie Mountains of NW Canada. Two taphonomic assemblages can be
   recognized. Soles of turbidite beds contain numerous impressions of
   simple (Aspidella) and tentaculate (Hiemalora, Eoporpita) discs. A
   specimen of the frond Primocandelabrum is attached to an Aspidella-like
   holdfast, but most holdfast discs lack any impressions of the leafy
   fronds to which they were attached, reflecting Fermeuse-style
   preservation of the basal level of the community Epifaunal fronds
   (Beothukis, Charnia, Charniodiscus) and benthic recliners (Fractofusus)
   were most commonly preserved intrastratally on horizontal parting
   surfaces within turbidite and contourite beds, reflecting a deep-water
   example of Nama-style preservation of higher levels in the community. A
   well-preserved specimen of Namalia significantly extends the known age
   and environmental range of erniettomorphs into deep-water aphotic
   settings. Infaunal bilaterian burrows are absent from the June beds
   despite favorable beds for their preservation. The June beds assemblage
   is broadly similar in age and environment to deep-water Avalonian
   assemblages in Newfoundland and England, and like them contains mainly
   rangeomorph and arboreomorph fossils and apparently lacks
   dickinsoniomorphs and other clades typical of younger and shallower
   Ediacaran assemblages. Fossil data presently available imply that the
   classically deep- and shallow-water taxa of the Ediacara biota had
   different evolutionary origins and histories, with sessile rangeomorphs
   and arboreomorphs appearing in deep-water settings approximately 580
   million years ago and spreading into shallow-water settings by 555 Ma
   but dickinsoniomorphs and other iconic Glades restricted to
   shallow-water settings from their first known appearance at 555 Ma until
   their disappearance prior to the end of the Ediacaran.}},

Volume = {{88}},

Abstract = {{Ediacaran and early Cambrian strata in NW Canada contain abundant trace
   fossils that record the progressive development of complex behavior in
   early animal evolution. Five feeding groups can be recognized: microbial
   grazing, deposit-feeding, deposit-feeding/predatory,
   filter-feeding/predatory, and arthropod tracks and trails. The lower
   Blueflower Formation (ca. 560-550 Ma) contains abundant burrows that
   completely cover bedding surfaces with small (similar to 1 mm diameter)
   cylindrical burrows that were strictly restricted to microbial bedding
   surfaces and exhibited only primitive and inconsistent avoidance
   strategies. The upper Blueflower contains three-dimensional avoidance
   burrows and rare filter-feeding or possibly predatory burrows,
   suggesting increased behavioral responses in food gathering that marked
   the beginning of the agronomic revolution in substrate utilization.
   Cambrian strata of the Ingta Formation contain systematically meandering
   burrows and more diverse feeding strategies, including the onset of
   treptichnid probing burrows that may reflect predation. These
   observations imply that Ediacaran burrowers were largely characterized
   by crude, two-dimensional avoidance meanders that represented simple
   behavioral responses of individual burrowers to sensory information, and
   that the subsequent development of more diverse and complex feeding
   patterns with genetically programmed search pathways occurred during the
   earliest stages of the Cambrian explosion. These observations further
   imply that changes occurred in both the food source and substrate during
   the ecological transition from Proterozoic matgrounds to Phanerozoic
   mixgrounds.}},

   radical copolymerization by starved-feed semibatch operation is
   simulated using three different methodologies. Even under perfect

   model is formulated to separately track the homopolymer chains that are

Abstract = {{Heat sinks are widely used for cooling electronic devices and systems.
   Their thermal performance is usually determined by the material, shape,
   and size of the heat sink. With the assistance of computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) and surrogate-based optimization, heat sinks can be
   designed and optimized to achieve a high level of performance. In this
   paper, the design and optimization of a plate-fin-type heat sink cooled
   by impingement jet is presented. The flow and thermal fields are
   simulated using the CFD simulation; the thermal resistance of the heat
   sink is then estimated. A Kriging surrogate model is developed to
   approximate the objective function (thermal resistance) as a function of
   design variables. Surrogate-based optimization is implemented by
   adaptively adding infill points based on an integrated strategy of the
   minimum value, the maximum mean square error approach, and the expected
   improvement approaches. The results show the influence of design
   variables on the thermal resistance and give the optimal heat sink with
   lowest thermal resistance for given jet impingement conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio has been widely considered as one of the prominent
   solutions to tackle the spectrum scarcity. While the majority of
   existing research has focused on single-band cognitive radio, multiband
   cognitive radio represents great promises toward implementing efficient
   cognitive networks compared to single-based networks. Multiband
   cognitive radio networks (MB-CRNs) are expected to significantly enhance
   the network's throughput and provide better channel maintenance by
   reducing handoff frequency. Nevertheless, the wideband front-end and the
   multiband spectrum access impose a number of challenges yet to overcome.
   This paper provides an in-depth analysis on the recent advancements in
   multiband spectrum sensing techniques, their limitations, and possible
   future directions to improve them. We study cooperative communications
   for MB-CRNs to tackle a fundamental limit on diversity and sampling. We
   also investigate several limits and tradeoffs of various design
   parameters for MB-CRNs. In addition, we explore the key MB-CRNs
   performance metrics that differ from the conventional metrics used for
   single-band-based networks.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider the dynamics of harmonically-confined atomic
   gases. We present various general results which are independent of
   particle statistics, interatomic interactions and dimensionality. Of
   particular interest is the response of the system to external
   perturbations which can be either static or dynamic in nature. We prove
   an extended Harmonic Potential Theorem which is useful in determining
   the damping of the centre of mass motion when the system is prepared
   initially in a highly nonequilibrium state. We also study the response
   of the gas to a dynamic external potential whose position is made to
   oscillate sinusoidally in a given direction. We show in this case that
   either the energy absorption rate or the centre of mass dynamics can
   serve as a probe of the optical conductivity of the system. (C) 2014

   This interaction of crystalline copper nanoparticles and copper

   a newly defined flattening aspect ratio. This ratio between the maximum
   diameter after the impact and the height of the splat increases with
   increasing Reynolds numbers until a critical value is reached. At higher
   Reynolds numbers the flattening aspect ratio decreases again, as the
   kinetic energy of the particle leads to increasing substrate temperature

Abstract = {{Production of organic acids in solid-liquid two-phase partitioning
   bioreactors (TPPBs) is challenging, and highly pH-dependent, as cell
   growth occurs near neutral pH, while acid sorption occurs only at low pH
   conditions. CO2 sparging was used to achieve acidic pH swings,
   facilitating undissociated organic acid uptake without generating
   osmotic stress inherent in traditional acid/base pH control. A modified
   cultivation medium was formulated to permit greater pH reduction by CO2
   sparging (pH 4.8) compared to typical media (pH 5.3), while still
   possessing adequate nutrients for extensive cell growth. In situ product
   recovery (ISPR) of butyric acid (pKa=4.8) produced by Clostridium
   tyrobutyricum was achieved through intermittent CO2 sparging while
   recycling reactor contents through a column packed with absorptive
   polymer Hytrel (R) 3078. This polymer was selected on the basis of its
   composition as a polyether copolymer, and the use of solubility
   parameters for predicting solute polymer affinity, and was found to have
   a partition coefficient for butyric acid of 3. Total polymeric
   extraction of 3.2g butyric acid with no CO2 mediated pH swings was
   increased to 4.5g via CO2-facilitated pH shifting, despite the buffering
   capacity of butyric acid, which resists pH shifting. This work shows
   that CO2-mediated pH swings have an observable positive effect on
   organic acid extraction, with improvements well over 150\% under optimal
   conditions in early stage fermentation compared to CO2-free controls,
   and this technique can be applied other organic acid fermentations to
   achieve or improve ISPR. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2014;111: 537-544. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{In complex hydrogeological environments the effective management of
   groundwater quality problems by pump-and-treat operations can be most
   confidently achieved if the mixing dynamics induced within the aquifer
   by pumping are well understood. The utility of isotopic environmental
   tracers (C-, H-, O-, S-stable isotopic analyses and age indicators-C-14,
   H-3) for this purpose is illustrated by the analysis of a pumping test
   in an abstraction borehole drilled into flooded, abandoned coal
   mineworkings at Deerplay (Lancashire, UK). Interpretation of the isotope
   data was undertaken conjunctively with that of major ion hydrochemistry,
   and interpreted in the context of the particular hydraulic setting of
   flooded mineworkings to identify the sources and mixing of water
   qualities in the groundwater system. Initial pumping showed breakdown of
   initial water quality stratification in the borehole, and gave evidence
   for distinctive isotopic signatures (delta S-34(SO4) congruent to -1.6
   parts per thousand, delta O-18(SO4) congruent to +15 parts per thousand)
   associated with primary oxidation of pyrite in the zone of water table
   fluctuation-the first time this phenomenon has been successfully
   characterized by these isotopes in a flooded mine system. The overall
   aim of the test pumping-to replace an uncontrolled outflow from a mine
   entrance in an inconvenient location with a pumped discharge on a site
   where treatment could be provided-was swiftly achieved. Environmental
   tracing data illustrated the benefits of pumping as little as possible
   to attain this aim, as higher rates of pumping induced in-mixing of
   poorer quality waters from more distant old workings, and/or renewed
   pyrite oxidation in the shallow subsurface.}},

Abstract = {{Boundary layer transition estimation and modelling is essential for the
   design of many engineering products across many industries. In this
   paper, the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes are solved in conjunction
   with three additional transport equations to model and predict boundary
   layer transition. The transition model (referred to as the
   k(T)-k(L)-omega model) is based on the k-omega framework with an
   additional transport equation to incorporate the effects low-frequency
   flow oscillations in the form of a laminar kinetic energy (k(L)).
   Firstly, a number of rectifications are made to the original
   k(T)-k(L)-omega framework in order to ensure an appropriate response to
   the free-stream turbulence level and to improve near wall predictions.
   Additionally, the model is extended to incorporate the capability to
   model transition due to surface irregularities in the form of
   backward-facing steps with maximum non-dimensional step sizes of
   approximately 1.5 times the local displacement thickness of the boundary
   layer where the irregularity is located (i.e k/delta{*} <= 1.5) at
   upstream turbulence intensities in the range 0.01 < Tu(\%) < 0.8. A
   novel function is proposed to incorporate transition sensitivity due to
   aft-facing steps. This paper details the rationale behind the
   development of this new function and demonstrates its suitability for
   transition onset estimation on a flat plate at zero pressure gradient.

Volume = {{96}},

Abstract = {{The existence of multiple wireless networks with different radio access
   technologies and protocols makes the radio environment heterogeneous. In
   order to provide the best Quality of Service available from the active
   networks, and satisfy the concept of always best connected, one can take
   advantage of this heterogeneity by developing multi-mode terminals able
   to smartly switch from one interface to another. This switching process,
   known as vertical handover (VHO), requires some relevant metrics to be
   measured by the terminal in order to decide whether to trigger a VHO or
   not. Using multiple antennas, we propose to track the number of active
   sources and employ the results in CSMA/CA networks for VHO. The proposed
   algorithm is developed using a Markov chain model for sources
   enumeration at any given time. We also use a three state Markov model
   for CSMA/ CA networks and show how this algorithm can be applied to
   recursively obtain two informative metrics about the channel state,
   namely the channel occupancy rate and the collision rate. Numerical
   simulations confirm that the proposed algorithm performs well for
   practical SNR values. The proposed algorithm relies on a physical layer
   sensing and requires no connection to the access point, no
   synchronization, no signal demodulation and no frame decoding. This
   particularity ensures a seamless handover with a time/ energy economy.

Pages = {{45-54}},

Abstract = {{The major objective in developing a robust digital watermarking
   algorithm is to obtain the highest possible robustness without losing
   the visual imperceptibility. To achieve this objective, we proposed in
   this paper an optimal image watermarking scheme using multi-objective
   particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and singular value decomposition
   (SVD) in wavelet domain. Having decomposed the original image into ten
   sub-bands, singular value decomposition is applied to a chosen detail
   sub-band. Then, the singular values of the chosen sub-band are modified
   by multiple scaling factors (MSF) to embed the singular values of
   watermark image. Various combinations of multiple scaling factors are
   possible, and it is difficult to obtain optimal solutions. Thus, in
   order to achieve the highest possible robustness and imperceptibility,
   multi-objective optimization of the multiple scaling factors is
   necessary. This work employs particle swarm optimization to obtain
   optimum multiple scaling factors. Experimental results of the proposed
   approach show both the significant improvement in term of
   imperceptibility and robustness under various attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Presently, there is an immense impetus in the automotive industry to
   develop plug-in electric vehicles (PIEVs) to reverse the ever increasing
   green house gas emissions from fossil fuels and depleting fossil fuel
   resources. High-frequency ac-dc converters with an isolated output are
   one of the essential building blocks for transferring power from utility
   mains to the traction battery packs which store energy for propelling
   the EV. Generally, the ac/dc converters used in EVs include a PFC stage
   at the input side and an isolated dc/dc converter at the battery side.
   Due to the switching nature of the converter, electromagnetic
   compatibility (EMC) of these converters is an essential requirement, to
   ensure not only its own operation but also the safe and secure operation
   of surrounding electrical equipment. EVs possess a lot of sophisticated
   electronic circuits in the vicinity of the battery charging power
   converters. Thus, strict EMC standards of the on-board power converters
   must be met according to the CISPR 12 or SAEJ551/5 relevant EMC
   standards. Conventional passive filters used for EMI mitigation in power
   converters, comes at the expense of cost, size and weight, power losses,
   and printed circuit board real estate. In this paper, an electromagnetic
   interference (EMI) filter embedded into the main high-frequency planar
   transformer used in the dc/dc converter is proposed as a very
   cost-effective and efficient solution for EVs. The proposed structure is
   able to significantly suppress the common-mode (CM) EMI noise generated
   in the dc/dc converter. Experimental results have been obtained from a
   3-kW prototype in order to prove the feasibility and performance of the
   proposed EMI filter. The results show that the proposed embedded EMI
   filter can effectively suppress the CM noise particularly for high
   switching frequency power converters. The proposed structure can be a
   very simple and cost-effective EMI filtering solution for future PIEVs.}},

Abstract = {{A digital adaptive current source driver (CSD) is proposed for the
   interleaved Boost PFC converter. The adaptive drive current is achieved
   for the CSDs to optimize the switching loss and gate drive loss
   according to different turn-on and turn-off drain currents in a wide
   load range. Compared to the adaptive CSDs with the linear regulator, the
   digital adaptive CSD is able to eliminate the additional loss and cost
   introduced by the linear regulator. The most important benefit of the
   digital CSD is that the turn-on and turn-off drive current can be
   adjusted independently according to the different turn-on and turn-off
   drain currents. At the same time, the proposed digital CSD is compatible
   with other advanced digital control technique. The proposed digital CSD
   is applied to the interleaved Boost PFC converter under critical
   conduction mode (CRM) to reduce the high turn-off loss and gate drive
   loss. A 220-VAC input, 380-V/400-W output, two-phase interleaved Boost

Abstract = {{This study describes the utilization of deep eutectic solvents (DESs)
   based on the mixture of the N-methylacetamide (MAc) with a lithium salt
   (LiX, with X = bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide, TFSI;
   hexafluorophosphate, PF6; or nitrate, NO3) as electrolytes for
   carbon-based supercapacitors at 80 degrees C. The investigated DESs were
   formulated by mixing a LiX with the MAc (at x(Li) = 0.25). All DESs show
   the typical eutectic characteristic with eutectic points localized in
   the temperature range from -85 to -52 degrees C. Using thermal
   properties measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),
   solid-liquid equilibrium phase diagrams of investigated LiX-MAc mixtures
   were then depicted and also compared with those predicted by using the
   COSMOThermX software. However, the transport properties of selected DESs
   (such as the conductivity (sigma) and the fluidity (eta(-1))) are not
   very interesting at ambient temperature, while by increasing the
   temperature up to 80 degrees C, these properties become more favorable
   for electrochemical applications, as shown by the calculated Walden
   products: w = sigma eta(-1) (mS cm(-1) Pa-1 s(-1)) (7 < w < 16 at 25
   degrees C and 513 < w < 649 at 80 degrees C). This ``superionicity{''}
   behavior of selected DESs used as electrolytes explains their good
   cycling ability, which was determined herein by cyclic voltammetry and
   galvanostic charge-discharge methods, with high capacities up to 380 F
   g(-1) at elevated voltage and temperature, i.e., Delta E = 2.8 V and 80
   degrees C for the LiTFSI-MAc mixture at x(Li), = 0.25, for example. The
   electrochemical resistances ESR (equivalent series resistance) and EDR
   (equivalent diffusion resistance) evaluated using electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements clearly demonstrate that
   according to the nature of anion, the mechanism of ions adsorption can
   be described by pure double-layer adsorption at the specific surface or
   by the insertion of desolvated ions into the ultramicropores of the
   activated carbon material. The insertion of lithium ions is observed by
   the presence of two reversible peaks in the CVs when the operating
   voltage exceeds 2 V. Finally, the efficiency and capacitance of
   symmetric AC/AC systems were then evaluated to show the imbalance carbon
   electrodes caused by important lithium insertion at the negative and by
   the saturation of the positive by anions, both mechanisms prevent in
   fact the system to be operational. Considering the promising properties,
   especially their cost, hazard, and risks of these DESs series, their
   introduction as safer electrolytes could represent an important
   challenge for the realization of environmentally friendly EDLCs

Title = {{IEEE 802.11 medium access control enhancements based on simultaneous
   multiple-input multiple-output bandwidth sharing}},

Abstract = {{The demand for higher data rate has spurred the adoption of
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission techniques in IEEE
   802.11 products. MIMO techniques provide an additional spatial dimension
   that can significantly increase the channel capacity. A number of
   multiuser MIMO system have been proposed, where the multiple antenna at
   the physical layer are employed for multiuser access, allowing multiple
   users to share the same bandwidth. As these MIMO physical layer
   technologies further evolve, the usable bandwidth per application
   increases; hence, the average service time per application decreases.
   However, in the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function-based
   systems, a considerable amount of bandwidth is wasted during the medium
   access and coordination process. Therefore, as the usable bandwidth is
   enhanced using MIMO technology, the bandwidth wastage of medium access
   and coordination becomes a significant performance bottleneck. Hence,
   there is a fundamental need for bandwidth sharing schemes at the medium
   access control (MAC) layer where multiple connections can concurrently
   use the increased bandwidth provided by the physical layer MIMO
   technologies. In this paper, we propose the MIMO-aware rate splitting
   (MRS) MAC protocol and examine its behavior under different scenarios.
   MRS is a distributed MAC protocol where nodes locally cooperate with one
   another to share bandwidth via splitting the spatial channels of MIMO
   systems. Simulation results of MRS protocol are obtained and compared
   with those of IEEE 802.11n protocol. We show that our proposed MRS
   scheme can significantly outperform the IEEE 802.11n in medium access
   delay and throughput. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   flow: Shear stress response}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{We examine the simplest relevant molecular model for large-amplitude
   shear (LAOS) flow of a polymeric liquid: the suspension of rigid
   dumbbells in a Newtonian solvent. We find explicit analytical
   expressions for the shear rate amplitude and frequency dependences of
   the first and third harmonics of the alternating shear stress response.
   We include a detailed comparison of these predictions with the
   corresponding results for the simplest relevant continuum model: the
   corotational Maxwell model. We find that the responses of both models
   are qualitatively similar. The rigid dumbbell model relies entirely on
   the dumbbell orientation to explain the viscoelastic response of the
   polymeric liquid, including the higher harmonics in large-amplitude
   oscillatory shear flow. Our analysis employs the general method of Bird
   and Armstrong {[}{''}Time-dependent flows of dilute solutions of rodlike
   macromolecules,{''} J. Chem. Phys. 56, 3680 (1972)] for analyzing the
   behavior of the rigid dumbbell model in any unsteady shear flow. We
   derive the first three terms of the deviation of the orientational
   distribution function from the equilibrium state. Then, after getting
   the ``paren functions,{''} we use these for evaluating the shear stress
   for LAOS flow. We find the shapes of the shear stress versus shear rate
   loops predicted to be reasonable. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical models are useful tools that aid in understanding complex
   flows and the distribution of suspended material over large geographic
   areas and during extreme weather events. Here we describe the use of a
   three-dimensional numerical model (Delft3D) to simulate freshwater and
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) transport over a 3-week period, following
   intense precipitation that led to high river discharge into the brackish
   Neuse River Estuary (NRE), NC, from Hurricane Irene (Aug. 2011). The
   model was calibrated and validated using field measurements of water
   level elevations, vertical salinity profiles, and surface DOC
   concentrations in the estuary. DOC was simulated as a conservative
   tracer over the study period. Model results indicate differences in the
   intensity of the freshwater and DOC-laden plumes as they propagated
   along estuary due to a one week time lag between the maximum discharge
   of 540 m(3) s(-1) and maximum DOC concentration of 29.85 mg L-1 entering
   the NRE from the river. In the upper estuary, the surface DOC
   concentration increased by 18 mg L-1 above the pre-storm value of 7 mg
   L-1; the maximum concentration occurred 10 days after the passage of the
   storm. In the lower estuary, the outer edge of the DOC plume reached
   Pamlico Sound after 3 weeks with a surface DOC concentration that was 3
   mg L-1 above the pre-storm value. Results also indicate cross-channel
   salinity differences up to 10 ppt and DOC concentration differences up
   to 15 mg L-1 in the upper NRE to due to wind-driven motion of the
   estuary. The methods described here could be applied to other coastal
   plain estuarine systems to simulate and characterize flow rates and DOC
   transport during and succeeding storm events where field measurements
   are often limited. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Boron-modified Pd catalysts have shown excellent performance for the
   selective hydrogenation of alkynes experimentally. In the current work,
   we investigated the hydrogenation of acetylene on boron-modified Pd(111)
   and Pd(211) surfaces, utilizing density functional theory calculations.
   The activity of acetylene hydrogenation has been studied by estimating
   the effective barrier of the whole process. The selectivity of ethylene
   formation is investigated from a comparison between the desorption and
   the hydrogenation of ethylene as well as comparison between the ethylene
   and the 1,3-butadiene formation. Formation of subsurface carbon and
   hydrogen on both boron-modified Pd(111) and Pd(211) surfaces has also
   been evaluated, since these have been reported to affect both the
   activity and the selectivity of acetylene hydrogenation to produce
   ethylene on Pd surfaces. Our results provide some important insights
   into the Pd B catalysts for selective hydrogenation of acetylene and
   also for more complex hydrogenation systems, such as stereoselective
   hydrogenation of longer chain alkynes and selective hydrogenation of

Abstract = {{The process of using solar energy to split water to produce hydrogen
   assisted by an inorganic semiconductor is crucial for solving our energy
   crisis and environmental problems in the future. However, most
   semiconductor photocatalysts would not exhibit excellent photocatalytic
   activity without loading suitable co-catalysts. Generally, the noble
   metals have been widely applied as co-catalysts, but always agglomerate
   during the loading process or photocatalytic reaction. Therefore, the
   utilization efficiency of the noble co-catalysts is still very low on a
   per metal atom basis if no obvious size effect exists, because
   heterogeneous catalytic reactions occur on the surface active atoms.
   Here, for the first time, we have synthesized isolated metal atoms (Pt,
   Pd, Rh, or Ru) stably by anchoring on TiO2, a model photocatalystic
   system, by a facile one-step method. The isolated metal atom based
   photocatalysts show excellent stability for H-2 evolution and can lead
   to a 6-13-fold increase in photocatalytic activity over the metal
   clusters loaded on TiO2 by the traditional method. Furthermore, the
   configurations of isolated atoms as well as the originality of their
   unusual stability were analyzed by a collaborative work from both
   experiments and theoretical calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Extrusion is one of the major methods for processing polymeric materials
   and the thermal homogeneity of the process output is a major concern for
   manufacture of high quality extruded products. Therefore, accurate
   process thermal monitoring and control are important for product quality
   control. However, most industrial extruders use single point
   thermocouples for the temperature monitoring/control although their
   measurements are highly affected by the barrel metal wall temperature.
   Currently, no industrially established thermal profile measurement
   technique is available. Furthermore, it has been shown that the melt
   temperature changes considerably with the die radial position and hence
   point/bulk measurements are not sufficient for monitoring and control of
   the temperature across the melt flow. The majority of process thermal
   control methods are based on linear models which are not capable of
   dealing with process nonlinearities. In this work, the die melt
   temperature profile of a single screw extruder was monitored by a
   thermocouple mesh technique. The data obtained was used to develop a
   novel approach of modelling the extruder die melt temperature profile
   under dynamic conditions (i.e. for predicting the die melt temperature
   profile in real-time). These newly proposed models were in good
   agreement with the measured unseen data. They were then used to explore
   the effects of process settings, material and screw geometry on the die
   melt temperature profile. The results showed that the process thermal
   homogeneity was affected in a complex manner by changing the process
   settings, screw geometry and material. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Graphene was prepared by low temperature vacuum-assisted thermal
   exfoliation of graphite oxide. The resulting thermally reduced graphene
   oxide (TRGO) had a specific surface area of 586 m(2)/g and consisted of
   a mixture of single-layered and multilayered graphene. The TRGO was
   added to maleated linear low-density polyethylene LLDPE and to its
   derivatives with pyridine aromatic groups by melt compounding. The
   LLDPE/TRGO composites exhibited very low electrical percolation
   thresholds, between 0.5 and 0.9 vol \%, depending on the matrix
   viscosity and the type of functional groups. The dispersion of the TRGO
   in the compatibilized composites was improved significantly, due to
   enhanced noncovalent interactions between the aromatic moieties grafted
   onto the polymer matrix and the filler. Better dispersion resulted in a
   slight increase in the rheological and electrical percolation
   thresholds, and to significant improvements in mechanical properties and
   thermal conductivity, compared to the noncompatibilized composites. The
   presence of high surface area nanoplatelets within the polymer also
   resulted in a substantially improved thermal stability. Compared to
   their counterparts containing multiwalled carbon nanotubes, LLDPE/TRGO
   composites had lower percolation thresholds. Therefore, lower amounts of
   TRGO were sufficient to impart electrical conductivity and modulus
   improvements, without compromising the ductility of the composites.}},

Abstract = {{Ethnopharmacological relevance: The ethnobotanical use of Aframomum

   acetone:methanol and 2:1 chloroform:methanol extracts were tested
   against Escherichia coli K12; acetone extract and the fractions of
   acetone extracts were tested against Listeria monocytogenes.
   Bioassay-guided fractionation was performed on the extract using L
   monocytogenes as the test organism to isolate the bioactive compounds
   which were then tested against all the other organisms. Results: Four
   known labdane diterpenes (G3 and G5) were isolated for the first time
   from the rhizomes of A. melegueta and purified. These were tested
   against E. coli, L monocytogenes, methicillin resistant Staphylococus
   aureus (MRSA) and S. aureus to determine antibacterial activity. The
   result showed that two compounds G3 and G5 exhibited more potent
   antibacterial activity compared to the current clinically used
   antibiotics ampicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin and can be potential
   antibacterial lead compounds. The structure of the labdane diterpenes
   were elucidated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and
   Mass spectrometry. A possible mode of action of the isolated compound G3
   and its potential cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells were also
   discussed. Conclusion: The results confirmed the presence of
   antibacterial compounds in the rhizomes of A. melegueta with a
   favourable toxicity profile which could be further optimized as

Abstract = {{The average-density approximation is used to construct a nonlocal
   kinetic energy functional for an inhomogeneous two-dimensional Fermi
   gas. This functional is then used to formulate a Thomas-Fermi-von
   Weizsacker-like theory for the description of the ground-state
   properties of the system. The quality of the kinetic energy functional
   is tested by performing a fully self-consistent calculation for an
   ideal, harmonically confined, two-dimensional system. Good agreement
   with exact results are found, with the number and kinetic energy
   densities exhibiting oscillatory structure associated with the
   nonlocality of the energy functional. Most importantly, this functional
   shows a marked improvement over the two-dimensional Thomas-Fermi von
   Weizsacker theory, particularly in the vicinity of the classically
   forbidden region.}},

Abstract = {{At Mistaken Point, Newfoundland, Canada, rangeomorph ``fronds{''}
   dominate the earliest (579-565 million years ago) fossil communities of
   large (0.1 to 2 m height) multicellular benthic eukaryotes. They lived
   in low-flow environments, fueled by uptake {[}1-3] of dissolved
   reactants (osmotrophy). However, prokaryotes are effective osmotrophs,
   and the advantage of taller eukaryotic osmotrophs in this deep-water
   community context has not been addressed. We reconstructed flow-velocity
   profiles and vertical mixing using canopy flow models appropriate to the
   densities of the observed communities. Further modeling of processes at
   organismal surfaces documents increasing uptake with height in the
   community as a function of thinning of the diffusive boundary layer with
   increased velocity. The velocity profile, produced by canopy flow in the
   community, generates this advantage of upward growth. Alternative models
   of upward growth advantage based on redox/resource gradients fail, given
   the efficiency of vertical mixing. In benthic communities of osmotrophs
   of sufficient density, access to flow in low-flow settings provides an
   advantage to taller architecture, providing a selectional driver for
   communities of tall eukaryotes in contexts where phototropism cannot
   contribute to upward growth. These Ediacaran deep-sea fossils were
   preserved during the increasing oxygenation prior to the Cambrian
   radiation of animals and likely represent an important phase in the
   ecological and evolutionary transition to more complex eukaryotic forms.}},

Abstract = {{Smart grids (SG) represent the next step in modernizing the current
   electric grid. In this structure, a communications network is combined
   with the power grid in order to gather information that can be used to
   increase the efficiency of the grid, reduce power consumption, and
   improve the reliability of services, among other numerous advantages. SG
   communication networks are unique in their large scale and the limited
   capabilities of nodes which present several challenges in the design of
   efficient routing protocols. This paper provides a comprehensive survey
   of the main networking challenges present in the design of SG
   communication networks, and some of the important routing protocols
   proposed to address those challenges. Various technologies and
   architectures proposed for routing in SGs are discussed. A detailed
   comparison of the protocols considered in this paper is also given, and
   key areas that require further investigation are highlighted.}},

Title = {{Behavior of Coupling Band Joints in Buried Corrugated Steel Pipelines}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Proper design of joints in buried gravity flow pipelines should account
   for the demands generated in these elements when the system is subjected
   to surface loading. However, the behavior of joints under these loading
   conditions has received scant attention despite the fact that joint
   failure could cause the system to reach serviceability or strength
   limits because of leakage and soil erosion. The purpose of this study is
   to examine the response of band joints in corrugated steel pipes when
   subjected to surface vehicle loading and to examine the influence of
   burial quality, burial depth, and loading location on the joint
   response. To achieve this, large-scale laboratory testing of two
   900-mm-diameter corrugated steel pipelines was performed, subjecting the
   specimens to the maximum service load (multiple configurations) and to
   the fully factored load (one configuration) while monitoring their
   response. The data obtained permit the key structural demands generated
   at the joint during surface loading to be identified and an observation
   of the failure mode. Recommendations are also made regarding the
   development of soil-pipe interaction analysis for use in structural
   design.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{An experimental investigation was undertaken to compare the performance
   of a largely intact steel culvert with well-compacted backfill with a
   corroded culvert in loose backfill. The behavior of both structures is
   compared during backfilling and under imposed surface loads equivalent
   to the standard American and Canadian design trucks at two burial depths
   (0.6 and 0.9 m). During backfilling, the deteriorated culvert
   deflections were much larger than the intact culvert because of
   differences in both culvert and backfill stiffnesses. Under surface
   loading, the deteriorated culvert experienced higher deflections and
   bending moments, whereas the intact culvert experienced higher thrust
   forces. It was found that, under relatively shallow cover, the load from
   one wheel pad of the axle influenced the behavior of the culvert under
   the other wheel pad. The deteriorated culvert was then tested to failure
   with localized bending in the crown and buckling of the remaining steel
   in the corroded region serving as indicators of failure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an adaptive estimation technique is proposed for the
   estimation of time-varying parameters for a class of continuous-time
   nonlinear system. A set-based adaptive estimation is used to estimate
   the time-varying parameters along with an uncertainty set. The proposed
   method is such that the uncertainty set update is guaranteed to contain
   the true value of the parameters. Unlike existing techniques that rely
   on the use of polynomial approximations of the time-varying behaviour of
   the parameters, the proposed technique does require a functional
   representation of the time-varying behaviour of the parameter estimates.
   A simulation example and a building systems estimation example are
   considered to illustrate the developed procedure and ascertain the
   theoretical results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments have been performed in the Shallow Water Wave Basin of DHI
   (Horsholm, Denmark), on large arrays of up to 25 heaving point absorber
   type Wave Energy Converters (WECs), for a range of geometric layout
   configurations and wave conditions. WEC response and modifications of
   the wave field are measured to provide data for understanding WEC array
   interactions and to evaluate array interaction numerical models. Each
   WEC consists of a buoy with a diameter of 0.315 m and power take-off
   (PTO) is modeled by realizing friction based energy dissipation through
   damping of the WEC's motion. Wave gauges are located within and around
   the WEC array. Wave conditions studied include regular, polychromatic,
   long-and short-crested irregular waves. A rectilinear arrangement of WEC
   support structures is employed such that several array configurations
   can be studied. In this paper, the experimental arrangement and the
   obtained database are presented. Also, results for wave height
   attenuation downwave a rectilinear array of 25 heaving WECs are
   presented, for the case of irregular waves. Up to 16.3\% and 18.1\%
   (long-crested) and 11.2\% and 18.1\% (short-crested waves) reduction in
   significant wave height is observed downwave the WEC array, for the
   radiated wave field only and for the combination of
   incident-diffracted-radiated (perturbed) wave field, respectively. Using
   spectra at different locations within and around the array, the wave

Abstract = {{One-way glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforced concrete slabs
   at elevated temperatures are investigated through numerical modeling.
   Serviceability and strength requirements of ACI-440.1R are considered
   for the design of the slabs. Diagrams to determine fire endurance of
   slabs by employing ``strength domain{''} failure criterion are
   presented. Comparisons between the existing ``temperature domain{''}
   method with the more representative ``strength domain{''} method show
   that the ``temperature domain{''} method is conservative. Additionally,
   a method to increase the fire endurance of slabs by placing FRP
   reinforcement in two layers is investigated numerically. The amount of
   fire endurance gained by placing FRP in two layers increases as the
   thickness of slab increases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the identification and output tracking control
   of a class of Hammerstein systems through a wireless network within an

   network are modelled using the inverse Gaussian cumulative distribution
   function. In the proposed framework, a new networked identification
   algorithm is proposed to compensate for the influence of the wireless
   network delays so as to acquire the more precise Hammerstein system
   model. Then, the identified model together with the model-based approach
   is used to design an output tracking controller. Mean square stability
   conditions are given using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and the
   optimal controller gains can be obtained by solving the corresponding
   optimization problem expressed using LMIs. Illustrative numerical
   simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   proposed method.}},

Title = {{Implantation of Scaffold-Free Engineered Cartilage Constructs in a

Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL ORGANS}},

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Joint resurfacing techniques offer an attractive treatment for damaged
   or diseased cartilage, as this tissue characteristically displays a
   limited capacity for self-repair. While tissue-engineered cartilage
   constructs have shown efficacy in repairing focal cartilage defects in
   animal models, a substantial number of cells are required to generate
   sufficient quantities of tissue for the repair of larger defects. In a
   previous study, we developed a novel approach to generate large,
   scaffold-free cartilaginous constructs from a small number of donor
   cells (20000 cells to generate a 3-cm(2) tissue construct). As
   comparable thicknesses to native cartilage could be achieved, the
   purpose of the present study was to assess the ability of these
   constructs to survive implantation as well as their potential for the
   repair of critical-sized chondral defects in a rabbit model. Evaluated
   up to 6 months post-implantation, allogenic constructs survived weight
   bearing without a loss of implant fixation. Implanted constructs
   appeared to integrate near-seamlessly with the surrounding native
   cartilage and also to extensively remodel with increasing time in vivo.
   By 6 months post-implantation, constructs appeared to adopt both a
   stratified (zonal) appearance and a biochemical composition similar to
   native articular cartilage. In addition, constructs that expressed
   superficial zone markers displayed higher histological scores,
   suggesting that transcriptional prescreening of constructs prior to
   implantation may serve as an approach to achieve superior and/or more
   consistent reparative outcomes. As the results of this initial animal
   study were encouraging, future studies will be directed toward the
   repair of chondral defects in more mechanically demanding anatomical
   locations.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are promising alternatives to
   conventional silicon devices because of their simple fabrication
   procedure, low cost, and high efficiency. Platinum is generally used as
   a superior counter electrode (CE) material, but the disadvantages such
   as high cost and low abundance greatly restrict the large-scale
   application of DSCs. An efficient and sustainable way to overcome the
   limited supply of Pt is the development of high-efficiency Pt-free CE
   materials, which should possess both high electrical conductivity and
   superior electrocatalytic activity simultaneously. Herein, for the first
   time, a two-step strategy to synthesize ruthenium dioxide (RuO2)
   nanocrystals is reported, and it is shown that RuO2 catalysts exhibit
   promising electrocatalytic activity towards triiodide reduction, which
   results in comparable energy conversion efficiency to that of
   conventional Pt CEs. More importantly, by virtue of first-principles
   calculations, the catalytic mechanism of electrocatalysis for triiodide
   reduction on various CEs is investigated systematically and it is found
   that the electrochemical triiodide reduction reaction on RuO2 catalyst
   surfaces can be enhanced significantly, owing to the ideal combination
   of good electrocatalytic activity and high electrical conductivity.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{A simple yet efficient harmony search (HS) method with a new pitch
   adjustment rule (NPAHS) is proposed for dynamic economic dispatch (DED)
   of electrical power systems, a large-scale non-linear real time
   optimization problem imposed by a number of complex constraints. The new
   pitch adjustment rule is based on the perturbation information and the
   mean value of the harmony memory, which is simple to implement and helps
   to enhance solution quality and convergence speed. A new constraint
   handling technique is also developed to effectively handle various
   constraints in the DED problem, and the violation of ramp rate limits
   between the first and last scheduling intervals that is often ignored by
   existing approaches for DED problems is effectively eliminated. To
   validate the effectiveness, the NPAHS is first tested on 10 popular
   benchmark functions with 100 dimensions, in comparison with four HS
   variants and five state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms. Then, NPAHS
   is used to solve three 24-h DED systems with 5,15 and 54 units, which
   consider the valve point effects, transmission loss, emission and
   prohibited operating zones. Simulation results on all these systems show
   the scalability and superiority of the proposed NPAHS on various large
   scale problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Whole-vehicle modelling of exhaust energy recovery on a diesel-electric
   hybrid bus}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid vehicles can use energy storage systems to disconnect the engine
   from the driving wheels of the vehicle. This enables the engine to be
   run closer to its optimum operating condition, but fuel energy is still
   wasted through the exhaust system as heat. The use of a turbogenerator
   on the exhaust line addresses this problem by capturing some of the
   otherwise wasted heat and converting it into useful electrical energy.
   This paper outlines the work undertaken to model the engine of a
   diesel-electric hybrid bus, coupled with a hybrid powertrain model which
   analysed the performance of a hybrid vehicle over a drive-cycle. The
   distribution of the turbogenerator power was analysed along with the
   effect on the fuel consumption of the bus. This showed that including
   the turbogenerator produced a 2.4\% reduction in fuel consumption over a
   typical drive-cycle.
   The hybrid bus generator was then optimised to improve the performance
   of the combined vehicle/engine package and the turbogenerator was then
   shown to offer a 3.0\% reduction in fuel consumption. The financial
   benefits of using the turbogenerator were also considered in terms of
   fuel savings for operators. For an average bus, a turbogenerator could
   reduce fuel costs by around 1200 pound per year. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology for solving the multivehicle
   formation control problem. It employs a unique
   extension-decomposition-aggregation scheme to transform the overall
   complex formation control problem into a group of subproblems, which
   work via boundary interactions or disturbances. Thus, it is proved that
   the overall formation system is exponentially stable in the sense of
   Lyapunov, if all the individual augmented subsystems (IASs) are stable.
   Linear matrix inequality-based H-infinity control methodology is
   employed to design the decentralized formation controllers to reject the
   impact of the formation changes being treated as boundary disturbances
   and guarantee the stability of all the IASs, consequently maintaining
   the stability of the overall formation system. Simulation studies are
   performed to verify the stability, performance, and effectiveness of the
   proposed strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy ion irradiation induced damage in Inconel X-750 at low
   temperatures (60-400 degrees C) has been reported in our previous study.
   In the current investigation, the microstructure evolution and phase
   change during heavy (1 MeV Kr2+) irradiation at elevated temperatures
   (500 C and 600 degrees C) were characterized under in situ observation
   of intermediate voltage electron microscope (IVEM) at Argonne National
   Laboratory. For each temperature, defect analyses using the weak beam
   dark field method were carried out at several doses, up to 5.4 dpa.
   Small defects (<5 nm) yielded from high temperature irradiation comprise
   mainly stacking fault tetrahedras (SFTs), small 1/3 < 1 1 1 > and 1/2 <
   1 1 0 > type dislocation loops. Large interstitial Frank loops were
   observed and a clear characteristic for growth of loops was
   video-captured. Unfaulting of interstitial Frank loops was observed. The
   number density of the defects saturated at a relatively low dose of 0.68
   dpa. No obvious change of defect fraction was found with increasing
   dose, but more complex dislocation structures formed at higher doses. In
   contrast to low temperature irradiation, the primary strengthening phase
   gamma' was found to be stable during irradiation at temperatures >500
   degrees C and was not disordered up to 5.4 dpa. No cavities were
   observed after the irradiation even at 600 degrees C. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The pressure and velocity field in a one-dimensional acoustic waveguide
   can be sensed in a non-intrusive manner using spatially distributed
   microphones. Experimental characterization with sensor arrangements of
   this type has many applications in measurement and control. This paper
   presents a method for measuring the acoustic variables in a duct under
   fluctuating propagation conditions with specific focus on in-system
   calibration and tracking of the system parameters of a three-microphone
   measurement configuration. The tractability of the non-linear
   optimization problem that results from taking a parametric approach is
   investigated alongside the influence of extraneous measurement noise on
   the parameter estimates. The validity and accuracy of the method are
   experimentally assessed in terms of the ability of the calibrated system
   to separate the propagating waves under controlled conditions. The
   tracking performance is tested through measurements with a time-varying
   mean flow, including an experiment conducted under propagation
   conditions similar to those in a wind instrument during playing. (C)

Abstract = {{Through combined theoretical and experimental efforts, the reaction
   mechanism of ethanol steam reforming on Rh catalysts was studied. The
   results suggest that acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) is an important reaction
   intermediate in the reaction on nanosized Rh catalyst. Our theoretical
   work suggests that the H-bond effect significantly modifies the ethanol
   decomposition pathway. The possible reaction pathway on Rh (211) surface
   is suggested as CH3CH2OH -> CH3CH2O -> CH3CHO -> CH3CO -> CH3 + CO ->
   CH2 + CO -> CH + CO -> C + CO, followed by the water gas shift reaction
   to yield H-2 and CO2. In addition, we found that the water-gas shift
   reaction, not the ethanol decomposition, is the bottleneck for the
   overall ethanol steam reforming process. The CO + OH association is
   considered the key step, with a sizable energy barrier of 1.31 eV. The
   present work first discusses the mechanisms and the water effect in
   ethanol steam reforming reactions on Rh catalyst from both theoretical
   and experimental standpoints, which may shed light on designing improved
   catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Carboxyl-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been
   successfully radiolabelled with cobalt-57 (Co-57) (T-1/2 = 270 days) via
   the attachment of the bifunctional caged ligand MeAMN(3)S(3)sar. In this
   study MeAMN(3)S(3)sar has been synthesized and coupled to MWCNTs to form
   the conjugate MWCNT MeAMN(3)S(3)sar. Synthesis was confirmed with
   nuclear magnetic resonance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   confirmed the conjugation. Non-radioactive labelling of this conjugate
   was completed with Cu(II) ions to confirm the stability of the
   MeAMN(3)S(3)sar after coupling with the MWCNTs. The complexation of the
   Cu(II) was also confirmed with XPS. Transmission electron microscopy was
   used to demonstrate that the coupling reaction had a negligible effect
   on the size and shape of the MWCNTs. Radiolabelling of the MWCNT
   MeAMN(3)S(3)sar conjugate and pristine (untreated) MWCNTs (nonspecific)
   with the gamma-emitting radioactive isotope Co-57 were compared. The
   radiolabelling efficiency of the MWCNT MeAMN(3)S(3-)sar conjugate was
   significantly higher (95\% vs. 0.1\%) (P <= 0.001) than for the
   unconjugated pristine MWCNTs. This will allow for the potential tracking
   of nanoparticle movement in vitro and in vivo. Crown Copyright (C) 2013

   deliver adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), filling irregular defects and
   stimulating natural soft tissue regeneration, would have significant
   value in plastic and reconstructive surgery. With this focus, the
   primary aim of the current study was to characterize the response of
   human ASCs encapsulated within three-dimensional bioscaffolds
   incorporating decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) as a bioactive matrix
   within photo-cross-linkable methacrylated glycol chitosan (MGC) or
   methacnrlated chondroitin sulphate (MCS) delivery vehicles. Stable MGC-
   and MCS-based composite scaffolds were fabricated containing up to 5
   wt\% cryomilled DAT through initiation with long-wavelength ultraviolet
   light. The encapsulation strategy allows for tuning of the 3-D
   microenvironment and provides an effective method of cell delivery with
   high seeding efficiency and uniformity, which could be adapted as a
   minimally-invasive in situ approach. Through in vitro cell culture
   studies, human ASCs were assessed over 14 days in terms of viability,
   glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) enzyme activity, adipogenic
   gene expression and intracellular lipid accumulation. In all of the
   composites, the DAT functioned as a cell-supportive matrix that enhanced
   ASC viability, retention and adipogenesis within the gels. The choice of
   hydrogel also influenced the cell response, with significantly higher
   viability and adipogenic differentiation observed in the MCS composites
   containing 5 wt\% DAT. In vivo analysis in a subcutaneous Wistar rat
   model at 1, 4 and 12 weeks showed superior implant integration and
   adipogenesis in the MCS-based composites, with allogenic ASCs promoting
   cell infiltration, angiogenesis and ultimately, fat formation. (C) 2013

   communication systems using coherent detection over atmospheric

   proposed to overcome turbulence-induced fading and phase noise from

   Their error rate performance is analyzed for a wide range of turbulence
   conditions. With developed analytical error rate expressions, the
   usefulness of the proposed Alamouti-type space-time block coding is
   demonstrated for coherent optical wireless communication systems.
   Numerical results confirm the performance improvements of the proposed

Abstract = {{A new strategy for remote reconfiguration of an antenna array far field
   radiation pattern is described. The scheme uses a pilot tone
   co-transmitted with a carrier signal from a location distant from that
   of a receive antenna array whose far field pattern is to be
   reconfigured. By mixing the co-transmitted signals locally at each
   antenna element in the array an IF signal is formed which defines an
   equivalent array spacing that can be made variable by tuning the
   frequency of the pilot tone with respect to the RF carrier. This makes
   the antenna array factor hence far field spatial characteristic
   reconfigurable on receive. For a 10 x 1 microstrip patch element array
   we show that the receive pattern can be made to vary from 35 to 10
   degrees half power beam width as the difference frequency between the
   pilot and the carrier at 2.45 GHz varies between 10 MHz and 500 MHz
   carrier.}},

Abstract = {{Adipose tissue is an abundant source of multipotent progenitor cells
   that have shown promise in regenerative medicine. In humans, fat is
   primarily distributed in the subcutaneous and visceral depots, which
   have varying biochemical and functional properties. In most studies to
   date, subcutaneous adipose tissue has been investigated as the
   adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) source. In this study, we sought to
   develop a broader understanding of the influence of specific adipose
   tissue depots on the isolated ASC populations through a systematic
   comparison of donor-matched abdominal subcutaneous fat and omentum, and
   donor-matched pericardial adipose tissue and thymic remnant samples. We
   found depot-dependent and donor-dependent variability in the yield,
   viability, immunophenotype, clonogenic potential, doubling time, and
   adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation capacities of the ASC
   populations. More specifically, ASCs isolated from both intrathoracic
   depots had a longer average doubling time and a significantly higher
   proportion of CD34(+) cells at passage 2, as compared with cells
   isolated from subcutaneous fat. or the omentum. Furthermore, ASCs from
   subcutaneous and pericardial adipose tissue demonstrated enhanced
   adipogenic differentiation capacity, whereas ASCs isolated from the
   omentum displayed the highest levels of osteogenic markers in culture.
   Through cell culture analysis under hypoxic (5\% O-2) conditions, oxygen
   tension was shown to be a key mediator of colony-forming unit-fibroblast
   number and osteogenesis for all depots. Overall, our results suggest
   that depot selection is an important factor to consider when applying
   ASCs in tissue-specific cell-based regenerative therapies, and also
   highlight pericardial adipose tissue as a potential new ASC source.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic wind confinement has been proposed as one explanation for the
   complex wind structures of supergiant stars of spectral types B and A.
   Observational investigation of this hypothesis was undertaken using
   high-resolution (lambda/Delta lambda similar to 65 000) circular
   polarization (Stokes V) spectra of six late B- and early A-type
   supergiants (beta Ori, B8Iae; 4 Lac, B9Iab; eta Leo, A0Ib; HR1040, A0Ib;
   alpha Cyg, A2Iae; nu Cep, A2Iab), obtained with the instruments ESPaDOnS
   and Narval at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Bernard Lyot
   Telescope. Least-squares deconvolution (LSD) analysis of the Stokes V
   spectra of all stars yields no evidence of a magnetic field, with best
   longitudinal field 1 sigma error bars ranging from similar to 0.5 to
   similar to 4.5G for most stars. Spectrum synthesis analysis of the LSD
   profiles using Bayesian inference yields an upper limit with 95.4 per
   cent credibility on the polar strength of the (undetected) surface
   dipole fields of individual stars ranging from 3 to 30 G. These results
   strongly suggest that magnetic wind confinement due to organized dipolar
   magnetic fields is not the origin of the wind variability of BA
   supergiant stars. Upper limits for magnetic spots may also be
   inconsistent with magnetic wind confinement in the limit of large spot
   size and filling factor, depending on the adopted wind parameters.
   Therefore, if magnetic spots are responsible for the wind variability of
   BA supergiant stars, they likely occupy a small fraction of the
   photosphere.}},

Abstract = {{The seismoelectric method is based on the interpretation of the
   electrical field associated with the conversion of mechanical to
   electromagnetic energy during the propagation of seismic waves in
   heterogeneous porous media. We propose an extension of a poroacoustic
   model that takes into account fluid flow and the effect of saturation.
   This model is coupled with an electrokinetic model accounting for the
   effect of saturation and in agreement with available experimental data
   in sands and carbonate rocks. We also developed new scaling laws for the
   permeability, the streaming potential coupling coefficient and the
   capillary entry pressure of porous media. The theory is developed for
   frequencies much below the critical frequency at which inertial effects
   starts to dominate in the Navier-Stokes equation (>10 kHz). The
   equations used to compute the propagation of the P waves and the
   seismoelectric effect in unsaturated condition are solved with finite
   elements using triangular meshing. We demonstrate the usefulness of a
   recently developed technique, seismoelectric beamforming, to localize
   saturation fronts by focusing seismic waves and looking at the resulting
   seismoelectric conversions. This method is applied to a cross-hole
   problem showing how a saturation front characterized by a drop in the
   electrical conductivity and compressibility is responsible for
   seismoelectric conversions. These conversions can be used, in turn, to
   determine the position of the front over time.}},

   enhancement from a value of 1.1 x 10(7) to 2.03 x 10(8) a{''}broken
   vertical bar cm with the increase in Nd3+ and Co2+ concentration. The
   dielectric constant exhibits high value at low frequencies and decreases
   with the increase of frequency. The tangent dielectric loss shows the
   abnormal behavior which can be explained on the basis of hopping between
   the Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions on octahedral sites. The maximum value of tangent
   loss at low frequencies reflects the application of these materials in
   medium frequency devices (MF).}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of an analysis of archival 21 cm (HI) data of the
   blue compact dwarf galaxy Haro 11 (ESO 350-IG038). Observations were
   obtained at the Very Large Array, and the presence of a compact
   absorption feature near the optical centre of the galaxy has been
   detected. The central location of the absorption feature coincides with
   the centre of the continuum background of the galaxy, as well as with
   the location of knot B. The absorption feature yields an HI mass in the
   range of 3-10 x 10(8) M-circle dot, corresponding to spin temperatures
   from 91 K to 200 K, respectively. The absence of HI seen in emission
   places an upper limit of 1.7 x 10(9) M-circle dot on the mass. To our
   knowledge this is the first example of a dwarf galaxy that shows HI
   absorption from its own background continuum. The continuum emission
   from the galaxy is also used to determine star formation rates, namely
   6.85 +/- 0.05 M-circle dot yr(-1) (for a stellar mass range of 5
   M-circle dot < M < 100 M-circle dot), or 32.8 +/- 0.2 M-circle dot

Title = {{Fracture strength of machined ceramic crowns as a function of tooth

Journal = {{DENTAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{234-241}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To determine, by means of static fracture testing the effect
   of the tooth preparation design and the elastic modulus of the cement on
   the structural integrity of the cemented machined ceramic crown-tooth
   complex.
   Methods. Human maxillary extracted premolar teeth were prepared for
   all-ceramic crowns using two preparation designs; a standard preparation
   in accordance with established protocols and a novel design with a flat
   occlusal design. All-ceramic feldspathic (Vita MK II) crowns were milled
   for all the preparations using a CAD/CAM system (CEREC-3). The machined
   allceramic crowns were resin bonded to the tooth structure using one of
   three cements with different elastic moduli: Super-Bond C\&B, Rely X
   Unicem and Panavia F 2.0. The specimens were subjected to compressive
   force through a 4 mm diameter steel ball at a crosshead speed of 1
   mm/min using a universal test machine (Loyds Instrument Model LRX.). The
   load at the fracture point was recorded for each specimen in Newtons
   (N). These values were compared to a control group of
   unprepared/unrestored teeth.
   Results. There was a significant difference between the control group,
   with higher fracture strength, and the cemented samples regardless of
   the occlusal design and the type of resin cement. There was no
   significant difference in mean fracture load between the two designs of
   occlusal preparation using Super-Bond C\&B. For the Rely X Unicem and
   Panavia F 2.0 cements, the proposed preparation design with a flat
   occlusal morphology provides a system with increased fracture strength.
   Significance. The proposed novel flat design showed less dependency on
   the resin cement selection in relation to the fracture strength of the
   restored tooth. The choice of the cement resin, with respect to its
   modulus of elasticity, is more important in the anatomic design than in
   the flat design. (C) 2013 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by

Abstract = {{Bilateral knee strength evaluations of unilateral anterior cruciate
   ligament (ACL) deficient patients using isokinetic dynamometry are
   commonly performed in rehabilitation settings. The most frequently-used
   outcome measure is the peak moment value attained by the knee extensor
   and flexor muscle groups. However, other strength curve features may
   also be of clinical interest and utility. The purpose of this
   investigation was to identify, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
   strength curve features that explain the majority of variation between
   the injured and uninjured knee, and to assess the capabilities of these
   features to detect the presence of injury. A mixed gender cohort of 43
   unilateral ACL deficient patients performed 6 continuous concentric knee
   extension and flexion repetitions bilaterally at 60 degrees s(-1) and
   180 degrees s(-1) within a 90 degrees range of motion. Moment waveforms
   were analyzed using PCA, and binary logistic regression was used to
   develop a discriminatory decision rule. For all directions and speeds, a
   statistically significant overall reduction in strength was noted for
   the involved knee in comparison to the uninvolved knee. The
   discriminatory decision rule yielded a specificity and sensitivity of
   60.5\% and 60.5\%, respectively, corresponding to an accuracy of similar
   to 62\%. As such, the curve features extracted using PCA enabled only
   limited clinical usefulness in discerning between the ACL deficient and
   contra lateral, healthy knee. Improvement in discrimination capabilities
   may perhaps be achieved by consideration of different testing speeds and
   contraction modes, as well as utilization of other data analysis
   techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Assembling aircraft stiffened panels using friction stir welding offers
   potential to reduce fabrication time in comparison to current mechanical
   fastener assembly, making it economically feasible to select
   structurally desirable stiffener pitching and novel panel
   configurations. With such a departure from the traditional fabrication
   process, much research has been conducted on producing strong reliable
   welds, with less examination of the impact of welding process residual
   effects on panel structural behaviour and the development of appropriate
   design methods. This article significantly expands the available panel
   level compressive strength knowledge, demonstrating the strength
   potential of a welded aircraft panel with multiple lateral and
   longitudinal stiffener bays. An accompanying computational study has
   determined the most significant process residual effects that influence
   panel strength and the potential extent of panel degradation. The
   experimental results have also been used to validate a previously
   published design method, suggesting accurate predictions can be made if
   the conventional aerospace design methods are modified to acknowledge
   the welding altered panel properties.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we expand on our understanding of the thrombogenicity of
   coatings prepared with three different recombinant elastin-like
   polypeptides (ELPs). The bulk platelet response of the ELP coatings was
   characterized following whole blood contact under physiological shear
   flow (300 s(-1)) using flow cytometry. Prolonged exposure to shear flow
   (1-h) indicated that materials coated with the longer ELP coatings (ELP2
   and ELP4) had less bulk platelet activation and microparticle formation
   than materials coated with the shorter ELP1. Quartz crystal microbalance
   with dissipation (QCM-D) was used to monitor the binding of the platelet
   membrane receptor GPIIb/IIIa to ELP-adsorbed fibrinogen (Fg) surfaces.
   Compared to the shorter ELPs, a lower amount of Fg adsorbed to the ELP4
   coated material and ELP4 appeared to form a softer, more structurally
   flexible coating layer. When Fg was adsorbed to the ELP coated surface
   it demonstrated an altered binding for GPIIb/IIIa that was inhibited in
   the presence of an AGDV-containing peptide but not an RGD-containing
   peptide. Conversely, on the shorter ELP coatings, binding of GPIIb/IIIa
   to an adsorbed Fg layer was partially inhibited in the presence of an
   RGD-containing peptide. These results indicate that both the quantity
   and conformational state of Fg varies when adsorbed to surfaces coated
   with ELPs of varying sequence length, which may be mediating their
   platelet response. Collectively, the findings reinforce the
   applicability of the ELPs as potential thromboresistant coatings,
   especially with the use of the longer polypeptideELP4. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{The design, development and evaluation of an optical fibre pH sensor for
   monitoring pH in the alkaline region are discussed in detail in this
   paper. The design of this specific pH sensor is based on the pH induced
   change in fluorescence intensity of a coumarin imidazole dye which is
   covalently attached to a polymer network and then fixed to the distal
   end of an optical fibre. The sensor provides a response over a pH range
   of 10.0-13.2 with an acceptable response rate of around 50 min, having
   shown a very good stability over a period of longer than 20 months thus
   far. The sensor has also demonstrated little cross-sensitivity to ionic
   strength (IS) and also excellent photostability through a series of
   laboratory tests. These features make this type of sensor potentially
   well suited for in situ long term monitoring of pH in concrete
   structures, to enhance structural monitoring in the civil engineering
   sector. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Effect of pre-IC annealing treatments on the final microstructure and

Volume = {{594}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the relationship between the microstructure and
   the work hardening behavior of a dual-phase (DP) steel. Various DP
   microstructures were systematically produced by application of different
   pre-IC annealing heat treatments as well as changing the IC annealing
   temperature. It was found that various austenite nucleation sites such
   as grain boundaries, prior pearlite colonies, martensite particles and
   cementite particles, have different nucleation and growth effectiveness
   which significantly influences the microstructure after IC annealing.
   Following a quantitative analysis of all microstructures, the effect of
   microstructural parameters including martensite particle size, volume
   fraction as well as their spatial distribution and morphology, on the
   mechanical behavior of DP steels is examined by considering true work
   hardening rate, instantaneous work hardening rate and the dislocation
   annihilation factor from the Kocks-Mecking analysis. These analyses
   reveal that at constant ratios of volume fraction to size of martensite
   particles, there are significant differences in all the three work
   hardening parameters. It is proposed that these observations are due to
   the effects of morphology and spatial distribution of martensite
   particles. Furthermore, it was shown that the contribution of martensite
   particles to work hardening behavior, via geometrically necessary
   dislocations, is only significant at the early stages of deformation.

Abstract = {{The ionomer in the catalyst layer of polymer electrolyte fuel cells
   exists as ultrathin films (4-10 nm) covering the aggregates of Pt/C
   catalyst and may experience elevated temperatures during hot-pressing
   step of the electrode fabrication process. In this study, we report the
   effect of thermal annealing on pertinent ionomer-film properties: proton
   transport and surface wettability. Self-assembled, 10 nm thin Nafion
   ionomer films on silica substrate were heat treated at different
   temperatures in the range 40-160 degrees C. It was found that both
   surface and bulk rearrangement/reorganization occur simultaneously upon
   annealing. Surface reorganization was evident by the dramatic change in
   free-surface wettability from super-hydrophilic to hydrophobic. On the
   other hand, bulk rearrangement was evident from significant depression
   in the proton conductivity with increasing treatment temperature.
   Extended exposure, up to 18 h, to water in vapor form at high humidity
   did not change the protonic conductivity. On the other hand, exposure to
   liquid water resulted in an interesting finding of simultaneous
   regeneration of the film surface and bulk properties. The latter has
   implications for in operando behavior of ionomer in PEFC cathode
   catalyst layers, where local water and heat generation may strongly
   influence its properties.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen atom abstraction from a series of homopolymers by cumyloxy

   2,2,4,4-tetramethylpentane, respectively. Taken together, abstraction
   efficiency and regioselectivity data are discussed in terms of enthalpic

   emphasis on steric hindrance imposed by methyl substituents on secondary
   positions within PP and PIB. The utility of polymer oxidizability as a

Abstract = {{Green oil, which leads to the deactivation of the catalysts used for the

   formation mechanism is not fully understood. In this work, the formation
   of 1,3-butadiene, known to be the precursor of green oil, on both
   Pd(111) and Pd(211) surfaces is examined using density functional theory
   calculations. The pathways containing C-2 + C-2 coupling reactions as
   well as the corresponding hydrogenation reactions are studied in detail.
   Three pathways for 1,3-butadiene production, namely coupling plus
   hydrogenation and further hydrogenation, hydrogenation plus coupling
   plus hydrogenation, and a two step hydrogenation followed by coupling,
   are determined. By comparing the effective barriers, we identify the
   favored pathway on both surfaces. A general understanding toward the
   deactivation process of the industrial catalysts is also provided. In
   addition, the effects of the formation of subsurface carbon atoms as
   well as the Ag alloying on the 1,3-butadiene formation on Pd-based

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate adaptive linear combinations of graph
   coloring heuristics with a heuristic modifier to address the examination
   timetabling problem. We invoke a normalisation strategy for each
   parameter in order to generalise the specific problem data. Two graph
   coloring heuristics were used in this study (largest degree and
   saturation degree). A score for the difficulty of assigning each
   examination was obtained from an adaptive linear combination of these
   two heuristics and examinations in the list were ordered based on this
   value. The examinations with the score value representing the higher
   difficulty were chosen for scheduling based on two strategies. We tested
   for single and multiple heuristics with and without a heuristic modifier
   with different combinations of weight values for each parameter on the
   Toronto and ITC2007 benchmark data sets. We observed that the
   combination of multiple heuristics with a heuristic modifier offers an
   effective way to obtain good solution quality. Experimental results
   demonstrate that our approach delivers promising results. We conclude
   that this adaptive linear combination of heuristics is a highly
   effective method and simple to implement. Crown Copyright (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Benzaldehyde (BZA), with its almond-like aroma, is an important additive
   in the food, fragrance and nutraceutical industries, and biologically
   derived BZA by microbial catalysts provides many advantages over the
   traditional methods of plant material extraction. The methylotrophic
   yeast Pichia pastoris induces alcohol oxidase (AOX) in the presence of
   methanol, which is highly nonspecific to other primary alcohols, and can
   oxidize them to their aldehyde form without further degradation, such as
   benzyl alcohol (BA) to BZA. In this work BA and BZA inhibition on P.
   pastoris cell growth was determined with an IC50 at 0.98 g L-1 for BZA
   and 2.95 g L-1 for BA, which are low levels and are undesirable for high
   biotransformation rates. Product detoxification, and not low AOX and low
   cellular energy source, was found to most improve the biotransformation
   rates, which prompted the application of in situ product removal (ISPR)
   using the thermoplastic polymer Hytrel 3078, fabricated into
   pervaporation tubing by DuPont, Canada. Hytrel 3078, chosen for its high
   partition coefficient (PC) for BZA and its low PC for BA, was
   characterized by available tubing surface area and permeate gas flow
   rate in terms of its BZA/BA flux, showing that permeate gas flow rate
   has a greater positive influence on flux. Finally, the integrated in
   situ pervaporation biotransformation was effective at continuous product
   separation, using 87.4\% less polymer in comparison to studies with the
   use of polymer beads, and improved overall volumetric productivity of
   214\% (245.9 mg L-1 h(-1) vs. 115.0 mg L-1 h(-1)) over previous studies
   producing BZA. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The plain fatigue and fretting fatigue tests of Ti-1023 titanium alloy
   were performed using a high-frequency push-pull fatigue testing machine.
   Both sigma(max) versus number of cycles to failure curves were obtained
   for comparative analysiS of the fretting effect on fatigue performance
   of the titanium alloy. Meanwhile, by analyzing the fracture of plain
   fatigue and fretting fatigue, the fretting scar and the fretting debris
   observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the mechanism of
   fretting fatigue failure of Ti-1023 titanium alloy is discussed. The
   fretting fatigue strength of Ti-1023 titanium alloy is 175 MPa under 10
   MPa contact pressure, which is 21\% of plain fatigue strength (836 MPa).
   Under fretting condition, the Ti-1023 titanium alloy fatigue fracture
   failure occurs in a shorter fatigue life. When it comes to sigma(max)
   versus number of cycles to failure curves, data points in the range of
   10(6)-10(7) cycles under plain fatigue condition moved to the range of
   10(5)-10(6) under fretting fatigue condition. The integrity of the
   fatigue specimen surface was seriously damaged under the effect of
   fretting. With the alternating stress loaded on specimen, the stress
   concentrated on the surface of fretting area, which brought earlier the
   initiation and propagation of crack. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A system of FRP stay-in-place (SIP) formwork for concrete bridge deck is
   tested within a full bridge setting, including multiple girders,
   diaphragms and monolithic connections between components. The 4350 x
   3250 mm footprint of the test bridge represents a 1:2.75 scale of a 12.5
   m span full scale bridge. It includes four simulated precast concrete
   girders, supported at both ends on neoprene bearing pads with integral
   concrete end diaphragms. The deck is cast compositely on the girders
   using a novel configuration of FRP SIP forms, except for a control
   portion constructed using traditional steel reinforcement. Fifteen tests
   were carried out to investigate the effects of girder spacing, interior
   versus exterior spans, end- versus middle-sections, loading on versus
   loading off splices of FRP panels, FRP surface treatment, and splice
   method. Results show the FRP SIP form system exceeded code requirements,
   exhibiting safety factors between 2.8 and 4.3 over factored loads.
   Location of test pads (interior versus exterior span) had a substantial
   impact on performance, leading to a difference of up to 32\% in
   capacity, with exterior and edge pads exhibiting the lowest loads. Using
   adhesive bond at concrete-FRP interface mitigated this reduction. Lack
   of panel-to-panel splice detailing reduced strength by 21\% if loading
   was between splices, but no reduction occurred when loading was directly
   above splice. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Regional groundwater flow in high mountainous terrain is governed by a
   multitude of factors such as geology, topography, recharge conditions,
   structural elements such as fracturation and regional fault zones as
   well as man-made underground structures. By means of a numerical
   groundwater flow model, we consider the impact of deep underground
   tunnels and of an idealized major fault zone on the groundwater flow
   systems within the fractured Rotondo granite. The position of the free
   groundwater table as response to the above subsurface structures and, in
   particular, with regard to the influence of spatial distributed
   groundwater recharge rates is addressed. The model results show
   significant unsaturated zones below the mountain ridges in the study
   area with a thickness of up to several hundred metres. The subsurface
   galleries are shown to have a strong effect on the head distribution in
   the model domain, causing locally a reversal of natural head gradients.
   With respect to the position of the catchment areas to the tunnel and
   the corresponding type of recharge source for the tunnel inflows (i.e.
   glaciers or recent precipitation), as well as water table elevation, the
   influence of spatial distributed recharge rates is compared to uniform
   recharge rates. Water table elevations below the well exposed
   high-relief mountain ridges are observed to be more sensitive to changes
   in groundwater recharge rates and permeability than below ridges with
   less topographic relief. In the conceptual framework of the numerical
   simulations, the model fault zone has less influence on the groundwater
   table position, but more importantly acts as fast flow path for recharge
   from glaciated areas towards the subsurface galleries. This is in
   agreement with a previous study, where the imprint of glacial recharge
   was observed in the environmental isotope composition of groundwater
   sampled in the subsurface galleries. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Title = {{Composite ionic liquid and polymer membranes for gas separation at
   elevated temperatures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{450}},
Pages = {{407-417}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, the utilization of ionic liquids supported on porous
   polymer membranes has been demonstrated to enhance gas separation
   performance by improving both permeability and selectivity for several
   industrially-relevant gas mixtures. However, the use of such supported
   ionic liquid membranes (SILMs) is normally not feasible at elevated
   process temperatures due to the resulting decrease in ionic liquid
   viscosity, which can lead to increased loss of ionic liquid from the
   membrane support during operation. In addition, many of the polymer
   membranes typically used in SILMs exhibit relatively poor mechanical and
   thermal stabilities at high temperatures. To overcome these problems
   associated with SILMs, thermally-stable composite ionic liquid and
   polymer membranes (CILPMs) have been fabricated in this study, thus
   exploiting the beneficial properties of ionic liquids for gas separation
   at elevated temperatures. Poly(pyromellitimide-co-4,4'-oxydianiline)
   (PMDA-ODA PI) and polybenzimidazole (PM) in combination with the ionic
   liquid, {[}C(4)mim]{[}NTf2] were used to fabricate the CILPMs. A
   measurement rig was designed and built to determine permeabilities and
   selectivities of the CILPMs for H-2, N-2, CO, CO2 and CH4 over a range
   of pressures and temperatures. The fabricated CILPMs were shown to
   maintain excellent mechanical and thermal stability over a wide range of
   processing conditions. Temperature was shown to greatly affect both
   permeability and selectivity of the membranes, whilst pressure had less
   influence, The incorporation of {[}C(4)mim]{[}NTf2] into the membranes
   was found to significantly increase CO2 permeation and, therefore, it is
   anticipated that these CILPMs hold significant potential for CO2
   separation applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biobased omega-hydroxytetradecanoic acid prepared via an efficient
   yeast-catalyzed omega-hydroxylation reaction was converted by a one-step
   reaction to the polymerizable surfactants omega-acryltetradecanoic acid
   (MA-1) and omega-maleate tetradecanoic acid (MA-2). MA-1 is a single
   polar-headed surfactant, whereas MA-2 is a,bolaamphiphile with
   carboxylic acid polar groups at both chain ends. MA-1 gave a distinct
   critical micelle concentration (cmc) at 253 mg/L, whereas for MA-2, the
   surface tension decreased monotonically and a distinct cmc was not
   observed even up to 1800 mg/L. Experimental determination of the
   reactivity ratios for MA-1 and MA-2 with styrene showed that for MA-1
   copolymers that approximate random structures were formed while MA-2
   tends to form copolymers with an alternating nature. Emulsion
   polymerizations conducted with varying amounts of MA-1 and MA-2 (1-10 wt
   \% with respect to styrene) gave colloidally stable latexes with
   particle sizes ranging from 52 to 155 nm. In emulsion polymerizations
   using either MA-1 or MA-2 at more than 5 wt \% to monomer, a linear
   increase in latex particle volume with conversion was observed and the
   particle number remained constant, establishing that the polymerizations
   proceeded without significant aggregation or secondary particle
   nucleation. Potentiometric titration and H-1 NMR were used to measure
   MA-1 and MA-2 conversions during polymerization as well as how the
   surfactants were distributed between the particle surface, aqueous
   phase, and particle interior. Observed differences were rationalized
   based on the comparative structures of MA-1 and MA-2 and their
   corresponding partitioning behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Thin-film sensing with a film thickness much less than a wavelength is
   an important challenge in conventional transmission-mode terahertz
   time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). Since the interaction length between
   terahertz waves and a sample film is short, a small change in the
   transmitted signal compared with the reference is considerably obscured
   by system uncertainties. In this article, several possible thin-film
   measurement procedures are carefully investigated. It is suggested that
   an alternating sample and reference measurement approach is most robust
   for thin-film sensing. In addition, a closed-form criterion is developed
   to determine the critical thickness, i.e., the minimal thickness of a
   film unambiguously detectable by transmission-mode THz-TDS. The analysis
   considers influences from the Fresnel transmission at interfaces and the
   Fabry-Perot reflections, in addition to the propagation across the film.
   The experimental results show that typical THz-TDS systems can detect
   polymer films with a thickness down to a few microns, two orders of
   magnitude less than the wavelength. For reasonably accurate
   characterization, it is recommended that the film thickness be at least
   ten times above this limit. The analysis is readily extended to
   biomolecular and semiconductor films. The criterion can be used to
   estimate the system-dependent performance in thin-film sensing
   applications, and can help to ascertain whether an alternative terahertz
   sensing modality is necessary. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We present an analysis of the large-scale structure of the halo of the
   Andromeda galaxy, based on the Pan-Andromeda Archeological Survey
   (PAndAS), currently the most complete map of resolved stellar
   populations in any galactic halo. Despite the presence of copious
   substructures, the global halo populations follow closely power-law
   profiles that become steeper with increasing metallicity. We divide the
   sample into stream-like populations and a smooth halo component (defined
   as the population that cannot be resolved into spatially distinct
   substructures with PAndAS). Fitting a three-dimensional halo model
   reveals that the most metal-poor populations ({[}Fe/H] < -1.7) are
   distributed approximately spherically (slightly prolate with ellipticity
   c/a = 1.09 +/- 0.03), with only a relatively small fraction residing in
   discernible stream-like structures (f(stream) = 42\%). The sphericity of
   the ancient smooth component strongly hints that the dark matter halo is
   also approximately spherical. More metal-rich populations contain higher
   fractions of stars in streams, with f(stream) becoming as high as 86\%
   for {[}Fe/H] > -0.6. The space density of the smooth metal-poor
   component has a global power-law slope of gamma = -3.08 +/- 0.07, and a
   non-parametric fit shows that the slope remains nearly constant from 30
   kpc to similar to 300 kpc. The total stellar mass in the halo at
   distances beyond 2 degrees is similar to 1.1x10(10) M-circle dot, while
   that of the smooth component is similar to 3 x 10(9) M-circle dot.
   Extrapolating into the inner galaxy, the total stellar mass of the
   smooth halo is plausibly similar to 8 x 10(9) M-circle dot. We detect a
   substantial metallicity gradient, which declines from <{[}Fe/H]> = -0.7
   at R = 30 kpc to <{[}Fe/H]> = -1.5 at R = 150 kpc for the full sample,
   with the smooth halo being similar to 0.2 dex more metal poor than the
   full sample at each radius. While qualitatively in line with
   expectations from cosmological simulations, these observations are of
   great importance as they provide a prototype template that such
   simulations must now be able to reproduce in quantitative detail.}},

Abstract = {{Constitutive equations including an Arrhenius term have been applied to
   analyze the hot deformation behavior of a nitride-strengthened (NS)
   martensitic heat resistant steel in temperature range of 900-1200
   degrees C and strain rate range of 10(-3)-10 s(-1). On the basis of
   analysis of the deformation data, the stress-strain curves up to the
   peak were divided into four regions, in sequence, representing four
   processes, namely hardening, dynamic recovery (DRV), dynamic strain
   induced transformation (DSIT), and dynamic recrystallization (DRX),
   according to the inflection points in partial derivative/theta and
   partial derivative(partial derivative theta/partial derivative
   sigma)/partial derivative sigma curves. Some of the inflection points
   have their own meanings. For examples, the minimum of partial derivative
   theta/partial derivative sigma locates the start of DRV and the maximum
   of it indicates the start of DRX. The results also showed that the
   critical strain of DRX was sensitive to ln(Z) below 40, while the
   critical stress of DRX was sensitive to it above 40. The final
   microstructures under different deformation conditions were analyzed in
   terms of softening processes including DRV, DRX, metadynamic
   crystallization (MDRX) and DSIT. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A practical machine-vision-based system is developed for fast detection
   of defects occurring on the surface of bottle caps. This system can be
   used to extract the circular region as the region of interests (ROI)
   from the surface of a bottle cap, and then use the circular region
   projection histogram (CRPH) as the matching features. We establish two
   dictionaries for the template and possible defect, respectively. Due to
   the requirements of high-speed production as well as detecting quality,
   a fast algorithm based on a sparse representation is proposed to speed
   up the searching. In the sparse representation, non-zero elements in the
   sparse factors indicate the defect's size and position. Experimental
   results in industrial trials show that the proposed method outperforms
   the orientation code method (OCM) and is able to produce promising
   results for detecting defects on the surface of bottle caps. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The use of an acid violet 7 (AV7) smart ink to assess the activity of
   photocatalytic paint is demonstrated. A linear correlation is
   established between the change in oxidized dye concentration, as
   measured by diffuse reflectance, and the change in the green component
   of the RGB color values, obtained using a portable hand-held scanner,
   suggesting that such tests can be monitored easily using an inexpensive
   piece of hand-held office equipment, as opposed to an expensive
   lab-based instrument, such as a diffuse reflectance UV/vis
   spectrophotometer. The bleaching of the AV7 follows first order
   kinetics, at a rate that is linearly dependent upon the UVA irradiance
   (0.30-3.26 mW cm(-2)). A comparison of relative rate of bleaching of the
   AV7 ink with the relative rate of removal of NOx, as determined using
   the ISO test (ISO 22197-1:2007), established a linear relationship
   between the two sets of results and the relevance of this correlation is
   discussed briefly.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the limitations of post-colonial planning
   practices that aimed to modernize Cairo's urban spaces during Gamal
   Abdel Nasser's rule (1952-1970). Following the Free Officers revolution
   of 1952, ambition to display urban order through forceful change in the
   city's built environment was in action. Nasser's visions of modernity
   were explicit in a series of attempts to reshape several prime locations
   in central Cairo, which included the old traditional waterfront quarter,
   in Bulaq Abul Ela. An analysis of the Bulaq planning scheme drafted in
   1966 reveals insights into how notions of order were spatialized to
   integrate with Cairo's complex urban fabric. The official plans to
   regularize Bulaq also strongly demonstrate how this was a top-down,
   centralized process in terms of governance, with full utilization of
   state resources, namely the military and the media. From a wider
   perspective, planning practices under Nasser demonstrated an evident
   break with the past to eliminate memories of colonization and disorder.
   Drawing on original resources, archival material, meeting minutes and
   maps of this historical but dilapidated quarter of Cairo, this paper
   gives an insight into how Nasser's government attempted to convey a
   sense of order in a revolutionary country without, however, having an
   understanding of order as a coherent, multi-layered and sequential
   process of change.}},

Abstract = {{Waste tyres were utilized as the sorption phase in a two-phase
   partitioning bioreactor (TPPB) for the biodegradation of a binary
   mixture of 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) and 4-nitrophenol (4NP). These
   compounds are extensively used in the chemical industry and are found in
   many industrial effluents. Although both compounds are toxic and are on
   the EPA list of priority pollutants, a higher inhibitory effect on
   microorganisms is exerted by DCP, and our experimental tests were
   focused on strategies to reduce its negative impact on microbial
   activity. Sorption/desorption tests for the DCP-4NP mixture were first
   performed to verify the related uptake/release rates by the tyres, which
   showed that the tyres had a higher capacity for DCP uptake and
   practically no affinity for 4NP. An acclimatized mixed culture was then
   utilized in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) operated in conventional
   and two-phase mode. For the binary DCP-4NP mixture a significant
   reduction in DCP toxicity, and a concomitant enhancement in substrate
   removal efficiency (up to 83\%for DCP and approximate to 100\% for 4NP)
   were clearly seen for the TPPB operated with 10\% and 15\% v/v tyres,
   for influent concentrations up to 180mg/L, with practically negligible
   biodegradation in the conventional single phase reactor. The long-term
   utilization of tyres was confirmed at an influent loading of 180mg/L
   with a test performed over 20 work cycles showing an improvement of the
   removal performance for both compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems
   can bring substantial improvement in spectral efficiency and/or energy
   efficiency, due to the excessive degrees-of-freedom and huge array gain.
   However, large-scale MINI is expected to deploy lower-cost radio
   frequency (RF) components, which are particularly prone to hardware
   impairments. Unfortunately, compensation schemes are not able to remove
   the impact of hardware impairments completely, such that a certain
   amount of residual impairments always exists. In this paper, we
   investigate the impact of residual transmit RF impairments (RTRI) on the
   spectral and energy efficiency of training-based point-to-point
   large-scale MIMO systems, and seek to determine the optimal training
   length and number of antennas which maximize the energy efficiency. We
   derive deterministic equivalents of the signal-to-noise-and-interference
   ratio (SINR) with zero-forcing (ZF) receivers, as well as the
   corresponding spectral and energy efficiency, which are shown to be
   accurate even for small number of antennas. Through an iterative
   sequential optimization, we find that the optimal training length of
   systems with RTRI can be smaller compared to ideal hardware systems in
   the moderate SNR regime, while larger in the high SNR regime. Moreover,
   it is observed that RTRI can significantly decrease the optimal number
   of transmit and receive antennas.}},

   described for generating the product terms in complex multiplications
   involving twiddle constants: standard single-cycle multiplication, and
   multi-cycle shift-and-add multiplication. Synthesis results are reported
   for parallelized FFT implementations of different sizes targeting
   low-cost Cyclone III chips and high-end Stratix III and IV chips from
   Altera. The shift-and-add approach for constant multiplication is shown
   to consume more logic resources, but provide a higher maximum clock

   presented for two-sided continuous beam scanning and directive radiation
   at broadside. By appropriate selection of the grating periodicity and
   sectoring of the 2-D guiding structure, TE field distributions can be
   suppressed over a large bandwidth ensuring efficient TM0 leakage and
   radiation into the far-field. Measured results demonstrate a pencil beam
   at broadside with gain values greater than 15 dBi, making the design
   attractive for radar systems and communication applications. More
   importantly, the investigated techniques for TM unimodal operation can
   also be applied to other guidance structures where unwanted TE field
   excitation may be of concern at microwave and millimeter-wave

Abstract = {{In this work an eight-port cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna
   (DRA) is presented for multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO)
   systems. Other possible applications include polarization diversity and
   other phased arrays for wireless communications. The antenna is defined
   by a cylindrical dielectric resonator with epsilon r = 30. Four HE11
   delta modes are excited within the DRA by slots which are etched out of
   the ground plane of the FR-4 substrate onto which the DRA is mounted.
   Each of these slots are excited by two 50-Omega microstrip transmission
   lines. This work provides a significant size reduction when compared
   with previous designs by the authors. In particular, when this work is
   compared to previous antenna structures which utilize a similar 4-port
   feeding scheme, a total antenna height and ground plane reduction of
   37\% and 44\% is achieved, respectively. The new eight-port antenna
   design is also low-profile, compact (90 mm by 90 mm), and offers good
   radiation performance with a bandwidth of more than 30\%.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new method to phase-modulate RF pulses through injection
   locking. The modulator can produce BPSK or QPSK modulated pulses over a
   frequency span of 3 to 10 GHz. The RF pulses are produced using a fast
   on/off switching technique to power up and power down a tunable ring
   oscillator. Experiments show that the modulator's energy consumption
   ranges from 13 pJ/pulse to 18 pJ/pulse as the carrier frequency varies
   from 3 GHz to 10 GHz. The energy consumption figures are for 2 ns long
   pulses with amplitudes of 300 mV at 3 GHz and 200 mV at 10 GHz. The
   pulse repetition rate is 250 MHz. The chip was fabricated in 130 nm CMOS
   and the core circuit area is only 0.05 mm(2).}},

Abstract = {{A simple and practical design technique is proposed to control
   guided-waves on a dielectric substrate. In particular, by introducing
   longitudinal slots with a transverse and subwavelength periodicity in
   the bottom metallic surface of a dielectric slab, radial surface-wave
   (SW) fields can be controlled for bound plane-wave propagation. An
   analysis of this guide is provided were the longitudinal slots for the
   modified ground plane are modeled by a tensor impedance sheet. Numerical
   calculations are in agreement with the full-wave simulations were
   considerations have been made for the structure anisotropy. Routing
   concepts are further applied to a SW-fed planar leakywave antenna (LWA)
   defined by a transverse array of microstrip lines with periodic
   width-modulation. Improved realized gain values for the LWA design are
   observed (more than 2.5 dB) when compared to a conventional ground plane
   configuration. Our approach for field control can also be applied to new
   guides and transitions, routing circuits, and other planar structures
   which operate at microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Planar periodic `bull-eye' leaky-wave antennas are investigated for
   two-sided frequency beam scanning and broadside radiation at microwave
   and millimeter-wave frequencies. In particular, the ground plane and the
   radial configuration of the structures are optimized to support leakage
   of the fundamental TM mode of the guiding structure in a regime without
   any other modes, either bound or radiating, while also taking into
   consideration the TM and TE fields generated by the practical slot
   source integrated into the bottom ground plane. These design approaches
   can improve beam scanning quality, reduce reflection losses, minimize
   cross-polarization levels, and increase antenna gain. In addition,
   full-wave simulations and antenna measurements are in agreement with the
   developed Method of Moments dispersion analysis where continuous
   wide-angle beam scanning is observed over a large radiating bandwidth.}},
