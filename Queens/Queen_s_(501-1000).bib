Abstract = {{The impact of buckling containment features on the stability of
   thin-gauge fuselage, metallic stiffened panels has previously been
   demonstrated. With the continuing developments in manufacturing
   technology, such as welding, extrusion, machining, and additive layer
   manufacture, understanding the benefits of additional panel design
   features on heavier applications, such as wing panels, is timely. This
   compression testing of thick-gauge panels with and without buckling
   containment features has been undertaken to verify buckling and collapse
   behaviors and validate sizing methods. The experimental results
   demonstrated individual panel mass savings on the order of 9\%, and wing
   cover design studies demonstrated mass savings on the order of 4 to
   13\%, dependent on aircraft size and material choice.}},

Title = {{l(0)-Norm Sparse Hyperspectral Unmixing Using Arctan Smoothing}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The goal of sparse linear hyperspectral unmixing is to determine a
   scanty subset of spectral signatures of materials contained in each
   mixed pixel and to estimate their fractional abundances. This turns into
   an
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   -norm minimization, which is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we
   propose a new iterative method, which starts as an
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   -norm optimization that is convex, has a unique solution, converges
   quickly and iteratively tends to be an
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   -norm problem. More specifically, we employ the arctan function with the
   parameter
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   in our optimization. This function is Lipschitz continuous and
   approximates
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   -norm and
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   -norm for small and large values of sigma, respectively. We prove that
   the set of local optima of our problem is continuous versus sigma. Thus,
   by a gradual increase of sigma in each iteration, we may avoid being
   trapped in a suboptimal solution. We propose to use the alternating
   direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for our minimization problem
   iteratively while increasing sigma exponentially. Our evaluations reveal
   the superiorities and shortcomings of the proposed method compared to
   several state-of-the-art methods. We consider such evaluations in
   different experiments over both synthetic and real hyperspectral data,
   and the results of our proposed methods reveal the sparsest estimated
   abundances compared to other competitive algorithms for the subimage of
   AVIRIS cuprite data.}},

Journal = {{FIBERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Repair and rehabilitation of deteriorating concrete elements are of
   significant concern in many infrastructural facilities and remain a
   challenging task. Concerted research efforts are needed to develop
   repair materials that are sustainable, durable, and cost-effective.
   Research data show that fiber-reinforced mortars/concretes have superior
   performance in terms of volume stability and toughness. In addition, it
   has been recently reported that nano-silica particles can generally
   improve the mechanical and durability properties of cement-based
   systems. Thus, there has been a growing interest in the use of
   nano-modified fiber-reinforced cementitious composites/mortars (NFRM) in
   repair and rehabilitation applications of concrete structures. The
   current study investigates various mechanical and durability properties
   of nano-modified mortar containing different types of fibers (steel,
   basalt, and hybrid (basalt and polypropylene)), in terms of compressive
   and flexural strengths, toughness, drying shrinkage, penetrability, and
   resistance to salt-frost scaling. The results highlight the overall
   effectiveness of the NFRM owing to the synergistic effects of
   nano-silica and fibers.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years carbon dioxide has emerged as a new and innovative
   ``trigger{''} for stimuli responsive materials. In addition to being
   abundant, inexpensive, nontoxic and environmentally benign, CO2 does not

   CO2-switchable materials that have been developed, polymer-based
   materials are of particular interest. In this paper we first present the
   fundamental principles of CO2-switchability, and then provide examples
   of applying the chemistry of CO2 switching to the preparation of
   CO2-switchable polymers and polymer nanoparticles. We intend to provide
   the reader with sufficient background on CO2-switchability to facilitate
   the synthesis of CO2-switchable polymers in their own research,
   including the design of new materials with novel properties enabled by

Abstract = {{Background and ObjectiveLaser osteotomy bears well-identified advantages
   over conventional techniques. However, lack of depth control and
   collateral thermal damage are barriers to wide clinical implementation.
   Flexible fiber delivery and economical benefits of ytterbium-doped fiber
   lasers make them desirable for laser osteotomy. In this work, we
   demonstrate automated bone ablation with a 1,070nm industrial-scale
   fiber laser to create 3D target structures with minimal thermal
   side-effects.
   Materials and MethodsFresh and dry ex vivo cortical bone samples are
   ablated using 50-100 mu s laser pulses of 15-30mJ. In situ inline
   coherent imaging monitors ablation dynamics with micron precision and on
   microsecond timescales. Ablation depth is extracted by on-the-fly
   processing of ICI data, enabling feedback control of depth (via laser
   pulse number). Final ablated morphology, measured by an ex situ stylus
   profiler, is compared to the target shape. Histological examination is
   performed to quantify the thermal side-effects of laser ablation.
   ResultsPercussion drilled hole depth is highly variable for fixed laser
   parameters (880151 mu m on fresh bone and 1038 +/- 148 mu m on dry bone)
   due to nondeterministic ablation. ICI-enabled depth control is
   implemented to achieve precise ablation of complex 3D features. The RMS
   deviation between target and ablated morphology is 12.6 mu m. The
   heat-affected zone is found to be 5-10 mu m on fresh and dry bone.
   ConclusionsAn ytterbium-doped fiber laser is utilized for cortical bone
   ablation with limited thermal side-effects. In situ real-time ICI
   measurement enables characterization of bone ablation dynamics.
   Furthermore, ICI closed-loop feedback realizes depth-controlled ablation
   on heterogeneous bone. This proof-of-principle study shows great promise
   for ICI-guided laser osteotomy. Lasers Surg. Med. 48:288-298, 2016. (c)

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted on a real continuous steel Gerber-truss
   bridge with artificial damage applied. This article summarizes the
   results of the experiment for bridge damage detection utilizing
   traffic-induced vibrations. It investigates the sensitivities of a
   number of quantities to bridge damage including the identified modal
   parameters and their statistical patterns, Nair's damage indicator and
   its statistical pattern and different sets of measurement points. The
   modal parameters are identified by autoregressive time-series models.
   The decision on bridge health condition is made and the sensitivity of
   variables is evaluated with the aid of the Mahalanobis-Taguchi system, a
   multivariate pattern recognition tool. Several observations are made as
   follows. For the modal parameters, although bridge damage detection can
   be achieved by performing Mahalanobis-Taguchi system on certain modal
   parameters of certain sets of measurement points, difficulties were
   faced in subjective selection of meaningful bridge modes and low
   sensitivity of the statistical pattern of the modal parameters to
   damage. For Nair's damage indicator, bridge damage detection could be
   achieved by performing Mahalanobis-Taguchi system on Nair's damage
   indicators of most sets of measurement points. As a damage indicator,
   Nair's damage indicator was superior to the modal parameters. Three main
   advantages were observed: it does not require any subjective decision in
   calculating Nair's damage indicator, thus potential human errors can be
   prevented and an automatic detection task can be achieved; its
   statistical pattern has high sensitivity to damage and, finally, it is
   flexible regarding the choice of sets of measurement points.}},

Abstract = {{We present solid-state, polymer-based, light-emitting electrochemical
   cells incorporating bipolar electrodes (BPEs) positioned between the
   driving electrodes. The dominant processes in these planar
   electrochemical cells are in situ electrochemical p and n doping of the
   luminescent conjugated polymer when a sufficient voltage bias is applied
   between the feeder anode and cathode. The inclusion of floating BPEs
   causes additional doping at the extremities of the BPE, which has been
   visualized through in situ fluorescence imaging. We investigate how the
   applied voltage bias and the BPE size affect electrochemical doping from
   the BPE. We observe an interesting delay in the appearance of doping
   from the BPE if the applied voltage bias was initially insufficient.
   Doping eventually occurs when the potential difference across the
   BPE/polymer interface becomes sufficient, as doping from the driving
   electrodes propagates. The inclusion of BPEs can lead to more efficient
   polymer light-emitting and photovoltaic cells when a large number of
   active junctions are formed.}},

Abstract = {{Kathmandu has been the last few cities in the world which retained its
   medieval urban culture up until twentieth century. Various Hindu and
   Buddhist religious practises shaped the arrangement of houses, roads and
   urban spaces giving the city a distinctive physical form, character and
   a unique oriental nativeness. In recent decades, the urban culture of
   the city has been changing with the forces of urbanization and
   globalization and the demand for new buildings and spaces. New
   residential design is increasingly dominated by distinctive patterns of
   Western suburban ideal comprising detached or semi-detached homes and
   high rise tower blocks. This architectural iconoclasm can be construed
   as a rather crude response to the indigenous spaces and builtform. The
   paper attempts to dismantle the current tension between traditional and
   contemporary `culture' (and hence society) and housing (or builtform) in
   Kathmandu by engaging in a discussion that cuts across space, time and
   meaning of building. The paper concludes that residential architecture
   in Kathmandu today stands disoriented and lost in the transition. (C)

Abstract = {{Quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models were firstly
   established for the hydrophobic substituent constant (pi(x)) using the
   theoretical descriptors derived solely from electrostatic potentials
   (EPSs) at the substituent atoms. The descriptors introduced are found to
   be related to hydrogen-bond basicity, hydrogen-bond acidity, cavity, or
   dipolarity/polarizability terms in linear solvation energy relationship,
   which endows the models good interpretability. The predictive
   capabilities of the models constructed were also verified by rigorous
   Monte Carlo cross-validation. Then, eight groups of meta- or
   para-disubstituted benzenes and one group of substituted pyridines were
   investigated. QSPR models for individual systems were achieved with the
   ESP-derived descriptors. Additionally, two QSPR models were also
   established for Rekker's fragment constants (f(oct)), which is a
   secondary-treatment quantity and reflects average contribution of the
   fragment to logP. It has been demonstrated that the descriptors derived
   from ESPs at the fragments, can be well used to quantitatively express
   the relationship between fragment structures and their hydrophobic
   properties, regardless of the attached parent structure or the valence
   state. Finally, the relations of Hammett sigma constant and ESP
   quantities were explored. It implies that sigma and pi, which are
   essential in classic QSAR and represent different type of contributions
   to biological activities, are also complementary in interaction site.

Title = {{Wavelet Packet Decomposition-Based Fault Diagnosis Scheme for SRM Drives
   With a Single Current Sensor}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Power converters are a key, but vulnerable component in switched
   reluctance motor (SRM) drives. In this paper, a new fault diagnosis
   scheme for SRM converters is proposed based on the wavelet packet
   decomposition (WPD) with a dc-link current sensor. Open-and
   short-circuit faults of the power switches in an asymmetrical
   half-bridge converter are analyzed in details. In order to obtain the
   fault signature from the phase currents, two pulse-width modulation
   signals with phase shift are injected into the lower-switches of the
   converter to extract the excitation current, and the WPD algorithm is
   then applied to the detected currents for fault diagnosis. Moreover, a
   discrete degree of the wavelet packet node energy is chosen as the fault
   coefficient. The converter faults can be diagnosed and located directly
   by determining the changes in the discrete degree from the detected
   currents. The proposed scheme requires only one current sensor in the dc
   link, while conventional methods need one sensor for each phase or
   additional detection circuits. The experimental results on a 750-W
   three-phase SRM are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the
   proposed fault diagnosis scheme.}},

   was investigated together with the viscosity of these systems in the
   presence or absence of CO2 to evaluate their practical application in
   CO2 capture processes. The effect of the presence of MEA on the rate of

   CO2 absorption over the ideal values in the case of {[}P-66614]
   {[}123Triz] and {[}P-66614] {[}Bentriz] while in the other systems the

Journal = {{GEOTECHNIQUE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{83-88}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Cuttings in heavily overconsolidated clays are known to be susceptible
   to progressive deformation caused by creep and fatigue that usually
   begins at the toe of the slope. The progressive deformation leads to
   strength reduction with time at constant stress (or called softening)
   and could be accelerated by fluctuation of groundwater level associated
   with more extreme rainfall events predicted through climate change. The
   purpose of this paper is to assess the mechanism of progressive
   deformation due to creep and fatigue using element testing on samples of
   till. The samples were subjected to fully drained loading and the
   deviator stresses were held constant at various percentages of peak
   failure stress, while the pore water pressure was kept static or dynamic
   (fluctuating +/- 5 kPa) over a period of time. The results have shown
   that the samples experienced significant deformation even at a higher
   factor of safety (i.e. the failure deviator stress/deviator stress at
   which the pore water pressure was fluctuated) under pore water pressure
   dynamics.}},

Journal = {{MINERALIUM DEPOSITA}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The Howard's Pass district, located in Yukon Territory, comprises 14
   Zn-Pb sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) deposits that collectively contain
   approximately 400.7 Mt grading at 4.5 \% Zn and 1.5 \% Pb. Sulfide
   mineralization is hosted in carbonaceous and calcareous to siliceous
   mudstones. Pyrite is a minor but ubiquitous component. Detailed
   petrographic analyses reveal that pyrite has a complex and protracted
   growth history, and multiple generations of pyrite are preserved in
   single grains. Combined electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and laser
   ablation-inductively coupled mass plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS)
   of paragenetically complex pyrite reveal minor and trace element
   zonation that mimic textural features. These data provide information on
   the relative timing and cation content of depositional (i.e., ambient
   marine), hydrothermal, and metamorphic fluids. These data also identify
   a suite of nonore elements (Mn, As, Ag, Sb, and Tl) associated with the
   Zn-Pb mineralizing hydrothermal fluids. Lithogeochemical data and
   statistical results corroborate the microanalytical findings. These
   elements are associated with both syngenetic to earliest diagenetic
   pyrite and later diagenetic pyrite overgrowths, suggesting that SEDEX
   mineralization was not only the product of hydrothermal precipitates
   that settled on the seafloor, but also dense metalliferous brine also
   settled on, and percolated through, unconsolidated carbonaceous muds and
   precipitated metals. This genetic model is similar to that proposed for
   the Paleoproterozoic HYC Zn-Pb-Ag SEDEX deposit in northern Australia,
   and it is likely that common processes and ambient conditions led to the
   formation and preservation of both of these large SEDEX districts.}},

Abstract = {{We report first-principles calculations of the energetic stability and
   electronic properties of metalphthalocyanine (MPc) molecules (M = Cr,
   Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) adsorbed on the delta-doped Si(111)-B( root
   3 x root 3) reconstructed surface. (i) It can be seen that CrPc, MnPc,
   FePc, and CoPc are chemically anchored to the topmost Si atom. (ii)
   Contrastingly, the binding of the NiPc, CuPc, and ZnPc molecules to the
   Si(111)-B(root 3 x root 3) surface is exclusively ruled by van der Waals
   interactions, the main implication being that these molecules may
   diffuse and rearrange to form clusters and/or self-organized structures
   on this surface. The electronic structure calculations reveal that in
   point (i), owing to the formation of the metal-Si covalent bond, the net
   magnetic moment of the molecule is quenched by 1 mu(B), remaining
   unchanged in point (ii). In particular, the magnetic moment of CuPc (1
   mu(B)) is preserved after adsorption. Finally, we verify that the
   formation of ZnPc, CuPc, and NiPc molecular (self-assembled)
   arrangements on the Si(111)-B(root 3 x root 3) surface is energetically
   favorable, in good agreement with recent experimental findings.}},

   for groundwater flow, reactive solute transport, soil gas flow, and
   vapour intrusion in buildings. The model was applied to a
   three-dimensional, community-scale (250 m x 1000 m x 14 m) domain
   containing heterogeneous, spatially correlated distributions of the
   hydraulic conductivity, fraction of organic carbon, and biodegradation
   rate constant, which were varied between realizations. Analysis
   considered results from both individual realizations as well as the
   suite of Monte Carlo simulations expressed through several novel,
   integrated parameters, such as the probability of exceeding a regulatory
   standard in either groundwater or indoor air. Results showed that
   exceedance probabilities varied considerably with the consideration of
   biodegradation in the saturated zone, and were less sensitive to changes
   in the variance of hydraulic conductivity or the incorporation of
   heterogeneous distributions of organic carbon at this spatial scale. A
   sharp gradient in exceedance probability existed at the lateral edges of
   the plumes due to variability in lateral dispersion, which defined a
   narrow region of exceedance uncertainty. Differences in exceedance
   probability between realizations (i.e., due to heterogeneity
   uncertainty) were similar to differences attributed to changes in the
   variance of hydraulic conductivity or fraction of organic carbon.
   Simulated clean-up times, defined by reaching an acceptable exceedance
   probability, were found to be on the order of decades to centuries in
   these community-scale domains. Results also showed that the choice of
   the acceptable exceedance probability level (e.g., 1 vs. 5 \%) would
   likely affect clean up times on the order of decades. Moreover, in the
   scenarios examined here, the risk of exceeding indoor air standards was
   greater than that of exceeding groundwater standards at all times and
   places. Overall, simulations of coupled transport processes combined
   with novel spatial and temporal quantification metrics for Monte Carlo
   analyses, provide practical tools for assessing risk in wider
   communities when considering site remediation.}},

Abstract = {{The causes behind the appearance of abundant macroscopic body and trace
   fossils at the end of the Neoproterozoic Era remain debated. Iron
   geochemical data from fossiliferous Ediacaran successions in
   New-foundland suggested that the first appearances correlated with an
   oxygenation event. A similar relationship was claimed to exist in the
   Mackenzie Mountains, Canada, although later stratigraphic studies
   indicated that the sections analyzed for geochemistry were incorrectly
   correlated with those hosting the fossils. To directly connect fossil
   occurrences with geochemistry in the Mackenzie Mountains, we conducted a
   multiproxy iron, carbon, sulfur, and trace-element geochemical analysis
   of stratigraphic sections hosting both the Cryogenian ``Twitya discs{''}
   at Bluefish Creek as well as Ediacaran fossils and simple bilaterian
   traces at Sekwi Brook. There is no clear oxygenation event correlated
   with the appearance of macroscopic body fossils or simple bilaterian
   burrows; however, some change in environment-a potential partial
   oxygenation-is correlated with increasing burrow width higher in the
   Blueflower Formation. Data from Sekwi Brook suggest that these organisms
   were periodically colonizing a predominantly anoxic and ferruginous
   basin. This seemingly incongruent observation is accommodated through
   accounting for differing time scales between the characteristic response
   time of sedimentary redox proxies versus that for ecological change.
   Thus, hypotheses directly connecting ocean oxygenation with the
   appearance of macrofossils need not apply to all areas of a
   heterogeneous Ediacaran ocean, and stably oxygenated conditions on
   geological time scales were not required for the appearance of these
   Avalon-assemblage Ediacaran organisms. At least in the Mackenzie
   Mountains, the appropriate facies for fossil preservation appears to be
   the strongest control on the stratigraphic distribution of macrofossils.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel weighted memory polynomial (WMP)-based model is
   proposed for wireless transmitters and radio-frequency power amplifiers'
   (PAs) behavioral modeling and predistortion. The new model introduces an
   instantaneous-power-dependent weight function on the static and dynamic
   terms of the conventional memory polynomial (MP) model. Experimental
   validation in both modeling and predistortion contexts was performed on
   a PA prototype driven by a 20-MHz Long Term Evolution signal. The
   proposed model was assessed against the standard MP model. The
   experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
   polynomial in behavioral modeling applications as it results in up to
   50\% (3-dB) improvement in the normalized mean square error for the same
   number of coefficients. The model robustness was then validated by using
   a second test signal applied to two Doherty PAs using different
   transistor technologies. Furthermore, when applied for digital
   predistortion, the proposed WMP function achieves the same performance
   as the state-of-art MP while requiring approximately 50\% less
   coefficients.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The problem of robust adaptive predictive control for a class of
   discrete-time. nonlinear systems is considered. First, a parameter
   estimation technique, based on an uncertainty set estimation, is
   formulated. This technique is able to provide robust performance for
   nonlinear systems subject to exogenous variables. Second, an adaptive
   MPC is developed to use the uncertainty estimation in a framework of
   min-max robust control. A Lipschitz-based approach, which provides a
   conservative approximation for the min-max problem, is used to solve the
   control problem, retaining the computational complexity of nominal MPC
   formulations and the robustness of the min-max approach. Finally, the
   set-based estimation algorithm and the robust predictive controller are
   successfully applied in two case studies. The first one is the control
   of anonisothermal CSTR governed by the van de Vusse reaction.
   Concentration and temperature regulation is considered with the
   simultaneous estimation of the frequency (or pre-exponential) factors of
   the Arrhenius equation. In the second example, a biomedical model for
   chemotherapy control is simulated using control actions provided by the
   proposed algorithm. The methods for estimation and control were tested
   using different disturbances scenarios. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper employs a unique extension-decomposition-aggregation (EDA)
   scheme to solve the formation flight control problem for multiple
   unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The corresponding decentralised
   longitudinal and lateral formation autopilots are novelly designed to
   maintain the overall formation stability when encountering changes of
   the formation error and topologies. The concept of propagation layer
   number (PLN) is also proposed to provide an intuitive criterion to judge
   which type of formation topology is more suitable to minimise formation
   error propagation (FEP). The criterion states that the smaller the PLN
   of the formation is, the quicker the response to the formation error is.
   A smaller PLN also means that the resulting topology provides better
   prevention to the FEP. Simulation studies of formation flight of
   multiple Aerosonde UAVs demonstrate that the designed formation
   controller based on the EDA strategy performs satisfactorily in
   maintaining the overall formation stable, and the bidirectional
   partial-mesh topology is found to provide the best overall response to
   the formation error propagation based on the PLN criterion.}},

Abstract = {{Intermittent energy harvesting devices often have difficulties in
   harvesting the peak energy generated due to battery power limitations,
   which increase the size and cost of the device. This paper discusses a
   power electronics module (PEM) that is used to extract power from a
   human energy harvesting device according to the user's desired
   difficulty level while maximizing energy transfer into a battery. The
   PEM can temporarily store the peak power produced by the generator,
   allowing a reduction in the battery size required to regulate the
   average power produced by the harvester. A two-stage prototype (a
   digitally controlled average current mode boost converter and an average
   current mode buck converter) has been designed, and the experimental
   waveforms were captured to validate the control theories used in the
   PEM. The peak efficiencies of the boost and buck are measured to be 93\%
   and 93.7\%, respectively. The total PEM system efficiency is measured at
   87.9\% at an average input power level of 10 W. The PEM design was able
   to extract 50\% more power than the single-stage converter without
   energy storage capability. The PEM is also used to demonstrate the
   flexible resistance control scheme capabilities of the device for
   broader usage in bioenergy harvesting research.}},

Abstract = {{In-service inspection of complex systems such as nuclear steam generator
   (SG) tubes and their surrounding support structures is challenged by
   overlapping degradation modes. In these complex systems the simultaneous
   and accurate measurement of more than two interdependent parameters is
   difficult using standard statistical regression analysis tools.
   Recently, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been investigated for
   dealing with the complex relation between inspection data and defect
   properties. In this paper, pulsed eddy current data were obtained using
   a single driver with an array of eight pick-up coils configured for
   inspection of Alloy-800 SG tube fretting, accompanied by tube offset
   within a simulated corroding ferromagnetic support structure.
   Time-voltage data were processed by a modified principal component
   analysis (MPCA) to reduce data dimensionality, and MPCA scores were
   input into an ANN that simultaneously targeted four parameters
   associated with support structure hole size, tube off-centering in two
   dimensions, and fret depth. The neural network was trained, tested, and
   validated on experimental data and provided estimates within 2\% of hole
   inner diameter (ID) and 3\% of fret depth targets. The estimates of hole
   ID and tube position were further improved when fret depth was used as
   an input, as might occur if fret depth inspection results are available.}},

Abstract = {{Analog amplifiers are used as front-end electronics to pre-condition
   signals or for control applications where low latency matters. Highly
   dynamic systems such as adaptive analog filters or simulation of dynamic
   virtual environments in haptic systems, require amplification gain
   adjustment which can be digitally implemented. In this article, we will
   present and experimentally evaluate five digitally controlled variable
   gain analog amplifiers which use dedicated components, including
   multiplier amplifier, voltage controlled amplifier and digital
   potentiometer, or use low-cost JFET-based alternatives. The amplifiers
   are designed for the high amplitude, low frequency signals often found
   in control systems. A method of interfacing the amplifiers with a
   desktop computer is discussed. The performance of these amplifiers are
   compared for their gain linearity, zero command gain, gain symmetry, DC
   offset, bandwidth, and noise. While each amplifier displayed strength in
   some aspects, the best performing amplifier had a maximum gain error of
   0.043 \%, a symmetry error of 0.42 \% and a DC offset of 0.026 V.
   Recommendations for the use of each amplifier are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Software plagiarism has become a serious threat to the health of
   software industry. A software birthmark indicates unique characteristics
   of a program that can be used to analyze the similarity between two
   programs and provide proof of plagiarism. In this paper, we propose a
   novel birthmark, Authority Histograms (AH), which can satisfy three
   essential requirements for good birthmarks resiliency, credibility, and
   scat ability. Existing birthmarks fail to satisfy all of them
   simultaneously. AH reflects not only the frequency of APIs, but also
   their call orders, whereas previous birthmarks rarely consider them
   together. This property provides more accurate plagiarism detection,
   making our birthmark more resilient and credible than previously
   proposed birthmarks. By random walk with restart when generating AH, we
   make our proposal fully applicable to even large programs. Extensive
   experiments with a set of Windows applications verify that both the
   credibility and resiliency of AH exceed those of existing birthmarks;
   therefore AH provides improved accuracy in detecting plagiarism.
   Moreover, the construction and comparison phases of All are established
   within a reasonable time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Strategies for extracting organic acids from aqueous solutions using
   polymeric absorbents are demonstrated and discussed in the context of
   two-phase partitioning bioreactor (TPPB) design. Experimental data and
   material balances for the uptake of butyric acid and benzoic acid by a
   poly(ether-blockamide) copolymer (Pebax 2533) establish the inherent
   limitations of unreactive absorbents for organic acid bioprocesses that
   operate at near-neutral pH. Improvements to TPPB performance are
   achieved by lowering pH temporarily with CO2 to enhance acid absorption,
   and removing the solute-rich polymer before restoring pH to fermentative
   values by releasing the CO2 pressure. Butyric acid removal by Pebax 2533
   improved from 3\% to 40\% upon acidifying a pH 6 solution with 60 bar of
   CO2, while benzoic acid absorption increased from 1\% to 80\% using this
   pressure manipulation technique. A reactive extraction approach
   involving a newly-synthesized amine functionalized hydrogel is also
   described wherein acid/base reaction equilibrium governs the extent of
   solute uptake. Copolymerization of 2(dimethylamino)ethyl acrylate
   (DMAEA) and trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) yielded a thermoset
   material with sufficient basicity to remove 80\% of both butyric and
   benzoic acid from aqueous solution using just 1 wt\% polymer relative to
   the aqueous phase mass. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{200}},
Pages = {{15-26}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The solid oxide fuel cell is an electro-chemical device which converts
   chemical energy into electricity and heat. To compete in today's market,
   design improvements, in terms of performance and life cycle, are
   required. Numerical prototypes can accelerate design and development
   progress. In this programme of research, a three-dimensional solid oxide
   fuel cell prototype, openFuelCell, based on open-source computational
   fluid dynamics software was developed and applied to a single cell.
   Transport phenomena, combined with the solution to the local Nernst
   equation for the open-circuit potential, as well as the Kirchhoff-Ohm
   relationship for the local current density, allow local
   electro-chemistry, fluid flow, multi-component species transport, and
   multi-region thermal analysis to be considered. The underlying
   physicochemical hydrodynamics, including porous-electrode and
   electro-chemical effects are described in detail. The openFuelCell
   program is developed in an object-oriented open-source C++ library. The
   code is available at http://openfuelcell.sourceforge.net/. The paper
   also describes domain decomposition techniques considered in the context
   of highly efficient parallel programming. Crown Copyright (C) 2015

Title = {{Strength model for end cover separation failure in RC beams strengthened

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{110}},

Abstract = {{As an alternative to externally bonded FRP reinforcement, near-surface
   mounted (NSM) FRP reinforcement can be used to effectively improve the
   flexural performance of RC beams. In such FRP-strengthened RC beams, end
   cover separation failure is one of the common failure modes. This
   failure mode involves the detachment of the NSM FRP reinforcement
   together with the concrete cover along the level of the tension steel
   reinforcement. This paper presents a new strength model for end cover
   separation failure in RC beams strengthened in flexure with NSM FRP
   strips (i.e. rectangular FRP bars with a sectional height-to-thickness
   ratio not less than 5), which was formulated on the basis of extensive
   numerical results from a parametric study undertaken using an efficient
   finite element approach. The proposed strength model consists of an
   approximate equation for the debonding strain of the FRP reinforcement
   at the critical cracked section and a conventional section analysis to
   relate this debonding strain to the moment acting on the same section
   (i.e. the debonding strain). Once the debonding strain is known, the
   load level at end cover separation of an FRP-strengthened RC beam can be
   easily determined for a given load distribution. Predictions from the
   proposed strength model are compared with those of two existing strength
   models of the same type and available test results, which shows that the
   proposed strength model is in close agreement with test results and is
   far more accurate than the existing strength models. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{As a newly invented parallel kinematic machine (PKM), Exechon has
   attracted intensive attention from both academic and industrial fields
   due to its conceptual high performance. Nevertheless, the dynamic
   behaviors of Exechon PKM have not been thoroughly investigated because
   of its structural and kinematic complexities. To identify the dynamic
   characteristics of Exechon PKM, an elastodynamic model is proposed with
   the substructure synthesis technique in this paper. The Exechon PKM is
   divided into a moving platform subsystem, a fixed base subsystem and
   three limb subsystems according to its structural features. Differential
   equations of motion for the limb subsystem are derived through finite
   element (FE) formulations by modeling the complex limb structure as a
   spatial beam with corresponding geometric cross sections. Meanwhile,
   revolute, universal, and spherical joints are simplified into virtual
   lumped springs associated with equivalent stiffnesses and mass at their
   geometric centers. Differential equations of motion for the moving
   platform are derived with Newton's second law after treating the
   platform as a rigid body due to its comparatively high rigidity. After
   introducing the deformation compatibility conditions between the
   platform and the limbs, governing differential equations of motion for
   Exechon PKM are derived. The solution to characteristic equations leads
   to natural frequencies and corresponding modal shapes of the PKM at any
   typical configuration. In order to predict the dynamic behaviors in a
   quick manner, an algorithm is proposed to numerically compute the
   distributions of natural frequencies throughout the workspace.
   Simulation results reveal that the lower natural frequencies are
   strongly position-dependent and distributed axial-symmetrically due to
   the structure symmetry of the limbs. At the last stage, a parametric
   analysis is carried out to identify the effects of structural,
   dimensional, and stiffness parameters on the system's dynamic
   characteristics with the purpose of providing useful information for
   optimal design and performance improvement of the Exechon PKM. The
   elastodynamic modeling methodology and dynamic analysis procedure can be
   well extended to other overconstrained PKMs with minor modifications.}},

Abstract = {{A triple-band 1 x 2 microstrip patch antenna array is proposed for use
   in next generation flying ad-hoc network (FANET) communication in
   multi-UAV systems. The antenna array resonates in the 3.6 GHz, 5.2 GHz
   and 6.7 GHz frequency bands, respectively. The antenna was designed and
   simulated using Agilent ADS Momentum using FR4 epoxy glass substrate
   (epsilon(r)=4.2 and h=1.66mm). A hybrid feed technique is used for
   antenna arrays with quarter-wave transformer based network to match the
   impedance from the feed-point to the antenna to 50. The antenna is
   optimized to resonate at triple-bands by introducing two symmetrical
   slits at the non-radiating edges of the patch. The bandwidths achieved
   for the three bands are 130 MHz, 125 MHz and 180 MHz, respectively,
   which are very practical. The antenna array design is less complex and
   can be used for the advanced antenna beam-steering systems in next
   generation FANETs. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microwave Opt

Abstract = {{New techniques are presented for using the medial axis to generate

   uses both the topological and geometric information in the medial axis
   to establish a valid and effective arrangement of mesh singularities for
   any 2-D surface. It deals with concavities effectively and finds
   solutions that are most appropriate to the geometric shapes. Resulting
   meshes are shown for a number of example models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   spatial data in geographic information systems}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{123-162}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Perfect information is seldom available to man or machines due to
   uncertainties inherent in real world problems. Uncertainties in
   geographic information systems (GIS) stem from either vague/ambiguous or
   imprecise/inaccurate/incomplete information and it is necessary for GIS
   to develop tools and techniques to manage these uncertainties. There is
   a widespread agreement in the GIS community that although GIS has the
   potential to support a wide range of spatial data analysis problems,
   this potential is often hindered by the lack of consistency and
   uniformity. Uncertainties come in many shapes and forms, and processing
   uncertain spatial data requires a practical taxonomy to aid decision
   makers in choosing the most suitable data modeling and analysis method.
   In this paper, we: (1) review important developments in handling
   uncertainties when working with spatial data and GIS applications; (2)
   propose a taxonomy of models for dealing with uncertainties in GIS; and
   (3) identify current challenges and future research directions in
   spatial data analysis and GIS for managing uncertainties. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Queen's University Belfast and Wave Barrier Ltd have developed a tidal
   testing platform to test hydro-kinetic turbines at medium scale.
   Multiple turbines can be pushed through still water conditions, in
   steady-state pushing tests. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the
   interactions between two identical, mono-strut, horizontal axis tidal
   turbines (HATTs) of 1.5 m diameter (13) rotor. Their relative
   performance when located individually, in-plane and in-line are
   investigated. The data shows a high consistency in the power curves at
   different flow speeds, which indicates high repeatability in this
   Reynolds range. For an individual turbine, there is no performance
   difference when the rotor is mounted either upstream or downstream of
   the supporting structure. When placed in-plane, the turbines have no
   adverse effect on one another. When spaced in-line with 2D separation,
   there is a 63\% reduction in the performance of the downstream turbine.
   At 6D downstream this performance reduction is still 59\%, indicating
   some wake recovery between 2D and 6D, though the influence from the
   upstream rotor persists to at least 6D downstream of the first device.
   In contrast the performance of the downstream turbine when placed at
   1.5D offset of the upstream device at 6D downstream is approximately
   recovered to the individual turbine performance. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Grid operators and electricity retailers in Ireland manage peak demand,
   power system balancing and grid congestion by offering relevant
   incentives to consumers to reduce or shift their load. The need for
   active consumers in the home using smart appliances has never been
   greater, due to increased variable renewable generation and grid
   constraints. In this paper an aggregated model of a single compressor
   fridge-freezer population is developed. A price control strategy is
   examined to quantify and value demand response savings during a
   representative winter and summer week for Ireland in 2020. The results
   show an average reduction in fridge-freezer operating cost of 8.2\%
   during winter and significantly lower during summer in Ireland. A peak
   reduction of at least 68\% of the average winter refrigeration load is
   achieved consistently during the week analysed using a staggering
   control mode. An analysis of the current ancillary service payments
   confirms that these are insufficient to ensure widespread uptake by the
   small consumer, and new mechanisms need to be developed to make becoming
   an active consumer attractive. Demand response is proposed as a new
   ancillary service called ramping capability, as the need for this
   service will increase with more renewable energy penetration on the
   power system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The speed of manufacturing processes today depends on a trade-off
   between the physical processes of production, the wider system that
   allows these processes to operate and the co-ordination of a supply
   chain in the pursuit of meeting customer needs. Could the speed of this
   activity be doubled? This paper explores this hypothetical question,
   starting with examination of a diverse set of case studies spanning the
   activities of manufacturing. This reveals that the constraints on
   increasing manufacturing speed have some common themes, and several of
   these are examined in more detail, to identify absolute limits to
   performance. The physical processes of production are constrained by
   factors such as machine stiffness, actuator acceleration, heat transfer
   and the delivery of fluids, and for each of these, a simplified model is
   used to analyse the gap between current and limiting performance. The
   wider systems of production require the co-ordination of resources and
   push at the limits of human biophysical and cognitive limits. Evidence
   about these is explored and related to current practice. Out of this
   discussion, five promising innovations are explored to show examples of
   how manufacturing speed is increasing with line arrays of point
   actuators, parallel tools, tailored application of precision,
   hybridisation and task taxonomies. The paper addresses a broad question
   which could be pursued by a wider community and in greater depth, but
   even this first examination suggests the possibility of unanticipated
   innovations in current manufacturing practices. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The -particle light response of liquid scintillators based on linear
   alkylbenzene (LAB) has been measured with three different experimental
   approaches. In the first approach, -particles were produced in the
   scintillator via C(n,)Be reactions. In the second approach, the
   scintillator was loaded with 2 \% of Sm providing an -emitter, Sm, as an
   internal source. In the third approach, a scintillator flask was
   deployed into the water-filled SNO+ detector and the radioactive
   contaminants Rn, Po and Po provided the -particle signal. The behavior
   of the observed -particle light outputs are in agreement with each case
   successfully described by Birks' law. The resulting Birks parameter kB
   ranges from to cm/MeV. In the first approach, the -particle light
   response was measured simultaneously with the light response of recoil
   protons produced via neutron-proton elastic scattering. This enabled a
   first time a direct comparison of kB describing the proton and the
   -particle response of LAB based scintillator. The observed kB values
   describing the two light response functions deviate by more than . The
   presented results are valuable for all current and future detectors,
   using LAB based scintillator as target, since they depend on an accurate
   knowledge of the scintillator response to different particles.}},

Abstract = {{Design of effective cooperative jamming (CJ) algorithm is studied in
   this paper to maximize the achievable secrecy rate when the total
   transmit power of the source and multiple trusted terminals is
   constrained. Recently, the same problem was studied in {[}1] and an
   optimal algorithm was proposed involving a one-dimensional exhaustive
   searching. However, the computational complexity of such exhaustive
   searching could be very high, which may limit the practical use of the
   optimal algorithm. We propose an asymptotically optimal algorithm,
   involving only a fast line searching, which can guarantee to achieve the
   global optimality when the total transmit power goes to infinity.
   Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed asymptotically optimal
   algorithm essentially gives the same performance as the algorithm in
   {[}1, (44)] but with much lower computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Auger-ionized free-carriers in a one-dimensional semiconductor are

Abstract = {{How a galaxy regulates its supernovae (SNe) energy into different
   interstellar/circumgalactic medium components strongly affects galaxy
   evolution. Based on the JVLA D-configuration C-(6 GHz) and L-band (1.6
   GHz) continuum observations, we perform statistical analysis comparing
   multiwavelength properties of the Continuum Haloes in Nearby Galaxies -
   an EVLA Survey galaxies. The high-quality JVLA data and edge-on
   orientation enable us for the first time to include the halo into the
   energy budget for a complete radio-flux-limited sample. We find tight
   correlations of L-radio with the mid-IR-based star formation rate (SFR).
   The normalization of our I1.6 GHz/WHz-1-SFR relation is similar to
   2-3times of those obtained for face-on galaxies, probably a result of
   enhanced IR extinction at high inclination. We also find tight
   correlations between L-radio and the SNe energy injection rate. (E)over
   dot(SN)(Ia+CC), indicating the energy loss via synchrotron radio
   continuum accounts for similar to 1 of. (E)over dot(SN), comparable to
   the energy contained in cosmic ray electrons. The integrated C-to-L-band
   spectral index is alpha similar to 0.5-1.1 for non-active galactic
   nucleus galaxies, indicating a dominance by the diffuse synchrotron
   component. The low-scatter L-radio-SFR/L-radio-. E SN(Ia+CC)
   relationships have superlinear logarithmic slopes at similar to 2 sigma
   in L band (1.132 +/- 0.067/1.175 +/- 0.102) while consistent with linear
   in C band (1.057 +/- 0.075/1.100 +/- 0.123). The superlinearity could be
   naturally reproduced with non-calorimeter models for galaxy discs. Using
   Chandra halo X-ray measurements, we find sublinear LX-L-radio relations.
   These results indicate that the observed radio halo of a starburst
   galaxy is close to electron calorimeter, and a galaxy with higher SFR
   tends to distribute an increased fraction of SNe energy into radio
   emission (than X-ray).}},

Abstract = {{Cobalt-free composite cathodes consisting of
   Pr0.6Sr0.4FeO3-delta-xCe(0.9)Pr(0.1)O(2-delta) (PSFO-xCPO, x = 0-50
   wt\%) have been synthesized using a one-pot method. X-ray diffraction,
   scanning electron microscopy, thermal expansion coefficient,
   conductivity, and polarization resistance (R-p) have been used to
   characterize the PSFO-xCPO cathodes. Furthermore the discharge
   performance of the Ni-SSZ/SSZ/GDC/PSFO-xCPO cells has been measured. The
   experimental results indicate that the PSFO-xCPO composite materials
   fully consist of PSFO and CPO phases and posses a porous microstructure.
   The conductivity of PSFO-xCPO decreases with the increase of CPO
   content, but R-p of PSFO-40CPO shows the smallest value amongst all the
   samples. The power density of single cells with a PSFO-40CPO composite
   cathode is significantly improved compared with that of the PSFO
   cathode, exhibiting 0.43, 0.75, 1.08 and 1.30 W cm(-2) at 650, 700, 750
   and 800 degrees C, respectively. In addition, single cells with the
   PSFO-40CPO composite cathode show a stable performance with no obvious
   degradation over 100 h when operating at 750 degrees C. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Future power systems are expected to integrate large-scale stochastic
   and intermittent generation and load due to reduced use of fossil fuel
   resources, including renewable energy sources and electric vehicles
   (EV). Inclusion of such resources poses challenges for the dynamic
   stability of synchronous transmission and distribution networks, not
   least in terms of generation where system inertia may not be wholly
   governed by large-scale generation but displaced by small-scale and
   localised generation. Energy storage systems (ESS) can limit the impact
   of dispersed and distributed generation by offering supporting reserve
   while accommodating large-scale EV connection; the latter (load) also
   participating in storage provision. In this study, a local energy
   storage system (LESS) is proposed. The structure, requirement and
   optimal sizing of the LESS are discussed. Three operating modes are
   detailed, including: (i) storage pack management; (ii) normal operation;
   and (iii) contingency operation. The proposed LESS scheme is evaluated
   using simulation studies based on data obtained from the Northern
   Ireland regional and residential network.}},

Abstract = {{Galactokinase catalyses the first committed step of the Leloir pathway,
   i.e. the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of alpha-D-galactose at C-1-OH.
   Reduced galactokinase activity results in the inherited metabolic
   disease type II galactosaemia. However, inhibition of galactokinase is
   considered a viable approach to treating more severe forms of
   galactosaemia (types I and III). Considerable progress has been made in
   the identification of high affinity, selective inhibitors. Although the
   structure of galactokinase from a variety of species is known, its
   catalytic mechanism remains uncertain. Although the bulk of evidence
   suggests that the reaction proceeds via an active site base mechanism,
   some experimental and theoretical studies contradict this. The enzyme
   has potential as a biocatalyst in the production of sugar 1-phosphates.
   This potential is limited by its high specificity. A variety of
   approaches have been taken to identify galactokinase variants which are
   more promiscuous. These have broadened galactokinase's specificity to
   include a wide range of D- and L-sugars. Initial studies suggest that
   some of these alterations result in increased flexibility at the active
   site. It is suggested that modulation of protein flexibility is at least
   as important as structural modifications in determining the success or
   failure of enzyme engineering.}},

Abstract = {{We use molecular dynamics simulation to study the mechanisms of
   plasticity during cutting of mono crystalline and polycrystalline
   silicon. Three scenarios are considered: (i) cutting a single crystal
   silicon workpiece with a single crystal diamond tool, (ii) cutting a
   polysilicon workpiece with a single crystal diamond tool, and (iii)
   cutting a single crystal silicon workpiece with a polycrystalline
   diamond tool. A long-range analytical bond order potential is used in
   the simulations, providing a more accurate picture of the atomic-scale
   mechanisms of brittle fracture, ductile plasticity, and structural
   changes in silicon. The MD simulation results show a unique phenomenon
   of brittle cracking typically inclined at an angle of 45 degrees-55
   degrees to the cut surface, leading to the formation of periodic arrays
   of nanogrooves in mono crystalline silicon, which is a new insight into
   previously published results. Furthermore, during cutting, silicon is
   found to undergo solid-state directional amorphisation without prior
   Si-I to Si-II (beta tin) transformation, which is in direct contrast to
   many previously published MD studies on this topic. Our simulations also
   predict that the propensity for amorphisation is significantly higher in
   single crystal silicon than in polysilicon, signifying that grain
   boundaries eases the material removal process. Crown Copyright (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the asymptotic optimality of the Constant False
   Alarm Rate (CFAR) tests obtained using the Minimal Invariant Group (MIG)
   reduction. We show that the CFAR tests obtained after MIG reduction
   using the Wald test is a Separating Function Estimation Test (SFET) and
   that the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) and the Rao test are
   asymptotically SFET using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) under some
   mild conditions. Thus, they are asymptotically optimal. In order to find
   an improved test and motivated by the invariance property of the MLE of
   induced maximal invariant, we maximize the asymptotic Probability of
   Detection of the SFET using the MLE after reduction. We propose a
   systematic method allowing to derive the asymptotically optimal
   Separating Function (AOSF). This AOSF is obtained as the Euclidean
   distance of the transformed parameters under two hypotheses such that
   the gradient of the transformed parameters is the Cholesky decomposition
   of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), i.e., the FIM is transformed
   into an identity matrix. Interestingly, the AOSF Estimation Test
   (AOSFET) using MLE simplifies to the Wald-CFAR wherever the FIM does not
   depend on the unknown parameters. The simulation results show that the
   proposed AOSFET usually outperforms the GLRT, Wald test and Rao test.}},

   synthesized using the organocatalyst 1,8-diazabicyclo{[}5.4.0]
   undec-7-ene (DBU) were studied and compared to those with the commonly
   used catalyst/initiator for ring-opening polymerization of cyclic
   carbonates and esters, stannous 2-ethylhexanoate. Further, the utility
   of each of these catalysts in the copolymerization of TMCM-MOE3OM with
   trimethylene carbonate (TMC) and L-lactide (LLA) was examined.
   Regardless of conditions with either catalyst, homopolymerization of
   TMCM-MOE3OM yielded oligomers, having number average molecular weight
   less than 4000 Da. The resultant molecular weight was limited by
   ring-chain equilibrium as well as through monomer autopolymerization.
   Interestingly, auto-polymerization of TMC was also achieved with DBU as
   the catalyst. Copolymerization with TMC using stannous 2-ethylhexanoate
   as the catalyst yielded random copolymers, while diblock copolymers were
   formed by copolymerization with LLA. With DBU as the catalyst,
   copolymers with LLA could not be formed, while blocky copolymers were

Title = {{The application of a novel fluidised photo reactor under UV-Visible and

Abstract = {{With advancements in the development of visible light responsive
   catalysts for H-2 production frequently being reported, photocatalytic
   water splitting has become an attractive method as a potential `solar
   fuel generator'. The development of novel photo reactors which can
   enhance the potential of such catalyst, however, is rarely reported.
   This is particularly important as many reactor configurations are mass
   transport limited, which in turn limits the efficiency of more effective
   photocatalysts in larger scale applications. This paper describes the
   performance of a novel fluidised photo reactor for the production of H-2
   over two catalysts under UV-Visible light and natural solar
   illumination. Catalysts Pt-C3N4 and NaTaO3.La were dispersed in the
   reactor and the rate of H-2 was determined by GC-TCD analysis of the gas
   headspace. The unit was an annular reactor constructed from stainless
   steel 316 and quartz glass with a propeller located in the base to
   control fluidisation of powder catalysts. Reactor properties such as
   propeller rotational speed were found to enhance the photo activity of
   the system through the elimination of mass transport limitations and
   increasing light penetration. The optimum conditions for H-2 evolution
   were found to be a propeller rotational speed of 1035 rpm and 144W of
   UV-Visible irradiation, which produced a rate of 89 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)
   over Pt-C3N4. Solar irradiation was provided by the George Ellery Hale
   Solar Telescope, located at the California Institute of Technology. (C)

Abstract = {{The MiMeS (Magnetism in Massive Stars) project is a large-scale,
   high-resolution, sensitive spectropolarimetric investigation of the
   magnetic properties of O- and early B-type stars. Initiated in 2008 and
   completed in 2013, the project was supported by three Large Program
   allocations, as well as various programmes initiated by independent
   principal investigators, and archival resources. Ultimately, over 4800
   circularly polarized spectra of 560 O and B stars were collected with
   the instruments ESPaDOnS (Echelle SpectroPolarimetric Device for the
   Observation of Stars) at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, Narval at
   the Telescope Bernard Lyot and HARPSpol at the European Southern
   Observatory La Silla 3.6 m telescope, making MiMeS by far the largest
   systematic investigation of massive star magnetism ever undertaken. In
   this paper, the first in a series reporting the general results of the
   survey, we introduce the scientific motivation and goals, describe the
   sample of targets, review the instrumentation and observational
   techniques used, explain the exposure time calculation designed to
   provide sensitivity to surface dipole fields above approximately 100 G,
   discuss the polarimetric performance, stability and uncertainty of the
   instrumentation, and summarize the previous and forthcoming
   publications.}},

Abstract = {{The mono(-oxo) dicopper cores present in the pores of Cu-ZSM-5 are
   active for the partial oxidation of methane to methanol. However, copper
   on the external surface reduces the ratio of active, selective sites to
   unselective sites. More efficient catalysts are obtained by controlling
   the copper deposition during synthesis. Herein, the external exchange
   sites of ZSM-5 samples were passivated by bis(trimethylsilyl)
   trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) followed by calcination, promoting selective
   deposition of intraporous copper during aqueous copper ion exchange. At
   an optimum level of 1-2wt\% SiO2, IR studies showed a 64\% relative
   reduction in external copper species and temperature-programmed
   oxidation analysis showed an associated increase in the formation of
   methanol compared with unmodified Cu-ZSM-5 samples. It is, therefore,
   reported that the modified zeolites contained a significantly higher
   proportion of active, selective copper species than their unmodified
   counterparts with activity for partial methane oxidation to methanol.}},

Abstract = {{Bridge weigh in motion (B-WIM) uses accurate sensing systems to
   transform an existing bridge into a mechanism to determine actual
   traffic loading. This information on traffic loading can enable
   efficient and economical management of transport networks and is
   becoming a valuable tool for bridge safety assessment. B-WIM can provide
   site-specific traffic loading on deteriorating bridges, which can be
   used to determine if the reduced capacity is still sufficient to allow
   the structure to remain operational and minimise unnecessary replacement
   or rehabilitation costs and prevent disruption to traffic. There have
   been numerous reports on the accuracy classifications of existing B-WIM
   installations and some common issues have emerged. This paper details
   some of the recent developments in B-WIM which were aimed at overcoming
   these issues. A new system has been developed at Queens University
   Belfast using fibre optic sensors to provide accurate axle detection and
   improved accuracy overall. The results presented in this paper show that
   the fibre optic system provided much more accurate results than
   conventional WIM systems, as the FOS provide clearer signals at high
   scanning rates which require less filtering and less post-processing. A
   major disadvantage of existing B-WIM systems is the inability to deal
   with more than one vehicle on the bridge at the same time; sensor strips
   have been proposed to overcome this issue. A bridge can be considered
   safe if the probability that load exceeds resistance is acceptably low,
   hence B-WIM information from advanced sensors can provide confidence in
   our ageing structures.}},

Title = {{Using particle dispersal models to assist in the conservation and

   enclosed sea lough}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},

Abstract = {{Oyster populations around the world have seen catastrophic decline which
   has been largely attributed to over exploitation, disease and pollution.
   While considerable effort and resources have been implemented into
   restoring these important environmental engineers, the success of oyster
   populations is often limited by poor understanding of site-specific
   dispersal patterns of propagules. Water-borne transport is a key factor
   controlling or regulating the dispersal of the larval stage of benthic
   marine invertebrates which have limited mobility. The distribution of
   the native oyster Ostrea edulis in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland,
   together with their densities and population structure at subtidal and
   intertidal sites has been documented at irregular intervals between 1997
   and 2013. This paper revisits this historical data and considers whether
   different prevailing environmental conditions can be used to explain the
   distribution, densities and population structure of O. edulis in
   Strangford Lough. The approach adopted involved comparing predictive 2D
   hydrodynamic models coupled with particle tracking to simulate the
   dispersal of oyster larvae with historical and recent field records of
   the distribution of both subtidal and intertidal, populations since
   1995. Results from the models support the hypothesis that commercial
   stocks of 0. edulis introduced into Strangford Lough in the 1990s
   resulted in the re-establishment of wild populations of oysters in the
   Northern Basin which in turn provided a potential source of propagules
   for subtidal populations. These results highlight that strategic site
   selection (while inadvertent in the case of the introduced population in
   1995) for the re-introduction of important shellfish species can
   significantly accelerate their recovery and restoration. (C) 2015

   Rational Selection of Hot-melt Extrusion Processing Parameters}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this article was to construct a T-phi phase diagram for a
   model drug (FD) and amorphous polymer (Eudragit (R) EPO) and to use this
   information to understand the impact of how temperature-composition
   coordinates influenced the final properties of the extrudate. Defining
   process boundaries and understanding drug solubility in polymeric
   carriers is of utmost importance and will help in the successful
   manufacture of new delivery platforms for BCS class II drugs. Physically
   mixed felodipine (FD)-Eudragit (R) EPO (EPO) binary mixtures with
   pre-determined weight fractions were analysed using DSC to measure the
   endset of melting and glass transition temperature. Extrudates of 10
   wt\% FD-EPO were processed using temperatures (110 degrees C, 126
   degrees C, 140 degrees C and 150 degrees C) selected from the
   temperature-composition (T-phi) phase diagrams and processing screw
   speed of 20, 100 and 200rpm. Extrudates were characterised using powder
   X-ray diffraction (PXRD), optical, polarised light and Raman microscopy.
   To ensure formation of a binary amorphous drug dispersion (ADD) at a
   specific composition, HME processing temperatures should at least be
   equal to, or exceed, the corresponding temperature value on the
   liquid-solid curve in a F-H T-phi phase diagram. If extruded between the
   spinodal and liquid-solid curve, the lack of thermodynamic forces to
   attain complete drug amorphisation may be compensated for through the
   use of an increased screw speed. Constructing F-H T-phi phase diagrams
   are valuable not only in the understanding drug-polymer miscibility
   behaviour but also in rationalising the selection of important
   processing parameters for HME to ensure miscibility of drug and polymer.}},

Abstract = {{The reduction of CO2 on copper electrodes has attracted great attentions
   in the last decades, since it provides a sustainable approach for energy
   restore. During the CO2 reduction process, the electron transfer to
   COads is experimentally suggested to be the crucial step. In this work,
   we examine two possible pathways in CO activation, i.e. to generate
   COHads and CHOads, respectively, by performing the state-of-the-art
   constrained ab initio molecular dynamics simulations on the charged
   Cu(100) electrode under aqueous conditions, which is close to the
   realistic electrochemical condition. The free energy profile in the
   formation of COHads via the coupled proton and electron transfer is
   plotted. Furthermore, by Bader charge analyses, a linear relationship
   between C-O bond distance and the negative charge in CO fragment is
   unveiled. The formation of COHads is identified to be a surface
   catalytic reaction, which requires the adsorption of H atom on the
   surface first. By comparing these two pathways, we demonstrate that
   kinetically the formation of COHads is more favored than that of COHads,
   while COHads is thermodynamically more stable. This work reveals that CO
   activation via COHads intermediate is an important pathway in
   electrocatalysis, which could provide some insights into CO2
   electroreduction over Cu electrodes. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published

   attached at random positions along the backbone. The macromer dispersant
   is incorporated more effectively than the randomly grafted dispersant, a
   result attributed to the uniform distribution of reactive double bonds
   across the entire dispersant molar mass distribution, although the
   effectiveness of the macromer dispersant decreases when methacrylates

Abstract = {{This letter investigates the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) of a
   two-tier cellular network, where massive multiple-input multiple-output
   macro base stations are overlaid with dense small cells. Macro user
   equipments (MUEs) and small cells with single user equipment uniformly
   scattered are modeled as two independent homogeneous Poisson point
   processes. By applying stochastic geometry, we analyze the multiuser
   uplink SE at a macro base station that employs a zero-forcing detector
   and we obtain a novel lower bound as well as its approximation.
   According to the simple and near-exact analytical expression, we observe
   that the ideal way to improve the SE is by increasing the MUE density
   and the base station antennas synchronously rather than increasing them
   individually. Furthermore, a large value of path loss exponent has a
   positive effect on the SE due to the reduced aggregated interference.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytical performance investigation of both
   beamforming (BF) and interference cancellation (IC) strategies for a
   device-to-device (D2D) communication system underlaying a cellular
   network with an M-antenna base station (BS). We first derive new
   closed-form expressions for the ergodic achievable rate for BF and IC
   precoding strategies with quantized channel state information (CSI), as
   well as, perfect CSI. Then, novel lower and upper bounds are derived
   which apply for an arbitrary number of antennas and are shown to be
   sufficiently tight to the Monte-Carlo results. Based on these results,
   we examine in detail three important special cases including: high
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), weak interference between cellular link and
   D2D link, and BS equipped with a large number of antennas. We also
   derive asymptotic expressions for the ergodic achievable rate for these
   scenarios. Based on these results, we obtain valuable insights into the
   impact of the system parameters, such as the number of antennas, SNR and
   the interference for each link. In particular, we show that an
   irreducible saturation point exists in the high SNR regime, while the
   ergodic rate under IC strategy is verified to be always better than that
   under BF strategy. We also reveal that the ergodic achievable rate under
   perfect CSI scales as log(2)M, whilst it reaches a ceiling with
   quantized CSI.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the hydrogeological processes that caused
   unexpected instability and quick conditions during the excavation of a
   25 m deep cutting through a drumlin in County Down, Northern Ireland. A
   conceptual hydrogeological model of the cutting, based on pore pressures
   monitored during and after the excavation, demonstrates how quick
   conditions at the toe of the cutting caused liquefaction of the till.
   Stability of the cutting was re-established by draining the highly
   permeable, weathered greywacke that underlies the drumlin, through the
   use of a deep toe drain. In spite of this drainage, the cutting was only
   marginally stable, owing to the presence of a low-permeability zone in
   the till above the bedrock, which limits the reduction of elevated pore
   pressures within the upper to mid-depths of the drumlin. The factor of
   safety has been further improved by the addition of vertical relief
   drains at the crest and berm of the cutting to relieve the pore
   pressures within the upper till by intercepting the weathered bedrock.
   The paper also highlights the importance of carrying out an adequate
   site investigation compliant with Eurocode 7 and additional monitoring
   in excavations in stiff, low-permeability till.}},

Title = {{Polymer chain flexibility-induced differences in fetuin A adsorption and
   its implications on cell attachment and proliferation}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{89-98}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Tissue cells are known to respond to the stiffness of the polymer
   substrate on which they are grown. It has been suggested that material
   stiffness influences the composition of the protein layer that adsorbs
   to the material surface, which affects subsequent cell behavior.
   Previously, the stiffness of a biomaterial elastomer formed from an
   acrylated star-poly(D,L lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone) was found to
   influence both fibroblast proliferation as well as the adsorption of
   certain proteins. However, it remained unresolved as to whether material
   stiffness influenced protein adsorption from serum supplemented
   environments and which protein(s) may have been responsible for the
   difference in fibroblast proliferation. Using quantitative proteomics,
   we show that polymer stiffness influenced the composition of the protein
   layers that adsorb from serum supplemented media. Fetuin A was
   identified as a protein that influenced fibroblast proliferation and,
   when combined with basic fibroblast growth factor as a medium
   supplement, improved fibroblast proliferation over 14 days. This study
   is the first to correlate cell proliferation to surface adsorbed fetuin
   A and presents the potential new application for fetuin A as biomaterial
   coating or surface modifier. This work also demonstrates a novel
   application of quantitative proteomics for the investigation of
   competitive protein adsorption to biomaterial surfaces.
   Statement of significance
   Cells are able to respond to the stiffness of their material substrate,
   but the method by which they sense material stiffness is still under
   investigation. Previously, material stiffness was found to impact the
   individual adsorption of fibronectin, a protein associated with cell
   attachment; however, it was unclear if stiffness was able to affect
   protein adsorption in environments with multiple proteins. This study
   shows that material stiffness affects the compositions of protein layers
   adsorbed from supplemented media, and suggests that cells may sense
   material stiffness via the adsorbed protein layer. Interestingly, fetuin
   A was found to be affecting cell proliferation and not fibronectin.
   Finally, this research demonstrates the use of relative quantitation
   proteomics as a potentially powerful method to improve biomaterial
   compatibility. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A class of metasurfaces and high impedance surfaces (HISs) formed by
   doubly periodic arrays of interleaved conductors with subwavelength unit

   distinctive features of these surfaces such as a broad fractional
   bandwidth (FBW), high angular and polarization stability, and low loss
   are revealed and elucidated. It is demonstrated that all these salient
   characteristics of the interleaved arrays and HISs are attainable
   simultaneously being controlled by the pattern geometry. It is shown
   that the interleaved Brigid's cross HIS with truly subwavelength unit
   cells exhibits practically the same FBW and losses as a square patch HIS
   with much larger unit cell. The effects of a dielectric substrate and
   near-field confinement on the properties of intertwined Brigid's cross
   arrays are examined, and the analytical models provide insight into the
   performance of the discussed metasurfaces and HISs.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular mechanosensitivity is an important factor during the mechanical
   stimulation of tissue engineered cartilage. While the application of
   mechanical stimuli improves tissue growth and properties, chondrocytes
   also rapidly desensitize under prolonged loading thereby limiting its
   effectiveness. One potential method to mitigate load-induced
   desensitization is by superimposing noise on the loading waveforms
   (stochastic resonance). Thus, the purpose of this study was to
   investigate the effects of stochastic resonance on chondrocyte matrix
   metabolism. Chondrocyte-seeded agarose gels were subjected to dynamic
   compressive loading, with or without, superimposed vibrations of
   different amplitudes and frequency bandwidths. Changes in matrix
   biosynthesis were determined by radioisotope incorporation and
   subsequent effects on intracellular calcium signaling were evaluated by
   confocal microscopy. Although dependent on the duration of loading,
   superimposed vibrations improved cellular sensitivity to mechanical
   loading by further increasing matrix synthesis between 20-60\%.
   Stochastic resonance also appeared to limit load-induced desensitization
   by maintaining sensitivity under desensitized loading conditions. While
   superimposed vibrations had little effect on the magnitude of
   intracellular calcium signaling, recovery of mechanosensitivity after
   stimulation was achieved at a faster rate suggesting that less time may
   be required between successive loading applications. Thus, stochastic
   resonance appears to be a valuable tool during the mechanical
   stimulation of cartilage constructs, even when suboptimal stimulation
   conditions are used. (c) 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Triiodide/iodide (I-3(-)/I-) represents a widely used redox couple and
   plays an important role in some photovoltaic devices. However, the
   understanding of the triiodide reduction kinetics occurring at the
   liquid/electrode interface is very limiting, which largely hinders the
   identification of highly efficient electrode material. In this work, by
   virtue of DFT calculations, we systematically investigated the I-3(-)
   electroreduction at some acetonitrile/electrode interfaces and uncovered
   two new BEP relations for the key elementary steps, I-2 dissociation and
   I{*} desorption through one-electron reduction. Furthermore, by
   utilizing a steady-state microkinetic model, we successfully identified
   a general volcano-shaped activity trend of triiodide electroreduction as
   a function of a single descriptor, the adsorption energy of I atom
   (E-ad(I)) at the interface. Our results show that a good catalyst should
   possess an E-ad(I) within the range of 0.3-0.6 eV, while the optimal
   E-ad(I) is 0.43 eV, where the surface coverages of free sites and iodine
   atoms are equal. In particular, the dependences of the volcano shape on
   the electrochemical conditions (external voltage, temperature,
   concentration, and transfer coefficient) are quantitatively discussed.
   Some suggestions for the optimization of experimental conditions and
   design of better catalysts are also provided.}},

Abstract = {{The development and optimization of catalysts and catalytic processes
   requires knowledge of reaction kinetics and mechanisms. In traditional
   catalyst kinetic characterization, the gas composition is known at the
   inlet, and the exit flow is measured to determine changes in
   concentration. As such, the progression of the chemistry within the
   catalyst is not known. Technological advances in electromagnetic and
   physical probes have made visualizing the evolution of the chemistry
   within catalyst samples a reality, as part of a methodology commonly
   known as spatial resolution. Herein, we discuss and evaluate the
   development of spatially resolved techniques, including the evolutions
   and achievements of this growing area of catalytic research. The impact
   of such techniques is discussed in terms of the invasiveness of physical
   probes on catalytic systems, as well as how experimentally obtained
   spatial profiles can be used in conjunction with kinetic modeling.
   Furthermore, some aims and aspirations for further evolution of
   spatially resolved techniques are considered.}},

Abstract = {{The out-of-plane bending of sandwich panels has been widely
   investigated, but studies on their behavior under in-plane loading are
   quite scarce. In this study, 18 sandwich beam specimens were tested
   under three- and four-point in-plane-bending. The specimens are composed
   of low-density polyurethane core and glass fiber-reinforced polymer
   (GFRP) skins on both sides. The shear span-to-depth (a/h) ratio was
   varied from 1.33 to 4.67. Two different skin thicknesses were also used,
   providing beam depth-to-skin thickness (h/t) ratios of 47 and 94. It was
   found that the ultimate moment reduced by approximately one third as the
   a/h ratio increased from 1.33 to 4.67 in sandwich beams with an h/t
   ratio of 94 and decreased by about one quarter in beams with an h/t
   ratio of 47. Doubling the skin thickness {[}i.e.,from h/t of 94-47]
   increased the moment capacity significantly. The percentage increase
   ranged from 55 to 95\% as a/h increased from 1.33 to 4.67. Failure of
   sandwich beams occurred by skin wrinkling in compression, mostly
   symmetrically, where skins move in opposite directions. A simplified
   analytical model accounting for shear and flexural rigidities of the
   sandwich beam and a skin wrinkling failure criterion in compression was
   developed and validated against experimental results. (C) 2015 American

   (Kr2+) irradiation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{Zr-Excel alloy (Zr-3.5Sn-0.8Nb-0.8Mo, wt.\%) has been proposed as a
   candidate material of pressure tubes in the CANDU-SCWR design. It is a
   dual-phase alloy containing primary hcp alpha-Zr and metastable bcc
   beta-Zr. Metastable hexagonal omega-Zr phase could form in beta-Zr as a
   result of aging during the processing of the tube. A synchrotron X-ray
   study was employed to study the lattice properties of the metastable
   phases in as-received Zr-Excel pressure tube material. In situ heavy ion
   (1 MeV Kr2+) irradiations were carried out at 200 degrees C and 450
   degrees C to emulate the stability of the metastable phase under a
   reactor environment. Quantitative Chemi-STEM EDS analysis was conducted
   on both un-irradiated and irradiated samples to investigate alloying
   element redistribution induced by heavy ion irradiation. It was found
   that no decomposition of beta-Zr was observed under irradiation at both
   200 degrees C and 450 degrees C. However, omega-Zr particles experienced
   shape changes and shrinkage associated with enrichment of Fe at the
   beta/omega interface during 200 degrees C irradiation but not at 450
   degrees C. There is a noticeable increase in the level of Fe in the a
   matrix after irradiation at both 200 degrees C and 450 degrees C. The
   concentrations of Nb, Mo and Fe are increased in the omega phase but
   decreased in the beta phase at 200 degrees C. The stability of
   metastable phases under heavy ion irradiation associated with elemental
   redistribution is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, ionic liquids have been demonstrated to increase the
   efficiency of solvent extraction of lipids from microalgae. However, to
   date, mostly imidazolium-based ionic liquids have been investigated.
   This report extends the range of cations studied to over 30, including
   imidazolium, ammonium, phosphonium, and pyridinium derivatives, which
   were screened for their ability to increase hexane extraction efficiency
   of lipids from freeze-dried microalgae Chlorella vulgaris at ambient
   temperature. Promising ionic liquids were first identified using
   gravimetric analysis of total extractable oils. Oils extracted after
   ionic liquid pretreatment were further characterized with respect to
   fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) equal to biodiesel yield, FAME
   composition, and chlorophyll content. With few exceptions, all of the
   tested ionic liquids had lower chlorophyll content than standard solvent
   extraction techniques. The effect of process parameters such as mass
   ratio of algae to ionic liquid, incubation time, water content, and
   cosolvents were investigated for 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   ethylsulfate {[}C(2)mim] {[}EtSO4]. The results indicate that this ionic
   liquid can disrupt C. vulgaris in conjunction with methanol and allow
   facile recovery of lipids over a large degree of dewatered microalgae
   (0-82 wt \% water), in a small amount of time (75 min) at room
   temperature, resulting in the development of a low energy, water
   compatible, biodiesel production scheme.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates virtual inertia control of doubly fed induction
   generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines to provide dynamic frequency
   support in the event of sudden power change. The relationships among
   DFIGs' virtual inertia, rotor speed and network frequency variation are
   analysed, and a novel virtual inertia control strategy is proposed. The
   proposed control strategy shifts the maximum power point tracking (MPPT)
   curve to the virtual inertia control curves according to the frequency
   deviation so as to release the `hidden' kinetic energy and provide
   dynamic frequency support to the grid. The calculation of the virtual
   inertia and its control curves are also presented. Compared with a PD
   regulator-based inertial controller, the proposed virtual inertia
   control scheme not only provides fast inertial response in the event of
   sudden power change but also achieves a smoother recovery to the MPPT
   operation. A four-machine system with 30\% of wind penetration is
   simulated to validate the proposed control strategy. Simulation results
   show that DFIG-based wind farms can provide rapid response to the
   frequency deviation using the proposed control strategy. Therefore, the
   dynamic frequency response of the power grid with high wind power
   penetration can be significantly improved. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley

   under Static Surface Loading}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{An alternative approach to replacing corrugated steel culverts is to
   insert a new pipe inside the existing culvert and grout the space
   between them, a process known as sliplining Though sliplining is a
   preferred rehabilitation approach among departments of transportation,
   very little research has been done to investigate the capacity
   enhancement provided by sliplining and how the load is shared between
   com ponents in a sliplined culvert (i.e., the existing pipe, the liner,
   the grout, and the surrounding soil). A series of experiments was
   conducted on a deteriorated corrugated steel culvert at two different
   burial depths (600 and 900 mm) under surface loading before and after
   the culvert was rehabilitated with a grouted high density polyethylene
   (HDPE) slipliner. The rehabilitated culvert was found to be considerably
   stiffer and the diameter changes under surface load were reduced by more
   than 90\% compared with the unrehabili.tated culvert suggesting that the
   negative arching between the pipe and the soil has increased. The
   strains in the existing pipe were also reduced by more than 70\% with
   negligible strain being measured in the invert of the culvert where the
   corrosion was concentrated. The results also indicated that when a neat
   grout with a compressive strength of approximately 30 MPa is used (what
   could be considered to be high strength in comparison with low density
   grouts featuring entrained air), the existing pipe and the grout carry
   most of the load, and the liner's main role is to improve the hydraulic
   conductivity. Additionally, because of the increased stiffness of the
   rehabilitated pipe, the surrounding soil carries less of the surface
   load applied above the pipe. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Bone tissue engineering may provide an alternative to autograft, however
   scaffold optimisation is required to maximize bone ingrowth. In
   designing scaffolds, pore architecture is important and there is
   evidence that cells prefer a degree of non-uniformity. The aim of this
   study was to compare scaffolds derived from a natural porous marine
   sponge (Spongia agaricina) with unique architecture to those derived
   from a synthetic polyurethane foam. Hydroxyapatite scaffolds of 1 cm(3)
   were prepared via ceramic infiltration of a marine sponge and a
   polyurethane (PU) foam. Human foetal osteoblasts (hFOB) were seeded at 1
   x 10(5) cells/scaffold for up to 14 days. Cytotoxicity, cell number,
   morphology and differentiation were investigated. PU-derived scaffolds
   had 84-91 \% porosity and 99.99 \% pore interconnectivity. In comparison
   marine sponge-derived scaffolds had 56-61 \% porosity and 99.9 \% pore
   interconnectivity. hFOB studies showed that a greater number of cells
   were found on marine sponge-derived scaffolds at than on the PU scaffold
   but there was no significant difference in cell differentiation. X-ray
   diffraction and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry showed that
   Si ions were released from the marine-derived scaffold. In summary,
   three dimensional porous constructs have been manufactured that support
   cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation but significantly
   more cells were seen on marine-derived scaffolds. This could be due both
   to the chemistry and pore architecture of the scaffolds with an
   additional biological stimulus from presence of Si ions. Further in vivo
   tests in orthotopic models are required but this marine-derived scaffold
   shows promise for applications in bone tissue engineering.}},

Title = {{Extent and mechanism of phase separation during the extrusion of calcium

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to increase understanding of the mechanism and
   dominant drivers influencing phase separation during ram extrusion of
   calcium phosphate (CaP) paste for orthopaedic applications. The liquid
   content of extrudate was determined, and the flow of liquid and powder
   phases within the syringe barrel during extrusion were observed, subject
   to various extrusion parameters. Increasing the initial liquid-to-powder
   mass ratio, LPR, (0.4-0.45), plunger rate (5-20 mm/min), and tapering
   the barrel exit (45 degrees-90 degrees) significantly reduced the extent
   of phase separation. Phase separation values ranged from (6.22 +/- 0.69
   to 18.94 +/- 0.69 \%). However altering needle geometry had no
   significant effect on phase separation. From powder tracing and liquid
   content determination, static zones of powder and a non-uniform liquid
   distribution was observed within the barrel. Measurements of extrudate
   and paste LPR within the barrel indicated that extrudate LPR remained
   constant during extrusion, while LPR of paste within the barrel
   decreased steadily. These observations indicate the mechanism of phase
   separation was located within the syringe barrel. Therefore phase
   separation can be attributed to either; (1) the liquid being forced
   downstream by an increase in pore pressure as a result of powder
   consolidation due to the pressure exerted by the plunger or (2) the
   liquid being drawn from paste within the barrel, due to suction, driven
   by dilation of the solids matrix at the barrel exit. Differentiating
   between these two mechanisms is difficult; however results obtained
   suggest that suction is the dominant phase separation mechanism
   occurring during extrusion of CaP paste.}},

Abstract = {{Design of reinforced concrete pipes focuses on circumferential bending
   moment. Analytical or numerical methods can be used to estimate these,
   but an adequate representation of the soil conditions and pipe
   properties is necessary. The objective of this research study is to use
   simple experiments (three-edge bearing tests) along with closed-form
   solutions to obtain the circumferential flexural rigidity of a 600 mm
   reinforced concrete pipe for use in calculating moments from
   experimental measurements of changes in curvature (without knowledge of
   the soil and loading conditions). The data from the experiments were
   also used to calculate an elastic modulus that can be used to represent
   the circumferential flexural rigidity of the specimen in numerical
   simulations without having to model the reinforcement. An assessment of
   the methods used in this research study is also presented. Finally, use
   of the circumferential flexural rigidity in interpretation of buried
   pipe experiments is illustrated where moments in a reinforced concrete
   pipeline subjected to live loading are inferred from measured strains,
   comparing pipes for different burial depths and configurations. (C) 2015

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PIPELINE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Joints in gravity flow pipelines can be subjected to internal or
   external pressure, depending on the conditions. Such conditions will
   influence the rotational stiffness of the joints and therefore may
   affect the behavior of the pipeline responding to surface loading. The
   purpose of this article is to characterize the influence of pressure
   variations on joint stiffness and assess their effect on pipeline
   response to live loading. First, rotation tests on a 600-mm-diameter
   reinforced concrete pipeline with gasketed bell and spigot joints
   subjected to internal positive and negative pressure are described.
   Next, numerical analyses are performed to approximate the rotational
   stiffness of the joint observed during the tests. Subsequently, these
   results are employed in new numerical analyses to evaluate the influence
   of the rotational stiffness of the joint on the behavior of a buried
   pipeline subjected to surface loading. It is shown that variations in
   pressure affect the rotational stiffness of the joint; however, these
   variations have little effect on the response of a pipeline when
   subjected to live loading. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   Blast and Impact Loading}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A major difficulty of the analysis of and design for close-in blasts is
   the high variability of the blast shock waves and the complex
   interactions between these waves and structures. Close-in blasts also
   tend to be severe loads that may cause extensive damage to a structural
   member. If the member in question is a load bearing column, its
   destruction may lead to a catastrophic progressive collapse of the
   structure. Thus any improvement on the performance of columns under
   close-in blast loading is a valuable addition to knowledge. This paper
   outlines a numerical model built using commercially available software
   to predict the response of concrete filled fiber reinforced polymer
   (FRP) tubes (CFFTs) and regular round reinforced concrete members to
   impacts and close-in blasts and determine the factors influencing their
   response. The models were verified against drop weight impact test lab
   measurements and single degree of freedom blast analyses. A parametric
   study was conducted using the verified models to investigate the effects
   of diameter, reinforcement ratio, and size of the blast on the response
   of CFFTs. It was found that the peak displacement response was inversely
   proportional to all three parameters. The results of the parametric
   study were used to construct new pressure-impulse diagrams for
   experimentally tested CFFT specimens that reflect the increased capacity
   of such members to blast loading. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Lap joints are widely used in the manufacture of stiffened panels and
   influence local panel sub-component stability, defining buckling unit
   dimensions and boundary conditions. Using the finite element method it
   is possible to model joints in great detail and predict panel buckling
   behaviour with accuracy. However, when modelling large panel structures
   such detailed analysis becomes computationally expensive. Moreover, the
   impact of local behaviour on global panel performance may reduce as the
   scale of the modelled structure increases. Thus this study presents
   coupled computational and experimental analyses, aimed at developing
   relationships between modelling fidelity and the size of the modelled
   structure, when the global static load to cause initial buckling is the
   required analysis output. Small, medium and large specimens representing
   welded lap-joined fuselage panel structure are examined. Two element
   types, shell and solid-shell, are employed to model each specimen,
   highlighting the impact of idealisation on the prediction of welded
   stiffened panel initial skin buckling.}},

Title = {{An executable formal semantics for UML-RT}},
Journal = {{SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{179-217}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We propose a formal semantics for UML-RT, a UML profile for real-time
   and embedded systems. The formal semantics is given by mapping UML-RT
   models into a language called kiltera, a real-time extension of the
   -calculus. Previous attempts to formalize the semantics of UML-RT have
   fallen short by considering only a very small subset of the language and
   providing fundamentally incomplete semantics based on incorrect
   assumptions, such as a one-to-one correspondence between ``capsules{''}
   and threads. Our semantics is novel in several ways: (1) it deals with
   both state machine diagrams and capsule diagrams; (2) it deals with
   aspects of UML-RT that have not been formalized before, such as thread
   allocation, service provision points, and service access points; (3) it
   supports an action language; and (4) the translation has been
   implemented in the form of a transformation from UML-RT models created
   with IBM's RSA-RTE tool, into kiltera code. To our knowledge, this is
   the most comprehensive formal semantics for UML-RT to date.}},

   fouling of a submerged membrane bioreactor}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{132-141}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The effect of COD:N ratio on sludge properties and their role in
   membrane fouling were examined using a well-controlled aerobic membrane
   bioreactor receiving a synthetic high strength wastewater containing
   glucose. Membrane performance was improved with an increase in the COD/N
   ratio (100:5-100:1.8) (i.e. reduced N dosage). Surface analysis of
   sludge by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicates significant
   differences in surface concentrations of elements C, O and N that were
   observed under different COD/N ratios, implying changes in the
   composition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Fourier
   transforth-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed a unique characteristic
   peak (C=O bonds) at 1735 cm(-1) under nitrogen limitation conditions.
   Total EPS decreased with an increase in COD/N ratio, corresponding to a
   decrease in the proteins (PN) to carbohydrates (CH) ratio in EPS. There
   were no significant differences in the total soluble microbial products
   (SMPs) but the ratio of PN/CH in SMPs decreased with an increase in
   COD/N ratios. The results suggest that EPS and SMP composition and the
   presence of a small quantity of filamentous microorganisms played an
   important role in controlling membrane fouling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The broad aim of this work was to investigate and optimize the
   properties of calcium phosphate bone cements (CPCs) for use in
   vertebroplasty to achieve effective primary fixation of spinal
   fractures. The incorporation of collagen, both bovine and from a marine
   sponge (Chondrosia reniformis), into a CPC was investigated. The
   biological properties of the CPC and collagen-CPC composites were
   assessed in vitro through the use of human bone marrow stromal cells.
   Cytotoxicity, proliferation, and osteoblastic differentiation were
   evaluated using lactate dehydrogenase, PicoGreen, and alkaline
   phosphatase activity assays, respectively. The addition of both types of
   collagen resulted in an increase in cytotoxicity, albeit not to a
   clinically relevant level. Cellular proliferation after 1, 7, and 14
   days was unchanged. The osteogenic potential of the CPC was reduced
   through the addition of bovine collagen but remained unchanged in the
   case of the marine collagen. These findings, coupled with previous work
   showing that incorporation of marine collagen in this way can improve
   the physical properties of CPCs, suggest that such a composite may offer
   an alternative to CPCs in applications where low setting times and
   higher mechanical stability are important. (c) 2015 The Authors. Journal

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{146-164}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Corner contact, which happens due to the tooth flexibility when
   subjected to a heavy load, is normally neglected in the dynamic analysis
   of gear transmission systems with profile modifications when using
   analytical methods. To fill this gap, an analytical method to study
   corner contact effects on the mesh stiffness, static transmission error
   and the dynamic response of a spur gear pair with tip relief is
   introduced. In order to stress the significance of corner contact
   effects on gear dynamic analysis two types of gear mesh stiffness model
   are differentiated, and three types of commonly used single degree of
   freedom (SDOF) models are generalized. Comparisons with experimentally
   measured results presented in the literature shows that corner contact
   effects should not be neglected in the gear dynamic analysis when no or
   an insufficient amount of profile modification is applied. Detailed
   comparisons of the steady state responses predicted by the proposed
   models are made by introducing different amounts of linear tip relief
   into the analysis, and the advantages and disadvantages of each model
   are stated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A 3-DOF (degrees-of-freedom) multi-mode translational/spherical PM

   It has both 3-DOF spatial translational operation mode and 3-DOF

   synthesis of translational/spherical PMs with lockable joints. Using the
   proposed approach, several 3-DOF translational/spherical PMs are
   obtained. It is found that these translational/spherical PMs do not
   encounter constraint singular configurations and self-motion of
   sub-chain of a leg during reconfiguration. The approach can also be used
   for synthesizing other classes of multi-mode PMs with lockable joints,
   multi-mode PMs with variable kinematic joints, partially decoupled PMs,
   and reconfigurable PMs with a reconfigurable platform. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Production of biodiesel from sewage sludge lipids was catalysed by six
   different Bronsted acidic imidazolium and long chain ammonium ionic
   liquids; both with an alkane sulfonic acid group and with different
   anions. Among the ionic liquid tested, 4-(3-methylimidazolium)
   butanesulfonic acid trifluoromethanesulfonate,
   {[}mimC(4)SO(3)H]{[}SO3CF3], was selected as the best catalyst due to
   its high catalytic performance and purer biodiesel obtained than the
   equivalent ammonium ionic liquid, 4-(trihexylammonium) butanesulfonic
   acid trifluoromethanesulfonate, {[}N-666(C4SO3H)]{[}SO3CF3]. The
   influence of different reaction variables on the biodiesel yield was
   studied using {[}mimC(4)SO(3)H]{[}SO3CF3] as a catalyst. The yield of
   fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) reached 90\% (based on saponifiable
   lipids) under the following optimised conditions: 10:1 molar ratio of
   methanol to saponifiable lipids, 7 wt\% ionic liquid catalyst (web,
   based on lipids), 100 degrees C and 5 h. In addition, the ionic liquid
   has a good reusability and can be easily separated from the biodiesel.
   These acidic ionic liquids were found to be efficient catalysts for the
   synthesis of biodiesel from low-cost and non-edible feedstock like
   sewage sludge lipids. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Kinetostatic-model-based stiffness analysis of Exechon PKM}},
Journal = {{ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{208-220}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{As a comparative newly-invented PKM with over-constraints in kinematic
   chains, the Exechon has attracted extensive attention from the research
   society. Different from the well-recognized kinematics analysis, the
   research on the stiffness characteristics of the Exechon still remains
   as a challenge due to the structural complexity. In order to achieve a
   thorough understanding of the stiffness characteristics of the Exechon
   PKM, this paper proposed an analytical kinetostatic model by using the
   substructure synthesis technique. The whole PKM system is decomposed
   into a moving platform subsystem, three limb subsystems and a fixed base
   subsystem, which are connected to each other sequentially through
   corresponding joints. Each limb body is modeled as a spatial beam with a
   uniform cross-section constrained by two sets of lumped springs. The
   equilibrium equation of each individual limb assemblage is derived
   through finite element formulation and combined with that of the moving
   platform derived with Newtonian method to construct the governing
   kinetostatic equations of the system after introducing the deformation
   compatibility conditions between the moving platform and the limbs. By
   extracting the 6 x 6 block matrix from the inversion of the governing
   compliance matrix, the stiffness of the moving platform is formulated.
   The computation for the stiffness of the Exechon PKM at a typical
   configuration as well as throughout the workspace is carried out in a
   quick manner with a piece-by-piece partition algorithm. The numerical
   simulations reveal a strong position-dependency of the PKM's stiffness
   in that it is symmetric relative to a work plane due to structural
   features. At the last stage, the effects of some design variables such
   as structural, dimensional and stiffness parameters on system rigidity
   are investigated with the purpose of providing useful information for
   the structural optimization and performance enhancement of the Exechon
   PKM. It is worthy mentioning that the proposed methodology of stiffness
   modeling in this paper can also be applied to other overconstrained PKMs
   and can evaluate the global rigidity over workplace efficiently with
   minor revisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel series-parallel current-driven (SPCD)
   full-bridge dc/dc converter, which is able to process and deliver power
   efficiently over a wide range of load variations. In order to guarantee
   reliable operation of high-frequency dc/dc converters, the converter
   should be able to sustain soft switching for a wide range of operating
   conditions. The SPCD full-bridge converter, proposed in this paper, is
   able to offer soft switching for the input power semiconductors and
   smooth commutations for the output diodes. Also, the particular
   structure of the proposed converter eliminates the need for extra
   auxiliary circuits to provide reactive current for soft switching at
   light loads. The proposed topology can fully eliminate voltage spikes
   across the output diodes by providing smooth and lossless commutations
   for the output diodes. Thus, the proposed converter can be an efficient
   and reliable solution for variety of applications with a high switching
   frequency and a high output voltage. The SPCD full-bridge converter has
   the ability to integrate all magnetic components into an integrated
   transformer in order to achieve a high power density. The integrated
   transformer is thoroughly analyzed using ANSYS high-frequency structure
   simulator. Simulation and experimental results confirm the superior
   performance of the proposed SPCD full-bridge dc/ dc converter.}},

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) can reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions while switched reluctance motor (SRM) is one of
   the promising motor for such applications. This paper presents a novel
   SRM fault-diagnosis and fault-tolerance operation solution. Based on the
   traditional asymmetric half-bridge topology for the SRM driving, the
   central tapped winding of the SRM in modular half-bridge configuration
   are introduced to provide fault-diagnosis and fault-tolerance functions,
   which are set idle in normal conditions. The fault diagnosis can be
   achieved by detecting the characteristic of the excitation and
   demagnetization currents. An SRM fault-tolerance operation strategy is
   also realized by the proposed topology, which compensates for the
   missing phase torque under the open-circuit fault, and reduces the
   unbalanced phase current under the short-circuit fault due to the
   uncontrolled faulty phase. Furthermore, the current sensor placement
   strategy is also discussed to give two placement methods for low cost or
   modular structure. Simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments
   on a 750-W SRM validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy,
   which may have significant implications and improve the reliability of
   EVs/HEVs.}},

   (SFMNb)-xSm(0.2)Ce(0.8)P(2-delta) (SDC) = 0, 20, 30, 40, 50 wt \%)
   composite cathode materials were synthesized by a one-pot combustion
   method to improve the electrochemical performance of SFMNb cathode for
   intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs). The
   fabrication of composite cathodes by adding SDC to SFMNb is conducive to
   providing extended electrochemical reaction zones for oxygen reduction
   reactions (ORB.). X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrates that SFMNb is
   chemically compatible with SDC electrolytes at temperature up to 1100
   degrees C. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) indicates that the
   SFMNb-SDC composite cathodes have a porous network nanostructure as well
   as the single phase SFMNb. The conductivity and thermal expansion
   coefficient of the composite cathodes decrease with the increased
   content of SDC, while the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS)
   exhibits that SFMNb-40SDC composite cathode has optimal electrochemical
   performance with low polarization resistance (R-p) on the
   La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 electrolyte. The R-p of the SFMNb-40SDC composite
   cathode is about 0.047 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C in air. A single
   cell with SFMNb-40SDC cathode also displays favorable discharge
   performance, whose maximum power density is 1.22 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees
   C. All results indicate that SFMNb-40SDC composite material is a
   promising cathode candidate for IT-SOFCs. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen

Abstract = {{A UK based project which involved casting of blocks, walls and slabs,

   mean strengths of 50 and 30 MPa also had partial cement replacement with
   supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) such as ground granulated

   effective in reducing the peak temperature especially when there was
   heat dissipation. The contribution to early age strength by SCMs
   increased with the high in situ temperatures especially in blocks cast
   during summer. The accuracy of strength estimates obtained from maturity
   functions was examined. The temperature dependence of the Nurse-Saul
   function was not sufficient to account for the improvement in early age
   strengths resulting from the high temperatures in blocks cast during
   summer. The Arrhenius based function, was better at estimating the early
   age strengths as it assumes that the concrete strength gain rate varies
   exponentially with temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Identifying promising compounds from a vast collection of potential
   compounds is an important and yet challenging problem in chemical
   engineering. An efficient sdlution to this problem will help to reduce
   the expenditure at the early states of chemical process. In an attempt
   to solve this problem, the industry is looking for predictive tools that
   would be useful in testing optimal properties of a candidate compound
   earlier. This paper explores the application of biogeography-based
   optimization (BBO) to achieve such predictive work. BBO is a new
   evolutionary algorithm that is based on the science of biogeography. BBO
   is a population-based search method that achieves information sharing by
   species migration. The performance of BBO is compared with genetic
   algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) on a set of test
   functions and the cases of identifying promising compounds. Simulation
   results show that BBO is a competitive method in determining an optimal
   solution to the optimization of promising compounds. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Modern control methods like optimal control and model predictive control
   (MPC) provide a framework for simultaneous regulation of the tracking
   performance and limiting the control energy, thus have been widely
   deployed in industrial applications. Yet, due to its simplicity and
   robustness, the conventional P (Proportional) and PI
   (Proportional-Integral) control are still the most common methods used
   in many engineering systems, such as electric power systems, automotive,
   and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) for buildings,
   where energy efficiency and energy saving are the critical issues to be
   addressed. Yet, little has been done so far to explore the effect of its
   parameter tuning on both the system performance and control energy
   consumption, and how these two objectives are correlated within the P
   and PI control framework. In this paper, the P and PI controllers are
   designed with a simultaneous consideration of these two aspects. Two
   case studies are investigated in detail, including the control of
   Voltage Source Converters (VSCs) for transmitting offshore wind power to
   onshore AC grid through High Voltage DC links, and the control of HVAC
   systems. Results reveal that there exists a better trade-off between the
   tracking performance and the control energy through a proper choice of
   the P and PI controller parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Reliability of power converters is of crucial importance in switched
   reluctance motor drives used for safety-critical applications.
   Open-circuit faults in power converters will cause the motor to run in
   unbalanced states, and if left untreated, they will lead to damage to
   the motor and power modules, and even cause a catastrophic failure of
   the whole drive system. This study is focused on using a single current
   sensor to detect open-circuit faults accurately. An asymmetrical
   half-bridge converter is considered in this study and the faults of
   single-phase open and two-phase open are analysed. Three different bus
   positions are defined. On the basis of a fast Fourier transform
   algorithm with Blackman window interpolation, the bus current spectrums
   before and after open-circuit faults are analysed in details. Their
   fault characteristics are extracted accurately by the normalisations of
   the phase fundamental frequency component and double phase fundamental
   frequency component, and the fault characteristics of the three bus
   detection schemes are also compared. The open-circuit faults can be
   located by finding the relationship between the bus current and rotor
   position. The effectiveness of the proposed diagnosis method is
   validated by the simulation results and experimental tests.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores some of the durability properties of a sustainable
   concrete utilizing oil palm shell COPS), which is a waste material from
   the palm oil industry, as lightweight coarse aggregate and manufactured
   sand to replace conventional natural mining sand as fine aggregate.
   Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) was used at 20\%, 40\% and
   60\% cement replacement levels with the aim of reducing the cement
   consumption in OPS concrete (OPSC) and the effect of the GGBS on the
   water absorption, sorptivity and the long-term free shrinkage of OPSC
   was investigated. The use of GGBS was found to reduce the sorption of
   OPSC as the 90-d sorptivity values fell in the range of 0.047-0.065
   mm/min(0.5), compared to 0.091 mm/min(0.5) for mixes without GGBS. The
   OPSC containing GGBS was also found to have initial water absorption of
   below 3\%, which indicated good quality of concrete. In the long term
   study, over a period of 365 d, the free shrinkage of the OPSC with up to
   40\% GGBS replacement level was comparable to the corresponding OPSC
   without GGBS. The GGBS was also found to be beneficial in enhancing the
   long term compressive strength gain as well as lowering the strength
   decrease of OPSC upon heat exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{218}},
Pages = {{102-107}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Decanoic acid is an ideal substrate for the synthesis of
   medium-chain-length poly-3-hydroxyalkanoate (MCL-PHA), but its use for
   this purpose has only previously been studied in shake-flasks likely due
   to its surfactant properties, low aqueous solubility and high melting
   temperature. A fed-batch fermentation process was developed for the
   production of MCL-PHA from decanoic acid using Pseudomonas putida
   KT2440. Decanoic acid was kept in liquid form by heating or by mixing
   with acetic acid to prevent crystallization. Different ratios of
   decanoic acid:acetic acid:glucose (DA:AA:G) were fed to produce a
   specific growth rate of 0.15 h(-1). This method produced a maximum of 39
   gL(-1) dry biomass containing 67\% MCL-PHA when the DA:AA: G ratio was
   5:1:4. However, a declining growth rate occurred in the late stage of
   fermentation, resulting in decanoic acid accumulation in the bioreactor
   leading to foaming. The duration of MCL-PHA production was extended by
   shifting from exponential to linear feeding before accumulation of
   decanoic acid. This resulted in 75 gL(-1) biomass containing 74\% PHA
   and an overall PHA productivity of 1.16 gL(-1) h(-1) with the production
   of each gram of PHA requiring only 1.16 g of decanoic acid. The final
   PHA composition (on a molar basis) was 78\% 3-hydroxydecanoate, 11\%
   3-hydroxyoctanoate and 11\% 3-hydroxyhexanoate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Volume = {{302}},
Pages = {{146-154}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Li-ion batteries have been widely used in the EVs, and the battery
   thermal management is a key but challenging part of the battery
   management system. For EV batteries, only the battery surface
   temperature can be measured in real-time. However, it is the battery
   internal temperature that directly affects the battery performance, and
   large temperature difference may exist between surface and internal
   temperatures, especially in high power demand applications. In this
   paper, an online battery internal temperature estimation method is
   proposed based on a novel simplified thermoelectric model. The battery
   thermal behaviour is first described by a simplified thermal model, and
   battery electrical behaviour by an electric model. Then, these two
   models are interrelated to capture the interactions between battery
   thermal and electrical behaviours, thus offer a comprehensive
   description of the battery behaviour that is useful for battery
   management. Finally, based on the developed model, the battery internal
   temperature is estimated using an,extended Kalman filter. The
   experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed method, and it
   can be used for online internal temperature estimation which is a key
   indicator for better real-time battery thermal management. Crown

Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{277-284}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The formation of layered tissues through the use of cell sheet
   harvesting has recently emerged as a potentially viable approach for
   clinical tissue engineering applications. Since the demonstration of
   effective cell sheet formation using temperature responsive substrates,
   a number of different stimuli have been utilized to facilitate cell
   sheet detachment. Each approach has differing advantages and
   disadvantages. Herein we demonstrate the ability of calcium alginate
   hydrogels to function as an effective substrate for cell sheet
   formation. By conjugating the integrin binding peptide sequence RGD to
   the alginate and crosslinking it with calcium ions, the hydrogel formed
   supported the attachment and growth of both 3T3 fibroblasts and human
   corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). Once the cells had grown to
   confluence, exposing the calcium alginate to the chelating agent citrate
   caused the release of a consolidated cell sheet. When HCEC sheets were
   stacked, the cell layers adhered to each other and the cells began to
   integrate.
   Statement of significance
   Herein we describe a simple and inexpensive process for creating cell
   sheets using the ability of calcium alginate hydrogels to be dissolved
   under mild conditions. The alginate was first modified to possess cell
   attachment sites and in this demonstration of feasibility we employed an

   alginate was then formed into stable hydrogels through a drying and
   re-hydration step, and used as a substrate to grow confluent cell sheets
   of human corneal epithelial cells and 3T3 fibroblasts as examples. The
   cell sheets were released through chelating the calcium using citrate.
   The cell cell connections were retained following this release and the
   cell sheets interconnect and grew following being stacked. (C) 2015 Acta

Abstract = {{Shape stabilised phase change materials (SSPCMs) based on a high density
   poly(ethylene)(hv-HDPE) with high (H-PW, T-m = 56-58 degrees C) and low
   (L-PW, T-m = 18-23 degrees C) melting point paraffin waxes were readily
   prepared using twin-screw extrusion. The thermo-physical properties of
   these materials were assessed using a combination of techniques and
   their suitability for latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES)
   assessed. The melt processing temperature (160 degrees C) of the HDPE
   used was well below the onset of thermal decomposition of H-PW (220
   degrees C), but above that for L-PW (130 degrees C), although the
   decomposition process extended over a range of 120 degrees C and the
   residence time of L-PW in the extruder was <30 s. The SSPCMs prepared
   had latent heats up to 89 J/g and the enthalpy values for H-PW in the
   respective blends decreased with increasing H-PW loading, as a
   consequence of co-crystallisation of H-PW and hv-HDPE. Static and
   dynamic mechanical analysis confirmed both waxes have a plasticisation
   effect on this HOPE. Irrespective of the mode of deformation (tension,
   flexural, compression) modulus and stress decreased with increased wax
   loading in the blend, but the H-PW blends were mechanically superior to
   those with L-PW. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A data delivery framework for cognitive information-centric sensor
   networks in smart outdoor monitoring}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{38-51}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive information-centric sensor networks represent a paradigm of
   wireless sensor networks in which sensory information is identified from
   the network using named-data, and elements of cognition are used to
   deliver information to the sink with quality that satisfies the end-user
   requirements. Specialized nodes called Local Cognitive Nodes (LCNs)
   implement knowledge representation, reasoning and learning as elements
   of cognition in the network. These LCNs identify user-requested sensory
   information, and establish data delivery paths to the sink by
   prioritizing Quality of Information (QoI) attributes (e.g., latency,
   reliability, and throughput) at each hop based on the network traffic
   type. Analytic Hierarchy Processing (AHP) is the reasoning tool used to
   identify these paths based on QoI-attribute priorities set by the user.
   From extensive simulations, parameters that can be controlled to improve
   the values of QoI attributes along each hop were identified, and
   performance of the AHP-based data-delivery technique was compared with
   two traditional data-centric techniques in terms of lifetime and QoI
   attribute performance. It was found that the use of cognition improves
   the number of successful transmissions to the sink by almost 30\%, while
   closely adapting the data delivery paths to the QoI requirements of the
   user. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Diverse land use activities can elevate risk of microbiological
   contamination entering stream headwaters. Spatially distributed water
   quality monitoring carried out across a 17 km(2) agricultural catchment
   aimed to characterize microbiological contamination reaching surface
   water and investigate whether winter agricultural land use restrictions
   proved effective in addressing water quality degradation. Combined flow
   and concentration data revealed no significant difference in fecal
   indicator organism (FIO) fluxes in base flow samples collected during
   the open and prohibited periods for spreading organic fertilizer, while
   relative concentrations of Escherichia coli, fecal streptococci and
   sulfite reducing bacteria indicated consistently fresh fecal pollution
   reached aquatic receptors during both periods. Microbial source
   tracking, employing Bacteroides 16S rRNA gene markers, demonstrated a
   dominance of bovine fecal waste in river water samples upstream of a
   wastewater treatment plant discharge during open periods. This
   contrasted with responses during prohibited periods where human-derived
   signatures dominated. Differences in microbiological signature, when
   viewed with hydrological data, suggested that increasing groundwater
   levels restricted vertical infiltration of effluent from on-site
   wastewater treatment systems and diverted it to drains and surface
   water. Study results reflect seasonality of contaminant inputs, while
   suggesting winter land use restrictions can be effective in limiting
   impacts of agricultural wastes to base flow water quality. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This study proposes an approach to optimally allocate multiple types of

   proposed method accurately evaluates the long-term costs and benefits
   gained by FACTS devices (FDs) installation to solve a large-scale
   optimisation problem. The objective implies maximising social welfare as
   well as minimising compensations paid for generation re-scheduling and
   load shedding. Many technical operation constraints and uncertainties
   are included in problem formulation. The overall problem is solved using
   both particle swarm optimisations for attaining optimal FDs allocation
   as main problem and optimal power flow as sub-optimisation problem. The
   effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on modified IEEE

Abstract = {{The purpose of Ventilation Management Systems is to ensure the health
   and safety of underground workers by creating and incorporating
   structured Plans, Procedures and Processes on the day-to-day operations
   of the mine ventilation system. Application of Ventilation Management
   Programs consists of audit, verification and corrective action
   procedures used to, i) ensure adherence to regulatory standards or to
   ii) return to compliance and safety standards when an upset condition
   arises. The present study describes how a Ventilation Management Program
   can be developed and implemented to ensure regulation compliance, to
   increase safety, to improve operational efficiency and to reduce the
   operating costs of an operating mine. A case study is presented in which
   air quality conditions have been substantially improved with the
   development and implementation of a Ventilation Management Program for
   an operating underground hard rock mine. KEYWORDS: mine ventilation;

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel method for the digital implementation of
   one-cycle controller (OCC) is introduced for the control of AC-DC
   full-bridge converter. The use of this technique eliminates the need of
   high sampling rates for data acquisition or of using averaged input
   parameters for control, which is usually the case for digital
   implementation of OCC. Since, the instantaneous result of integration of
   switched variable is compared with the reference signal, sampling rates
   much higher than the switching frequency are required. In the proposed
   implementation technique, the current ripple is mathematically estimated
   based on the measured values of input current and voltages sampled at
   the beginning of each switching cycle. Since the choice of carrier
   affects the performance of the converter, a generalized triangular
   carrier is used in the analysis of converter operation using this
   technique. It allows us to choose an appropriate carrier suitable for
   this application. This leads to obtaining accurate duty cycles by
   switching action, while sampling rates remain the same as the switching
   frequency. The above technique is then used to perform reactive power
   control on a lab prototype of a boost based AC-DC converter. The
   simulation and experimental results show satisfactory performance of the
   converter with the proposed implementation technique.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of two types of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) on the
   physico-mechanical properties of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE)
   was investigated. The addition of these two types of GNPs - designated
   as grades C and M - enhanced the thermal conductivity of the LLDPE, with
   a more pronounced improvement resulting from the M-GNPs compared to
   C-GNPs. Improvement in electrical conductivity and decomposition
   temperature was also noticed with the addition of GNPs. In contrast to
   the thermal conductivity, C-GNPs resulted in greater improvements in the
   electrical conductivity and thermal decomposition temperature. These
   differences can be attributed to differences in the surface area and
   dispersion of the two types of GNPs.}},

Abstract = {{Defect prediction on projects with limited historical data has attracted
   great interest from both researchers and practitioners. Cross-project
   defect prediction has been the main area of progress by reusing
   classifiers from other projects. However, existing approaches require
   some degree of homogeneity (e.g., a similar distribution of metric
   values) between the training projects and the target project. Satisfying
   the homogeneity requirement often requires significant effort (currently
   a very active area of research).
   An unsupervised classifier does not require any training data, therefore
   the heterogeneity challenge is no longer an issue. In this paper, we
   examine two types of unsupervised classifiers: a) distance-based
   classifiers (e.g., k-means); and b) connectivity-based classifiers.
   While distance-based unsupervised classifiers have been previously used
   in the defect prediction literature with disappointing performance,
   connectivity-based classifiers have never been explored before in our
   community.
   We compare the performance of unsupervised classifiers versus supervised
   classifiers using data from 26 projects from three publicly available
   datasets (i.e., AEEEM, NASA, and PROMISE). In the cross-project setting,
   our proposed connectivity- based classifier (via spectral clustering)
   ranks as one of the top classifiers among five widely-used supervised
   classifiers (i.e., random forest, naive Bayes, logistic regression,
   decision tree, and logistic model tree) and five unsupervised
   classifiers (i.e., k-means, partition around medoids, fuzzy C-means,
   neural-gas, and spectral clustering). In the within-project setting
   (i.e., models are built and applied on the same project), our spectral
   classifier ranks in the second tier, while only random forest ranks in
   the first tier. Hence, connectivity-based unsupervised classifiers offer
   a viable solution for cross and within project defect predictions.}},

   of the web and the location of the holes as defined by the distance of
   the hole from the edge of the bearing plate divided by the flat depth of

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a simplified microturbine (MT) model which allows
   for dynamic heat and power output prediction. Considering the time-scale
   difference of various dynamic processes occuring within MTs, the
   electromechanical subsystem is treated as a fast quasi-linear system
   while the thermo-mechanical subsystem is treated as a slow process with
   high nonlinearity. A subspace model identification method is utilized to
   capture dominant dynamics and predict outputs of the electromechanical
   subsystem. For the thermo-mechanical process, a fast recursive algorithm
   assisted radial basis function model is employed to handle the strong
   nonlinear characteristics. Experimental tests on a Capstone C30 MT show
   that the proposed modeling method can well capture the system dynamics
   and produce a good model to predict the interrelated heat and

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new technique for exploration and
   mapping/surveying of underwater infrastructure and/or objects of
   interest, using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The
   proposed method employs rotational potential fields, and extends them
   for use on multiple vehicles within a three dimensional environment. An
   inter-vehicle fluid formation is maintained throughout, free of angular
   constraints (or the need of a virtual vehicle). When an object of
   interest is approached, the formation is split and follows a smooth
   trajectory around opposite sides of its boundary. To fully utilise the
   potential of rotational fields, a unique local 2D-plane is created
   around every object within the 3D environment, which is employed for
   boundary coverage. Traditional artificial potential fields are used to
   guide vehicles towards each object in turn (and maintain the fluid
   formation), while rotational fields are employed within the local
   2D-plane providing a smooth trajectory around opposing sides of every
   object. Simulation results show the method to be effective, providing a
   more stable trajectory. Comparison with the standard technique shows
   that the formation is maintained throughout and overall journey time is
   significantly reduced using this method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the enhanced piezoresistive effect in p-type < 110

   nanowire width is varied from 100 to 500nm with thickness of 200 nm and
   length of 9 mu m. It is found that the piezoresistive effect increases
   when the nanowire width is reduced below 350 nm. Compared with
   micrometre sized piezoresistors, silicon nanowires have produced up to
   50\% enhancement. Silicon nanowire with cross-section of (100 x 200 nm)
   with doping concentration of 3.2 x 10(8) cm(-3) has produced a gauge
   factor of 150. The extracted gauge factors are compared with other

Abstract = {{The subject of this paper is a particularly challenging machine vision
   (MV) based sorting application where the `part' is an Indian coin. The
   application is challenging in part because of the lack of distinctive
   features to differentiate between denominations as well as the
   variability in the features for a given denomination. Although there are
   coin recognition algorithms documented in the literature, the
   applications are typically tested off-line with static images of the
   coins. In this paper, a MV-based system for on-line recognition and
   counting of Indian coins moving on a conveyor is evaluated. The accuracy
   and performance of three different techniques are compared: particle
   classification, pattern matching and geometric matching. The conclusion
   is that none of these three techniques produced acceptable results,
   where the goal was to achieve 95\% accuracy at 1000 coins/min.}},

Abstract = {{Planning is an essential process in teams of multiple agents pursuing a
   common goal. When the effects of actions undertaken by agents are
   uncertain, evaluating the potential risk of such actions alongside their
   utility might lead to more rational decisions upon planning. This
   challenge has been recently tackled for single agent settings, yet
   domains with multiple agents that present diverse viewpoints towards
   risk still necessitate comprehensive decision making mechanisms that
   balance the utility and risk of actions. In this work, we propose a
   novel collaborative multi-agent planning framework that integrates (i) a
   team-level online planner under uncertainty that extends the classical
   UCT approximate algorithm, and (ii) a preference modeling and
   multicriteria group decision making approach that allows agents to find
   accepted and rational solutions for planning problems, predicated on the
   attitude each agent adopts towards risk. When utilised in risk-pervaded
   scenarios, the proposed framework can reduce the cost of reaching the
   common goal sought and increase effectiveness, before making collective
   decisions by appropriately balancing risk and utility of actions.}},

   electromagnetically tracked implementation tested in a laboratory
   environment, the device measured a spherical center to within 1.2 +/-
   0.2 mm in a technical validation. Applied to a plastic model of a
   cadaveric femur, the center of the femoral head was measured to 1.8 +/-
   0.4 mm and the implant was measured to within 1.5 +/- 0.5 mm. Because
   leg length changes and offset changes in conventional hip arthroplasty
   can be as much as 16 mm, this device has relatively high accuracy that
   may improve implant localization for the hip.}},

Abstract = {{Predictive Resource Allocation (PRA) has demonstrated its ability to
   provide smooth video delivery with minimal and fair interruptions.
   Recent work on PRA techniques exploited rate predictions to
   strategically allocate the limited radio resources for delivering video
   content. However, existing PRA techniques assume perfect prediction of
   future information in order to define the maximum attainable gains. In
   this paper, we introduce a probabilistic robust PRA framework that
   handles prediction errors. By adopting chance constraint programming we
   were able to define a probabilistic measure on the QoS degradation due
   to prediction uncertainties. A deterministic non-convex formulation is
   then obtained using the statistical parameters of predicted rates.
   Accordingly, we propose a convex approximation to the formulated fair
   PRA, which can be solved using optimal solvers to obtain a benchmark
   solution for future robust PRA schemes. We evaluate non-PRA and
   non-robust PRA schemes considering typical error models of the predicted
   rates. We found these schemes to result in suboptimal fairness and
   increased QoS degradations with the network load. Results further reveal
   the ability of the introduced robust fair PRA to reach the optimal and
   fair QoS satisfaction levels. Our approach provides a step towards
   applying PRA in future wireless networks to deliver video streaming
   content.}},

Abstract = {{LCLC converter is an LLC-based, four-element resonant topology, which
   has been proved to achieve high voltage gain and high efficiency. Such
   trait makes LCLC converter specifically suitable for
   wide-input-voltage-range DC/DC applications. Currently, LCLC converter
   lacks a design method targeting at optimal efficiency over a wide input
   voltage range. In fact, due to the complexity, efficiency itself is
   seldom used as optimization criterion even for LLC designs. In this
   paper, a systematic methodology is proposed to optimize the efficiency
   at different input voltage levels for LCLC converter. Three mathematical
   programs (developed in MATLAB) are employed respectively to find all
   resonant parameter combinations that critically achieve the required
   voltage gain; precisely analyze the current stress in time domain; and
   comprehensively calculate the losses in the power circuit including
   magnetic components. The programs will automatically generate the
   optimal parameter design with highest weighted efficiency at desired
   input voltage levels, as well as the magnetic components construction
   with specified types and sizes of core and conductor. Besides, this
   method can be extended to other topologies for wide voltage range
   applications. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed optimal design
   method, the function of the mathematical tools will be carefully
   explained in this paper; and a step-by-step design will be demonstrated
   as an example. Simulation will be included to verify the accuracy of the
   method.}},

Abstract = {{An isolated, single-stage bidirectional AC-DC converter for electric
   vehicle battery charger is proposed. The topology utilizes two
   half-bridge circuits and a series resonant LC circuit in between. The
   proposed topology uses only six switches. Low component count in the
   circuit results in lower cost and volume. Control methods using variable
   phase-shift and duty-cycles of the half-bridge circuits are proposed.
   They transfer the desired power and obtain ZVS for all the switching
   instants while minimizing the RMS current through the resonant circuit
   and switches. ZVS operation of the circuit enables the switching
   frequency to increase, without increasing the switching losses. This
   will result in smaller reactive components and transformer. The proposed
   controllers also obtains the best performance out of the circuit.
   Simulation results with PSIM and experimental results to verify the
   theory have been done.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a Pulse Density Modulation (PDM) method with
   improved transient for high frequency converters such as Class E DC/DC
   or quasi-resonant boost converters. In contrast to frequency or duty
   cycle control, the conventional PDM control method provides high
   efficiency at any load when modulation frequency is low. However,
   efficiency drops significantly for higher modulation frequencies due to
   the transient power losses in each power pulse. The proposed method
   decreases the power losses at the beginning of each pulse and reduces
   the voltage stress of the switch. Therefore, a higher modulation
   frequency and smaller filter size become feasible. Startup behavior of a
   quasi-resonant boost converter is analyzed in this paper. Soft switching
   conditions and peak voltage stress are studied as a function of the
   first switching cycle timing. In order to minimize the voltage overshoot
   and switching loss of the converter, the first switching period of each
   power pulse is chosen based on this analysis. A 1000 W, 3 MHz
   quasi-resonant boost converter with Class DE rectifier is implemented to
   verify the analysis and simulation results. A maximum efficiency of 96.7
   percent is obtained. Further, the efficiency dropped less than three
   percent at one tenth of the load. About a 2\% improvement in the light
   load efficiency is observed as compared to the conventional PDM method.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-cell diode-capacitor/inductor based boost derived DC-DC converter
   provides a simple solution for high step-up voltage regulation in solar
   and fuel cell generation. However, many passive components increase the
   order of system model and complexity. Transient modeling analysis
   reveals that time constant of each component in diode-capacitor/inductor
   network is much smaller than that of other circuit if the directly
   charging and discharge processes between capacitor through diode is fast
   enough. The voltage/current relationship of each capacitor/inductor in
   multi-cell network is fixed. Multi-cell diode-capacitor/inductor network
   can be seemed as multi-stage DC transformer. Based on the unique
   feature, this paper proposes the reduced-order modeling approach for
   high step-up DC-DC converter with multi-cell diode-capacitor/inductor
   network. Finally, simulation and experiments verify the correctness and
   effectiveness of new modeling approach. The unified reduce-dorder model
   contributes to better understanding of circuit characteristic and
   simplification of controller parameters design.}},

   to choose the strongest antenna to transmit signals, while MRC scheme is
   used by secondary receiver and eavesdropper to strengthen their received

   dual-hop RaF cognitive MIMO wiretap networks. To gain more observation
   on the influence of the proposed TAS/MRC scheme and outdated CSI, we
   further present tractable asymptotic SOP at high SNR regimes. From the
   analysis, we derive that outdated CSI will affect SOP by decreaseing the
   secrecy coding gain of TAS/MRC scheme. In addition, the RaF relaying
   strategy can achieve better secrecy performance than that of DF relaying
   strategy for dual-hop cognitive MIMO wiretap networks.}},

Abstract = {{Knee adduction moment is a key parameter that links with the severity of
   knee osteoarthritis. However, assessment of the knee adduction moment is
   commonly implemented through the stationary measurement systems in a
   gait laboratory. The purpose of this study is to develop a wearable
   sensor system that can be used to estimate the knee adduction moment. A
   wearable sensor sock, composed of six pressure sensors, were developed
   using the pressure-sensitive electric conductive rubber. Based on the
   sensor sock measurements and the reference knee adduction moment
   obtained from the motion capture system (Vicon), we trained a neural
   network model to estimate the knee adduction moment. In our validation
   experiments on healthy subjects, the knee adduction moment can be
   accurately estimated with the trained neural network model.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a building based virtual storage system (VSS) model is
   developed by utilizing the heat storage characteristics of the building.
   Then, the VSS is integrated to the optimal scheduling model of the
   building microgrid (BM) for operation cost reduction. The indoor
   temperature of the building is adjusted within the customer temperature
   comfort level range to manage the charging/discharging power of the VSS.
   Finally, two different types of BM cases under the summer refrigeration
   scenario are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed optimal scheduling approach. Numerical studies demonstrate that
   the proposed optimal scheduling approach can make full use of the
   potential of the VSS and furthermore contribute to the operation cost
   reduction of the BM, while guarantee the customer temperature comfort
   level at the same time.}},

Abstract = {{Gradual escalation of electric vehicle (EV) penetration in modern power
   systems requires increasing support for EV charging. This additional
   demand represents a significant proportion of daily electric load which
   requires greater or flexible generation and transmission and poses
   challenges to system security and stability. This paper considers the
   impact of EV integration on transient stability by using an equivalent
   model of the Northern Ireland (NI) power system. The paper proposes an
   AC/DC converter-based EV aggregator model with two typical EV
   connections. A range of typical faults is investigated and discussed
   through simulation. The critical clearing time (CCT) and transient
   stability margin are used to assess transient stability on the NI
   system. Simulation results indicate that in order to achieve and sustain
   2020 EV integration targets and guarantee adequate transient stability,
   asset support and network reinforcement will be required and these
   outcomes are described in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Densification of access points (APs) in wireless local area networks
   (WLANs) increases the interference and the contention domains of each AP
   due to multiple overlapped basic service sets (BSSs). Consequently, high
   interference from multiple co-channel BSS at the target AP impairs
   system performance. To improve system performance in the presence of
   multi-BSSs interference, we propose a decentralized AP selection scheme
   that takes interference at the candidate APs into account and selects AP
   that offers best signal-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR). In the
   proposed algorithm, the AP selection process is distributed at the user
   stations (STAs) and is based on the estimated SINR in the downlink.
   Estimating SINR in the downlink helps capture the effect of interference
   from neighboring BSSs or APs. Based on a simulated large-scale 802.11
   network, the proposed scheme outperforms the strongest signal first
   (SSF) AP selection scheme used in current 802.11 standards as well as
   the mean probe delay (MPD) AP selection algorithm in {[}3]; it achieves
   99\% and 43\% gains in aggregate throughput over SSF and MPD,
   respectively. While increasing STA densification, the proposed scheme is
   shown to increase aggregate network performance.}},

   over a network. We consider the problem where several agents each
   measure a local cost and must cooperate to minimize the total cost vhich
   is the surd of the local costs. To solve this problem, we combine a
   dynamic average consensus algorithm with a proportional integral ESC
   technique in discrete-time. The consensus algorithm provides each agent
   with an estimate of the total cost and this estimate is used by the ESC
   to minimize the total cost. The main contribution of this paper is to
   show that the distributed agents are able to minimize the total cost
   despite none of the agents directly measuring it. We provide a proof of
   time convergence of this algorithum and a simulation example to

   of the standard perturbation based techniques that provides fast
   transient performance of the closed-loop system to the optimum
   equilibrium of a measured objective function. In this application of
   PIESC, the gain of the nonlinear observer is computed in real-time to
   minimize the least-squares output prediction error. Two examples are

Abstract = {{This paper reports the development of an automatic collision avoidance
   technique for unmanned marine vessel incorporating standard collision
   regulations or COLREGs, defined by the International Maritime
   Organisation. Like any ship, all unmanned vessels must adhere to COLREGs
   at all times in order to minimise or eliminate the risk of collisions.
   The proposed approach is essentially a reactive path planning algorithm
   based on a modified Well known Artificial Potential Fields (APF)
   framework. It is shown through simulations that the proposed strategy is
   able to generate COLREGs-compliant trajectories in the presence of both
   stationary and dynamic obstacles. Rules 13, 14 and 15 of the COLREGs,
   which apply to the overtaking, head-on and crossing scenarios
   respectively, are simulated for multiple dynamic vessels in an
   environment inclusive of land features. (C) 2016, IFAC (International

Abstract = {{The entropy production of thermodynanmical systems with reversible
   (conservative) and irreversible (dissipative) phenomena is used as a
   Lyapunov candidate function to address stability properties. First,
   based on the conjugated variables of the extensive properties, the
   dissipative and conservative phenomena are identified, then, the dynamic
   behavior of entropy production is obtained. Based on the properties of
   the entropy function Hessian, it is found that dissipative phenomena
   contribute to stability and attraction of the thermodynamical
   equilibrium. In particular, when only dissipative phenomena are present,
   the entropy production is a Lyapunov function that guarantees global or
   local stability, depending on the nonlinearities. Complex behaviors, for
   instance transitory increments of the entropy production, are due to
   both conservative phenomena and, far from equilibrium, non linearities
   of dissipative phenomena. Finally, a case study consisting in a
   gas-piston system is presented to illustrate these ideas. (C) 2016, IFAC

   the intracardiac electrograms of several cardiac sites are sequentially
   recorded, their activation times (ATs) are extracted, and the
   corresponding wavefronts are specified. The locations of the mapping
   catheter's electrodes and the ATs of the wavefronts are used here for
   the CCV estimation. We assume that the extracted ATs include some
   estimation errors, which we model with zero-mean white Gaussian noise
   values with known variances. Assuming stable planar wavefront
   propagation, we derive the maximum likelihood CCV estimator, when the
   synchronization times between various recording sites are unknown. We
   analytically evaluate the performance of the CCV estimator and provide
   its mean square estimation error. Our simulation results confirm the
   accuracy of the proposed}},

Abstract = {{The cardiac conduction velocity (CV) can be estimated by analysing the
   activation times (ATs) and the locations of the electrodes that are used
   for the intracardiac electrogram (IEGM) recording. Here, we study the
   problem of the CV estimation in sequential mapping without using any
   independent electrogram as a time alignment reference. We assume that
   the IEGMs are sequentially recorded from several sites, where at each
   site, at least two of the catheter's electrodes are in contact with the
   cardiac tissue. We consider the planar wavefront with stable CV that
   propagates within the recording sites throughout our data collection
   period. Assuming the zero-mean Gaussian AT estimation error, we derive
   the maximum likelihood estimations of the CV and AT at a desired
   location on the cardiac shell. The CV is estimated when the variance of
   the AT estimation error and the time delay between the sequential
   recordings are unknown variables. Our simulation results show that the
   proposed method can precisely estimate the CV of the planar wavefront.}},

Abstract = {{There is a discontinuity in published electromechanical delays (EMD) in
   upper-limb muscles and the state-of-the-art in modelling end-point force
   from electromyographic signals collected from one or more muscles.
   Published values are typically in the range of 10 to 30ms, depending on
   the nature of the contraction. In published literature where the
   EMG-force relationship is modelled, generally a delay of 100ms or more
   is induced during linear enveloping to match the EMD. The implications
   of EMD on end-point force prediction were considered using inter-session
   end-point force modelling with a support-vector-regression model. The
   delays were estimated using the first-order cross-correlation and the
   force and EMG signal were temporally aligned. The results show the
   delays vary by 20ms or more but did produce a notable trend based on
   elbow joint angle. We conclude that for upper-limb biomechanics
   modelling, the best practice is to align the force and EMG signals based
   on the induced delay during linear enveloping.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of variable selection is addressed for
   high-dimensional nonparametric additive nonlinear systems. The purpose
   of variable selection is to determine contributing additive functions
   and to remove non-contributing ones from the underlying nonlinear
   system. A two-step method is developed to conduct variable selection.
   The first step is concerned with estimating each additive function by
   virtue of kernel-based nonparametric approaches. The second step is to
   apply a nonnegative garrote estimator to identify which additive
   functions are nonzero in terms of the obtained non parametric estimates
   of each function. The proposed variable selection method is workable
   without suffering from the curse of dimensionality, and it is able to
   find the correct variables with probability one under weak conditions as
   the sample size approaches infinity. The good performance of the
   proposed variable selection method is demonstrated by a numerical
   example.}},

Abstract = {{in this paper, a new single-stage isolated bi-directional AC-DC

   application is proposed. The topology uses only 6 active switches.
   Single-stage power conversion reduces the cost and volume. Instead of
   using an Electrolytic capacitor with limited life-time, it uses a film
   capacitor. This increases the reliability of the system. The low
   frequency power ripple produced by the single-phase AC-DC power
   conversion is not allowed to the battery. This increases the life-time
   of the battery compared to conventional chargers. A three part
   controller to shape the input current, control the power, and prevent
   the low frequency power ripple from going to the battery is proposed.
   Simulation results, as well as experimental results to verify the
   theory, are presented.}},

   never experienced a flooding or surcharging event (i.e., 100\% system
   reliability), however, an observed positive trend in the ratio of
   conduit depth to full depth over time indicates the potential for
   unsatisfactory system performance in the future as a result of changing

Abstract = {{Performing array processing on the Global Navigation Satellite Systems
   (GNSS) signals in a controlled environment requires costly hardware that
   most researchers cannot afford. This paper introduces a new experimental
   approach that substantially reduces that cost. It makes possible the
   emulation of raw digitized in-phase (I) and quadrature phase (Q) samples
   of GNSS signals, received by an array of Global Positioning System (GPS)
   antennas. The proposed technique enables simulating linear, planar and
   three dimensional (3D) array geometries for any satellite positioning
   system. In this study, only one Spirent GSS6700 GNSS simulator is used

Abstract = {{This paper describes an automatic method for identifying thin-sheet
   regions (regions with large lateral dimensions relative to the
   thickness) for complex thin walled components, with a view to using this
   information to guide the hex meshing process. This fully automated
   method has been implemented in a commercial CAD system (Siemens NX) and
   is based on the interrogation and manipulation of face pairs, which are
   sets of opposing faces bounding thin-sheet regions. Careful
   consideration is given to the mapping, merging and intersection of face
   pairs to generate topologies suitable for sweep meshing thin-sheet
   regions, and for treating the junctions between adjacent thin-sheet
   regions. The quality of the resulting hexahedral mesh is considered when
   making decisions on the generation and positioning of the cutting
   surfaces required to isolate thin-sheet regions. The resulting
   decomposition delivers a substantial step towards automatic hexahedral
   meshing for complex thin-walled geometries. It is proposed that
   hexahedral meshes be applied to the identified thin-sheet regions by
   quad meshing one of the faces bounding the thin-sheet region and
   sweeping it through the thickness to create hexahedral elements. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper aims to develop a hierarchical management strategy for the
   building microgrid. The proposed hierarchical framework is presented as
   day-ahead scheduling stage and a two-layer intra-hour adjustment stage.
   Firstly, a virtual storage system (VSS) model is developed by utilizing
   the heat storage characteristics of a building. Then, the VSS model is
   integrated into the developed hierarchical management strategy of the
   building microgrid, which is presented as a day-ahead optimal economic
   scheduling stage for the minimum operation cost and an intra-hour
   adjustment stage to follow the tie-line power set-points. In the
   intra-hour real-time adjustment, a master-client structure is designed.
   The VSS and plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) are coordinated by a method
   with two different time scales in order to execute the schedule and
   handle uncertainties from the load demand, outdoor environment and the
   renewable generation in the intra-hour adjustment stage. Numerical
   studies demonstrate that the proposed strategy can contribute to the
   operation cost reduction in day-ahead scheduling stage and tie-line
   power smoothing in intrahour adjustment stage, while guarantee the
   customer temperature comfort level and EVs travelling demands at the
   same time. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we optimize vapor compression system power consumption
   through the application of a newly-developed proportional-integral
   extremum seeking controller (PI-ESC) that converges at the same
   timescale as the process. This method modifies the control law to
   include terms proportional to the estimated gradient, but this
   modification of the control law requires a more sophisticated gradient
   estimator in order to avoid bias. We develop a PI-ESC for which this
   bias is eliminated. PI-ESC is applied to the problem of compressor
   discharge temperature setpoint selection for a vapor compression system
   where setpoints are automatically determined so that power consumption
   is minimized. The vapor compression system operates with a regulating
   feedback controller configured to drive the compressor discharge
   temperature to setpoints selected by the PI-ESC, and we use a
   physics-based simulation model to demonstrate that power consumption is
   minimized dramatically faster than by traditional perturbation-based
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a method for the formation control of high-altitude
   balloons is developed. This method uses a distributed extremum seeking
   controller implemented at each balloon. The controller works to minimize
   a cost function based on the number of users connected to each balloon.
   This cost function is designed so that the balloons tend to spread
   themselves out evenly over Earth. The control approach is fully
   distributed and requires no central coordinator. Balloons communicate
   over a network via a consensus algorithm providing all balloons with an
   accurate estimate of the total cost. Since extremum seeking is a
   model-free approach, it does not require a complex wind model. The
   resulting algorithm is efficient as the burden of computation is shared
   between all balloons. A simulation study involving 20 balloons is used
   to verify the effectiveness of this approach.}},

Abstract = {{Remotely sensed spectral imagery, geophysical (magnetic and gravity),
   and geodetic (elevation) data are useful in a variety of Earth science
   applications such as environmental monitoring and mineral exploration.
   Using these data with Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA), which are
   widely used in image analysis and statistical pattern recognition
   applications, may enhance preliminary geological mapping and
   interpretation. This approach contributes towards a rapid and objective
   means of geological mapping in contrast to conventional field expedition
   techniques. In this study, four supervised MLAs (naive Bayes, k-nearest
   neighbour, random forest, and support vector machines) are compared in
   order to assess their performance for correctly identifying geological
   rocktypes in an area with complete ground validation information.
   Geological maps of the Sudbury region are used for calibration and
   validation. Percent of correct classifications was used as indicators of
   performance. Results show that random forest is the best approach. As
   expected, MLA performance improves with more calibration clusters, i.e.
   a more uniform distribution of calibration data over the study region.
   Performance is generally low, though geological trends that correspond
   to a ground validation map are visualized. Low performance may be the
   result of poor spectral images of bare rock which can be covered by
   vegetation or water. The distribution of calibration clusters and MLA
   input parameters affect the performance of the MLAs. Generally,
   performance improves with more uniform sampling, though this increases
   required computational effort and time. With the achievable performance
   levels in this study, the technique is useful in identifying regions of
   interest and identifying general rocktype trends. In particular, phase I
   geological site investigations will benefit from this approach and lead
   to the selection of sites for advanced surveys.}},

Abstract = {{Classic feeding techniques and dielectric slab selection for planar
   circuit and antenna designs can be challenging at microwave and
   millimeter-wave frequencies. Substrates can become electrically thick
   and unwanted surface-wave (SW) field distributions may be excited
   potentially spoiling device performance. Thus SWs are typically looked
   upon as an adverse effect causing parasitic radiation and power losses.
   In this work a full wave analysis is provided in the spectral domain by
   examining the fields generated by the main slot connected to the feeding
   transmission line. Numerical results by the authors suggest that there
   is a broad frequency range which can offer increased TM SW power levels
   when compared to the radiated space wave power. Applications for these
   printed surface-wave launchers, as described in this review article
   include, new quasi-optical planar circuits, leaky-wave antennas, and
   other guiding structures for power combining at microwave and
   millimeter-wave frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{We study two types of leaky wave antenna structures and the role of
   surface waves in their design. The first leaky wave antenna is a
   multi-dielectric structure of layered contrasting refractive indices. We
   review a rigorous derivation, by the present authors, of the radiation
   and surface wave powers excited by an embedded dipole source. It is
   shown that with this type of leaky wave antenna, the excitation of
   surface waves can drastically lower the antenna radiation efficiency.
   The latter is obtained in a closed form. The second leaky wave structure
   considered is based on the efficient excitation of surface waves on a
   dielectric slab. By introducing a suitable grating screen, the surface
   wave is smoothly converted into a leaky wave with a desirable radiation
   beam in the far-field. In this type of leaky wave antenna, efficient
   surface wave excitation is a key design step. We also review our
   perturbation analysis to find the radiation properties of planar
   periodic leaky wave antennas and certain design consideration are also
   recommended.}},

Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{26-34}},
Abstract = {{The oil production industry in Nigeria operates both onshore and more
   recently offshore in the coastal areas located in the oil-rich
   Niger-Delta. Unfortunately, the drilling mud additives currently used in
   the country are all imported and at huge foreign exchange costs.
   Therefore the objective of the current effort is development of drilling
   fluid from locally sourced mud additives for drilling operations.
   Various rheological and filtration tests were carried out on both
   unbeneficiated and beneficiated local clay from Afuze, Nigeria using a
   six-speed Rheometer and API filter press respectively. Beneficiation
   involved the addition of sodium carbonate, caustic soda and starch to
   the mud formulations. Clay concentrations were varied from 20g/350ml to
   60g/350ml.
   The test results showed that free swell volume (FSV) increased from with
   clay concentration with the optimum values observed at 60g/350ml. The
   filtrate loss of 63ml, filter cake thickness of 6m, yield point of 7cp
   and plastic viscosity of 1cp values of Afuze clay did not satisfy API
   specification of 15ml, 2m, 24cp and 8cp respectively at any tested
   concentration. Likewise Afuze clay did not display gel strength (10
   seconds and 10 minutes of 29 and 34 respectively) suitable for bringing
   cuttings up from the hole. However, improvements in its rheological and
   filtration properties as well as free swell volume were observed with
   the beneficiated Afuze clay at clay concentrations of 20, 30, 40, 50,
   60g/350ml when beneficiated with starch concentrations of 1g and 0.5g,
   sodium carbonate of 2g and 1g and caustic soda of 0.25g. Beneficiated
   Afuze clay displayed gel strengths (10 seconds and 10 minutes of 98 and
   140 respectively) suitable for bringing cuttings up from the hole with
   optimum values observed at 60g/350ml.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the wrench accuracy for parallel manipulators is examined
   and the solution sets of actuator forces/torques are investigated under
   variations in parameters and data. The subset of solution set that
   produces platform wrenches within the required lower and upper bounds
   are modeled using discrete and analytical methods. In addition, the
   formulation of the solutions that provide any platform wrench within the
   defined interval is examined. Intersection of these two sets, if any,
   results in the given interval platform wrench. Moreover, the dependency
   among the entries of the interval linear systems and its effect on the
   solution set is considered.
   The discrete method is based on the discretization of solution set
   enclosure and validation at each increment, or the collection of the
   solutions of real linear relations for the discretized interval
   coefficient matrix and output vector. The analytical method for each
   solution set is based on the intersection of the pertinent closed
   half-spaces or the assembly of closed line segments that encompass the
   solution. Implementation of the methods to identify the solution for
   actuator forces/torques is presented on example parallel manipulators.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamic numerical models of Wave Energy Converters (WEC) contain
   hydrodynamic coefficients that are commonly obtained from numerical
   codes that solve linear potential flow problems using Boundary Element
   Methods (BEM codes). The assumptions made by the BEM codes in their
   calculation of the linear hydrodynamic coefficients are violated by the
   large and nonlinear motions that wave activation body class WECs often
   go through during operation. In this study, Forced Oscillation Tests
   were used to evaluate the hydrodynamic torque coefficients estimated for
   an Oscillating Wave Surge Converter (OWSC) WEC by two BEM codes; WAMIT
   and Nemoh. The paper describes the tests and the active Force Feedback
   Dynamometer test rig used to perform them. The results indicate good
   agreement between the BEM codes and experimental data for small angular
   displacement amplitude oscillations, as expected; up to 0.3 rad. The
   torque not predicted by the BEM codes is presented and shown to have an
   amplitude and phase that vary throughout the range of tests performed.}},

Abstract = {{The aerodynamics of an aircraft in flight impose significant stresses
   upon the structure. Specifically, the mechanics of fluid flow are highly
   turbulent and, the layer around the aircraft, is referred to the
   turbulent boundary layer (TBL). The TBL incites a gradient of pressure
   fluctuations across the fuselage skin resulting in its vibration, and in
   turn, the generation of noise inside the passenger cabin. The
   investigation herein proposes a hybrid FEM-BEM modeling technique to
   predict the aforementioned vibro-acoustic response and an experimental
   methodology to verify the results (following ASTM and ANSI international
   testing standards). The described expectations required construction of
   an acoustic facility consisting of a reverberation chamber and a
   semi-anechoic room, the development of DAQ software using LabVIEW, an
   assembly of DAQ hardware using National Instruments products, and the
   post-processing of test data using Microsoft Excel. The principal
   quantity of interest is transmission loss (though insertion loss,
   absorption and other metrics are also calculated). Two panels (0.04in
   (40thou) and 0.09in (90thou) in thickness) were simulated and tested
   (0.01in = 1thou). The calculated error of the proposed methodology is
   within a maximum of 5dB, with an average of 1 dB. Ongoing work is
   investigating complex constructions and the use of damping materials.}},

Abstract = {{It is commonly believed that a complete understanding of gear dynamics
   is essential for the design of gear transmission systems capable of
   running at low noise and vibration levels with prolonged service life.
   Several single degree of freedom (SDOF) models of gear dynamics with
   clearance nonlinearity are generalized based on previous research, while
   a constant damping ratio is assumed and the friction is neglected. These
   models include the effects of time-varying mesh stiffness, gear
   manufacturing errors, profile modifications and backlash. Comparisons of
   the steady responses predicted by these SDOF models are intensively
   studied and the relationships between these models are discussed. Even
   though, different types of mesh stiffness and different treatments of
   the gear error functions in the analysis are used in these models, the
   steady-state responses predicted by these models are generally
   consistent with each other and agree well with experimental results.
   However, some discrepancies and relationships do exist among these
   models. The advantages and disadvantages of each model are highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an automated design framework for the development of
   individual part forming tools for a composite stiffener. The framework
   uses parametrically developed design geometries for both the part and
   its layup tool. The framework has been developed with a functioning user
   interface where part / tool combinations are passed to a virtual
   environment for utility based assessment of their features and
   assemblability characteristics. The work demonstrates clear benefits in
   process design methods with conventional design timelines reduced from
   hours and days to minutes and seconds. The methods developed here were
   able to produce a digital mock up of a component with its associated
   layup tool in less than 3 minutes. The virtual environment presenting
   the design to the designer for interactive assembly planning was
   generated in 20 seconds. Challenges still exist in determining the level
   of reality required to provide an effective learning environment in the
   virtual world. Full representation of physical phenomena such as
   gravity, part clashes and the representation of standard build functions
   require further work to represent real physical phenomena more

Abstract = {{In this work, the impact of conventional drilling and helical milling
   processes on the fatigue response Ti-6Al-4V (grade 5 titanium alloy) has
   been presented. Results show that the work pieces produced by helical
   milling has a 119\% longer fatigue life compared with the drilled pieces
   under dry machining condition, and a 96\% longer fatigue life for
   helical milled piece under lubricated condition. The use of cutting
   fluid has led to longer fatigue lives -15\% longer for drilling and 3\%
   longer for helical milling. Other results such as the machined surface
   roughness, alloy surface and sub-surface microstructures have also been
   studied in details. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   discrete time simulation of the dynamics of a stiff, damped string. The
   resulting algorithms have spectral accuracy, are unconditionally stable,

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose generalized selection combining/zero forcing
   beamforming (GSC/ZFB) scheme to improve the secrecy performance of
   spectrum-sharing wiretap networks with a full-duplex Bob. Specifically,
   the full-duplex Bob selects L-B strongest antennas to receive the
   signals from Alice and simultaneously transmits jamming signals with the
   remaining (N-B - L-B) antennas based on ZFB algorithm. We first derive
   exact closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability of
   full-duplex multi-antenna spectrum-sharing wiretap networks with GSC/ZFB
   scheme. Then, we derive tractable asymptotic expression for the secrecy
   outage probability, which reveals that there exists a secrecy outage
   floor for the proposed GSC/ZFB scheme in high SNR region. The simulation
   results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves better performance
   than traditional GSC scheme with half-duplex technique. In addition,
   different from the traditional GSC scheme, the secrecy performance of
   the proposed GSC/ZFB scheme is not always improved with the increase of
   L-B under a given N-B.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the transmission of confidential information
   over an alpha - mu and a kappa - mu fading channel in the presence of an
   eavesdropper who experiences kappa - mu and alpha - mu fading,
   respectively. In particular, we derive novel analytical expressions for
   the probability of strictly positive secrecy capacity (SPSC) and a lower
   bound on secrecy outage probability (SOPL) for independent and
   non-identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) channel coefficients. These
   results have been validated through simulations and reduction to known
   special cases. These new, very general formulations, are important as
   they bring together previously non-unified secrecy capacity and secrecy
   outage probabilities (SOP) such as those involving alpha - mu,
   Nakagami-m, Rayleigh, One-Sided Gaussian, Weibull, Negative Exponential
   with kappa - mu and Rice. Additionally, due to the duality of analysis
   of secrecy capacity and co-channel interference (CCI), the results
   presented here will also have immediate applicability in the analysis of
   outage probability in wireless systems affected by CCI and background
   noise for the aforementioned fading scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-carrier index keying (MCIK) is a recently developed transmission
   technique that exploits sub-carrier indices as an additional degree of
   freedom for data transmission. This paper investigates the performance
   of a low complexity detection scheme with diversity reception for MCIK
   with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). In order to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed detection scheme, an exact and
   an approximate closed-form expression for the pairwise error probability
   (PEP) of greedy detector (GD) with maximal ratio combining (MRC) is
   derived. The presented results show that the performance of the GD is
   significantly improved when MRC diversity is employed. The proposed
   hybrid scheme is found to outperform maximum likelihood (ML) detection
   with a substantial reduction on the associated computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we characterize the simultaneous channel response of
   narrowband on-body and body-to-body channels at 2.48 GHz using the

   these were located on the front-chest and front-central-waist of an
   adult male, and the third node was located on the front-central-waist of
   an adult female. Multiple human mobility scenarios were considered for
   three different environments namely an anechoic chamber, reverberation
   chamber and laboratory environment. For all of the measured channels,
   the kappa-mu probability density function (pdf) provided an excellent
   fit to the empirical distribution of the measured short-term fading. In
   addition, the channel measurements also demonstrated the channel
   reciprocity property for each of the on-body and body-to-body links, and
   scenarios considered here. Finally, we also show that the sample period
   of the measurement system developed for this study was well within the

   can be used to find building temperature variations, heat energy
   production, electrical energy consumption, instantaneous power,
   coefficients of performance on a real-time scale based on different
   control strategies used for demand side management. The developed model
   in SIMULINK includes the effect of thermal storage in the underfloor

Title = {{Secure Transmission in Cognitive MIMO Relaying Networks With Outdated
   Channel State Information}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{8212-8224}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce transmit antenna selection/maximal-ratio
   combining (TAS/MRC) scheme in dual-hop randomize-and-forward (RaF)
   cognitive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap networks with
   outdated channel state information (CSI). In this network, the secondary
   transmitter adopts the TAS scheme to choose the antenna with the maximal
   received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while the secondary receiver and
   the eavesdropper adopt the MRC scheme to combine the received signals.
   To thoroughly assess the secrecy performance achieved by the TAS/MRC
   scheme and the impact of outdated CSI on the secrecy performance, we
   derive a new closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability
   of dual-hop RaF cognitive MIMO wiretap networks. In order to achieve
   more insights on the application of TAS/MRC scheme, we further present
   tractable asymptotic secrecy outage probability at high SNR regimes
   under two distinct scenarios. From our analysis, several important
   concluding remarks are obtained as follows: 1) the RaF relaying strategy
   achieves better secrecy performance than that of the decode-and forward
   relaying strategy for dual-hop cognitive MIMO wiretap networks; 2)
   outdated CSI decreases the secrecy diversity gain of the TAS/MRC scheme
   from N-R min (N-A, N-B) to min (N-R, N-B); and 3) although TAS/MRC
   scheme cannot attain full secrecy diversity gain for the considered
   system with outdated CSI, it still can achieve an extra secrecy coding
   gain compared with the random antenna selection/MRC scheme.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing level of wind power integration using doubly fed
   induction generators (DFIGs) has implications for local frequency
   support as a consequence of decoupling between DFIG rotor speed and grid
   frequency. To ensure reliable and stable power system operation with
   DFIG integration, supplementary inertial control strategies are
   required. Conventional inertial control algorithms which use the rate of
   change of frequency (RoCoF) and frequency deviation loops (droop loop)
   require great effort to determine appropriate gains suitable for all
   power grid and wind speeds. In this paper, the influence of
   supplementary inertial control loop parameters on the inertial response
   and power system frequency are analysed. An active control strategy is
   proposed for frequency regulation using variable gains in the frequency
   deviation loop for the inertial controller. The variable gain control
   approach is shown to actively respond to system changes to improve the
   performance. The controller is compared with the widely used PID method.
   The proposed method is shown to enhance the frequency nadir and
   guarantee steady DFIG operation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel technique for mapping and exploration using
   cooperating autonomous underwater vehicles. Rather than using the
   typical lawnmower sweep pattern to search an entire area, the proposed
   navigational plan involves guiding the formation directly towards each
   object of interest in turn, before arriving at a final goal position.
   This is achieved by the use of traditional artificial potential fields
   alongside counter-rotational potential fields. These clockwise and
   counter- clockwise fields are employed simultaneously by vehicles to
   ensure that the entire object is scanned rather than simply avoided as
   is the case with traditional collision avoidance techniques. The
   proposed methodology allows a formation to have fluid-like motion whilst
   a separation distance between cooperating agents (free of angular
   constraints) is maintained with a greater degree of flexibility than
   traditional formation control approaches. Owing to its nature, this
   technique is suited for applications such as exploration, mapping and
   underwater inspection to name a few. Simulation results demonstrate the
   efficacy of the proposed approach.}},

   clusters due to their high performance and energy efficiency. To
   increase the GPU computational power in a cluster node and tackle larger
   problems, multi-GPU nodes have become the platform of choice for
   scientific applications. In a multi-GPU node, GPU devices are
   interconnected together via different communication channels. Thus,
   intranode inter-process communications among GPUs may traverse different
   paths with different latency and bandwidth capacity. As the number of
   GPUs within a multi-GPU node increases, the topology of GPU
   interconnects becomes more hierarchical, effectively increasing the
   heterogeneity of the GPU communication channels.
   In this paper, we provide evidence that the performance of different
   intranode GPU communication channels can be considerably different from
   each other. This is specially true for larger message sizes. Taking this
   into account, our goal in this work is to efficiently assign the
   available GPU devices on a multi-GPU node to MPI processes in order to
   improve the GPU-to-GPU communication performance. We tackle this
   challenge by proposing a topology-aware GPU selection scheme. Our scheme
   is capable of efficiently mapping MPI processes to the available
   intranode GPU devices, in a way that more intensive inter-process GPU
   communications take place on the more efficient communication channels.
   Our experimental results show that our topology-aware GPU selection
   scheme can improve the communication performance of the microbench-marks
   with different communication patterns, specifically those with weighted
   and asymmetrical communications.}},

Abstract = {{GPU accelerators have been increasingly used in modern heterogeneous HPC
   clusters by offering high performance and energy efficiency. Such
   heterogeneous GPU clusters consisting of multiple CPU cores and GPU
   devices have become the platform of choice for many HPC applications.
   The communication channels among these processing elements expose
   different latency and bandwidth characteristics. Thus, efficient
   utilization of communication channels becomes an important factor for
   achieving higher inter-process communication performance.
   In this paper, we exploit topology awareness for a better utilization of
   communication channels in GPU clusters. We first discuss the challenges
   associated with topology-aware mapping in GPU clusters, and then propose
   MAGC, a Mapping Approach for GPU Clusters. MAGC seeks to improve the
   total communication performance by a joint consideration of both
   CPU-to-CPU and GPU-to-GPU communications of the application, and CPU and
   GPU physical topologies of the underlying GPU cluster. It provides a
   unified framework for topology-aware process-to-core mapping and
   GPU-to-process assignment across a GPU cluster. We study the potential
   benefits of MAGC with two different mapping algorithms: a) the Scotch
   graph mapping library, and b) a heuristic designed to explicitly
   consider maximum congestion.
   We evaluate our design through extensive experiments at micro-benchmark
   and application levels on two GPU clusters with different GPU types and
   topologies. We have developed a micro-benchmark suite to model various
   communication patterns among CPU cores and among GPU devices. For
   application results, we use the molecular dynamics simulator,
   HOOMD-blue. Micro-benchmark results show that we can achieve up to
   91.4\% improvement in communication time. At the application level, we
   can achieve up to 8\% performance improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relaying is a promising
   technological paradigm which can offer high spectral efficiency and
   substantially improved coverage. Yet, these configurations face some
   formidable challenges in terms of digital signal processing (DSP) power
   consumption and circuitry complexity, since the number of radio
   frequency (RF) chains may scale with the number of antennas at the relay
   station. In this paper, we advocate that performing a portion of the
   power-intensive DSP in the analog domain, using simple phase shifters
   and with a reduced number of RF paths, can address these challenges. In
   particular, we consider a multipair amplify-and-forward (AF) relay
   system with maximum ratio combining/transmission (MRC/MRT) and we
   determine the asymptotic spectral efficiency for this hybrid
   analog/digital architecture. After that, we extend our analytical
   results to account for heavily quantized analog phase shifters and show
   that the performance loss with 2 quantization bits is only 10\%.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider beamforming design for an underlay cognitive
   radio multiple-input single-output broadcast channel, where a pair of
   secondary users coexists with multiple primary receivers. There exist
   multiple malicious eavesdroppers who attempt to overhear the
   confidential messages from the secondary system. When the channel state
   information of the eavesdroppers can only be obtained in the statistical
   sense, we transform the constraint which results from the statistical
   information of the passive eavesdroppers into a linear matrix inequality
   and convex constraint. To improve the secrecy rate of the secondary
   system, we aim to design a jamming noise to degrade the eavesdroppers.
   The main objective of the design is to maximize the secrecy rate of the
   secondary system while satisfying all the interference power constraints
   at the primary users and per-antenna power constraint at the secondary
   transmitter. The original problem is a nonconvex program, which can be
   reformulated to a convex program by applying the rank relaxation method.
   To this end, we prove that the rank relaxation is tight and it can be
   efficiently solved. Moreover, to develop an efficient resource
   allocation scheme we transform the relaxed problem into an equivalent
   problem based on a duality result.}},

   we design a receiver by minimizing the error probability. An iterative
   algorithm is derived to determine a threshold value which minimizes a
   linear approximation of the error probability at each iteration.
   Numerical evaluations reveal that our theoretical analysis based on the
   Gaussian mixture model match our simulation very closely. Furthermore,
   we propose a memory-based receiver in which previously detected symbols
   are considered in deriving the detection algorithm. Computer simulations
   confirm that the memory-based receiver effectively eliminates
   inter-symbol interference (ISI) and significantly improves the bit error

   error receivers (MMSE) receivers. In particular, our analysis shows that
   the MRC receiver is non-optimal for spaceconstrained massive MIMO
   topologies. On the other hand, ZF and MMSE receivers can still deliver
   an increasing SE as the number of BS antennas grows large. Numerical
   results corroborate our analysis and show the effect of the number of
   antennas, the number of users, and the total antenna array space on the
   sum SE performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the problem of fault tolerant for a group
   of multiple autonomous cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
   during execution their mission in a desired geometrical pattern. A
   decentralized linear model predictive control (LMPC) is designed and
   implemented on a team of cooperative UAVs to achieve the desired
   formation in the absence of faults (normal/fault-free cases). When
   faults occur in one or more of the UAVs, a fault-tolerant cooperative
   control (FTCC) strategy is designed via fuzzy logic such that each UAV
   in the team will take its own decision in a decentralized manner, to
   reconfigure the formation of the whole team ensuring the execution of
   the required mission. The proposed controller respects the general
   formation constraints known as Reynolds rules of flocking during
   simulations. Our main contribution in this paper lays in the use of
   fuzzy logic control by the cooperative UAVs in taking the decision to
   solve the problem of formation reconfiguration for an autonomous team of
   UAVs in the presences of faults.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the simplest relevant molecular model of a polymeric
   liquid in large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) flow: the suspension
   of rigid dumbbells in a Newtonian solvent. For such suspensions, the
   viscoelastic response of the polymeric liquid depends exclusively on the
   dynamics of dumbbell orientation. We have previously derived explicit
   analytical expressions for the shear rate amplitude and frequency
   dependences of the first and third harmonics of the alternating shear
   stress response in LAOS. Higher harmonics sculpt the shear stress,
   distorting it from its sinusoidal shape. In this work, we derive the
   polymer contribution to the shear stress response up to and including
   the next higher, fifth harmonic. For this, we use the fourth order term
   in the expansion of the orientation distribution to calculate the shear
   stress response. Our analysis employs the general method of Bird and
   {[}J Armstrong Chem Phys, 56, 3680 (1972)]. Our expression is the only
   one to have been derived from a molecular theory for a fifth harmonic.
   Our paper thus provides the first glimpse of the molecular origins of a
   shear stress harmonic higher than the third.}},

Abstract = {{To accurately reproduce colors, it is necessary to calibrate a digital
   camera that is used to acquire images. The traditional calibration
   methods have been used to build a color correction model that has a
   transformation matrix mapping data from a RGB image to standard XYZ
   tristimulus. Determination of this matrix is performed through matrix
   transformation from each color checker patch to its corresponding actual
   XYZ value, using least-squares regression. However, these methods cannot
   effectively minimize the CIE DE error because of these algorithms'
   limitations and CCD dark currents, which can be hard to accurately
   measure. In this paper, a new color correction model is presented for
   color calibration and helps minimize the CIEDE2000 error in order to
   achieve higher color fidelity. Experimental results show that our method
   significantly outperforms other algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an improved channel model and estimation for positioning
   in indoor environments using the visible light is presented. For
   positioning, the specific propagation and indoor channel model for
   visible light is used and a time-of-arrival (TOA) based distance
   estimations are proposed for two cases of known and unknown transmitter
   and receiver vertical distance. Based on this model and also assuming
   perfect synchronization between transmitter and receiver, the Cramer-Rao
   lower bound (CRLB) is computed as the theoretical limits on the
   performance and accuracy of any unbiased estimator. Unlike the radio
   frequency (RF) channel, the visible light communication (VLC) channel
   depends on the distance between the transmitter and receiver.
   Calculations show that proposed channel model and positioning result to
   more accurate distance estimate compared to their counterparts and the
   corresponding CRLB is almost 100 times lower than what was previously
   supposed.}},

Abstract = {{Extended Kalman filter frequency tracker converges to an optimal
   estimation with a very low computational complexity only if an exact
   knowledge about the initial state is available and the model is accurate
   otherwise it may diverge. On the other hand, particle filter performance
   is not so sensitive to the initial state estimation and results in a
   more robust estimation even if no prior knowledge about the initial
   state is available but at a cost of much more computational complexity.
   In this paper, we propose a hybrid algorithm that takes advantages of
   both extended Kalman and particle filter in order to achieve a robust
   and fast algorithm for estimating the fundamental frequency of audio
   signals. Simulation results reveal that this hybrid algorithm is robust,
   fast and accurate enough for real-time applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the retargeting and further enhancement of a
   compact multitasking kernel for the 32-bit Altera Nios II processor. The
   kernel, called QUERK for Queen's University Educational Real-time
   Kernel, was originally written in assembly language and then the C
   language for the Motorola (and then Freescale) 68HC11 processor.
   Consisting of less than 200 lines of assembly-language instructions, the
   kernel was intended for educational purposes on undergraduate laboratory
   equipment in use at the time it was created. The software also supported
   undergraduate capstone project activity. To migrate the software to the
   32-bit Altera Nios II processor that subsequently replaced the 8-bit
   68HC11 in undergraduate laboratory activity, and to investigate issues
   arising from differences between the two instruction sets, this paper
   describes the retargeting of the kernel at the level of assembly
   language. The results reveal that the number of assembly-language source
   instructions for the base kernel with relinquish, block, and unblock
   services increased by less than 9\% for the Nios II in comparison to the
   68HC11. Although many additional instructions are needed to save and
   restore the larger number of registers for the Nios II, reductions in
   the number of instructions needed in other parts of the kernel aid in
   offsetting that increase in instructions. Further enhancements of the
   kernel are also described with support for timer delay requests, dynamic
   memory management, and interprocess communication with message passing.
   Potential future enhancements are also described.}},

Abstract = {{The cardiac conduction velocity vector (CCVV) provides valuable
   information that is used to distinguish/treat various heart diseases.
   The CCVV can be estimated using the intracardiac electrograms; i.e., the
   activation times (ATs) and locations of the recording catheter's
   electrodes are used for the VV estimation. In practice, the ATs and
   locations of the electrodes are estimated, and if their estimation
   errors are not taken into consideration, they may significantly degrade
   the quality of the velocity estimation. Thus, in this paper, we assume
   that the locations and the ATs of the catheter's electrodes are
   contaminated with white Gaussian noise with known variances, and we
   derive the maximum likelihood (ML) cardiac velocity estimator for the
   planar wavefront. We further calculate the NIL estimate of the AT that
   the planar wavefront reaches at any given location. Our simulation
   results show the efficiency of the proposed MI, estimators for the
   velocity and AT, and they also confirm the validity of the derived
   relations for the covariance of the error of the estimators.}},

Abstract = {{The cardiac conduction velocity vector (VV) provides insight into the
   characteristics of the myocardial tissue and can be deployed to treat
   different heart diseases. The cardiac VV can be estimated by processing
   the intracardiac electrograms. In this paper, we analyse the VV
   estimation error of two computationally efficient heuristic estimators:
   1- maximum time difference (MTD) and 2- minimum velocity (MinV). In the
   MTD, the estimated velocity is a vector in the direction of the vector
   that connects the first to the last catheter's activated electrode, and
   the magnitude of the VV is estimated as the ratio of the distance
   between two electrodes to the delay between their ATs. In the MinV,
   using a similar procedure as the MTD, we assign a VV to each available
   electrode pair of the catheter, and the VV with the smallest magnitude
   is selected as the final estimated VV. We derive the average absolute
   value and average squared absolute value of the VV estimation error of
   the MTD and MinV methods for a planar wavefront in a two-dimensional
   case and confirm the accuracy of our analysis by simulating synthetic
   data.}},

Abstract = {{The cardiac conduction velocity vector (VV) at a desired point in any
   chamber of the heart can be estimated by processing the local
   intracardiac electrograms, i.e., the activation times (ATs) and the
   locations of the recording catheter's electrodes can be used for the VV
   estimation. In this paper, we modify the maximum time difference (MID)
   method, which is a simple computational efficient cardiac VV estimation
   approach. In the MTD, first, the ATs of the electrograms are extracted,
   and the corresponding wavefronts are estimated. For each wavefront, the
   VV is estimated as the vector connecting the first to the last activated
   electrodes of the catheter divided by the time duration between the
   activation of those two electrodes. In the proposed modified MTD (MMTD)
   approach, which is slightly more computationally complex than the MTD,
   we divide the AT's of each considered wavefront into two groups, such
   that one group contains the electrodes with early activations, and the
   other contains those with late activations. We properly assign a time
   value and a location value to these groups and follow the same procedure
   as the MTD method to estimate the VV using the assigned values. Using
   synthetic data, we show that the proposed MMTD improves the quality of
   the cardiac conduction VV estimation of the MTD method, i.e., the MMTD
   is more robust to the AT estimation error and is able to determine the
   VV of the planar wavefronts more accurately.}},

Abstract = {{Unit commitment is a key issue in power system operation and has long
   been an intractable problem due to its complex mix-integer nonlinear
   formulation. The original unit commitment problem aims to minimize the
   fossil fuel cost by determining the on/off status of power units and
   power contribution of each online unit at the same time. However, the
   uncoordinated large charging power necessity of plug-in electric
   vehicles brings unprecedented challenges to the power system operators
   and further complicates the unit commitment problem. To seamless
   integrate the plug-in electric vehicles into the unit commitment, a new
   binary/real-value hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm framework is proposed
   in this paper, simultaneously determining the binary status and power
   output of units as well as the power delivered to/feedback from flexible
   charging and discharging of plug-in electric vehicles. A batch of binary
   particle swarm optimisation variants with different transfer functions
   are implemented and compared in solving the unit commitment problem with
   and without plug-in electric vehicles. Numerical studies illustrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed intelligent algorithm and the impact of
   different transfer functions is evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present an effective hybrid algorithm based on
   particle swarm optimization (PSO) and teaching-learning-based
   optimization (TLBO), called PSO-TLBO, to solve multi-objective
   optimization (MOO) problems. In PSO-TLBO, teacher phase and learner
   phase in TLBO are incorporated to a PSO to improve the exploration and
   exploitation ability. Another feature of PSO-TLBO is the improved
   circular crowed sorting (CCS) to truncate the external archive which
   stores the nondominated solutions found during the search. Moreover, the
   polynomial mutation is used only when the velocities of all solutions
   are very small. The performance of PSO-TLBO algorithm for MOO is tested
   on ZDT and DTLZ benchmarks functions and compared with some powerful MOO
   algorithms in terms of both convergence and spread performance. Also,
   the contribution of CCS is compared with crowded sorting in NSGA-II.
   Comparison results reveal the powerful ability of PSO-TLBO to obtain
   remarkable solutions in terms of inverted generational distance (IGD)
   metrics.}},

Abstract = {{Battery charging strategy is a key issue in battery management system to
   ensure good battery performance and safe operation during the charging
   process. In this paper, a novel battery optimal charging strategy is
   proposed by applying the TLBO algorithm to a LiFePO4 battery for an
   optimal charging based on a coupled thermoelectric model. A specific
   dual objective function including battery charging time and temperature
   rise (both battery interior and surface) is formulated first. Then a
   battery optimal charging strategy is presented in detail by using the
   TLBO algorithm, aiming at finding a suitable
   constant-current-constant-voltage (CCCV) current profile to minimize the
   dual-objective function. Besides, the effects of different weights in
   dual-objective function on the optimal charging profile are analyzed.
   Simulation results demonstrate that the presented optimal charging
   strategy can provide effective and acceptable optimal charge current
   profile. The strategy can he also easily implemented to other battery
   types to effectively balance the battery charging time and battery
   temperature rise during charging process.}},

Abstract = {{The following work investigates a cost efficient method of measuring
   shaft rotational position. The proposed sensor configuration consists of
   a magnet and a Hall effect sensor. When compared to the alternative (an
   optical encoder), this approach has several advantages including cost,
   and durability. The puck shaped magnet was placed on the end of a
   rotating shaft and generated a magnet field oriented transverse to the
   shaft axis. The Hall effect sensor was placed in a stationary holder
   co-axially aligned with the shaft and slightly offset, in the axial
   direction, from the magnet. The sensor output was compared to a high
   accuracy incremental encoder, which is the industry standard technique.
   The proposed sensor was tested for its ability to record shaft
   rotational speed under a variety of test conditions, including; various
   constant speeds, varying speeds, magnet size, sensor to magnet lateral
   distance, and various obstructions between the magnet and the sensor
   (termed readability). The sensor provided excellent measurement results,
   under all test conditions and compared well to the incremental optical

   Verification in Wireless Sensor Networks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{The target nodes are k-covered by the sensor nodes; there will be a lot
   of redundant data forcing the phenomenon of congestion which lowers the
   network communication capability and coverage and accelerates network
   energy consumption. Therefore, this paper proposes an energy-efficient
   coverage control with multinodes redundancy verification (ECMRV). The
   algorithm constructs the coverage network model by using the positional
   relationship among the sensor nodes, and the proof procedure of the
   sector coverage expected value of the monitoring area also has been
   provided. On the aspect of the energy consumption, this paper gives the
   proportion of energy conversion functions between the working sensor
   nodes and the neighboring sensor nodes. And by using the function
   proportional to schedule the sensor nodes with low energy, we achieve
   the energy balance of the whole network and the optimization of the
   network resources. Finally, the simulation experiments indicate that
   this algorithm can not only improve the quality of network coverage, but
   completely inhibit the rapid energy consumption of the sensor nodes as
   well; as a result, the network lifetime extends, which has verified
   availability and stability of the algorithm in the paper.}},

   carefully designed in a lumped element configuration. Due to the fact
   that all the parasitics (i.e. ohmic losses, inductances and
   capacitances) were taken into consideration at different stages of the
   design process, this resulted in a measured response which is in very
   close agreement with the simulated one. The measurements showed an input
   return loss and isolation of 22.43 dB and 15.76 dB respectively at 1 GHz
   with a 10-dB fractional bandwidth of almost 10.85 \%. The measured
   coupling and thru coefficients are 3.48 dB and 4.01 dB respectively at
   the same operating frequency. These values agreed quite well with the
   ones from the electromagnetic simulations. The reduction in the measured
   thru coefficient is mainly due to the added losses of solders and
   co-axial connectors. A phase error of about 2.4 degrees with respect to

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel hierarchical control scheme to integrate the
   telecom backup systems into power grid through microgrid. The proposed
   scheme employs hierarchical control system to correctly control the
   system in both grid-connected and islanded modes. The conventional
   hierarchical control system is highly dependent on communication links.
   With no communication link, the reliability and efficiency of the system
   degrades significantly. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical control
   scheme that is less relies om communication links and performs
   adequately even with no communication link. For the secondary control
   level, an innovative adaptive droop control scheme that regulates
   microgrid parameters locally is proposed. This approach needs neither an
   extra controller nor a communication link. To reduce the voltage
   measurement errors, the effect of line impedance between converter and
   Point of Common Coupling (PCC) has been taken into account in voltage
   adaptive droop controller. In addition, the proposed scheme offers two
   operation modes of autonomous and non-autonomous. In autonomous mode,
   the active/reactive power is controlled based on the grid parameters and
   available storage capacity without a need to communication link. While
   in non-autonomous mode the active/reactive power reference is provided
   by tertiary controller. With no tertiary controller in service, the
   proposed controller operates in the autonomous mode and controls the
   active/reactive power itself to ensure the stability of the power grid.
   The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated by using
   simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{When the Pipeline Inspection Gauge (PIG) is driven by the pressure
   differential between its two ends, the motion of the PIG inside the
   inspected pipeline is mainly dominated by the rotation motion around its
   longitudinal axis (rolling) and the conventional travelling motion along
   the pipeline longitudinal direction. The rolling motion improves PIG's
   capability to go through some heavy sludge or wax obstacle areas in the
   bottom part of the pipeline and enhances the inspection capability for
   the potential defects inside the pipeline. Moreover, it has some
   positive effects on the Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (SINS)
   error model and the corresponding localization precision. This paper
   presents an innovative error modeling technique, which is based on the
   detailed analysis of the Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) inertial
   sensors main error sources (gyroscope biases and scale factor errors,
   accelerometer biases and scale factor errors) on SINS error model when
   the PIG is exhibiting the rolling motion. The developed error models
   were verified experimentally at different rolling rates. Results showed
   high consistency with the theoretical analysis conclusions.}},

   the new approach, without any estimation of the noise, significantly

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work is to gauge user opinions on vehicle dashboard
   design to ascertain the criteria important to consumers for the next
   generation of automobile dashboards. The results provide insight into
   the aspects of dashboard design that users feel are not beneficial and
   thereby lead to better informed dashboard designs in the future.
   Participants reviewed the physical ergonomics of their vehicles very
   positively. However, in dashboard design and instrument panel layout
   they were unsure of what an ideal dashboard would look like, often
   showing contradictory views. Controls on the steering wheel were also
   well reviewed but controls near the gear stick were not. In terms of
   vehicle technology Satnavs received good scoring for effectiveness but
   were reported as distracting. IVISs were negatively reviewed. Finally,
   automation was reviewed as potentially improving the daily lives of
   individuals but trust in automation is still a problem. Overall, this
   study showed that whilst dashboards are relatively well reviewed there
   are still issues to be addressed regarding in-vehicle technology and
   distraction, as well as improving public opinion on automated vehicles.
   Results represent the first stage in research studying current
   dashboards and distraction of in-vehicle technology and the design of
   automated dashboards of the future using virtual reality environments to
   create optimal console designs for drivers. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Electrothermal vaporization (ETV) coupled to inductively coupled plasma
   optical emission spectrometry (ICPOES) was applied to the direct
   analysis of austenitic stainless steel powders using external
   calibration with increasing amounts of urban particulate matter (NIST
   1648a) certified reference material. The method was first validated
   through the analysis of a reference material of free cutting steel, BCS
   152/3, which was also analysed, following digestion in aqua regia, by
   ICPOES with external calibration using matrix-matched standard
   solutions. A four-step heating program, where the 30 s vaporization step
   was not ramped and followed a cooling step after pyrolysis, was used
   along with hemi-spherical graphite boats and trifluoromethane (CHF3,
   freon R-23) reaction gas, which resulted in sharp analyte signal peaks.
   Internal standardization with an argon emission line (415.859 nm) was
   applied throughout to compensate for sample loading effects on the
   plasma, improve the signal-to-background ratio and extend the linear
   dynamic range. Quantification limits ranged from 0.02 (Cd) to 200 (Si)
   mu g g(-1) in the solid using 5 mg aliquots, and are one or two orders
   of magnitude lower than those obtained by ICPOES with nebulization for
   several elements. The proposed method allowed determination of Al, Cd,
   Ce, Co, Cu, Mn, Pb, S, Si, Ti, V and Zn at levels in the 10 mu g g(-1)
   to 0.4\% (m m(-1)) range, in agreement with results obtained by ICPOES
   following digestion. The method is suitable for alloy quality control,
   as it drastically reduces analysis time and cost by eliminating the acid
   digestion step altogether, which is quite attractive for industrial
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{With the availability of a wide range of cloud Virtual Machines (VMs) it
   is difficult to determine which VMs can maximise the performance of an
   application. Benchmarking is commonly used to this end for capturing the
   performance of VMs. Most cloud benchmarking techniques are typically
   heavyweight - time consuming processes which have to benchmark the
   entire VM in order to obtain accurate benchmark data. Such benchmarks
   cannot be used in real-time on the cloud and incur extra costs even
   before an application is deployed.
   In this paper, we present lightweight cloud benchmarking techniques that
   execute quickly and can be used in near real-time on the cloud. The
   exploration of lightweight benchmarking techniques are facilitated by
   the development of DocLite - Docker Container-based Lightweight
   Benchmarking. DocLite is built on the Docker container technology which
   allows a user-defined portion ( such as memory size and the number of
   CPU cores) of the VM to be benchmarked. DocLite operates in two modes,
   in the first mode, containers are used to benchmark a small portion of
   the VM to generate performance ranks. In the second mode, historic
   benchmark data is used along with the first mode as a hybrid to generate
   VM ranks. The generated ranks are evaluated against three scientific
   high-performance computing applications. The proposed techniques are up
   to 91 times faster than a heavyweight technique which benchmarks the
   entire VM. It is observed that the first mode can generate ranks with
   over 90\% and 86\% accuracy for sequential and parallel execution of an
   application. The hybrid mode improves the correlation slightly but the
   first mode is sufficient for benchmarking cloud VMs.}},

Pages = {{649-657}},
Abstract = {{Gas phase photoreforming of methanol using a Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst has
   been performed under flow conditions at elevated temperatures. Comparing
   the activity of the reforming process as a function of temperature under
   dark and irradiated conditions shows a significant enhancement in the
   rate of H-2 production using the photo-assisted conditions at
   temperatures between 100-140 degrees C. At higher temperatures, the
   effect of irradiation is small with the process dominated by the thermal
   process. Deactivation of the catalyst was observed under irradiation but
   the catalyst was easily regenerated using an oxygen treatment at 120
   degrees C. Diffuse reflectance infra-red Fourier transform spectroscopy
   (DRIFTS) showed that the activity of the catalyst could be correlated
   with the presence of the photogenerated trapped electrons. In addition,
   lower amounts of CO adsorbed on Pt, compared to those observed in the
   dark reaction, were found for the UV-irradiated systems. It is proposed
   that CO and adsorbed intermediates, such as formate, can act as
   inhibitors in the photoreforming process and this is further supported
   by the observation that, before and after the regeneration process in
   O-2, the CO and surface adsorbed organic intermediate products are
   removed and the activity is recovered.}},

Abstract = {{The development of prosthetic foot components often incorporates
   mechanical characterization methods that simulate the loading conditions
   expected in activities of daily living. However, it is recognized that
   these conditions vary among users and the effect of user variability on
   mechanical testing results is not currently understood. The objective of
   this study was to statistically characterize the vertical ground
   reaction force (vGRF) waveform of prosthesis users to describe its
   variability in a population by: (1) Applying Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA) to measured waveforms in a cohort of trans-tibial
   subjects, and (2) Simulate an expected sample of waveforms for this
   population using a Monte Carlo method.
   Phase 1: Three prosthesis users walked on a level walkway at
   self-selected walking speeds under four prosthetic foot conditions. PCA
   performed on the vGRF waveforms for affected-limb footsteps resulted in
   three principal components (PCs) accounting for 91.5\% of data
   variability. Results showed low variability for the same subject using
   similar designs of prosthetic feet and distinct differences when using a
   familiar device.
   Phase 2: Monte Carlo simulation was used to predict a family of 30 vGRF
   waveforms representative of the sample population. Variability was
   highest in regions of weight acceptance, midstance, and push-off, while
   lower variability was observed in the transition regions prior to,
   between, and after these regions.
   Conclusion: The study supports the use of PCA to describe variability in
   vGRF waveforms of trans-tibial prosthesis users. The analysis is
   suitable for Monte Carlo simulation, which showed vGRF waveforms with
   distinct regions of high and low variability.}},

Abstract = {{Popularity of service-oriented computing makes more and more companies
   and organizations provide their services through Web Application Program
   Interfaces (Web APIs). The Web APIs are considered to offer a convenient
   way to integrate web services to client applications. However, the
   integration process is often challenging. For example, updated Web APIs
   may be no longer compatible with the current version of client
   applications, thus break the client applications. To help the
   integration process, it is of significant interest to understand the
   challenges that are encountered by client developers. Developer forums
   and Stack Overflow are commonly used by client developers to seek help
   from fellow peers. In this paper, we mine both developer forums and
   Stack Overflow to find the common challenges encountered by client
   developers. We perform an empirical study on 32 Web APIs with a total of
   92,471 discussions. To extract topics from all discussions, we apply a
   topic modeling technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The
   results show that on average five dominant topics can cover at least
   50\% of questions regarding each Web API. We further investigate how
   topics evolve across Web APIs, and find five patterns. As a summary, our
   findings highlight a list of dominant concerns and persistent concerns
   for each Web API that Web API providers should pay more attention to.}},

   Luby-Transform (LT) codes. The proposed overlapped LT (OLT) codes
   achieve significant gains in BER and/or code rate. They are highly
   energy-efficient, scalable, and robust. Our analysis shows in particular
   that by using OLT codes, we can modify the fountain degree distribution
   such that it does not contain degree-one packets starting from the
   second generation. Thus, we introduce new degree distributions to
   improve the performance of OLT codes; the new scheme is referred to as
   smart OLT (SOLT). Simulation results are provided to show the
   improvements of OLT and SOLT codes in AWGN channel in terms of error
   rate. For example, SOLT codes can achieve the same error performance as
   LT codes, but they require smaller transmission overhead, for instance,
   at SNR of 9 dB and error rate of 10(-5), SOLT codes require a code rate
   of 0.476 while LT codes require a code rate of 0.417.}},

Abstract = {{The conversion of sugars to furans has been gaining attention in recent
   years as a potential source of renewable chemical building blocks. This
   work considers the viability of CO2 as an acid catalyst for the
   conversion of carbohydrates to 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF). In
   addition, the effects of secondary solvents for the separation of the
   produced 5-HMF from the aqueous reaction mixtures are explored. The
   addition of salts as a means of phase separation to improve the 5-HMF
   yield was also investigated. The yield of 5-HMF for CO2-catalyzed
   glucose conversions was increased from 18\% to 64\% by varying the
   concentrations of sugar, salt and choice of secondary solvent. This
   method was also applied to starch, xylan, and cellulose, and was able to
   achieve 55\%, 51\% and 22\% respectively. This work shows that high
   yields of 5-HMF could be achieved through the use of CO2-catalyzed
   carbohydrate conversions.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission of information in nano-networks can be implemented by the
   emission and reception of molecules in diffusion-based molecular
   communications. Since the propagation environment is shared among
   multiple nodes, the molecules emitted by different transmitters cause
   inter-user interference (IUI). In this paper, we propose molecular code
   division multiple access (MCDMA) to overcome the IUI caused by
   transmitted signals from asynchronous users. Based on adopting on-off
   keying (OOK) modulation scheme in implementing molecular codes, we
   develop a chip detection scheme with an adaptable threshold to decide
   between ``on{''} and ``off{''} hypotheses, by counting the number of
   received molecules. To eliminate the inter-symbol interference (ISI)
   caused by residual molecules, the receiver is modified by exploiting
   previously detected chips. The performance evaluation of the proposed
   MCDMA system via computer simulations show that the symbol error rate
   (SER) of the receiver considering previously detected chip outperforms
   the memory-less receiver. Results indicate that the MCDMA system is a
   promising approach to reduce interference created by asynchronous users
   in multi-user molecular communications.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing penetration of wind generation impacts the reliability

   effect of PID controller parameters on the inertial response of a doubly

   control of a power system in the event of sudden power changes. The goal
   of this review is to extensively determine the effect of PID parameters
   to compare and set a benchmark so that an adaptive control strategy can
   be developed for frequency regulation. A conventional inertial
   controller algorithm using the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and
   frequency deviation loops was investigated whilst the contribution of
   the DFIG to system inertial response and frequency control are examined.
   The paper considers the influence of supplementary inertial control loop
   parameters on the inertial response and power system frequency. The
   results indicate that the DFIG inertial controller scheme is able to
   provide appropriate frequency support.}},

   propose using the Leap Motion controller as an alternative to using

   hand is needed to control each robot arm. We affixed two end effectors
   to a Baxter research robot, a standard electric gripper, and an AR10
   robotic hand. The standard electric gripper was controlled via pinch
   gestures and all five fingers and thumb were controlled on the AR10
   robotic hand using finger movement from the Leap. Some simple tests were
   performed and the results indicate that in lifting standard objects the
   standard electric gripper had a higher success rate. The main problem
   with the hand appeared to be due to the absence of any touch or force
   feedback to the operator, as the user became more comfortable with the
   system the better their performance became. This leads us to believe
   that the use of a robotic hand could be improved with a training
   program.}},

Abstract = {{Permanent magnet linear motors (PMLMs) are widely used in many high
   precision servo motion platforms, and lithography is a typical
   application. The reticle stage macro movement subsystem of a lithography
   machine is a 3-DOF coupling system in X-Y direction which requires
   carefully modelling and control to achieve high precision. This paper
   proposes a new modeling method for the 3-DOF PMLM driven coupling
   system. The modeling method considers the rotation angle of linear
   motors in X direction to solve the coupling problem and to achieve
   ultraprecision tracking performance with millimeter accuracy.
   Furthermore,
   a 3-DOF sliding mode controller is designed to control the proposed
   model. Finally, the effectiveness of this modeling and control strategy
   is demonstrated via S-curve tracking simulation, and both the
   performance of the master-slave with feedforward control structure and
   the main-main with feedforward control structure are compared. The
   simulation results show that the tracking errors of PMLMs both in X and
   Y directions are less than 3 mu m, and the rotation angle is less than
   25 mu rad.}},

Abstract = {{Yangtze River is the world's busiest inland waterway. Ships need to be
   guided when passing through controlled waterways based on their
   trajectory predictions. Inaccurate predicted trajectories lead to
   non-optimal traffic signalling which may cause significant traffic jam.
   For the existing intelligent traffic signalling systems (ITSSs), ships
   are supposed to travel exactly along the mid-line of the Yangtze River,
   which has caused many problems and issues. Over the last few years,
   traffic data have been growing exponentially, and we have gone into big
   data ear. This trend allows us to predict the ship travel trajectories
   using big historical data. In this paper, the historical trajectories
   are grouped by the popular K-Means clustering algorithm firstly, and
   then Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are built using the above
   clustering results and other known factors (i.e. ship speed, loading

Abstract = {{In-situ characterisation of thermocouple sensors is a challenging
   problem. Recently the authors presented a blind characterisation
   technique based on the cross-relation method of blind identification.
   The method allows in-situ identification of two thermocouple probes,
   each with a different dynamic response, using only sampled sensor
   measurement data. While the technique offers certain advantages over
   alternative methods, including low estimation variance and the ability
   to compensate for noise induced bias, the robustness of the method is
   limited by the multimodal nature of the cost function. In this paper, a
   normalisation term is proposed which improves the convexity of the cost
   function. Further, a normalisation and bias compensation hybrid approach
   is presented that exploits the advantages of both normalisation and bias
   compensation. It is found that the optimum of the hybrid cost function
   is less biased and more stable than when only normalisation is applied.
   All results were verified by simulation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the security issue is investigated for networked control
   systems (NCSs) where the physical plant is controlled by a remote

   measurement to remote control centre is vulnerable to attacks from
   malicious adversaries. Here, false data injection (FDI) attacks are
   considered. The aim is to find the so-called insecurity conditions under
   which the NCS is insecure in the sense that there exist FDI attacks that
   can bypass the anomaly detector but still destabilize the overall
   system. In particular, a new necessary and sufficient condition for the
   insecurity is derived when the communication channel is compromised by
   the adversary. Moreover, a specific algorithm is proposed with which the
   NCS is shown to be insecure. A simulation example is utilized to
   demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed conditions/algorithms in the

   Researches in this area are mainly devoted both to improved layouts and

   identification and validation are important preliminary steps. This
   paper focuses on the modelling of an electro-actuated solenoid,
   fast-acting valve, which is a key component of the VVT system. The valve
   is used to regulate the pressure that commands the lift of engine intake
   valves. An identification method is applied to represent the valve

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel technique for obstacle avoidance and target
   location using autonomous underwater vehicles. The proposed method uses
   the concept of bidirectional artificial potential fields in order to
   cooperatively avoid obstacles whilst travelling to a desired location. A
   fluid-like formation is presented whereby the vehicles are assigned a
   separation distance, which they adhere to when not in the process of
   obstacle avoidance. This distance is free of angular constraints, which
   allows a more flexible formation than traditional approaches. Although
   cooperative in nature, the proposed strategy allows all the vehicles to
   be independently guided by the overall potential field. This technique
   is useful even when other vehicles fail. Both clockwise and
   anticlockwise fields are simultaneously created around obstacles, and
   used by the vehicles to ensure cooperative avoidance around the
   obstacles. The proposed technique could be used for a number of
   applications such as mapping/exploration/surface inspection to name a
   few. Simulation results have been conducted for various scenarios and
   show the method to be effective.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops an integrated optimal power flow (OPF) tool for
   distribution networks in two spatial scales. In the local scale, the
   distribution network, the natural gas network, and the heat system are
   coordinated as a microgrid. In the urban scale, the impact of natural
   gas network is considered as constraints for the distribution network
   operation. The proposed approach incorporates unbalance three-phase
   electrical systems, natural gas systems, and combined cooling, heating,
   and power systems. The interactions among the above three energy systems
   are described by energy hub model combined with components capacity
   constraints. In order to efficiently accommodate the nonlinear
   constraint optimization problem, particle swarm optimization algorithm
   is employed to set the control variables in the OPF problem. Numerical
   studies indicate that by using the OPF method, the distribution network
   can be economically operated. Also, the tie-line power can be
   effectively managed.}},

Abstract = {{As a key and popular renewable energy, wind power penetration has
   increased significantly into the power system worldwide in recent years.
   In order to solve the stochastic nature of wind power and develop better
   dispatch plan, wind power forecasting is imperative before integrating
   it into the system. To achieve better forecasting accuracy, it is
   necessary to investigate the significance of temporal resolution for
   model based multi-step forecasting. In this paper, three models, namely
   Gaussian process (GP), temporally local Gaussian process (TLGP) and
   persistence are employed for short term wind power forecasting under two
   temporal forecasting resolutions, e.g. hourly and quarter-hourly. The
   methods are applied to the data collected from a wind farm located in
   Texas, USA. A key finding is that the hourly forecasting is more
   accurate and computationally efficient than the quarter-hour resolution.
   Another finding is that, to achieve the best forecasting performance
   regardless of the resolutions, the models need to use data of the same
   length of time period. However, a combination consideration should be
   taken regarding the minimum horizon required.}},

   show a low THD content in the input current and a fast control of power

   multi-directional multi-port converter is proposed to serve as the top
   layer. With the hierarchical architecture, the balanced energy transfer
   of the cells in different packs can be decoupled, which avoid the
   repeated charging and discharging during the balancing process. This is
   beneficial for lengthening the battery lifetime and increasing the
   State-of-Health (SOH). Moreover, the proposed architecture can lower the
   current rating of the balancing circuits, which helps decrease the
   required cost and improve the system efficiency. The experimental
   results verified the benefits of the proposed architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Multilevel converters are a popular solution for medium-voltage and
   high-power applications, including renewable energy conversion.
   Five-level active neutral-point-clamped converter (5L-ANPC) is one of
   the most advantageous topologies among five-level multilevel converters.
   A six-switch 5L-ANPC (6S-5L-ANPC) topology is proposed, which can
   achieve low-cost because several fast recovery diodes are employed to
   replace the body-diodes and active switches. However, the power branches
   including the diode can only provide active current path. Special
   modulation strategy is proposed to achieve reactive power operation. The
   simulation analysis shows the proposed 6S-5L-ANPC is suitable for unity
   power factor application such as photovoltaic (PV) application. A 500W
   single-phase inverter prototype is built to verify the validity and

   the power module constructed based on the inductor can achieve higher

   packaging solutions. Design of the inductor is demonstrated through the
   combination of analytical and simulation methods. An inductor prototype

Abstract = {{Power density of converters have been dramatically increased through the
   innovations of packaging and integration technologies. Meanwhile, it
   also imposes more challenges on the thermal performances. An integrated
   power module packaged with magnetic component is proposed to improve
   both electrical and thermal performances. This paper presents the
   thermal analysis of the proposed power module. The magnetic component
   acts as both the filter inductor in the converter and the package of the
   power module. Benefiting from this package technology, the inductor can
   be designed with a bigger winding of lower resistance, thus generating
   less heat. The magnetic material has better thermal conductivity than
   plastic material used in conventional plastic packaged power modules;
   therefore, the power module has better thermal performance. Simulation
   is executed to show thermal effect of winding configurations. A thermal
   evaluation board is built to compare thermal performances of the
   proposed power module and two other commercial products. The proposed
   power module has 11 degrees C lower than the other part with the same

Abstract = {{A passive impedance matching (PIM) concept is proposed for multi-phase

   positive resistors and negative resistors are distributed into these
   units accordingly. The equivalent virtual resistors are of variable
   value, which automatically adjust the DC gain in each unit to achieve
   load sharing. Three equivalents LLC resonant converters with virtual
   variable resistor are analyzed. The theoretical analysis result shows
   that the first and third types have good load current sharing
   performance. A 600W, 12V two-phase LLC converter prototype is built
   based on the first type. The prototype verified the feasibility and

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new half bridge (HB) LLC resonant converter with
   pulse width modulated (PWM) auxiliary switch (sLLC converter) for
   hold-up mode operation. The proposed sLLC converter works with
   synchronous rectifier (SR), which is suitable for low output voltage
   applications. The magnetizing inductor can be designed with large value
   to reduce the circulation loss. In the proposed sLLC converter, the
   auxiliary switch and diode branch will provide charging path for the
   resonant inductor. For nominal 400V input, sLLC achieves same
   performance as conventional LLC converter, and all the good features
   such as soft switching are naturally retained. For slight input voltage
   fluctuation, frequency modulation is used to regulate the output
   voltage. When the input voltage drops further, HB switches will operate
   at constant minimum frequency, and the auxiliary switch will operate in
   PWM mode to energize the resonant inductor with 400V bus directly during
   hold up period, thus the output voltage can be maintained at desired
   level. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed sLLC converter,
   operational principle and equivalent circuit will be carefully explained
   and analyzed in this paper. A 300W prototype is built for 250V-400V

Abstract = {{This study determined that both triethylamine hydrochloride (TEA center

   activity is especially noteworthy because it is a common by-product in

   trimethylene carbonate (TMC) catalyzed with TEA achieved monomer
   conversions ranging from 97\% in 6 h at 85 degrees C to 98\% in 1 h at
   110 degrees C and those catalyzed with TEA center dot HCl ranged from
   98\% in 12 h at 85 degrees C to 98\% in 1 h at 110 degrees C using a
   monomer : initiator : catalyst ratio of 50 : 1 : 0.1. By contrast, TMC
   polymerizations conducted with stannous octoate, a widely used catalyst,
   required at least twice as long to achieve the same monomer conversion
   (24 h at 85 degrees C and 2.5 h at 110 degrees C). Catalyst-free

   from both academia and industry. Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) can achieve
   better performance to recover low grade waste heat and an accurate ORC
   model is a key for the design of proper management and control strategy
   for ORC systems. In this paper, compact ARX and NARX models for ORC are
   built using a new identification method, namely Fast Recursive algorithm
   (FRA). Training and validation results on experimental data confirm that
   the developed compact ORC models can achieve good modelling accuracy and
   satisfactory generalization performance.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main safety requirements in the design of buildings is
   ensuring safe and appropriate fire endurance of the structures. To fill
   the knowledge gap on the fire resistance of fibre reinforced polymer
   (FRP) reinforced concrete members, comprehensive experimental and
   analytical studies are underway at Queen's University with collaboration
   from industry and the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). As a
   part of the program, two full-scale glass FRP (GFRP) reinforced concrete
   slabs were tested under exposure to the ASTM-E119 standard fire. The
   slabs were identical except that they were reinforced with different
   types of GFRP and tested to examine the adequacy of 40 mm of clear
   concrete cover. Currently, CSA-S806 allows a simplified method to design
   concrete slabs with FRP reinforcement and this results in a requirement
   for clear concrete cover of approximately 60 mm to achieve a 2 hour fire
   resistance rating. The test results showed that the slabs endured beyond
   3 hours of fire exposure while resisting a high level of sustained load
   that was higher than the expected service load.}},

Abstract = {{This study involved the evaluation of time-series relationships between
   chlorophyll-a (chl-a), dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH in three
   facultative wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) operated in series at
   a wastewater treatment plant in eastern Ontario, Canada. Since 2003, the
   WSP system has experienced high pH levels and excessive algae growth
   during the summer months. During the summer of 2013, chl-a, DO, pH,
   temperature, and daily solar radiation were monitored on an hourly basis
   for each WSP over a one-week period, with an additional two weeks
   conducted in WSP\#2 to provide a more robust data set. Time-series
   analyses, consisting of cross-correlation evaluations, were performed on
   the dataset to investigate the time-dependent dynamics between chl-a,
   DO, and pH. Strong statistical dependence between chl-a, DO, and pH was
   identified during periods of high photosynthetic activity and algae
   growth. WSP\#2 had the highest algae growth and the statistical
   relationships between chl-a and DO and chl-a and pH were the strongest,
   with maximum cross-correlation coefficients of 0.54 and 0.56 observed at
   lags of 20 and 16 hours for DO and pH, respectively. Strong diurnal
   patterns for DO and pH were observed in WSP\#1 and WSP\#4, and in WSP\#2
   during periods of reduced algae growth. During periods of excessive
   algae growth in WSP\#2, no clear DO and pH diurnal patterns were noted.
   In general, across all WSPs, daily DO concentration peaks led those of
   chl-a by an average of 43 minutes, which subsequently led those of pH by
   an average of 2 hours and 15 minutes.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years there has been growing interest in the use of microalgae
   as a feedstock for biofuels, particularly for biodiesel. The production
   process of biodiesel from microalgae generally consists of five
   different phases: cultivation, harvesting, drying, lipid extraction and
   transesterification. While existing technologies are available to
   undertake each of these phases, the process would benefit from enhanced
   sustainability achieved by reducing environmental impact and costs. One
   process innovation currently under consideration is the use of waste
   products as inputs to the process, including CO2 captured from
   industrial flue gas, or nutrients from wastewater. These could be
   employed in algae cultivation. The co-location of an algae cultivation
   plant with other industrial facilities, such as a cement plant or a
   wastewater treatment facility, could result in significantly reduced
   atmospheric emissions and improve wastewater effluent discharges. A
   comparative life cycle assessment approach is used to examine two
   different, realistic alternatives for the co-location of an algae
   cultivation plant with an existing cement plant or wastewater treatment
   facility near Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The study seeks to identify a
   preferred siting option from the perspective of minimizing environmental
   impacts. The first alternative involves the co-location with the Lafarge
   Cement plant, on the north shore of Lake Ontario, near Bath Ontario. The
   second alternative consists in the co-location with the Ravensview
   wastewater treatment facility east of the city of Kingston on the St.
   Lawrence River. The algae production plant is based on an open pond
   technology and is assumed to have a production capacity of about 120
   tons of dry microalgal biomass per year. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{In a team of multiple agents, the pursuance of a common goal is a
   defining characteristic. Since agents may have different capabilities,
   and effects of actions may be uncertain, a common goal can generally
   only be achieved through a careful cooperation between the different
   agents. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage planner that combines
   online planning at both team level and individual level through a
   subgoal delegation scheme. The proposal brings the advantages of online
   planning approaches to the multi-agent setting. A number of
   modifications are made to a classical UCT approximate algorithm to (i)
   adapt it to the application domains considered, (ii) reduce the
   branching factor in the underlying search process, and (iii) effectively
   manage uncertain information of action effects by using information
   fusion mechanisms. The proposed online multi-agent planner reduces the
   cost of planning and decreases the temporal cost of reaching a goal,
   while significantly increasing the chance of success of achieving the
   common goal.}},

Abstract = {{Automated assembly machines are designed to be operated round-the-clock
   to maintain high production rates. Continuous operation of an assembly
   machine results in wear of its various mechanisms that in turn lead to
   machine faults and subsequent machine downtime. The goal of this
   research project is to develop and validate a Machine Vision Inspection
   (MVI) system to detect and classify multiple faults using a single
   camera as a sensor. The results are experimental in nature, with an
   industrial O-ring assembly machine used for test purposes. The machine
   places O-rings on to continuously moving plastic carriers at a rate of
   over 100 assemblies per minute. The machine is controlled by a PLC with
   an HMI used to introduce the controlled faults such as transfer track
   jams, air knife jams, and hopper supply failures. Three MVI methods
   based on computer vision techniques are developed for this application:
   1) Gaussian Mixture Models with blob analysis, 2) optical flow and 3)
   running average. In order to provide a measure of performance that can
   be used to better differentiate relative performance, a novel Machine
   Vision Performance Index (MVPI) was developed. The MVPI is based on five
   measures of performance: accuracy, processing time, speed of response,
   robustness against noise, and ease of tuning. The MVPI for the three MVI
   methods is reported and the significance of the results is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Carrying load manually is a highly strenuous task and costs additional
   energy during walking. The forward velocity and vertical displacement of
   the body center of mass (COM) changes along with the inverted
   pendulum-like motion. Thus the interaction between the load and carrier
   varies as well. The interaction between load and carrier has a big
   influence on the comfort and energetics of the carrier. In this paper,
   we present the design of a novel carrying device where the load is
   connected to the frame with springs arranged in the fore-aft direction.
   This design is capable of changing the interaction pattern of
   load-carrier system. A simple mass-spring-damper model is proposed to
   characterize the motion of load and carrier in the forward direction.
   The motion pattern of the load can be predicted with the model, and it
   differs according to the selection of the stiffness of spring and load
   weight. Experimental method is presented to determine damping
   coefficient in the interaction model. The effect of stiffness of springs
   on gait kinetics is also analyzed with the model and examined with
   experiments. The stiffness selection is suggested to be able to make the
   natural frequency of the mass-spring-damper model lower than the walking
   frequency. In this case the interaction force can be reduced. The result
   also reveals that the ``touchdown{''} impact during walking can be
   weakened significantly with proper stiffness selection.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new power factor correction scheme for a three
   phase wind energy conversion systems (WECSs). The proposed scheme
   provides power factor correction (PFC) with respect to the back-EMF of a
   permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) instead of the terminal
   voltage. Since there exists a series impedance between the back-EMF and
   terminal voltage, performing PFC with respect to the terminal voltage
   leads to the additional reactive power generated by the back EMF. This
   additional reactive power degrades the capacity of the generator. In
   this paper, a novel three-phase reactive power control technique based
   on the one-cycle control scheme is presented in order to eliminate the
   need for additional reactive power. In the proposed technique, the
   terminal voltage and current of each phase are measured and the optimal
   power factor is regulated at the generator's terminals. The optimal
   reactive power is determined in the proposed control scheme by
   introducing a fictitious reactive current, derived from the input
   voltage, in the control law. The simulation and experimental results
   show the optimal performance of the proposed technique in terms of
   reactive power.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an Instantaneous Power Signal (IPS) has been used to
   extract amount of active/reactive power in real-time. Estimation of
   real-time power is challenging in single-phase systems due to the
   presence of double-frequency ripple in IPS. In conventional methods the
   low bandwidth filters are used to remove this ripple. In this paper the
   real-time power estimation is obtained first by presenting the problem
   in terms time dependent linear optimization and then solved by using a
   least square (LS) method. In order to tackle the drawbacks associated
   with the conventional methods based on dq rotating frames and grid
   synchronization algorithms, the proposed algorithm is modified to be
   recursive and windows type to reduce the computational time. It is
   mathematically shown that by adding one additional parameter the active
   and reactive power estimation can be made independent of the initial
   time value. Simulation and experimental results prove the superior
   performance of the proposed estimator in comparison with the
   conventional estimators and the other least square algorithms, such as
   Kalman filters and forgetting factor, in term of convergence time and
   the amount of undershoot/overshoot in estimation of active and reactive

Abstract = {{An isolated single-stage bi-directional AC-DC converter with no
   electrolytic capacitor for electric vehicle battery charger application
   is proposed. The topology utilizes a single-stage series resonant dual
   Half-bridge AC-DC converter to transfer the power and an active-shunt
   filter on the DC-side to absorb the 100/120Hz current ripple and prevent
   it from going to the battery. Diverting the low frequency ripple to the
   active filter prevents extra heat production in the battery and
   increases of the lifespan of the battery. Also film capacitors, instead
   of electrolytic capacitors with a lower lifetime, can be used on the
   DC-side filter. The reliability of the system is increased by not using
   an electrolytic capacitor in the circuit. To control the circuit for a
   wide range of power and power angle under soft switching, a four-part
   controller is proposed. The controller obtains ZVS for all the active
   switches while it optimizes the performance of the system in terms of
   conduction losses. ZVS operation of the circuit, enables the switching
   frequency to increase without increasing the switching losses. Increased
   switching frequency will result in smaller reactive components and
   smaller transformer size. The proposed controller obtains the best
   performance from the circuit. Simulation results with PSIM and
   experimental results to verify the theory have been carried out.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an improved Pulsed Density Modulation (PDM) method for
   high frequency converters such as push/pull Class E DC-DC or quasi
   resonant boost converters is proposed. Conventional PDM control provides
   high efficiency at any load when modulation frequency is low. However,
   the efficiency drops significantly at higher modulation frequencies due
   to hard-switching during transients. The proposed method not only
   reduces the transient power loss of the converter, but also decreases
   the voltage stress of the switches. Startup behavior of a class E
   push-pull converter is analyzed. Soft switching conditions and the
   switches' peak voltages are studied as a function of the first switching
   cycle. In each power pulse, the first cycle timing of the converter is
   calculated to minimize the voltage overshoot and switching loss of the
   converter. A 1 kW, 3 MHz push-pull Class-E inverter with Class-DE
   rectifier is implemented to verify the analysis and simulation results.
   A maximum efficiency of 93 percent is obtained. Further, the efficiency
   drops only 2 percent at one tenth of the load. In addition, about 1/5
   reduction in the switches' peak voltage is obtained as compared to the
   conventional PDM method.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources into modern
   power system especially in a microgrid form, power inverters are
   commonly employed as the interface to the utility grid. LCL-filters are
   commonly used in interfacing inverters, in order to reduce the harmonics
   around the switching frequency and its multiples. However, unlike the
   single gridconnected inverter system where the resonance frequency is
   mainly fixed by the inverter output LCL filter parameters, the
   parallel-inverter-based grid-interactive power system presents a more
   challenging picture where inverter interactions will excite complex
   resonances at various frequencies. In this paper, an adaptive optimal
   feedback control is proposed to address system uncertain multi-resonance
   problem in the parallel-connected inverter system with LCL filters. The
   proposed adaptive control will force the inverter by modifying
   state-feedback optimal control law adaptively to follow the desired
   system response, thus significantly improve the grid current quality
   under various grid conditions. Experimental results have verified the
   performance of the proposed adaptive control.}},

Abstract = {{Localization of the distributed sources is not free of challenges and
   there are many concerns regarding microgrids control systems and their
   reliable operation. Microgrids could operate in both stand-alone and
   grid-connected modes of operation. Their control systems must maintain
   voltages at the rated frequency, while they ensure power sharing among
   units along with providing synchronization requirements for a smooth
   transition between modes of operation. In this paper a control system is
   proposed consisting of a power signal processor synchronizer based on an
   Adaptive Notch Filter (ANF). The proposed PLL-less control system is
   modeled in Simulink/MATLAB and is examined on an islanded microgrid in
   abnormal circumstances such as in fixing voltages and frequencies when
   balanced and specially unbalanced loads are connected to the system and
   also during transitioning of the microgrid to the grid-connected mode.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the secrecy performance of dual-hop
   amplify-and-forward (AF) multi-antenna relaying systems over Rayleigh
   fading channels by taking into account the direct link between the
   source and destination. To improve the secrecy performance, two linear
   processing schemes at relay and maximal ratio combining (MRC) at
   destination are proposed, namely, Zero-forcing/MRC (ZF/MRC) and Maximal
   ratio transmission/MRC (MRT/MRC). For these schemes, we present new
   tight analytical expressions of the secrecy outage probability. In
   addition, we examine the performance in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   regimes, and present simple secrecy outage approximations for all
   schemes. The results reveal that: 1) The MRT/MRC scheme achieves a full
   diversity order of M + 1, while the ZF/MRC scheme achieves a diversity
   order of M, where M is the number of antennas at relay. 2) The ZF/MRC
   scheme outperforms the MRT/MRC scheme in the low SNR regime, while
   becomes inferior to the MRT/MRC scheme in the high SNR regime.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the achievable spectral efficiency (SE) of
   millimeter wave downlink cellular systems accounting for both small and
   large-scale fading effects. The base station (BS) employs a uniform
   linear array (ULA) and maximal ratio transmission. We derive the
   expectation of the squared inner product for different channel links
   under the assumption that the users are randomly distributed within a
   circular-shaped cell. Using this result, a new lower bound on the
   achievable SE, valid for arbitrary numbers of antennas is derived. The
   analytical results show that the achievable SE increases with the number
   of BS antennas, whilst it converges to a saturated value in the high
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and larger inter-antenna spacing.}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{5}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a simple, scalar model for predicting a nonlinear
   shear stress response of a viscoelastic fluid in Large Amplitude
   Oscillatory Shear (LAOS) experiments. The model is constructed by
   replacing the viscosity in the well-known Maxwell model by a shear rate
   dependent viscosity function. By assuming the empirical Cox-Merz rule to
   be valid, this shear rate dependent viscosity function is specified
   based on the Maxwell expression for the complex viscosity. We thus
   construct a particular case of the White-Metzner constitutive equation.
   Numerical solutions as well as an asymptotic analytical solution of the
   model are presented. The results, analyzed for higher harmonic content
   by Fourier transform, are compared to experimental data of a
   viscoelastic solution of wormlike micelles based on
   cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Good agreement is found for low
   frequencies, where viscous properties dominate.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this research was to study the impact that different mineral
   powders have on the properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) in
   order to obtain relations that make it possible to optimize their
   dosages for being used in precast concrete applications. Different
   combinations and contents of cement, mineral additions (active and
   inert), superplasticizers, and aggregates are considered. A new approach
   for determining the saturation point of superplasticizers is introduced.
   The fresh state performance was assessed by means of the following
   tests: slump flow, V-funnel, and J-ring. Concrete compressive strength
   values at different ages up to 56 days have been retained as
   representative of the materials' performance in its hardened state. All
   these properties have been correlated with SCC proportioning. As a
   result, a number of recommendations for the precast concrete industry
   arise to design more stable SCC mixes with a reduced carbon footprint.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the tracking performance of global positioning system
   receivers, we have proposed a carrier loop structure based on a
   high-order Doppler parameter detection algorithm. Applied when the input
   of the tracking loop is the carrier signal, this solution begins by
   establishing a relationship between the first and second order rate of
   change of the Doppler frequency shift and the output of the
   discriminator, after which the Doppler frequency shift can be estimated.
   Following this, we used the combined frequency-lock loop and phase-lock
   loop methods to build a carrier loop structure for the high-order
   Doppler parameter detection algorithm. Our results showed that the
   proposed carrier loop structure performs well in high-dynamic conditions
   compared with other carrier loop structures. Accordingly, the structure
   provides an improved design for the tracking module of satellite

Abstract = {{The problem of detecting a change in distribution of a sequence of
   independent and identically distributed (IID) random variables is
   addressed. Unlike previous approaches to sequential change detection,
   which assume a known initial probability density function (PDF) for the
   sequence, in this paper we address the case where the initial
   distribution of the sequence is unknown. An optimal stopping approach
   based on Bayesian hypothesis testing with exponential delay cost is
   proposed. The tradeoffs among average detection delay, probability of
   false alarm and probability of detecting a change in the incorrect
   direction are investigated. It is shown that the proposed test's
   probability of change detection in the incorrect direction can be made
   arbitrarily small without significantly increasing average detection
   delay for change times larger than a minimum value determined by the
   hypothesis testing problem itself. The proposed test also has a
   recursive algorithm to track the minimum risk hypotheses with fixed
   complexity per sample. Simulation results confirm the derived properties
   and reveal that the average delay, after an initial transient period,
   approaches that of the CUSUM test, which is delay-optimal if the initial
   state were known.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new selective multi-carrier index keying in orthogonal

   modulate both a small subset of sub-carriers and their indices.
   Particularly, we investigate the performance enhancement in two cases of
   error propagation sensitive and compromised device-to-device (D2D)
   communications. For the performance evaluation, we focus on analyzing
   the error propagation probability (EPP) introducing the exact and upper
   bound expressions on the detection error probability, in the presence of
   both imperfect and perfect detection of active multi-carrier indices.
   The average EPP results in closed-form are generalized for various
   fading distribution using the moment generating function, and our
   numerical results clearly show that the proposed approach is desirable
   for reliable and energy-efficient D2D applications.}},

   first-year engineering course. Minor refinements were made, and the TLO
   (version two) was retested with second-year undergraduates. The TLO is
   designed to engage students in meta-cognitive processes and provide
   meaningful feedback to students. The dimensions are outcome motivation,
   learning belief, self-efficacy, transfer and organisation. Results from
   the second-year group were more consistent and reliable than the
   first-year group, suggesting that context is an important factor. The
   scales demonstrate acceptable reliability, and the moderate correlations
   between scale scores and rubric ratings provide support for concurrent
   validity. We recommend the TLO be tested with broader populations to
   confirm psychometric properties and that it be implemented
   longitudinally to investigate the development of learning skills and
   changes in orientations over time.}},

Title = {{A novel methodology for assessing the environmental sustainability of
   ionic liquids used for CO2 capture}},
Journal = {{FARADAY DISCUSSIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{192}},
Pages = {{283-301}},
Abstract = {{Ionic liquids ( ILs) have been proposed as suitable sorbents for CO2
   capture because of their high CO2 absorption capacity, thermal
   stability, negligible vapour pressure and physicochemical tunability.
   However, the environmental implications of ILs are currently largely
   unknown because of a lack of data. The issue is further complicated by
   their complex chemical structures and numerous precursors for which
   environmental data are scarce or non-existent. In an attempt to address
   this issue, this paper presents a new methodology for estimating life
   cycle environmental impacts of novel ILs, with the aim of aiding
   synthesis and selection of more sustainable CO2 sorbents. The
   methodology consists of four main steps: ( 1) selection of an
   appropriate IL and synthesis route; ( 2) construction of a life cycle
   tree; ( 3) life cycle assessment; and ( 4) recommendations for
   improvements. The application of the methodology is illustrated using
   trihexyltetradecylphosphonium 1,2,4-triazolide ({[} P-66614] {[}
   124Triz]), a promising IL for CO2 capture currently under development.
   Following the above steps, the paper demonstrates how the data obtained
   from laboratory synthesis of the IL can be scaled up to industrial
   production to estimate life cycle impacts and identify environmental
   hotspots. In this particular case, the main hotspots are the precursors
   used in the synthesis of the IL. Comparison of impacts with
   monoethanolamine ( MEA), currently the most widely-used CO2 sorbent,
   suggests that {[} P-66614]{[}124Triz] has much higher impacts than MEA,
   including global warming potential. However, human toxicity potential is
   significantly higher for MEA. Therefore, the proposed methodology can be
   used to optimise the design of ILs and to guide selection of more
   sustainable CO2 sorbents. Although the focus is on ILs, the methodology
   is generic and can be applied to other chemicals under development.}},

Title = {{RFID impacts on barriers affecting lean manufacturing}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT \& DATA SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1585-1616}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Lean manufacturing is one of the leading paradigms for fast
   and proficient manufacturing but its proper implementation is a foremost
   task due to certain barriers affecting lean and can be handled when
   utilized with RFID technology. With this aspect in view, the purpose of
   this paper is to enlighten and present a thorough literature study that
   can show how RFID-based lean manufacturing is helpful for handling
   barriers affecting lean manufacturing in light of previous literature
   available.
   Design/methodology/approach - In order to achieve this purpose a
   systematic literature review is conducted to justify the impacts of RFID
   technology for handling barriers. The aim of this systematic literature
   review is to initially find the barriers affecting lean implementation
   and then to explain the properties of RFID-based lean manufacturing
   which are highly feasible to handle detected barriers.
   Findings - An interrelation is generated in this study which provides a
   clear indication that the properties of RFID carry significant effects
   to handle detected barriers in the operational, managerial and financial
   regime of manufacturing companies. The detected barriers that affect
   lean implementation are company's cultures, top management commitment,
   poor employee administration, lack of finances, unbalanced inventory
   control, unstable customer handling and longer lead times. The
   properties of RFID-based lean manufacturing like operational visibility,
   inventory control, production control, minimized lead times and the
   real-time data information (to facilitate top management and employees
   on shop floor) are extremely helpful to control these barriers.
   Originality/value - The originality of this study is the provision of
   clarity provided to both academicians and practitioners by citing and
   utilizing previous research studies which undoubtedly indicates positive
   impacts of RFID on lean implementation.}},

Abstract = {{To minimize the side effects and the multidrug resistance (MDR) arising
   from daunorubicin (DNR) treatment of malignant lymphoma, a chemotherapy
   formulation of cysteamine-modified cadmium tellurium (Cys-CdTe) quantum
   dots coloaded with DNR and gambogic acid (GA) nanoparticles
   (DNR-GA-Cys-CdTe NPs) was developed. The physical property, drug-loading
   efficiency and drug release behavior of these DNR-GA-Cys-CdTe NPs were
   evaluated, and their cytotoxicity was explored by
   3-{[}4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.
   These DNR-GA-Cys-CdTe NPs possessed a pH-responsive behavior, and
   displayed a dose-dependent antiproliferative activity on
   multidrug-resistant lymphoma Raji/DNR cells. The accumulation of DNR
   inside the cells, revealed by flow cytometry assay, and the
   down-regulated expression of P-glycoprotein inside the Raji/DNR cells
   measured by Western blotting assay indicated that these DNR-GA-Cys-CdTe
   NPs could minimize the MDR of Raji/DNR cells. This multidrug delivery
   system would be a promising strategy for minimizing MDR against the

Abstract = {{This study looks into the effect of polypropylene (PP) macrofibers on
   the flexural response of self-consolidating fiber-reinforced concrete
   (SCFRC). PP fibers with a length of 38 mm dosed at 8 kg/m(3) were
   incorporated in different mixes in order to produce prismatic specimens
   and test them in flexure. The total binder content was maintained at 450
   kg/m3 in all cases, and the percentage of ground granulated
   blast-furnace slag (GGBS) was varied between 25\% and 50\%. The
   water-to-binder ratio (w/b) was varied between 0.40 and 0.45. The
   compressive strength and the residual flexural strength were evaluated
   at the age of 56 days. The experimental results from these tests were
   related to w/b and GGBS content. Predictive equations and response
   surfaces were obtained for the residual flexural strength parameters by
   means of multiple linear regression. It was shown that there is a
   statistically significant synergy between GGBS content and w/b that
   affects the variability of residual load-bearing capacity of SCFRC in
   flexure.}},

Abstract = {{Localization is one of the key technologies in wireless sensor networks
   (WSNs), since it provides fundamental support for many location-aware
   protocols and applications. Constraints on cost and power consumption
   make it infeasible to equip each sensor node in the network with a
   global position system (GPS) unit, especially for large-scale WSNs. A
   promising method to localize unknown nodes is to use mobile anchor nodes
   (MANs), which are equipped with GPS units moving among unknown nodes and
   periodically broadcasting their current locations to help nearby unknown
   nodes with localization. A considerable body of research has addressed
   the mobile anchor node assisted localization (MANAL) problem. However,
   to the best of our knowledge, no updated surveys on MAAL reflecting
   recent advances in the field have been presented in the past few years.
   This survey presents a review of the most successful MANAL algorithms,
   focusing on the achievements made in the past decade, and aims to become
   a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in
   MANAL research field. In addition, we seek to present a comprehensive
   review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the
   most interesting and successful advances in this research field.}},

Title = {{Essential scientific mapping of the value chain of thermochemically
   converted second-generation bio-fuels}},
Journal = {{GREEN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{5086-5117}},
Abstract = {{As the largest contributor to renewable energy, biomass (especially
   lignocellulosic biomass) has significant potential to address
   atmospheric emission and energy shortage issues. The bio-fuels derived
   from lignocellulosic biomass are popularly referred to as
   second-generation bio-fuels. To date, several thermochemical conversion
   pathways for the production of second-generation bio-fuels have shown
   commercial promise; however, most of these remain at various
   pre-commercial stages. In view of their imminent commercialization, it
   is important to conduct a profound and comprehensive comparison of these
   production techniques. Accordingly, the scope of this review is to fill
   this essential knowledge gap by mapping the entire value chain of
   second-generation bio-fuels from technical, economic, and environmental
   perspectives. This value chain covers (i) the thermochemical
   technologies used to convert solid biomass feedstock into
   easier-to-handle intermediates, such as bio-oil, syngas, methanol, and
   Fischer-Tropsch fuel; and (ii) the upgrading technologies used to
   convert intermediates into end products, including diesel, gasoline,
   renewable jet fuels, hydrogen, char, olefins, and oxygenated compounds.
   This review also provides an economic and commercial assessment of these
   technologies, with the aim of identifying the most adaptable technology
   for the production of bio-fuels, fuel additives, and bio-chemicals. A
   detailed mapping of the carbon footprints of the various thermochemical
   routes to second-generation bio-fuels is also carried out. The review
   concludes by identifying key challenges and future trends for
   second-generation petroleum substitute bio-fuels.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that the passage of a shock wave in a moist atmosphere can
   produce a condensation cloud that is briefly visible to the human eye.
   Recent accidents (e.g. Toronto August 2008) involving boiling liquid
   expanding vapour explosions (BLEVE) and vapour cloud explosions (VCE)
   have shown such condensation clouds.
   In this age where video footage of an explosion incident is the norm
   (i.e. from the smart phone of a remote observer, or from a security
   video camera) it is very likely that there will be visual evidence of
   explosions. This evidence may include the size of a condensation cloud
   from a shock wave. This paper presents an analysis that allows us to
   estimate the overpressure of the shock wave at the edge of this
   condensation cloud. In many cases we can also determine the distance to
   this shock overpressure from the video image. With this overpressure and
   distance data it is possible to estimate the energy of the explosion and
   the overpressure and expected damage at other distances. This could be
   very useful for accident analysis. Limited video footage of BLEVE tests
   is used to provide and limited validation the method.}},

Abstract = {{Full engulfment fire tests have been conducted on total containment
   pressure vessels filled to 50\% and 98 \% capacity with water. The tests
   included an unprotected tank and tanks with two different levels of
   thermal protection. Total containment in this context means there was no
   pressure relief device.
   The tests were conducted with 1/3rd linear scale rail tank cars similar
   to the DOT 111 tank cars used in North America. The 2.4 m(3) model tanks
   were subjected to 100 \% engulfing fires fuelled by liquid propane. The
   fire heat flux was approximately 80 \% by radiation and 20 \% by
   convection with a total heat flux to a cool surface of approximately 100
   kW/m(2).
   The tanks were instrumented with wall and lading thermocouples and
   pressure transducers. The fire conditions were measured using
   directional flame thermometers (DFT). In these tests the tank pressure
   increased rapidly suggesting strong liquid temperature stratification.
   Even at high fill levels of 98 \% the tank wall temperature in the
   vapour space increased rapidly to dangerous levels. The results from
   these tests will be used to validate computer models of the tank heating
   process.}},

Abstract = {{There is a need to have a better understanding of the near field blast
   and impulse from boiling liquid expanding vapour explosions. Emergency
   responders and response planners need to know the ground loading on a
   bridge if there is a tank truck BLEVE, or the loading on a building if a
   tank truck suffers a BLEVE near a high rise building.
   When a tank suffers a BLEVE the vessel opens fully to release the
   contained energy. The release is strongly directional since the tank
   wall does not move away instantaneously. The piston effect of the
   expanding vapour generates a shock at some distance away from the tank.
   This shock then propagates into the surroundings. Behind this shock is
   an additional blast wind caused by liquid flashing. This may also
   produce a shock. When the tank opens fully and is flattened on the
   ground this produces a large impulse load. Long range projectiles are
   also possible.
   Experiments have been conducted using 50 mm diameter tubes filled with
   water or propane. These tubes have been heated until failure to produce
   a BLEVE release. The tube failure mode and kinematics was representative
   of pressure vessel failures. The tube supports contained load cells to
   measure the ground force. Pencil blast gages were located close to tube
   to measure overpressures. High speed shadowgraph imaging was used to
   capture the formation and movement of the shocks.
   The results include detailed data on near field blast and ground loading
   effects from a boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical model developed to predict the response
   of partially composite load bearing concrete sandwich panels under axial
   loads applied to the structural wythe at any eccentricity. The model
   accounts for material nonlinearity, second-order effects, and cracking
   of concrete and plasticity of steel reinforcement, and can also model
   fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) connectors. The analysis uses a bond-slip
   model to simulate partial composite action between the two wythes
   resulting from various configurations of insulation and shear
   connectors. A variety of failure modes can be detected, including
   concrete crushing, flexural yielding, connectors yielding, pullout or
   rupture, and stability failures. Progressive failure of connectors is
   also modeled. The degree of composite action (u) can be calculated for a
   given design. The model was verified against experimental data and used
   to conduct a comprehensive parametric study. It was shown that u
   increases with panel length. Connectors' diameter and spacing greatly
   affect u and give similar gains in strength and stiffness at the same
   connector's reinforcement ratio (v). Connectors inserted at an angle are
   considerably stronger than those inserted normal to panel face. The
   insulation bond alone provides a 31\% u without any connectors, but this
   contribution decreases as v increases.}},

Abstract = {{Variations are inherent in all manufacturing processes and can
   significantly affect the quality of a final assembly, particularly in
   multistage assembly systems. Existing research in variation management
   has primarily focused on incorporating GD\&T factors into variation
   propagation models in order to predict product quality and allocate
   tolerances. However, process induced variation, which has a key
   influence on process planning, has not been fully studied. Furthermore,
   the link between variation and cost has not been well established, in
   particular the effect that assembly process selection has on the final
   quality and cost of a product. To overcome these barriers, this paper
   proposes a novel method utilizing process capabilities to establish the
   relationship between variation and cost. The methodology is discussed
   using a real industrial case study. The benefits include determining the
   optimum configuration of an assembly system and facilitating rapid
   introduction of novel assembly techniques to achieve a competitive edge.}},

Abstract = {{The European Union continues to exert a large influence on the direction
   of member states energy policy. The 2020 targets for renewable energy
   integration have had significant impact on the operation of current
   power systems, forcing a rapid change from fossil fuel dominated systems
   to those with high levels of renewable power. Additionally, the
   overarching aim of an internal energy market throughout Europe has and
   will continue to place importance on multi-jurisdictional co-operation
   regarding energy supply. Combining these renewable energy and
   multi-jurisdictional supply goals results in a complicated multi-vector
   energy system, where the understanding of interactions between fossil
   fuels, renewable energy, interconnection and economic power system
   operation is increasingly important. This paper provides a novel and
   systematic methodology to fully understand the changing dynamics of
   interconnected energy systems from a gas and power perspective. A fully
   realistic unit commitment and economic dispatch model of the 2030 power
   systems in Great Britain and Ireland, combined with a representative gas

Abstract = {{Web services play a major role in electronic businesses and allow
   organizations to perform certain business activities in a distributed
   fashion. In some circumstances, a single service is not able to perform
   certain tasks and it becomes imperative to compose two or more services
   in order to complete a task. While approaches to tackle such a problem
   are known, the task of generating provably correct Web service
   compositions still remain challenging and complex. In this paper, we
   develop a supervisory control framework for automated composition of Web
   services. Labelled Transition Systems augmented with guards and data
   variables are used to represent a given set of Web service
   specifications. We model the interactions of services asynchronously and
   we use guards and data variables to allow us to express certain
   preconditions which are then propagated from the system requirements
   through the overall composite service. The objective of our framework is
   to synthesize a controller, which interacts with a given set of Web
   services through messages to guarantee that a given specification is
   satisfied. A key novelty of this work is the application of control
   theory to service-oriented computing and the incorporation of run-time
   input into the supervisor generation process.}},

   to be more accurate and physically consistent than the Kelvin-Voigt
   model for deformable environments such as soft tissues. In this paper, a
   novel real-time identification method is presented in which a linearly
   parameterized polynomial approximation is used to indirectly identify
   the HC model. Simulation results show that ``Polynomial
   Identification{''} excels in highly damped environments, which presented
   a challenge in previous methods. The method is also shown to be less
   sensitive to estimation parameters and more robust during intermittent
   contact.}},

Abstract = {{Absolute stability of teleoperation systems is analyzed based on linear
   models of such systems. These models are prone to dynamic and parametric
   uncertainties, which may result in a false robust stability outcome. In
   this paper, we propose an experimental methodology for the analysis of
   absolute stability of master-slave teleoperation systems. Using the
   properties of Mobius transformation, the methodology uses the force and
   position data collected from the three experiments locked-slave,
   mass-carrying slave, and free motion, to determine whether the passivity
   unit disk of the load mapped to the master side is within the passivity
   unit disk. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology,
   numerical and experimental results for a force-position bilateral
   control architecture under constant time delays are provided.}},

Abstract = {{The main limitation of perturbation based extremum seeking methods is
   the requirement of a multiple time-scale separation between the system
   dynamics, the perturbation frequency, and the adaptation rate so as to
   avoid interactions and possible instabilities. This causes the
   convergence to he extremely slow. In the present work, we propose a
   simple modification to the perturbation-based extremum seeking control
   method that can be used when the system cannot be accurately
   approximated by a Wiener-Hammerstein model for which convergence rate
   acceleration schemes are available. The linear filtering used in the
   perturbation based extremum seeking control for estimating the objective
   function gradient is replaced by a recursive least square with
   forgetting factor estimation algorithm. It is shown that this simple
   modification can accelerate convergence to the optimum by removing one
   time scale separation. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of

Abstract = {{Rivers are major conduits for the transport of allochthonous dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) to the ocean in coupled land-coastal systems. DOM
   can regulate biogeochemical processes and affect water quality,
   depending on the concentration and quality of DOM. By using spectral
   parameters calculated from chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM)
   ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra, along with dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) concentrations, we examined the input and change in the
   amount and quality of DOM in surface waters of the lower Neuse River and
   upper-middle regions of the Neuse Estuary following a major rainfall (30
   cm in 1 day) associated with Hurricane Irene (2011). CDOM and DOC nearly
   tripled in the 3 days following the storm. Although a strong linear
   relationship was observed between DOC and CDOM absorption coefficient at
   350 nm (R-2 = 0.85), a higher fraction of non-chromophoric DOC to CDOM
   was observed during the rising river discharge. The spectral slope at
   275-295 nm and the slope ratio (275-295 : 350-400 nm) indicated a shift
   from higher to lower molecular-weight DOM as it transited through the
   estuary, probably as a result of photodegradation. The present study
   demonstrated the utility of using CDOM spectral parameters for examining
   the flux and transformation of DOM in coastal waters following major
   rain events.}},

Abstract = {{Reliability has emerged as a critical design constraint especially in
   memories. Designers are going to great lengths to guarantee fault free
   operation of the underlying silicon by adopting redundancy-based
   techniques, which essentially try to detect and correct every single
   error. However, such techniques come at a cost of large area, power and
   performance overheads which making many researchers to doubt their
   efficiency especially for error resilient systems where 100\% accuracy
   is not always required. In this paper, we present an alternative method
   focusing on the confinement of the resulting output error induced by any
   reliability issues. By focusing on memory faults, rather than correcting
   every single error the proposed method exploits the statistical
   characteristics of any target application and replaces any erroneous
   data with the best available estimate of that data. To realize the
   proposed method a RISC processor is augmented with custom instructions
   and special-purpose functional units. We apply the method on the
   proposed enhanced processor by studying the statistical characteristics
   of the various algorithms involved in a popular multimedia application.
   Our experimental results show that in contrast to state-of-the-art fault
   tolerance approaches, we are able to reduce runtime and area overhead by
   71.3\% and 83.3\% respectively.}},

   to accelerate existing algorithms to cluster large-scale datasets which
   contain large numbers of attributes, items, and clusters. Our framework
   makes use of locality sensitive hashing to significantly reduce the
   cluster search space. We also theoretically prove that our framework has
   a guaranteed error bound in terms of the clustering quality. This
   framework can be applied to a set of centroid-based clustering
   algorithms that assign an object to the most similar cluster, and we
   adopt the popular K-Modes categorical clustering algorithm to present
   how the framework can be applied. We validated our framework with five
   synthetic datasets and a real world Yahoo! Answers dataset. The
   experimental results demonstrate that our framework is able to speed up
   the existing clustering algorithm between factors of 2 and 6, while
   maintaining comparable cluster purity.}},

Volume = {{141}},

Pages = {{5152-5158}},
Abstract = {{Highly swellable polymer films doped with Ag nanoparticle aggregates
   (poly-SERS films) have been used to record very high signal : noise
   ratio, reproducible surface-enhanced (resonance) Raman (SER(R)S) spectra
   of in situ dried ink lines and their constituent dyes using both 633 and
   785 nm excitation. These allowed the chemical origins of differences in
   the SERRS spectra of different inks to be determined. Initial
   investigation of pure samples of the 10 most common blue dyes showed
   that the dyes which had very similar chemical structures such as Patent
   Blue V and Patent Blue VF (which differ only by a single OH group) gave
   SERRS spectra in which the only indications that the dye structure had
   been changed were small differences in peak positions or relative
   intensities of the bands. SERRS studies of 13 gel pen inks were
   consistent with this observation. In some cases inks from different
   types of pens could be distinguished even though they were dominated by
   a single dye such as Victoria Blue B (Zebra Surari) or Victoria Blue BO
   (Pilot Acroball) because their predominant dye did not appear in other
   inks. Conversely, identical spectra were also recorded from different
   types of pens (Pilot G7, Zebra Z-grip) because they all had the same
   dominant Brilliant Blue G dye. Finally, some of the inks contained
   mixtures of dyes which could be separated by TLC and removed from the
   plate before being analysed with the same poly-SERS films. For example,
   the Pentel EnerGel ink pen was found to give TLC spots corresponding to
   Erioglaucine and Brilliant Blue G. Overall, this study has shown that
   the spectral differences between different inks which are based on
   chemically similar, but nonetheless distinct dyes, are extremely small,
   so very close matches between SERRS spectra are required for confident
   identification. Poly-SERS substrates can routinely provide the very
   stringent reproducibility and sensitivity levels required. This, coupled
   with the awareness of the reasons underlying the observed differences
   between similarly coloured inks allows a more confident assessment of
   the evidential value of inks SERS and should underpin adoption of this
   approach as a routine method for the forensic examination of inks.}},

Abstract = {{Increased technological advances, coupled with new learners' needs, have
   created new realities for higher education contexts. This study explored
   and mapped trends in pedagogical approaches and learning technologies in
   postsecondary education and identified how these innovations are

   particularly for the Canadian Armed Forces education system. A
   qualitative research methodology was employed including a comprehensive
   review of Canadian and international literature, an environmental scan
   of Canadian Armed Forces educational institutions, and consultations
   with experts and practitioners in the field of military education. The
   research findings shed light on trends in pedagogies and learning
   technologies in higher education as well as on the presence of these
   trends in the military educational system. In addition, the findings
   consider the necessity for a corresponding level of preparedness to meet
   the needs of diverse learners in the future. This study informs both the

Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{847-869}},
Abstract = {{We performed large-eddy simulations (LES) of forced impinging jets over
   smooth and rough surfaces, containing large-scale, azimuthal vortices
   generated by the enhanced primary instability in the jet shear layer.
   The interaction between these vortices and the turbulence in the wall
   jet that is formed downstream of the impingement region determines their
   rate of decay. To explore the surface-roughness effects on the evolution
   of the vortices, sand-grain-like surfaces are generated using uniformly
   distributed but randomly oriented ellipsoids. The flow is compared to
   our previous LES of jets impinging on a smooth surface. In spite of the
   severe modification caused by the roughness on the near-wall flow, the
   vortex development is not significantly altered. Slightly faster decay
   of the primary vortices is observed in the rough-wall case compared to
   the smooth-wall one; the secondary vortex that detaches from the wall
   and is lifted up has larger vorticity. The highly disturbed near-wall
   flow is advected outward and affects the evolution of the primary vortex
   for a longer period during the vortex interaction. The robust turbulent
   generation mechanism in the outer shear layer, however, mitigates the
   changes in vortex behaviour. The momentum deficit and the enhancement of
   turbulence due to the surface roughness play a key role during this
   process.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Tracked power-tools are routinely used in computer-assisted
   intervention and surgical systems. In order to properly perform temporal
   and spatial monitoring of the tracked tool with the navigation system,
   it is important to know when the tool, such as an electrosurgical
   cauterizer, is being activated during surgery. We have developed a
   general purpose current sensor that can be augmented to tracked surgical
   devices in order to inform the surgeon and the navigation system when
   the tool is activated. METHODS: Two non-invasive AC current sensors, two
   peak detector circuits, one voltage comparator circuit, and a
   microcontroller were used to detect when an electrosurgical cauterizer
   is being powered on and differentiate between the cut and coagulation
   modes. The system was tested by cauterizing various substances at varied
   power ratings. RESULTS: By comparing the ratio of amplitudes as well as
   the frequencies of the signals, the current sensing system is able to
   differentiate between on/off, cut/coagulation, as well as when
   cauterizer tissue. DISCUSSION: The current sensing system is able to
   detect when the cauterizer is being powered on and can differentiate
   between monopolar cut and coagulation modes. CONCLUSION: This system
   shows promise for detecting when the cauterizer is being powered on and
   in the future could be integrated with a navigation system in order to
   easily temporally monitor the electrosurgical tool.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: When using surgical navigation systems in the operating room,
   feedback is typically displayed on a computer monitor. The surgeon's
   attention is usually focused on the tool and the surgical site, so the
   display is typically out of the direct line of sight. The purpose is to
   develop a visual feedback device mounted on an electromagnetically
   tracked electrosurgical cauterizer which will provide navigation
   information for the surgeon in their field of view. METHODS: A study was
   conducted to determine the usefulness of the visual feedback in adjunct
   to the navigation system currently in use. Subjects were asked to follow
   tumor contours with the tracked cauterizer using 3D screen navigation
   with the mounted visual feedback and the 3D navigation screen alone. The
   movements of the cauterizer were recorded. RESULTS: The study showed a
   significant decrease in the subjects' distance from the tumor margin, a
   significant increase in the subjects' confidence to avoid cutting the
   tumor and a statistically significant reduction in the subjects'
   perception of the need to look at the screen when using the visual
   feedback device compared to without. DISCUSSION: The LED feedback device
   helped the subjects feel confident in their ability to identify safe
   margins and minimize the amount of healthy tissue removed in the tumor
   resection. CONCLUSION: Good potential for the visual LED feedback has
   been shown. With additional training, this approach promises to lead to
   improved resection technique, with fewer cuts into the tumor and less
   healthy tissue removed.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: An electromagnetic navigation system for tumor excision in
   breast conserving surgery has recently been developed. Preoperatively, a
   hooked needle is positioned in the tumor and the tumor boundaries are
   defined in the needle coordinate system. The needle is tracked
   electromagnetically throughout the procedure to localize the tumor.
   However, the needle may move and the tissue may deform, leading to
   errors in maintaining a correct excision boundary. It is imperative to
   quantify these errors so the surgeon can choose an appropriate resection
   margin.
   METHODS: A commercial breast biopsy phantom with several inclusions was
   used. Location and shape of a lesion before and after mechanical
   deformation were determined using 3D ultrasound volumes. Tumor location
   and shape were estimated from initial contours and tracking data. The
   difference in estimated and actual location and shape of the lesion
   after deformation was quantified using the Hausdorff distance. Data
   collection and analysis were done using our 3D Slicer software
   application and PLUS toolkit.
   RESULTS: The deformation of the breast resulted in 3.72 mm (STD 0.67 mm)
   average boundary displacement for an isoelastic lesion and 3.88 mm (STD
   0.43 mm) for a hyperelastic lesion. The difference between the actual
   and estimated tracked tumor boundary was 0.88 mm (STD 0.20 mm) for the
   isoelastic and 1.78 mm (STD 0.18 mm) for the hyperelastic lesion.
   CONCLUSION: The average lesion boundary tracking error was below 2mm,
   which is clinically acceptable. We suspect that stiffness of the phantom
   tissue affected the error measurements. Results will be validated in
   patient studies.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of fast changing temperature fluctuations is a
   challenging problem due to the inherent limited bandwidth of temperature
   sensors. This results in a measured signal that is a lagged and
   attenuated version of the input. Compensation can be performed provided
   an accurate, parameterised sensor model is available. However, to
   account for the influence of the measurement environment and changing
   conditions such as gas velocity, the model must be estimated in-situ.
   The cross-relation method of blind deconvolution is one approach for in.
   situ, characterisation of sensors. However, a drawback with the method
   is that it becomes positively biased and unstable at high noise levels.
   In this paper, the cross-relation method is cast, in the discrete-time
   domain and a bias compensation approach is developed. It is shown that
   the proposed compensation scheme is robust and yields unbiased estimates
   with lower estimation variance than the uncompensated version. All
   results are verified using Monte-Carlo simulations. (C) 2016, IFAC

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to identify the critical factors causing
   construction disputes in small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in Ireland
   during the recent recession period from 2007 to 2013.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used a mixed-method approach
   incorporating a literature review, case studies and questionnaire
   survey, with results analysed using exploratory (data reduction) factor
   analysis.
   Findings - The results indicate seven core critical factors which result
   in construction disputes in SMEs in Ireland during a recession: payment
   and extras; physical work conditions; poor financial/legal practise;
   changes to the agreed scope of works; time overrun; defects; and
   requests for increase in speed of project and long-term defects.
   Research Limitations/implications - With Ireland emerging from the
   current economic recession and the prevalence of SMEs in the
   construction sector, it is essential to document the core critical
   factors of construction disputes which emerge within this particular
   segment of the built environment.
   Practical Implications - To address the adversarial nature of the
   construction sector and the prevalence of SMEs, it is essential to
   identify and document the critical factors of construction disputes
   within this remit. It is envisaged that the results of this research
   will be acknowledged, and the recommendations adopted, by construction
   SMEs, particularly within Ireland, as they emerge from the economic
   recession.
   Originality/value - This paper fulfils a gap in knowledge with the
   emergence of the economic recession and the identification of critical
   factors of construction dispute within SMEs in the Irish construction
   industry.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{393-417}},
Abstract = {{In May 2006, the New Engineering Contract (NEC) contract was introduced
   as the preferred contract for Northern Ireland public sector works. This
   was subsequently followed by the 2007 economic crash and ensuing
   recession, which continues to affect the Northern Ireland Construction
   Industry, to a greater extent than the remainder of the United Kingdom.
   However, use of the NEC contract has increased during this period,
   particularly in the public sector. There has been debate in the
   literature regarding the impact of the NEC contract on adversarial
   behaviour, but little consideration of the impact of external economic
   factors on the use of the NEC contract. Using a sequential mixed method
   approach, the study aims to fill this gap in knowledge through
   examination of the impact the economic downturn has had on the operation
   of the NEC contract in Northern Ireland. Qualitative and quantitative
   findings show that the demands placed by the NEC contract, and the
   effects of the economic recession, have exerted opposing forces on
   contract implementation, thus hindering its execution. The findings can
   lead to a deeper understanding, in the context of both industry and
   academia, of situations where a lack of resources may negatively impact
   the operation of the NEC contract.}},

Abstract = {{Porous manganese oxide ( OMS-2) and platinum supported on OMS-2
   catalysts have been shown to facilitate the hydrogenation of the nitro
   group in chloronitrobenzene to give chloroaniline with no
   dehalogenation. Complete conversion was obtained within 2 h at 25
   degrees C and, although the rate of reaction increased with increasing
   temperature up to 100 degrees C, the selectivity to chloroaniline
   remained at 99.0\%. Use of Pd/OMS-2 or Pt/Al2O3 resulted in significant
   dechlorination even at 25 degrees C and 2 bar hydrogen pressure giving a
   selectivity to chloroaniline of 34.5\% and 77.8\%, respectively, at
   complete conversion. This demonstrates the potential of using platinum
   group metal free catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of
   halogenated aromatics. Two pathways were observed for the analogous
   nitrobenzene hydrogenation depending on the catalyst used. The
   hydrogenation of nitrobenzene was found to follow a direct pathway to
   aniline and nitrosobenzene over Pd/OMS-2 in contrast to the OMS and
   Pt/OMS-2 catalysts which resulted in formation of nitrosobenzene,
   azoxybenzene and azobenzene/hydrazobenzene intermediates before complete
   conversion to aniline. These results indicate that for Pt/OMS-2 the
   hydrogenation proceeds predominantly over the support with the metal
   acting to dissociate hydrogen. In the case of Pd/OMS-2 both the
   hydrogenation and hydrogen adsorption occur on the metal sites.}},

   the presence of uncertainty/error in parameters/data, are investigated.
   The enclosure for the vector of actuator torques is formulated utilizing
   the interval forms of the Jacobian matrix and external wrench. Two
   analytical methods are utilized to identify the solution set; one method
   generates the rays that bound the solution set in each orthant, and the
   other one is based on parameterizing the interval entries of the
   Jacobian matrix and wrench. For the parametric method, the existence of
   dominant parameter groups to produce the whole solution set (or a subset
   of solution set) is examined. Implementation of these methods on example
   parallel manipulators are presented to identify the solution set for the
   actuator torques, and the results are verified with the discrete method.}},

Abstract = {{Heat transfer from a window recessed into a wall when there is a plane
   blind mounted over the window, the blind being in the same plane as the
   wall, has been considered. In such situations the blind is sometimes
   narrower than the window, i.e., there are gaps between the vertical
   edges of the blind and the vertical edges of the wall window opening. In
   the present study the effect of the size of the blind edge gaps on the
   window heat transfer has been numerically investigated. Conditions under
   which the flow over the window-blind system is laminar and under which
   it is turbulent have been considered. The present study, as in many
   previous window heat transfer studies, has only considered the
   convective heat transfer from the window to the surrounding room. The
   flow has been assumed to be steady and symmetrical about the
   window-blind vertical center-plane. The Boussinesq approach has been
   used and it has been assumed that the ``window{''}, which is modeled as
   a plane surface, is at a uniform temperature. Attention has been
   restricted to the case where the window is at a higher temperature than
   the temperature of the room air, this room air being assumed to be at a
   uniform temperature far from the window. The solution has been obtained
   by numerically solving the governing equations using the commercial CM
   solver FLUENT. The k-epsilon turbulence model has been used in obtaining
   the solution. Results have only been obtained for a Prandtl number of
   0.74, i.e., effectively the value for air. The effect of the
   dimensionless size of the blind side gaps on the window Nusselt number
   has been studied for various Rayleigh numbers; the results being used to
   determine under what conditions the blind side openings have a
   significant effect on the window heat transfer rate.}},

Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{27}},
Pages = {{4567-4574}},
Abstract = {{2-Hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), commonly introduced to control resin
   properties and introduce cross-linking sites, affects radical
   copolymerization kinetics through hydrogen-bonding, with the extent of
   the influence dependent upon solvent choice. The pulsed-laser
   polymerization technique has been applied to systematically investigate
   the influence of solvent choice on composition-averaged propagation rate
   coefficients (k(p)(cop)) and copolymer composition for HEA copolymerized
   with butyl methacrylate (BMA) in xylenes, dimethyl formamide (DMF),
   n-butanol (BuOH), methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) and butyl propionate. It
   is found that copolymer composition (as measured by proton NMR) has a
   greater dependency on solvent choice than propagation kinetics. HEA is
   incorporated into the BMA copolymer at higher relative rates than butyl
   acrylate (BA) in bulk, with the introduction of DMF and BuOH both
   reducing HEA incorporation rates. In contrast, the other solvents
   increase the relative reactivity of HEA, with reactivity ratios for the
   highest HEA incorporating case of BMA/HEA in xylenes found to be r(BMA)
   = 0.96 +/- 0.05 and r(HEA) = 1.35 +/- 0.14. Surprisingly, k(p)(cop)
   could be represented by the terminal model for polymerization in
   xylenes, MIBK and butyl propionate, but not for the bulk system.}},

Abstract = {{To solve problems in polymer fluid dynamics, one needs the equations of
   continuity, motion, and energy. The last two equations contain the
   stress tensor and the heat-flux vector for the material. There are two
   ways to formulate the stress tensor: (a) One can write a continuum
   expression for the stress tensor in terms of kinematic tensors, or (b)
   one can select a molecular model that represents the polymer molecule
   and then develop an expression for the stress tensor from kinetic
   theory. The advantage of the kinetic theory approach is that one gets
   information about the relation between the molecular structure of the
   polymers and the rheological properties. We restrict the discussion
   primarily to the simplest stress tensor expressions or constitutive
   equations containing from two to four adjustable parameters, although we
   do indicate how these formulations may be extended to give more
   complicated expressions. We also explore how these simplest expressions
   are recovered as special cases of a more general framework, the Oldroyd
   8-constant model. Studying the simplest models allows us to discover
   which types of empiricisms or molecular models seem to be worth
   investigating further. We also explore equivalences between continuum
   and molecular approaches. We restrict the discussion to several types of
   simple flows, such as shearing flows and extensional flows, which are of
   greatest importance in industrial operations. Furthermore, if these
   simple flows cannot be well described by continuum or molecular models,
   then it is not necessary to lavish time and energy to apply them to more
   complex flow problems.}},

   so-called l(2), q-norm term. We show that this problem can be
   efficiently solved by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Our

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRASHWORTHINESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{211-221}},
Abstract = {{Roadside safety barriers designs are tested with passenger cars in
   Europe using standard EN1317 in which the impact angle for normal, high
   and very high containment level tests is 20 degrees. In comparison to
   EN1317, the US standard MASH has higher impact angles for cars and
   pickups (25 degrees) and different vehicle masses. Studies in Europe
   (RISER) and the US have shown values for the 90th percentile impact
   angle of 30 degrees-34 degrees. Thus, the limited evidence available
   suggests that the 20 degrees angle applied in EN 1317 may be too low.
   The first goal of this paper is to use the US NCHRP database (Project
   NCHRP 17-22) to assess the distribution of impact angle and collision
   speed in recent ROR accidents. Second, based on the findings of the
   statistical analysis and on analysis of impact angles and speeds in the
   literature, an LS-DYNA finite element analysis was carried out to
   evaluate the normal containment level of concrete barriers in
   non-standard collisions. The FE model was validated against a crash test
   of a portable concrete barrier carried out at the UK Transport Research
   Laboratory (TRL).
   The accident data analysis for run-off road accidents indicates that a
   substantial proportion of accidents have an impact angle in excess of 20
   degrees. The baseline LS-DYNA model showed good comparison with
   experimental acceleration severity index (ASI) data and the parametric
   analysis indicates a very significant influence of impact angle on ASI.
   Accordingly, a review of European runoff road accidents and the
   configuration of EN 1317 should be performed.}},

   world leading scientists actively involved in the synthesis,
   characterisation, modelling and testing of solid catalysts, attracting
   more than one hundred delegates from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and
   experience levels - academic and industrial researchers,
   experimentalists and theoreticians, and students. The meeting was a
   reflection of how big of an impact the ability to control and design
   catalysts with specific properties for particular processes can
   potentially have on the chemical industry, environment, economy and
   society as a whole. In the following, we give an overview of the topics
   covered during this meeting and briefly highlight the content of each
   presentation.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, olive stone (OS) was utilized to investigate its capacity
   as biosorbent for methylene blue (MB) and Cr(III), which are usually
   present in textile industry effluents. Equilibrium and kinetic
   experiments were performed in batch experiments. The biosorption process
   followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. The equilibrium data were fitted
   with several models, but Langmuir and Sips models best reproduced the
   experimental results. Maximum biosorption capacities were 3.296 mg/g
   (0.0116 mmol/g) and 4.990 mg/g (0.0960 mmol/g) for MB and Cr(III),
   respectively. Several operation variables, such as biosorbent mass, flow
   rate, and initial concentration on the removal of dye and metal, were
   evaluated in column system. The removal efficiency improved as OS mass
   increased and decreased when flow rate and initial concentration
   increased. Also, MB uptake was substantially decreased by increasing the
   initial concentration of Cr(III), ranging from 6.09 to 2.75 mg/g. These
   results show that the presence of Cr(III) significantly modifies the
   biosorption capacity of MB by the OS. These results suggest that OS is a
   potential low-cost food industry waste for textile industry wastewater
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this work is to develop the knowledge of prediction of the
   physical and chemical properties of processed linear low density
   polyethylene (LLDPE)/graphene nanoplatelets composites. Composites made
   from LLDPE reinforced with 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 wt\% grade C graphene
   nanoplatelets (C-GNP) were processed in a twin screw extruder with three
   different screw speeds and feeder speeds (50, 100, and 150 rpm). These
   applied conditions are used to optimize the following properties:
   thermal conductivity, crystallization temperature, degradation
   temperature, and tensile strength while prediction of these properties
   was done through artificial neural network (ANN). The three first
   properties increased with increase in both screw speed and C-GNP
   content. The tensile strength reached a maximum value at 4 wt\% C-GNP
   and a speed of 150 rpm as this represented the optimum condition for the
   stress transfer through the amorphous chains of the matrix to the C-GNP.
   ANN can be confidently used as a tool to predict the above material
   properties before investing in development programs and actual
   manufacturing, thus significantly saving money, time, and effort.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model for availability analysis of standalone
   hybrid microgrid. The microgrid used in the study consists of wind,
   solar storage and diesel generator. Boolean driven Markov process is
   used to develop the availability of the system in the proposed method.
   By modifying the developed model, the relationship between the
   availability of the system with the fine (normal) weather and disturbed
   (stormy) weather durations are analyzed. Effects of different converter
   technologies on the availability of standalone microgrid were
   investigated and the results have shown that the availability of
   microgrid increased by 5.80 \% when a storage system is added. On the
   other hand, the availability of standalone microgrid could be
   overestimated by 3.56 \% when weather factor is neglected. In the same
   way 200, 500 and 1000 hours of disturbed weather durations reduced the
   availability of the system by 5.36\%, 9.73\% and 13.05 \%, respectively.
   In addition, the hybrid energy storage cascade topology with a capacitor
   in the middle maximized the system availability.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents an overview of selected physical processes and
   their effects on water quality in Hamilton Harbour. An understanding of
   circulation and mixing processes are essential to assess the fate and
   transport of water quality constituents in Hamilton Harbour. Water level
   measurements showed that in addition to harbour and lake seiches, the
   Helholtz mode, due to pumping action from Lake Ontario, is important in
   generating harbour water movements while the circulation patterns in the
   open waters of the harbour are influenced by prevailing winds. In
   general, the mean summer circulation consists of two counter-rotating
   gyres occupying the harbour. Hamilton Harbour physical processes are
   further characterized by substantial water exchanges with Lake Ontario.
   These exchange flows play a major role in determining the retention time
   of the harbour, thereby exerting a large influence on water quality,
   including hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method to fabricate chemically linked conducting
   polymer-biopolymer composites that are intrinsically flexible and
   conducting for functional electrode applications is presented.
   Polypyrrole was synthesised in situ during the cellulose regeneration
   process using the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid as a
   solvent medium. The obtained polypyrrole-cellulose composite was
   chemically blended and showed flexible polymer properties while
   retaining the electronic properties of a conducting polymer. Addition of
   an ionic liquid such as trihexyl (tetradecyl) phosphonium
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, enhanced the flexibility of the
   composite. The functional application of these materials in the
   electrochemically controlled release of a model drug has been
   demonstrated. This strategy opens up a new design for a wide spectrum of
   materials for smart electronic device applications wherein the
   functionality of doping and de-doping of conducting polymers is retained
   and their processability issue is addressed by exploiting an ionic
   liquid route.}},

Abstract = {{In today's internet world, web browser security is an important issue.
   Browsers can be breached in different ways. Because of the over
   privileged access, extensions are responsible for many security issues.
   Therefore, before installation, users should thoroughly analyze the
   security of browser extensions. Extensions are not only available for
   desktop browsers, many mobile browsers are also furnished with extension
   features. Mobile devices have various resource constraints. Hence,
   traditional security analysis approaches cannot be directly used to
   examine mobile browser extension security issues. To overcome the
   inadequacies of the existing approaches, we propose CLOUBEX, a
   CLOUd-based security analysis framework for both desktop and mobile
   Browser EXtensions. CLOUBEX is enriched with a number of essential
   features like requirement-driven security analysis, high performance,
   fault tolerance, and dynamic decision making. The framework has been
   implemented for the security analysis of Firefox desktop and Firefox for
   Android mobile browser extensions. Users can accurately and efficiently
   detect the security vulnerabilities of Firefox extensions by this
   solution.}},

Title = {{On vortex evolution in the wake of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric
   low-aspect-ratio accelerating plates}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Impulsively started, low-aspect-ratio elliptical and rectangular flat
   plates were investigated to determine the role of geometric asymmetries
   on vortex evolution. Dye visualizations, force measurements, and
   particle image velocimetry were used throughout to characterize the
   variation between shapes. For all the shapes studied, aspect ratio was
   observed to have the largest influence on force production and vortex
   evolution. Non-uniform curvature and edge discontinuities characteristic
   of ellipses (with aspect ratios other than one) and rectangles,
   respectively, play a secondary role. Furthermore, it was shown that
   stably attached vortex rings form behind the circular and square flat
   plates, which reduce the instantaneous drag force of each plate until
   the vortex rings break down. In contrast, all flat plates with aspect
   ratios other than one are subjected to fast-modulating elliptical vortex
   rings in the wake. These vortex rings increase the drag force of each
   plate until pinch-off occurs. Finally, pinch-off was identified with the
   streamwise pressure-gradient field and compared with formation numbers
   calculated using the circulation-based methodology, yielding good
   agreement for all plates with aspect ratios greater than one. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The conventional two-way relaying (TWR) protocol requires that the
   transmitter (receiver) in one direction must be the receiver
   (transmitter) in the other direction, a limitation precluding the
   application of the TWR for sophisticated real-world wireless networks.
   In this paper, we study a more general multicell system consisting of a
   downlink (DL) traffic in one cell and an uplink (UL) traffic in an
   adjacent cell, with a multiantenna relay located in the cell edge and
   shared by both cells. For the coexistence of DL and UL transmissions, we
   propose exploiting the overheard signals from the adjacent cell
   (commonly known as the intercell interference) to improve the quality of
   signal reception in both cells. To reduce the power consumption to suit
   for green networks, we design the optimum relay precoder to minimize the
   total power at the relay yet satisfying the rate constraints for both
   the DL and UL traffic flows. The original precoder design is a nonconvex
   problem that is difficult to solve. To make the problem tractable, we
   transform the nonconvex problem to an equivalent quadratically
   constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which is then solved by the
   semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. Finally, simulations validate
   the effectiveness of our proposed protocol together with the optimized
   relay precoder.}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{242-258}},
Abstract = {{Die drool is an operational problem associated with polymer extrusion.
   The extrudate collects outside of the die, necessitating periodic
   disruptions for cleaning. There is a debate over the mechanism that
   produces die drool: stress induced fractionation or thermal degradation.
   This article examines the latter. In cohesive failure, a slip
   discontinuity develops in the velocity profile, where frictional heating
   occurs. This slip heating can contribute to resin degradation, resulting
   in lower molecular weight fragments in the die drool. This article
   examines resin degradation kinetics and its influence on die drool rates
   and on the resulting drool layer and bulk polymer concentration
   profiles.}},

Journal = {{GEOSYNTHETICS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{86-99}},
Abstract = {{Super-saturated salt solutions are used to control relative humidity
   (RH) and to infer the hydration (water uptake and loss) behaviour of
   three needle-punched geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) with respect to
   time under conditions of both free swell and 20 kPa applied stress. It
   is shown that RH and applied stress play a key role in the hydration
   behaviour with time when GCL specimens were in equilibrium with water
   vapour. It was also observed that water uptake and loss was affected by
   the bentonite form (powdered or granular) and mineralogy of the
   bentonite. However, the effect of GCL structure (i. e. difference in
   geotextiles and bonding of needle-punched fibres to the carrier
   geotextile) on their hydration behaviour for GCLs with similar form of
   bentonite was not significant for RH=97.7\%. The effect of GCL structure
   became more apparent at 100\% RH (for all GCLs). The results presented
   in this study can be used to better assess the hydration of GCLs in
   field applications such as waste containment liners and cover systems at
   different RH and overburden stress conditions.}},

Title = {{Evaluation and application of multi-decadal visibility data for trend
   analysis of atmospheric haze}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2435-2457}},
Abstract = {{There are few multi-decadal observations of atmospheric aerosols
   worldwide. This study applies global hourly visibility (Vis)
   observations at more than 3000 stations to investigate historical trends
   in atmospheric haze over 1945-1996 for the US, and over 1973-2013 for
   Europe and eastern Asia. A comprehensive data screening and processing
   framework is developed and applied to minimize uncertainties and
   construct monthly statistics of inverse visibility (1/Vis). This data
   processing includes removal of relatively clean cases with high
   uncertainty, and change point detection to identify and separate
   methodological discontinuities such as the introduction of
   instrumentation. Although the relation between 1/Vis and atmospheric
   extinction coefficient (b(ext)) varies across different stations,
   spatially coherent trends of the screened 1/Vis data exhibit consistency
   with the temporal evolution of collocated aerosol measurements,
   including the b(ext) trend of -2.4\% yr(-1) (95\% CI: -3.7, -1.1\%
   yr(-1)) vs. 1/Vis trend of -1.6\% yr(-1) (95\% CI: -2.4, -0.8\% yr(-1))
   over the US for 1989-1996, and the fine aerosol mass (PM2.5) trend of
   -5.8\% yr(-1) (95\% CI: -7.8, 4.2\% yr(-1)) vs. 1/Vis trend of -3.4\%
   yr(-1) (95\% CI: -4.4, 2.4\% yr(-1)) over Europe for 2006-2013. Regional
   1/Vis and Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR)
   sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions are significantly correlated over the
   eastern US for 1970-1995 (r = 0.73), over Europe for 1973-2008 (r
   similar to 0.9) and over China for 1973-2008 (r similar to 0.9).
   Consistent ``reversal points{''} from increasing to decreasing in SO2
   emission data are also captured by the regional 1/Vis time series (e.g.,
   late 1970s for the eastern US, early 1980s for western Europe, late
   1980s for eastern Europe, and mid 2000s for China). The consistency of
   1/Vis trends with other in situ measurements and emission data
   demonstrates promise in applying these quality assured 1/Vis data for
   historical air quality studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the quality of the interface-and edge-bonded joints
   in layers of cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels. The shear performance
   was studied to assess the suitability of two different adhesives,
   polyurethane (PUR) and phenol-resorcinol-formaldehyde (PRF), and to
   determine the optimum clamping pressure. Since there is no established
   testing procedure to determine the shear strength of the surface bonds
   between layers in a CLT panel, block shear tests of specimens in two
   different configurations were carried out, and further shear tests of
   edge-bonded specimen in two configurations were performed. Delamination
   tests were performed on samples which were subjected to accelerated
   aging to assess the durability of bonds in severe environmental
   conditions. Both tested adhesives produced boards with shear strength
   values within the edge-bonding requirements of prEN 16351 for all
   manufacturing pressures. While the PUR specimens had higher shear
   strength values, the PRF specimens demonstrated superior durability
   characteristics in the delamination tests. It seems that the test
   protocol introduced in this study for crosslam-bonded specimens, cut
   from a CLT panel, and placed in the shearing tool horizontally,
   accurately reflects the shearing strength of glue lines in CLT.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear steam generators (SGs) are a critical component for ensuring
   safe and efficient operation of a reactor. Life management strategies
   are implemented in which SG tubes are regularly inspected by
   conventional eddy current testing (ECT) and ultrasonic testing (UT)
   technologies to size flaws, and safe operating life of SGs is predicted
   based on growth models. ECT, the more commonly used technique, due to
   the rapidity with which full SG tube wall inspection can be performed,
   is challenged when inspecting ferromagnetic support structure materials
   in the presence of magnetite sludge and multiple overlapping degradation
   modes. In this work, an emerging inspection method, pulsed eddy current
   (PEC), is being investigated to address some of these particular
   inspection conditions. Time-domain signals were collected by an 8 coil
   array PEC probe in which ferromagnetic drilled support hole diameter,
   depth of rectangular tube frets and 2D tube off-centering were varied.
   Data sets were analyzed with a modified principal components analysis
   (MPCA) to extract dominant signal features. Multiple linear regression
   models were applied to MPCA scores to size hole diameter as well as size
   rectangular outer diameter tube frets. Models were improved through
   exploratory factor analysis, which was applied to MPCA scores to refine
   selection for regression models inputs by removing nonessential
   information.}},

Title = {{Assessing the effect of reducing agents on the selective catalytic
   reduction of NOx over Ag/Al2O3 catalysts}},
Journal = {{CATALYSIS SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1661-1666}},
Abstract = {{The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx in the presence of
   different reducing agents over Ag/Al2O3 prepared by wet impregnation was
   investigated by probing catalyst activity and using NMR relaxation time
   analysis to probe the strength of surface interaction of the various
   reducing agent species and water. The results reveal that the strength
   of surface interaction of the reducing agent relative to water, the
   latter present in engine exhausts as a fuel combustion product and, in
   addition, produced during the SCR reaction, plays an important role in
   determining catalyst performance. Reducing agents with weak strength of
   interaction with the catalyst surface, such as hydrocarbons, show poorer
   catalytic performance than reducing agents with a higher strength of
   interaction, such as alcohols. This is attributed to the greater ability
   of oxygenated species to compete with water in terms of surface
   interaction with the catalyst surface, hence reducing the inhibiting
   effect of water molecules blocking catalyst sites. The results support
   the observations of earlier work in that the light off-temperature and
   maximum NOx conversion and temperature at which that occurs are
   sensitive to the reducing agent present during reaction, and the
   proposal that improved catalyst performance is caused by increased
   adsorption strength of the reducing agent, relative to water, at the
   catalyst surface. Importantly, the NMR relaxation time analysis approach
   to characterising the strength of adsorption more readily describes the
   trends in catalytic behaviour than does a straightforward consideration
   of the polarity (i.e., relative permittivity) of the reducing agents
   studied here. In summary, this paper describes a simple approach to
   characterising the interaction energy of water and reducing agent so as
   to aid the selection of reducing agent and catalyst to be used in SCR
   conversions.}},

Pages = {{23827-23836}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a systematic study of methane hydrate inhibition in
   the presence of five structurally variable ionic liquids (ILs) belonging
   to the ammonium family-viz., tetra-alkylammonium acetate (TMAA), choline
   butyrate (Ch-But), choline iso-butyrate (Ch-iB), choline hexanoate
   (Ch-Hex) and choline octanoate (Ch-Oct). For this purpose, hydrate
   equilibrium curves have been obtained for methane in pure water and in 1
   and 5 wt\% aqueous solutions of ILs using a rocking cell apparatus
   (RC-5). Thermodynamic hydrate inhibition and promotion efficiency in
   each IL has been thoroughly investigated by observing the shifts in the
   hydrate equilibrium curves and trends of the calculated hydrate
   suppression temperatures (Delta T). The results were also obtained for
   methanol to validate the apparatus and compare the inhibition efficiency
   of ILs. Molar hydrate dissociation enthalpies (Delta H-diss) were
   obtained for the studied systems using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation
   and showed that ILs do not participate in forming the hydrate cages. The
   induction time (t(ind)) data reveal that some of the studied ILs delay
   the time of hydrate formation, thereby indicating a potential kinetic
   inhibitor effect. The tested ILs exhibited a variety of phenomena, such
   as hydrate inhibition, hydrate stabilization, kinetic effect and
   surfactant-like behavior, which emphasize the use of ILs as potential
   gas hydrate inhibitors.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud data centres are implemented as large-scale clusters with
   demanding requirements for service performance, availability and cost of
   operation. As a result of scale and complexity, data centres typically
   exhibit large numbers of system anomalies resulting from operator error,
   resource over/under provisioning, hardware or software failures and
   security issus anomalies are inherently difficult to identify and
   resolve promptly via human inspection. Therefore, it is vital in a cloud
   system to have automatic system monitoring that detects potential
   anomalies and identifies their source. In this paper we present a
   lightweight anomaly detection tool for Cloud data centres which combines
   extended log analysis and rigorous correlation of system metrics,
   implemented by an efficient correlation algorithm which does not require
   training or complex infrastructure set up. The LADT algorithm is based
   on the premise that there is a strong correlation between node level and
   VM level metrics in a cloud system. This correlation will drop
   significantly in the event of any performance anomaly at the node-level
   and a continuous drop in the correlation can indicate the presence of a
   true anomaly in the node. The log analysis of LADT assists in
   determining whether the correlation drop could be caused by naturally
   occurring cloud management activity such as VM migration, creation,
   suspension, termination or resizing. In this way, any potential anomaly
   alerts are reasoned about to prevent false positives that could be
   caused by the cloud operator's activity. We demonstrate LADT with log
   analysis in a Cloud environment to show how the log analysis is combined
   with the correlation of systems metrics to achieve accurate anomaly
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{There have been many attempts to find suitable replacements for
   fluorinated surfactants due to problems related to their
   bio-accumulation and resistance to biodegradation. Meeting the
   exceptional performances of these compounds, however, remains largely an
   unaccomplished challenge. Currently, a solution might be found through
   the synthesis of new classes of fluorinated compounds that possess
   reduced environmental impact by following the recommended strategies for
   their greener and safer design. In this article we report a novel
   approach by designing a family of cat-anionic fluorinated surfactants
   that shows potential for improved degradation, good water solubility,
   and low Krafft points. Furthermore, these surfactants exhibit excellent
   fluorine efficiency and effectiveness of surface tension reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Targeted drug delivery using polymeric nanostructures has been at the
   forefront of cancer research, engineered for safer, more efficient and
   effective use of chemotherapy. Here, we designed a new polymeric micelle
   delivery system for active tumor targeting followed by micelle-drug
   internalization via receptor-induced endocytosis. We recently reported
   that oseltamivir phosphate targets and inhibits Neu1 sialidase activity
   associated with receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth
   factor receptors (EGFRs) which are overexpressed in cancer cells. By
   decorating micelles with oseltamivir, we investigated whether they
   actively targeted human pancreatic PANC1 cancer cells. Amphiphilic block
   copolymers with oseltamivir conjugated at the hydrophilic end,
   oseltamivir-pPEGMEMA-b-pMMA (oseltamivir-poly(polyethylene glycol methyl
   ether methacrylate)-block-poly(methyl methacrylate), were synthesized
   using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) living
   radical polymerization. Oseltamivir-conjugated micelles have
   self-assembling properties to give worm-like micellar structures with
   molecular weight of 80 000 g mol(-1). Oseltamivir-conjugated water
   soluble pPEGMEMA, dose dependently, both inhibited sialidase activity
   associated with Neu1, and reduced viability of PANC1 cells. In addition,
   oseltamivir-conjugated micelles, labelled with a hydrophobic fluorescent
   dye within the micelle core, were subsequently internalized by PANC1
   cells. Blocking cell surface Neu1 with anti-Neu1 antibody, reduced
   internalization of oseltamivir-conjugated micelles, demonstrating that
   Neu1 binding linked to sialidase inhibition were prerequisite steps for
   subsequent internalization of the micelles. The mechanism of
   internalization is likely that of receptor-induced endocytosis
   demonstrating potential as a new nanocarrier system for not only
   targeting a tumor cell, but also for directly reducing viability through
   Neu1 inhibition, followed by intracellular delivery of hydrophobic
   cytotoxic chemotherapeutics.}},

Title = {{Periodate - an alternative oxidant for testing potential water oxidation
   catalysts}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The redox catalyst ruthenium dioxide, prepared via the Adams technique,
   i.e. Ru(Adams), is used as a water oxidation catalyst using the oxidants
   (i) Ce(IV) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and (ii) periodate in 0.5 M H2SO4, water and
   0.1 M KOH. Like Ce(IV), periodate is a very strong oxidant that is able
   to oxidise water to oxygen and can be readily monitored
   spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, compared with 430 nm for Ce(IV). More
   importantly, unlike Ce(IV), which is unstable towards hydrolysis above
   pH 1, periodate is stable in acid, water and strong alkali. A
   spectrophotometric study of the kinetics of periodate reduction, and
   concomitant oxidation of water to O-2, reveals that in the presence of a
   suitable redox catalyst, Ru(Adams) in this work, periodate is able to
   effect the stoichiometric oxidation of water, with a turnover number
   >48. In just water, the kinetics of the latter reaction appear
   diffusion-controlled, due to the large thermodynamic driving force, a
   measure of which is the difference in redox potential, i.e. Delta E =
   423 mV. As this difference is decreased, Delta E = 396 mV in acid and
   290 mV in strong alkali (0.1 M KOH), the kinetics become increasingly
   activation-controlled and slower. These findings are discussed briefly
   with regard to the possible use of (i) periodate as an alternative
   oxidant in the rapid screening of new potential water oxidation catalyst
   material powders that are stable only under near neutral and/or alkaline
   conditions, and (ii) Ru(Adams) as a benchmark catalyst.}},

Abstract = {{The Mayuan Zn-Pb deposit is an exploration breakthrough at the northern
   margin of the Yangtze plate in recent years. The layered or layered-like
   orebodies occur in brecciated dolomites of Sinian Dengying Formation at
   the wings of the Beiba uplift, and the alterations are weak. The ore
   minerals are mainly sphalerite and galena, with medium to coarse
   crystalline structure, filling in open-space of dolomite breccias.
   Characterized by high contents of Cd, Ge and Ag, low contents of In, Ti
   and Se, high Ga/In (6 similar to 132) and Ge/In (mostly > 1000) values,
   sphalerites may have been formed at medium to low temperature. The delta
   S-34 values of sulphides are from 12.9 parts per thousand to 19.4 parts
   per thousand with an average of 17.4 parts per thousand, which are
   relatively concentrated, and may be formed by reduction of marine
   sulphate. Lead isotope compositions are stable. The Pb-206/Pb-204 values
   are from 17.858 to 17.918, the Pb-207/Pb-204 values are from 15.603 to
   15.694, and the Pb-208/Pb-204 values are from 37.756 to 38.046. The lead
   isotopes plot between orogen and upper crust. Sinian strata may have
   provided ore-forming materials. The He-3/He-4, Ar-40/Ar-36 and
   Ar-38/Ar-36 of fluid inclusions in sphalerite are from 0.03Ra to 1.05Ra,
   326.1 to 765.1, and 0.183 to 0.204, respectively, suggesting that the
   ore-forming fluids were mainly a mixture of crustal fluid and
   atmospheric water (meteoric water or seawater). The delta C-13(CH4),
   delta C-13(C2H6) and delta C-13(CO2) values of volatiles in fluid
   inclusions from sphalerite are from -36.01 parts per thousand to -28.80
   parts per thousand, -27.72 parts per thousand to -22.44 parts per
   thousand, and -23.24 parts per thousand to -9.68 parts per thousand,
   respectively, which indicate that the organic fluid mixed in ore-forming
   process. The compositions of H-0 isotopes from quartz and calcite show
   the characteristics of fluid mixing of seawater and organic water. So,
   the ore-forming fluid may be a mixture of two types of fluid i.e. the
   basin brine formed by the seawater evaporation and the reaction with
   wall-rocks, and the organic fluid. It is speculated that the ancient gas
   reservoir became the high-sulfur gas reservoir in the deposit due to
   thermal sulfate reaction. The gas reservoir was also the major source of
   reductive organic fluid. When the ore-forming fluids bearing abundant Zn
   and Pb were transported to the brecciated belt where reductive organic
   fluids gathered, two types of fluids mixed together. Elements of Zn and
   Pb reacted with H2S and precipitated sulfides, with occurrence of
   hydrothermal dolomitization. In conclusion, the Mayuan Zn-Pb deposit is
   considered as a MVT type deposit.}},

Title = {{Current Status and Future Prospects of the SNO plus Experiment}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{SNO+ is a large liquid scintillator-based experiment located 2
   kmunderground at SNOLAB, Sudbury, Canada. It reuses the Sudbury Neutrino
   Observatory detector, consisting of a 12 m diameter acrylic vessel which
   will be filled with about 780 tonnes of ultra-pure liquid scintillator.
   Designed as a multipurpose neutrino experiment, the primary goal of SNO+
   is a search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay (0 nu beta beta) of
   Te-130. In Phase I, the detectorwill be loaded with 0.3\% natural
   tellurium, corresponding to nearly 800 kg of Te-130, with an expected
   effective Majorana neutrino mass sensitivity in the region of 55-133
   meV, just above the inverted mass hierarchy. Recently, the possibility
   of deploying up to ten times more natural tellurium has been
   investigated, which would enable SNO+ to achieve sensitivity deep into
   the parameter space for the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy in the
   future. Additionally, SNO+ aims to measure reactor antineutrino
   oscillations, low energy solar neutrinos, and geoneutrinos, to be
   sensitive to supernova neutrinos, and to search for exotic physics. A
   first phase with the detector filled with water will begin soon, with
   the scintillator phase expected to start after a few months of water
   data taking. The 0 nu beta beta Phase I is foreseen for 2017.}},

Title = {{Factors affecting gas migration and contaminant redistribution in

Abstract = {{A series of intermediate-scale laboratory experiments were completed in
   a two-dimensional flow cell to investigate gas production and migration
   during the application of electrical resistance heating (ERH) for the
   removal of dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). Experiments
   consisted of heating water in homogeneous silica sand and heating 270 mL
   of trichloroethene (TCE) and chloroform (CF) DNAPL pools in
   heterogeneous silica sands, both under flowing groundwater conditions.
   Spatial and temporal distributions of temperature were measured using
   thermocouples and observations of gas production and migration were
   collected using front-face image capture throughout the experiments.
   Post-treatment soil samples were collected and analyzed to assess DNAPL
   removal. Results of experiments performed in homogeneous sand subject to
   different groundwater flow rates showed that high groundwater velocities
   can limit subsurface heating rates. In the DNAPL pool experiments,
   temperatures increased to achieve DNAPL-water co-boiling, creating
   estimated gas volumes of 131 and 114 L that originated from the TCE and
   CF pools, respectively. Produced gas migrated vertically, entered a
   coarse sand lens and subsequently migrated laterally beneath an
   overlying capillary barrier to outside the heated treatment zone where
   31-56\% of the original DNAPL condensed back into a DNAPL phase. These
   findings demonstrate that layered heterogeneity can potentially
   facilitate the transport of contaminants outside the treatment zone by
   mobilization and condensation of gas phases during ERH applications.
   This underscores the need for vapor phase recovery and/or control
   mechanisms below the water table during application of ERH in
   heterogeneous porous media during the co-boiling stage, which occurs
   prior to reaching the boiling point of water. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRAIN ANALYSIS FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{1, SI}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the influence on the engineering design process of
   the primary objective of validation, whether it is proving a model, a
   technology or a product. Through the examination of a number of
   stiffened panel case studies, the relationships between simulation,
   validation, design and the final product are established and discussed.
   The work demonstrates the complex interactions between the original (or
   anticipated) design model, the analysis model, the validation activities
   and the product in service. The outcome shows clearly some unintended
   consequences. High fidelity validation test simulations require a
   different set of detailed parameters to accurately capture behaviour. By
   doing so, there is a divergence from the original computer-aided design
   model, intrinsically limiting the value of the validation with respect
   to the product. This work represents a shift from the traditional
   perspective of encapsulating and controlling errors between simulation
   and experimental test to consideration of the wider design-test process.
   Specifically, it is a reflection on the implications of how models are
   built and validated, and the effect on results and understanding of
   structural behaviour. This article then identifies key checkpoints in
   the design process and how these should be used to update the
   computer-aided design system parameters for a design. This work strikes
   at a fundamental challenge in understanding the interaction between
   design, certification and operation of any complex system.}},

Abstract = {{Radical propagation kinetics of the bulk homopolymerizations of vinyl
   pivalate (VPi) and vinyl benzoate (VBz) have been studied using
   pulsed-laser polymerization (PLP) combined with size exclusion
   chromatography (SEC). As part of the study, the Mark-Houwink parameters
   of poly(VPi) and poly(VBz) in tetrahydrofuran are determined using a
   triple detector SEC. The observed significant increase (by approximate
   to 20\%) of the bulk VPi propagation rate coefficient (k(p)) as pulse
   repetition rate is increased from 200 to 500 Hz is similar to that
   reported for vinyl acetate (VAc). Data collected in the temperature
   range of 25-85 degrees C for VPi is well fit by the Arrhenius relation
   ln(k(p)/L mol(-1) s(-1)) = 15.73-2093(T/K). The activation energy is
   similar to that found for vinyl acetate (VAc), with k(p) values higher
   by approximate to 50\%. PLP studies in ethyl acetate and in heptane find
   no substantial solvent effect on VPi or VAc k(p) values. Attempts to
   measure the propagation kinetics of VBz by PLP are not successful,
   suggesting that significant radical stabilization occurs for the system.
   Small-scale batch polymerization experiments demonstrate relative
   polymerization rates of these vinyl ester monomers that are consistent
   with the PLP results.}},

Title = {{Electrospun fibers for oil-water separation}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{12868-12884}},
Abstract = {{The increasing worldwide oil pollution intensifies the needs for new
   techniques of separation of oil from oily water. Separation by the use
   of electrospun fibers with selective oil/water absorption is a
   relatively new but highly promising technique. Owing to their highly
   specific surface areas, interconnected nanoscale pore structures and the
   potential to incorporate active chemistry on a nanoscale surface,
   electrospun fibers have become a promising versatile platform for the
   separation of oil/water mixtures and emulsions. In this review, after a
   short introduction to the imperative for oil/water separation and
   electrospinning technique, we will focus on
   superhydrophobic/superoleophilic electrospun fibers for oil/water
   separation, including the preparation of electrospun fibers with
   superhydrophobic/superoleophilic surfaces, and
   superhydrophobic/superoleophilic fibrous membranes for oil absorption
   and oil filtration. Further, superoleophobic/superhydrophilic
   electrospun fibers and their application for oil-water separation will
   be discussed as well. Finally, conclusions about this review will be
   presented while addressing remaining problems and future challenges.}},

   Wastewater Stabilization Pond Operated in a Temperate Climate}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Treatment in a wastewater stabilization pond (WSP) relies on natural
   purification processes, which can be sensitive to both location and
   climate. This study investigated the effects of three environmental
   factors, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature, on disinfection
   efficiency in a WSP system consisting of three facultative cells, and
   operated in a temperate climate region, in Eastern Ontario, Canada.
   Indicator organism (Escherichia coli (E. coli)) removal in WSP systems
   is driven by a combination of different factors. Elevated pH and DO
   concentrations, which are attributed to the presence of algae, are
   important factors for effective disinfection. Therefore, the presence of
   algae in natural wastewater treatment systems can contribute appreciably
   to disinfection. Consequently, based on algal concentrations, removal
   efficiencies of pathogenic microorganisms during wastewater treatment
   over the course of a year can be highly variable, where higher removal
   efficiencies would be expected in summer and fall seasons.}},

Abstract = {{While liquid exfoliation is a powerful technique to produce defect-free
   nanosheets in large quantities, its usefulness is limited by broad
   nanosheet thickness distributions and-Iow monolayer contents. Here we
   demonstrate liquid processing techniques, based on iterative
   centrifugation cascades, which can be designed to achieve either highly
   efficient nanosheet size-selection and/or monolayer enrichment. The
   resultant size-selected dispersions were used to establish quantitative
   metrics to determine monolayer volume fraction, as well as mean
   nanosheet size and thickness, from standard spectroscopic measurements.
   Such metrics allowed us to design and optimize centrifugation cascades
   to enrich liquid exfoliated WS2 dispersions up to monolayer contents of
   75\%. Monolayer-rich dispersions show relatively bright
   photoluminescence with narrow line widths (<35 meV) indicating the high
   quality of the nanosheets. The enriched dispersions display extinction
   spectra with distinct features, which also allow the direct estimation
   of monolayer contents.}},

   tested temperatures up to 1200 K. (ii) The degree of flow in terms of
   vorticity was found higher on the (1 1 1) crystal plane signifying
   better machinability on this orientation in accord with the current pool
   of knowledge (iii) an increase in the machining temperature reduces the
   spring-back effect and thereby the elastic recovery and (iv) the cutting

Abstract = {{Electrokinetic process has emerged as an important tool for remediating
   heavy metal-contaminated soil. The process can concentrate heavy metals
   into smaller soil volume even in the absence of hydraulic flow. This
   makes it an attractive soil pre-treatment method before other
   remediation techniques are applied such that the chemical consumption in
   the latter stage can be reduced. The present study evaluates the
   feasibility of electrokinetic process in concentrating lead (Pb) and
   chromium (Cr) in a co-contaminated soil using different types of wetting
   agents, namely 0.01 M NaNO3, 0.1 M citric acid and 0.1 M EDTA. The data
   obtained showed that NaNO3 and citric acid resulted in poor Pb
   electromigration in this study. As for Cr migration, these agents were
   also found to give lower electromigration rate especially at low pH
   region as a result of Cr(VI) adsorption and possible reduction into
   Cr(III). In contrast, EDTA emerged as the best wetting agent in this
   study as it formed water-soluble anionic complexes with both Pb and Cr.
   This provided effective one-way electromigration towards the anode for
   both ions, and they were accumulated into smaller soil volume with an
   enrichment ratio of 1.55-1.82. A further study on the application of
   approaching cathode in EDTA test showed that soil alkalisation was
   achieved, but this did not provide significant enhancement on
   electromigration for Pb and Cr. Nevertheless, the power consumption for
   electrokinetic process was decreased by 22.5 \%.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study a two-phase underlay cognitive relay network,
   where there exists an eavesdropper who can overhear the message. The
   secure data transmission from the secondary source to secondary
   destination is assisted by two decode-and-forward (DF) relays. Although
   the traditional opportunistic relaying technique can choose one relay to
   provide the best secure performance, it needs to continuously have the
   channel state information (CSI) of both relays, and may result in a high
   relay switching rate. To overcome these limitations, a secure
   switch-and-stay combining (SSSC) protocol is proposed where only one out
   of the two relays is activated to assist the secure data transmission,
   and the secure relay switching occurs when the relay cannot support the
   secure communication any longer. This security switching is assisted by
   either instantaneous or statistical eavesdropping CSI. For these two
   cases, we study the system secure performance of SSSC protocol, by
   deriving the analytical secrecy outage probability as well as an
   asymptotic expression for the high main-to-eavesdropper ratio (MER)
   region. We show that SSSC can substantially reduce the system complexity
   while achieving or approaching the full diversity order of opportunistic
   relaying in the presence of the instantaneous or statistical
   eavesdropping CSI.}},

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate secure device-to-device (D2D)
   communication in energy harvesting large-scale cognitive cellular
   networks. The energy constrained D2D transmitter harvests energy from
   multiantenna equipped power beacons (PBs), and communicates with the
   corresponding receiver using the spectrum of the primary base stations
   (BSs). We introduce a power transfer model and an information signal
   model to enable wireless energy harvesting and secure information
   transmission. In the power transfer model, three wireless power transfer
   (WPT) policies are proposed: 1) co-operative power beacons (CPB) power
   transfer, 2) best power beacon (BPB) power transfer, and 3) nearest
   power beacon (NPB) power transfer. To characterize the power transfer
   reliability of the proposed three policies, we derive new expressions
   for the exact power outage probability. Moreover, the analysis of the
   power outage probability is extended to the case when PBs are equipped
   with large antenna arrays. In the information signal model, we present a
   new comparative framework with two receiver selection schemes: 1) best
   receiver selection (BRS), where the receiver with the strongest channel
   is selected; and 2) nearest receiver selection (NRS), where the nearest
   receiver is selected. To assess the secrecy performance, we derive new
   analytical expressions for the secrecy outage probability and the
   secrecy throughput considering the two receiver selection schemes using
   the proposed WPT policies. We presented Monte carlo simulation results
   to corroborate our analysis and show: 1) secrecy performance improves
   with increasing densities of PBs and D2D receivers due to larger
   multiuser diversity gain; 2) CPB achieves better secrecy performance
   than BPB and NPB but consumes more power; and 3) BRS achieves better
   secrecy performance than NRS but demands more instantaneous feedback and
   overhead. A pivotal conclusion is reached that with increasing number of
   antennas at PBs, NPB offers a comparable secrecy performance to that of
   BPB but with a lower complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Reinforced concrete pipes in North America are often designed using the
   Indirect Design Method, which uses bedding factors to relate in-place
   pipe performance to the performance obtained from three-edge bearing
   tests. The key performance indicator is the load at which the 0.254 mm
   (0.01 in.) critical crack is developed. The current bedding factors were
   developed using numerical modeling, and a limited amount of experimental
   verification has been performed to determine the accuracy of the
   approach. As such, a series of shallow burial tests with surface
   loading, a simulated deep burial test, and three-edge bearing tests were
   undertaken on 0.6 and 1.2 m (24 and 48 in.) diameter pipes to evaluate
   the current bedding factors. Both the shallow and deep burial tests
   indicated that the critical crack does not develop until after the
   specified service load has been surpassed, suggesting that current pipe
   designs are overly conservative.}},

Abstract = {{Aerobic granules offer enhanced biological nutrient removal and are
   compact and dense structures resulting in efficient settling properties.
   Granule instability, however, is still a challenge as understanding of
   the drivers of instability is poorly understood. In this study,
   transient instability of aerobic granules, associated with filamentous
   outgrowth, was observed in laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors
   (SBRs). The transient phase was followed by the formation of stable
   granules. Loosely bound, dispersed, and pinpoint seed flocs gradually
   turned into granular flocs within 60 days of SBR operation. In stage 1,
   the granular flocs were compact in structure and typically 0.2 mm in
   diameter, with excellent settling properties. Filaments appeared and
   dominated by stage 2, resulting in poor settleability. By stage 3, the
   SBRs were selected for larger granules and better settling structures,
   which included filaments that became enmeshed within the granule,
   eventually forming structures 2-5 mm in diameter. Corresponding changes
   in sludge volume index were observed that reflected changes in
   settleability. The protein-to-polysaccharide ratio in the extracted
   extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) from stage 1 and stage 3
   granules was higher (2.8 and 5.7, respectively), as compared to stage 2
   filamentous bulking (1.5). Confocal laser scanning microscopic (CLSM)
   imaging of the biomass samples, coupled with molecule-specific
   fluorescent staining, confirmed that protein was predominant in stage 1
   and stage 3 granules. During stage 2 bulking, there was a decrease in
   live cells; dead cells predominated. Denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprint results indicated a shift in
   bacterial community composition during granulation, which was confirmed
   by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In particular, Janthinobacterium (known
   denitrifier and producer of antimicrobial pigment) and Auxenochlorella
   protothecoides (mixotrophic green algae) were predominant during stage 2
   bulking. The chitinolytic activity of Chitinophaga is likely
   antagonistic towards Auxenochlorella and may have contributed to stage 3
   stable granule formation. Rhodanobacter, known to support complete
   denitrification, were predominant in stage 1 and stage 3 granules. The
   relative abundance of Rhodanobacter coincided with high protein
   concentrations in EPS, suggesting a role in microbial aggregation and
   granule formation.}},

Abstract = {{Melt electrospinning writing (MEW) is an emerging additive manufacturing
   technique that enables the design and fabrication of micrometer-thin
   fibrous scaffolds made of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers. By
   using a computer-aided deposition process, a unique control over pore
   size and interconnectivity of the resulting scaffolds is achieved,
   features highly interesting for tissue engineering applications.
   However, MEW has been mainly used to process low melting point
   thermoplastics such as poly(epsilon-caprolactone). Since this polymer
   exhibits creep and a reduction in modulus upon hydration, we
   manufactured scaffolds of
   poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone-co-acryloyl carbonate)
   (poly(LLA-epsilon-CL-AC)), a photo-cross-linkable and biodegradable
   polymer, for the first time. We show that the stiffness of the scaffolds
   increases significantly (up to similar to 10-fold) after cross-linking
   by UV irradiation at room temperature, compared with un-cross-linked
   microfiber scaffolds. The preservation of stiffness and high average
   fiber modulus (370 +/- 166 MPa) within the cross-linked hydrated
   scaffolds upon repetitive loading (10\% strain at 1 Hz up to 200,000
   cycles) suggests that the prepared scaffolds may be of potential
   interest for soft connective tissue engineering applications. Moreover,
   the approach can be readily adapted through manipulation of polymer
   properties and scaffold geometry to prepare structures with mechanical
   properties suitable for other tissue engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{The jet flow fields reported on in this paper were created by an
   unconventional gun head intended for polymer powder flame deposition.
   These flow fields are discussed in earlier papers by Payne et al. This
   paper reports on how the air or CO2 used in place of propane with this
   gun head mixed inertly with an isothermal coaxial air jet. Flow
   visualization with a sheet of laser light described by Payne et al.
   showed that the jets, air or CO2, emanating from the propane nozzles
   were rapidly entrained in the coaxial air jet regardless of the presence
   or absence of a particle stream from the central nozzle. A gas analyzer
   measured the gas composition in the flow field downstream of the
   entrainment volume. The time-averaged CO2 concentration on the nominal
   centreline of the jet was constant or nearly so. In contrast, the
   variation in CO2 concentration increased dramatically with the radius at
   which the gas was sampled, up to a radius of similar to 1.5cm at a
   distance of 10cm from the nozzle, after which this fluctuation decreased
   to 0 at the edges of the flow field. The magnitude of these fluctuations
   also decreased with the axial distance changing from 10 to 30 cm. Again,
   the presence or absence of a particle stream from the central jet nozzle
   had very little effect on the amount of CO2 measured. The irregular
   entrainment of CO2 caused the variations in the CO2 measured in the flow
   field.}},

Abstract = {{A range of lanthanum strontium manganates (La1-xSrxMnO3-LSMO) where 0 <=
   x < 0.4 were prepared using a modified peroxide sol-gel synthesis
   method. The magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) clusters obtained for each of
   the materials were characterised using scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and infra-red (IR) spectroscopy in
   order to confirm the crystalline phases, crystallite size and cluster
   morphology. The magnetic properties of the materials were assessed using
   the Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) to evaluate the
   magnetic susceptibility, Curie temperature (T-c) and static hysteretic
   losses. Induction heating experiments also provided an insight into the
   magnetocaloric effect for each material. The specific absorption rate
   (SAR) of the materials was evaluated experimentally and via numerical
   simulations. The magnetic properties and heating data were linked with
   the crystalline structure to make predictions with respect to the best
   LSMO composition for mild hyperthermia (41 degrees C <= T <= 46 degrees
   C). La0.65Sr0.35MnO3, with crystallite diameter of 82.4 nm, (agglomerate
   size of similar to 10 mu m), T-c of 89 degrees C and SAR of 56 W
   g(Mn)(-1) at a concentration 10 mg mL(-1) gave the optimal induction
   heating results (T-max of 46.7 degrees C) and was therefore deemed as
   most suitable for the purposes of mild hyperthermia, vide infra.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{There is now a strong body of research that suggests that the form of
   the built environment can influence levels of physical activity, leading
   to an increasing interest in incorporating health objectives into
   spatial planning and regeneration. There have been a number of strands
   to this research, one of which has sought to develop objective
   measurements of the built environment using geographic information
   systems involving measures of connectivity and proximity to compare the
   relative walkability'of different neighbourhoods. The development of the
   walkability index' has become a popular indicator of the spatial
   distribution of those built environment features that are considered to
   have the greatest positive influence on levels of physical activity. The
   success of this measure is built on its ability to capture succinctly
   correlates of physical activity using routinely available spatial data,
   which includes using road centre lines to measure connectivity. In this
   paper we discuss two key aspects of the walkability index. First, as
   suggested by others, that the use of a footpath network, rather than
   road centre lines, may be far more effective in evaluating walkability.
   This may be particularly important for assessing changes in walkability
   arising from pedestrian-focused infrastructure projects, such as
   greenways. Second, we explore the implications of this for how
   connectivity can be measured. We take six different measures of
   connectivity and first analyse the relationships between them and then
   test their correlation with actual levels of physical activity of local
   residents in Belfast, Northern Ireland. We find that the best
   measurements appear to be intersection density and metric reach and use
   this finding to discuss the implications for developing tools that may
   better support decision-making in spatial planning.}},

Abstract = {{The signal acquisition stage of a GPS receiver detects GPS satellites in
   view and provides coarse estimate of the GPS signal Doppler frequency
   shift and code delay for use by the tracking loops. The accuracy of the
   signal acquisition has a direct influence on the tracking performance.
   The implementation of a GPS signal acquisition algorithm requires
   compromising between acquisition frequency resolution improvement and
   reduction in acquisition time. A robust fine acquisition method is
   proposed to acquire the carrier frequency accurately after the
   completion of the coarse acquisition of the GPS signals. The proposed
   method uses Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to provide robust spectral
   estimation of satellite Doppler frequency with less computational time.
   The proposed method starts after the coarse acquisition has been
   accomplished. The C/A code phase is striped off from the carrier signal.
   Then, sinusoidal candidate functions are generated at each of the
   frequencies range of interest, which is typically set around the
   estimated Doppler shift acquired from the coarse acquisition stage.
   Finally, an orthogonal search algorithm is utilized to detect the
   carrier frequency accurately. The performance of the proposed method is
   evaluated against of the computational load and the effects of the
   noise. Its performance was also compared to the state-of-the-art FFT and
   zero-padding FFT-based fine acquisition algorithms. The simulation and
   experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing
   methods and has sufficient acquisition accuracy for its application in
   the real world.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a novel identification technique for the estimation
   of time-varying parameters in a class of nonlinear dynamical systems.
   The concept of almost invariant manifold is used to find an implicit
   mapping from known variables of the system to the unknown variables. A
   parameter estimation update law is generated from the proposed mapping.
   The exponential convergence of parameter estimation error to a small
   neighbourhood of the origin is achieved. The algorithm is extended to
   estimate the uncertain periodic parameters. An upper bound estimation of
   the unknown periodic parameters and their time derivatives are obtained.
   Unlike most periodic time-varying parameter estimation techniques, only
   the knowledge of the number of distinctive frequencies is assumed. The
   effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated with two simulation
   examples. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous research endeavors on hard turning (HT), both on machine
   tools and cutting tools, have made the previously reported daunting
   limits easily attainable in the modern scenario. This presents an
   opportunity for a systematic investigation on finding the current
   attainable limits of hard turning using a CNC turret lathe. Accordingly,
   this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by providing
   the latest experimental results of hard turning of AISI 4340 steel (69
   HRC) using a CBN cutting tool. An orthogonal array was implemented using
   a set of judiciously chosen cutting parameters. Subsequently, the
   longitudinal turning trials were carried out in accordance with a
   well-designed full factorial-based Taguchi matrix. The speculation
   indeed proved correct as a mirror finished optical quality machined
   surface (an average surface roughness value of 45 nm) was achieved by
   the conventional cutting method using a CBN cutting tool. Furthermore,
   signal to noise (S/N) ratio analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and
   multiple regression analysis were carried out on the experimental
   datasets to assert the dominance of each machining variable in dictating
   the machined surface roughness and to optimize the machining parameters.
   One of the key findings was that when feed rate during hard turning
   approaches very low (about 0.02 mm/rev), it could alone be most
   significant (99.16 \%) parameter in influencing the machined surface
   roughness (Ra). This has, however, also been shown that low feed rate
   results in high tool wear; so, the selection of machining parameters for
   carrying out hard turning must be governed by a trade-off between the
   cost and quality considerations.}},

Abstract = {{Fluvial discharge fluctuations are a fundamental characteristic of
   almost all modern rivers and can produce distinctive deposits that are
   rarely described from ancient fluvial or mixed-energy successions.
   Large-scale outcrops from the Middle Jurassic Lajas Formation
   (Argentina) expose a well-constrained stratigraphic succession of
   marginal-marine deposits with a strong fluvial influence and well-known
   tidal indicators. The studied deposits show decimetre-scale interbedding
   of coarser-and finer-grained facies with mixed fluvial and tidal
   affinities. The alternation of these two types of beds forms non-cyclic
   successions that are interpreted to be the result of seasonal variation
   in river discharge, rather than regular and predictable changes in
   current velocity caused by tides. Seasonal bedding is present in bar
   deposits that form within or at the mouth of minor and major channels.
   Seasonal bedding is not preserved in channel thalweg deposits, where
   river flood processes were too powerful, or in floodplain, muddy
   interdistributary-bay, prodelta and transgressive deposits, where the
   river signal was weak and sporadic. The identification of sedimentary
   facies characteristic of seasonal river discharge variations is
   important for accurate interpretation of ancient deltaic process regime.}},

Abstract = {{We report sandwich polymer light-emitting devices doped with a lithium
   salt. The salt-doped polymer devices are initially conductive and weakly
   emitting under forward bias but blocking under reverse bias. The
   application of a large reverse bias or current activates the device,
   causing a dramatic increase in current and the onset of
   electroluminescence under reverse bias. Meanwhile, the forward-bias
   current and emission have become heavily suppressed. Moreover, the
   activated devices exhibit photovoltaic response whose polarity is
   opposite to that of an un-activated device. Electrical,
   electroluminescent, photoluminescent and photovoltaic properties of the
   activated devices suggest the formation of a p-n junction by in situ
   electrochemical doping. Devices made with a green-emitting polymer are
   quasi-frozen with no significant degradation in current density and
   light intensity after 1200 h of storage at room temperature. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a full-scale site fire test performed
   on a cold-formed steel portal frame building with semi-rigid joints. The
   purpose of the study is to establish a performance- based approach for
   the design of such structures in fire boundary conditions. In the
   full-scale site fire test, the building collapsed asymmetrically at a
   temperature of 714 degrees C. A non-linear elasto-plastic finite-element
   shell model is described and is validated against the results of the
   full-scale test. A parametric study is presented that highlights the
   importance of in-plane restraint from the side rails in preventing an
   outwards sway failure for both a single portal and full building
   geometry model. The study also demonstrates that the semi-rigidity of
   the joints should be taken into account in the design. The single portal
   and full building geometry models display a close match to site test
   results with failure at 682 degrees C and 704 degrees C, respectively. A
   design case is described in accordance with Steel Construction Institute
   design recommendations. The validated single portal model is tested with
   pinned bases, columns protected, realistic loading and rafters subject
   to symmetric uniform heating in accordance with the ISO 834 standard
   fire curve; failure occurs at 703 degrees C.}},

Title = {{Development of a Vehicle-Bridge-Soil Dynamic Interaction Model for Scour
   Damage Modelling}},
Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Damage detection in bridges using vibration-based methods is an area of
   growing research interest. Improved assessment methodologies combined
   with state-of-the-art sensor technology are rapidly making these
   approaches applicable for real-world structures. Applying these
   techniques to the detection and monitoring of scour around bridge
   foundations has remained challenging; however this area has gained
   attraction in recent years. Several authors have investigated a range of
   methods but there is still significant work required to achieve a
   rounded and widely applicable methodology to detect and monitor scour.
   This paper presents a novel Vehicle-Bridge-Soil Dynamic Interaction
   (VBSDI) model which can be used to simulate the effect of scour on an
   integral bridge. The model outputs dynamic signals which can be analysed
   to determine modal parameters and the variation of these parameters with
   respect to scour can be examined. The key novelty of this model is that
   it is the first numerical model for simulating scour that combines a
   realistic vehicle loading model with a robust foundation soil response
   model. This paper provides a description of the model development and
   explains the mathematical theory underlying the model. Finally a case
   study application of the model using typical bridge, soil, and vehicle
   properties is provided.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{As a newly invented parallel kinematic machine(PKM), Exechon has found
   its potential application in machining and assembling industries due to
   high rigidity and high dynamics. To guarantee the overall performance,
   the loading conditions and deflections of the key components must be
   revealed to provide basic mechanic data for component design. For this
   purpose, a kinetostatic model is proposed with substructure synthesis
   technique. The Exechon is divided into a platform subsystem, a fixed
   base subsystem and three limb subsystems according to its structure. By
   modeling the limb assemblage as a spatial beam constrained by two sets
   of lumped virtual springs representing the compliances of revolute
   joint, universal joint and spherical joint, the equilibrium equations of
   limb subsystems are derived with fmite element method(FEM). The
   equilibrium equations of the platform are derived with Newton's 2nd law.
   By introducing deformation compatibility conditions between the platform
   and limb, the governing equilibrium equations of the system are derived
   to formulate an analytical expression for system's deflections. The
   platform's elastic displacements and joint reactions caused by the
   gravity are investigated to show a strong position-dependency and
   axis-symmetry due to its kinematic and structure features. The proposed
   kinetostatic model is a trade-off between the accuracy of FEM and
   concision of analytical method, thus can predict the kinetostatics
   throughout the workspace in a quick and succinct manner. The proposed
   modeling methodology and kinetostatic analysis can be further expanded
   to other PKMs with necessary modifications, providing useful information
   for kinematic calibration as well as component strength calculations.}},

Title = {{Reynolds-averaged and wall-modelled large-eddy simulations of impinging

Abstract = {{We have performed simulations of an impinging jet with embedded
   azimuthal vortices, a model of the wake of a helicopter hovering near
   the ground. This problem has considerable practical importance since,
   When the landing area is covered with sand or snow, the interaction
   between the helicopter wake, the rotor-tip vortices and the solid
   particles on the ground can result in the lift up of a cloud of sediment
   that limits the pilot's vision, causing accidents and potentially loss
   of life. We compare the results of well-resolved large-eddy simulations
   (LES) at laboratory scale, with solutions of the Unsteady
   Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations with three turbulence
   models, and also with LES in which the wall layer is modelled (WMLES),
   using the Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DUES) approach, or employing
   approximate boundary conditions. The URANS solutions do not yield a
   reliable prediction of the development of the azimuthal vortices (a
   well-known shortcoming of most eddy-viscosity turbulence models in this
   type of configuration), while the WMLES and DDES predict vortex decay in
   good agreement with the resolved LES data. Simulations at a Reynolds
   number higher by a factor of 20 (intermediate between the laboratory
   scale and the real configuration) were also carried out. All the
   simulation methods predict very little effect of the Reynolds number:
   the flow appears to be driven by the evolution of the large-scale
   embedded vortices. The trends are the same observed at laboratory-scale:
   the RANS turbulence models predict a much faster decay of the embedded
   vortices compared to the WMLES and DDES. The need for reliable
   experimental data is highlighted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The demand for sustainable development has resulted in a rapid growth in
   wind power worldwide. Although various approaches have been proposed to
   improve the accuracy and to overcome the uncertainties associated with
   traditional methods, the stochastic and variable nature of wind still
   remains the most challenging issue in accurately forecasting wind power.
   This paper presents a hybrid deterministic-probabilistic method where a
   temporally local ``moving window{''} technique is used in Gaussian
   process (GP) to examine estimated forecasting errors. This temporally
   local GP employs less measurement data with faster and better
   predictions of wind power from two wind farms, one in the USA and the
   other in Ireland. Statistical analysis on the results shows that the
   method can substantially reduce the forecasting error while it is more
   likely to generate Gaussian-istributed residuals, particularly for
   short-term forecast horizons due to its capability to handle the
   time-varying characteristics of wind power.}},

   motion in early rehabilitation of radiocarpal injuries to develop the
   argument that coupled motion during functional activities is a

Abstract = {{This study provides experimental and theoretical evidence that the

   and associated energy loss. The friction factor decrease can be
   attributed to an increase in the apparent Reynolds number. The study
   demonstrates that the Cassie effects imposed by SH coating can be
   quantitatively shown to decrease the frictional resistance to flow in
   commercial pipes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of wastewater, with four different nutrient loadings, from
   synthetic centrate on biomass production, nutrient removal, microalgal
   settling, and lipid production were investigated in photo-bioreactors
   under both batch and, subsequently, semi-continuous operations. At
   higher centrate concentration factors (17.2\% and 36.2\%), hydraulic
   retention time and pH adjustments could be employed to sustain
   acceptable microalgal growth rates and wastewater treatment. Similar
   nutrient removals efficiencies (>95\%) and biomass production (0.42-0.51
   g/L) were observed for the four centrate concentrations. Both the lipid
   productivity and lipid content decreased with increasing nutrient
   loading in the wastewater. The results also demonstrated that the mass
   ratio of carbohydrate to protein could provide a good indication of
   microalgal settling performance, rather than sole component composition
   or total extracellular polymeric substances. The highest settling
   efficiency (42.3 +/- 0.04\% after 24 h) and lowest lipid content (10.2
   +/- 1.6\%) were observed for the lowest mass ratio of carbohydrate to
   protein (0.74 +/- 0.15) noted in the microalgae cultivated in the
   wastewater with the highest centrate concentration factor (36.2\%). (C)

Abstract = {{The Bay of Fundy in eastern Canada has the world's largest tidal range
   of over 16 m with tidal currents up to 5 ms(-1) making it an ideal place
   for tidal power extraction using tidal in-stream energy conversion
   devices in the Minas Passage. Field observations collected from
   ship-based and bottom-moored sensors over an 8-day period in 2013 are
   used to validate a 3D hydrodynamic and sediment transport model of the
   Minas Basin with measurements of water levels, current profiles, waves,
   suspended sediment fluxes and suspended sediment concentration (SSC)
   profiles. The sediment conditions are initialized using a bi-modal
   sediment distribution map and the model simulates both cohesive and
   non-cohesive sediments in the Minas Basin. Model results for
   fine-grained suspended sediment concentrations are compared
   horizontally, vertically, and temporally to observations and indicate
   strong data-model agreement for SSC from 5 to 287 mg L-1. The
   implications of constructing a large-scale turbine farm within the Minas
   Passage and the impacts on suspended sediment within the Minas Basin are
   investigated using the model. The farm is simulated by adding
   semi-permeable structures that use an energy loss term in the fluid
   momentum equations to parameterize turbine regions in the hydrodynamic
   model. The results emphasize the sensitivity of the system to changes in
   flow and suggest that a large-scale tidal energy farm that extracts
   maximum power could reduce SSC by 37\% on average across the basin which
   would influence physical and biological processes particularly on the
   fine-grained intertidal areas around the macrotidal basin. (C) 2015

Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{147-158}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{It has been widely accepted that reinforcement made of polyethylene and
   polypropylene is susceptible to creep and soil's hydraulic conductivity
   varies with its void ratio. However, unfortunately there is no available
   sensitivity analysis on time-dependent embankment behaviour taking
   either reinforcement viscosity or time varying hydraulic conductivity of
   subsoil into consideration. The influence of geosynthetic reinforcement
   viscosity and decreasing hydraulic conductivity with consolidation on
   the time-dependent performance of embankments with floating columns is
   investigated using a fully 3D coupled model. For an embankment at the
   working height corresponding to a post-consolidation polypropylene
   geotextile strain of about 5\%, it is shown that the assumption of
   constant hydraulic conductivity and the failure to consider the viscous
   behaviour of geosynthetic reinforcement can underestimate time-dependent
   embankment deformations (including differential crest settlement and
   horizontal toe movement). The effects of factors including the
   foundation soil, reinforcement stiffness, column stiffness, column
   spacing, column type (floating and fully penetrating), and construction
   rate, on the time-dependent behaviour of column supported embankments
   are explored. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADHESION AND ADHESIVES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{33-47}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A significant increase in strength and performance of reinforced
   concrete, timber and metal beams may be achieved by adhesively bonding a
   fibre reinforced polymer composite, or metallic such as steel plate to
   the tension face of a beam. One of the major failure modes in these
   plated beams is the debonding of the plate from the original beam in a
   brittle manner. This is commonly attributed to the interfacial stresses
   between the adherends whose quantification has led to the development of
   many analytical solutions over the last two decades. The adherends are
   subjected to axial, bending and shear deformations. However, most
   analytical solutions have neglected the effect of shear deformation in
   adherends. Few solutions consider this effect approximately but are
   limited to one or two specific loading conditions. This paper presents a
   more rigorous solution for interfacial stresses in plated beams under an
   arbitrary loading with the shear deformation of the adherends duly
   considered in closed form using Timoshenko's beam theory. The solution
   is general to linear elastic analysis of prismatic beams of arbitrary
   cross section under arbitrary loading with a plate of any thickness
   bonded either symmetrically or asymmetrically with respect to the span
   of the beam. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For one-polarization mode-division-multiplexed (MDM) system using sparse

   we numerically investigate the discrete modal crosstalk (XT) behaviors
   due to splices in weakly coupled few-mode fibers. Its impacts on
   transmission distance of uncoupled MDM link are comparably analyzed by
   evaluating the extreme cases relevant to the required splicing
   tolerances. Under different splicing conditions, the complexity of 2 x 2
   MIMO equalizers is assessed by intra-modal relative group delay (RGD)
   emulation. Simulation results show that, by specifically controlling the
   lateral offsets at splicing points, an intra-modal RGD reduction of TSD
   LP11 modes can be obtained, benefiting the tap number decrease of the
   corresponding 2 x 2 MIMO equalizer. Besides, the propagation of TSD LP21
   modes is verified to possess intra-modal splice-XT-immune property,
   indicating that the relevant intra-modal RGD will not be affected by

Abstract = {{While indoor portable navigation using portable devices is becoming
   increasingly required, it faces many challenges in obtaining accurate
   positioning performance. One of the methods to improve navigation
   results is to recognize the mode of motion of the user carrying the
   portable device containing low-cost microelectromechanical systems
   (MEMS) motion sensors. Pattern recognition methodology has been employed
   to detect a group of motion modes that are common indoors, namely,
   walking, stationary, going up/down stairs, standing on an escalator,
   walking on an escalator, standing on a moving walkway, and walking on a
   moving walkway. The performance of the motion mode recognition module
   was examined on different types of mobile computing devices, including
   various brands of smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and smartglasses,
   and the results obtained showed the capability of enhancing positioning
   performance. The module does not require satellite or wireless
   positioning signals, and depends only on MEMS sensors.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses the durability of glass fiber-reinforced polymer
   (GFRP) pultruded structural sections used in bridge-deck applications,
   namely, a flat plate with T-shaped ribs (R-GFRP) and a corrugated plate
   (C-GFRP). Standard coupons were aged for up to 224 days at 23, 40, and
   55 degrees C in separate baths of 3\% salt solutions simulating deicing
   conditions. The tensile-strength retentions and Young's moduli were
   measured periodically. Data were assessed using ANOVA. Microstructure
   assessments using differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy were carried out
   to provide additional assessment of degradation. It was shown that after
   224 days, the tensile strength retentions of the R-GFRP and C-GFRP were
   similar, and that they decreased from 77 to 63\% as the temperature
   increased from 23 to 55 degrees C. The observed reductions were
   confirmed by micrographs showing some surface cracks and separations
   between the fibers and the matrix, but results also showed that the
   polymer matrix was not fully degraded by the hydrolysis because no
   significant changes occurred in the glass transition temperature after
   exposure. When data were fitted in the Arrhenius service-life model, it
   showed that after 100 years, R-GFRP will suffer more deterioration than
   C-GFRP because the strength retentions at a location with annual mean
   temperatures of 10 degrees C were 42 and 61\%, respectively. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{The inclusion of granular columns in soft clay deposits leads to
   improvements in bearing capacity and overall stiffness, along with a
   reduction in consolidation settlement. Many laboratory investigations
   have focused on aspects of bearing capacity, but published data on
   settlement performance are limited. This paper reports on some
   interesting findings obtained from a laboratory model study with respect
   to these issues. In this investigation, 300mm diameter by 400mm long
   samples of soft kaolin clay were reinforced with single or multiple
   granular columns of various lengths using the displacement and
   replacement installation methods. The experimental findings revealed
   that, for the same area replacement ratio, limited settlement reduction
   was achieved for single long floating columns and end-bearing column
   groups. Marginal improvements in settlement performance were also
   achieved for columns installed by the displacement method. No settlement
   reduction was achieved for short single floating columns, whereas short
   floating granular column groups produced increased settlements. These
   observations were verified using contact pressure measurements between
   the footing and column/surrounding clay.}},

Abstract = {{A bicomponent initiation system consisting of
   2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO) and the water soluble
   initiator potassium persulfate (KPS) was used to develop a robust and
   versatile semibatch emulsion polymerization process to obtain
   polystyrene (PS) latexes with solids contents of 5-40 wt \%. A window of
   operating conditions was found that yielded high conversion (>95\%)
   stable latexes and well controlled polymers, overcoming limitations
   found in previous attempts at developing similar processes using TEMPO.
   The critical parameters studied were surfactant concentration, monomer
   concentration in the nucleation step and the monomer feed rate in the
   semibatch step. Methyl acrylate (MA) was used in the nucleation step to
   improve the nitroxide efficiency (N-Eff). Latexes having molecular
   weight distribution (MWD) with dispersity (-D) lower than 1.5, average
   particle size (D-p) from approximate to 32 to approximate to 500 nm,
   nitroxide efficiencies N-Eff up to approximate to 1.0 and monomer
   conversions >90\% were obtained in less than 12 h with solids contents
   up to 40 wt \%. These results constitute a significant advance over
   prior efforts in TEMPO-mediated polymerization in aqueous dispersions.

Title = {{Rapid, simple method for determining the porosity of mesoporous TiO2
   films using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{144}},
Pages = {{78-83}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Two different mesoporous films of TiO2 were coated onto a QCM disc and
   fired at 450 degrees C for 30 min. The first film was derived from a
   sol-gel paste that was popular in the early days of dye-sensitised solar
   cells, i.e. dssc, research, a TiO2(sg) film. The other was a commercial
   colloidal paste used to make examples of the current dssc cell; a
   TiO2(ds) film. A QCM was used to determine the mass of the TiO2 film
   deposited on each disc and the increase in the mass of the film when
   immersed in water/glycerol solutions with wt\% values spanning the range
   0-70\%. The results of this work reveal that with both TiO2 mesoporous
   films the solution fills the film's pores and acts as a rigid mass,
   thereby allowing the porosity of each film to be calculated as: 59.1\%
   and 71.6\% for the TiO2(sg) and TiO2(ds) films, respectively. These
   results, coupled with surface area data, allowed the pore radii of the
   two films to be calculated as: 9.6 and 17.8 nm, respectively. This
   method is then simplified further, to just a few frequency measurements
   in water and only air to reveal the same porosity values. The value of
   the latter `one point' method for making porosity measurements is
   discussed briefly. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In situ neutron diffraction has been carried out on fast neutron
   irradiated Zr-2.5Nb pressure tube and non-irradiated Zr-2.5Nb pressure
   tube samples, with tensile deformation applied along two texture
   directions. Through the evolution of intergranular strains with applied
   stress, as measured via the lattice strains of individual grain
   families, the deformation mechanism of the pressure tube material with
   and without fast neutron irradiation has been studied. Prismatic < a >,
   basal < a > and pyramidal < c + a > has been found to operate in both
   irradiated and non-irradiated Zr-2.5Nb alloy at different stress levels.
   Furthermore, by line profile analysis, it is shown that the density of
   type < a > dislocations in the irradiated sample changed very little
   during deformation, whereas the density of pyramidal < c + a >
   dislocations increased continuously with plastic strain once plastic
   deformation started. Therefore, it is found that the neutron irradiation
   induced defects selectively harden prismatic < a > and basal < a > slip,
   and have very small impact on the operation of pyramidal < c + a > slip

Abstract = {{In this letter, we consider wireless powered communication networks
   which could operate perpetually, as the base station (BS) broadcasts
   energy to the multiple energy harvesting (EH) information transmitters.
   These employ ``harvest then transmit{''} mechanism, as they spend all of
   their energy harvested during the previous BS energy broadcast to
   transmit the information towards the BS. Assuming time division multiple
   access (TDMA), we propose a novel transmission scheme for jointly
   optimal allocation of the BS broadcasting power and time sharing among
   the wireless nodes, which maximizes the overall network throughput,
   under the constraint of average transmit power and maximum transmit
   power at the BS. The proposed scheme significantly outperforms ``state
   of the art{''} schemes that employ only the optimal time allocation. If
   a single EH transmitter is considered, we generalize the optimal
   solutions for the case of fixed circuit power consumption, which refers
   to a much more practical scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Retrospective clinical datasets are often characterized by a relatively
   small sample size and many missing data. In this case, a common way for
   handling the missingness consists in discarding from the analysis
   patients with missing covariates, further reducing the sample size.
   Alternatively, if the mechanism that generated the missing allows,
   incomplete data can be imputed on the basis of the observed data,
   avoiding the reduction of the sample size and allowing methods to deal
   with complete data later on. Moreover, methodologies for data imputation
   might depend on the particular purpose and might achieve better results
   by considering specific characteristics of the domain. The problem of
   missing data treatment is studied in the context of survival tree
   analysis for the estimation of a prognostic patient stratification.
   Survival tree methods usually address this problem by using surrogate
   splits, that is, splitting rules that use other variables yielding
   similar results to the original ones. Instead, our methodology consists
   in modeling the dependencies among the clinical variables with a
   Bayesian network, which is then used to perform data imputation, thus
   allowing the survival tree to be applied on the completed dataset. The
   Bayesian network is directly learned from the incomplete data using a
   structural expectation-maximization (EM) procedure in which the
   maximization step is performed with an exact anytime method, so that the
   only source of approximation is due to the EM formulation itself. On
   both simulated and real data, our proposed methodology usually
   outperformed several existing methods for data imputation and the
   imputation so obtained improved the stratification estimated by the
   survival tree (especially with respect to using surrogate splits). (C)

Title = {{A Distributed Architecture Based on Microbank Modules With

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new distributed battery energy architecture based
   on the microbank module (MBM) for dc micro-grids. The benefits of the
   proposed architecture include: 1) no voltage sharing problem and no
   overcharge/overdischarge problem; 2) high compatibility and reliability;
   3) high energy utilization efficiency; 4) reduced volume and weight of
   the battery management system (BMS). The proposed MBM consists of a
   microbidirectional dc/dc converter, a micro-BMS and a cell bank.
   Moreover, taking advantage of the battery recovery effect, a
   self-reconfiguration discharge strategy is also proposed to further
   enhance the battery performance and discharge efficiency of the new
   battery energy storage system (BESS). To optimize the proposed control,
   an efficiency analytical model considering the battery recovery effect
   is proposed using the curve fitting method. Owing to the bidirectional
   capability, soft switching capability and high efficiency, the dual
   active bridge (DAB) converters are chosen as the microbidirectional
   dc/dc converters. A hybrid modulation strategy with variable switching
   frequency combining the conventional phase-shift modulation and
   triangular current modulation is proposed for the DAB converter to
   reduce the dominant loss and improve the efficiency in wide load range
   based on the minimum loss model. A 1.5-kW experimental testing platform
   consisting of four MBMs and four 12 V/100 Ah lithium battery modules was
   built to verify the proposed architecture with the control and the
   proposed model. The experimental results show that the discharge time of
   the proposed distributed BESS is increased significantly under wide
   operation condition with the self-reconfiguration control. The discharge
   efficiency of the BESS is improved by 7.1\% with the idling time of 5
   min under the power level of 1.5 kW.}},

Abstract = {{Nonuniform local flow inside randomly porous media of gas solid packed
   beds of low aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 5 was investigated by
   three-dimensional modeling and near-infrared tomography. These beds are
   known to demonstrate heterogeneous mixing and uneven distributions of
   mass and heat. The effects of the confining wall on flow dynamics were
   found nonlinear, particularly for aspect ratios lower than 3. High
   velocities were mainly observed in regions near the wall of aspect ratio
   value of 1.5 and those of values higher than 3, owing to high local
   porosities in these zones. Mass dispersion characterized both by
   experimental near-infrared imaging and by particle tracking showed
   discrepancies with literature models, particularly for aspect ratios
   lower than 3. Uncertainties were more significant with the radial
   dispersion due to bed size limits. Beyond this value, the wall affected
   more the axial dispersion, confirming the nonlinear impact of the wall
   on global hydrodynamics.}},

Abstract = {{We describe, for the first time the use of hydrogel-forming microneedle
   (MN) arrays for minimally-invasive extraction and quantification of drug
   substances and glucose from skin in vitro and in vivo. MN prepared from
   aqueous blends of hydrolysed poly(methyl-vinylether-co-maleic anhydride)
   (11.1\% w/w) and poly(ethyleneglycol) 10,000 daltons (5.6\% w/w) and
   crosslinked by esterification swelled upon skin insertion by uptake of
   fluid. Post-removal, theophylline and caffeine were extracted from MN
   and determined using HPLC, with glucose quantified using a proprietary
   kit. In vitro studies using excised neonatal porcine skin bathed on the
   underside by physiologically-relevant analyte concentrations showed
   rapid (5 min) analyte uptake. For example, mean concentrations of 0.16
   mu g/mL and 0.85 mu g/mL, respectively, were detected for the lowest (5
   mu g/mL) and highest (35 mu g/mL) Franz cell concentrations of
   theophylline after 5 min insertion. A mean concentration of 0.10 mu g/mL
   was obtained by extraction of MN inserted for 5 min into skin bathed
   with 5 mu g/mL caffeine, while the mean concentration obtained by
   extraction of MN inserted into skin bathed with 15 mu g/mL caffeine was
   0.33 mu g/mL. The mean detected glucose concentration after 5 min
   insertion into skin bathed with 4 mmol/L was 19.46 nmol/L. The highest
   theophylline concentration detected following extraction from a
   hydrogel-forming MN inserted for 1 h into the skin of a rat dosed orally
   with 10 mg/kg was of 0.363 mu g/mL, whilst a maximum concentration of
   0.063 mu g/mL was detected following extraction from a MN inserted for 1
   h into the skin of a rat dosed with 5 mg/kg theophylline. In human
   volunteers, the highest mean concentration of caffeine detected using MN
   was 91.31 mu g/mL over the period from 1 to 2 h post-consumption of 100
   mg Proplus (R) tablets. The highest mean blood glucose level was 7.89
   nmol/L detected 1 h following ingestion of 75 g of glucose, while the
   highest mean glucose concentration extracted from MN was 4.29 nmol/L,
   detected after 3 hours skin insertion in human volunteers. Whilst not
   directly correlated, concentrations extracted from MN were clearly
   indicative of trends in blood in both rats and human volunteers. This
   work strongly illustrates the potential of hydrogel-forming MN in
   minimally-invasive patient monitoring and diagnosis. Further studies are
   now ongoing to reduce clinical insertion times and develop mathematical
   algorithms enabling determination of blood levels directly from MN
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Microcystins and nodularin are toxic cyanobacterial secondary
   metabolites produced by cyanobacteria that pose a threat to human health
   in drinking water. Conventional water treatment methods often fail to
   remove these toxins. Advanced oxidation processes such as TiO2
   photocatalysis have been shown to effectively degrade these compounds. A
   particular issue that has limited the widespread application of TiO2
   photocatalysis for water treatment has been the separation of the
   nanoparticulate powder from the treated water. A novel catalyst format,
   TiO2 coated hollow glass spheres (Photospheres (TM)), is far more easily
   separated from treated water due to its buoyancy. This paper reports the
   photocatalytic degradation of eleven microcystin variants and nodularin
   in water using Photospheres (TM). It was found that the PhotospheresTM
   successfully decomposed all compounds in 5 min or less. This was found
   to be comparable to the rate of degradation observed using a Degussa P25
   material, which has been previously reported to be the most efficient
   TiO2 for photocatalytic degradation of microcystins in water.
   Furthermore, it was observed that the degree of initial catalyst
   adsorption of the cyanotoxins depended on the amino acid in the variable
   positions of the microcystin molecule. The fastest degradation (2 mm)
   was observed for the hydrophobic variants (microcystin-LY, -LW, -LF).
   Suitability of UV-LEDs as an alternative low energy light source was
   also evaluated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The move to a low-carbon economy has generated renewed interest in
   microalgae for the production of biofuels with the potential mutual
   benefit of wastewater treatment. However, harvesting has been identified
   as a limiting factor to the economic viability of this process. This
   paper explores the harvesting of microalgae using high-pressure gas
   without the addition of coagulants. Coagulation of microalgae under
   high-pressure gas was found to be an efficient method to separate algae
   from suspension. The critical coagulation pressures (CCPs) for H-2 and
   CO2 were determined to be 6.1 and 6.2 MPa, respectively. The CO2-induced
   decrease in solution pH positively influenced coagulation rates, without
   appearing to affect the CCP. This approach could be beneficial for the
   economic removal of microalgae from solution for the production of both
   biofuels and biomedical compounds without the addition of
   non-environmentally friendly chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular weight dispersity is not typically studied as a design
   parameter of block copolymer stabilizers but is often assumed to impact
   stabilization performance; low molecular weight dispersity is generally
   assumed to be associated with best performance. This is the first
   quantitative investigation of the effects of block copolymer molecular
   weight dispersity with regards to stabilization performance in an
   emulsion polymerization. Poly(styrene)-b-poly(acrylic acid) block
   copolymers were synthesized by nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization
   and employed as stabilizers in the emulsion polymerization of styrene.
   The effect of the stabilizing poly(acrylic acid) block molecular weight
   dispersity on stabilization behavior was studied, independent of
   molecular weight and composition. Block copolymer stabilizers were
   evaluated in terms of critical aggregation concentration, dispersed
   phase particle size, distribution, and zeta potential. The molecular
   weight dispersity of the stabilizing block affected the aggregation
   number and final number of particles but displayed no negative effects
   on stability or size distribution.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-scale analysis of the diffusion and reaction in the catalyst
   coating of a reformer is done based on virtual reconstructions of the
   porous catalyst coating. Pore structure can have significant impact on
   reaction and transport processes in the catalyst coating and
   consequently on the reformer performance. In this work, tomography-based
   simulation of the methane steam reforming in the microstructure of a
   nickel-alumina spinet coating is presented. X-ray nano-and
   micro-computed tomography are done to reconstruct the catalyst pore
   structure at different length scales and to consider the effect of both
   intra-and inter-particle pores on the reacting flow in the coating.
   Results of the reacting flow simulation in the coating microstructure
   based on tomographic imaging are compared with the simulation using
   numerically reconstructed microstructure based on a random packing of
   spheres with similar morphological characteristics. The comparison shows
   that the rate of hydrogen production, in general, is higher in the
   particle packing due to better inter-particle pore connectivity. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents the analysis and results of a supercritical WHR
   (Waste Heat Recovery) ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle) modelling study. The
   study focuses on multiple series heat sources from vehicles and the
   potential of WHR ORC's to convert this into useful work. The work
   presented is generally applicable to any waste heat recovery system,
   either stationary or mobile and, with careful consideration, is also
   applicable to single heat sources. The simulation model simultaneously
   calculates WHR ORC performance for multiple circuit layouts related to
   the position of the regenerator. The work presented details the
   optimisation of WHR ORC performance with regard to fluid selection from
   a distinct pool of pre-selected fluids and from an operational parameter
   perspective at realistic drive cycle related heat boundary conditions.
   The paper also looks at WHR ORC performance with regard to condenser
   pressure and atmospheric conditions for different fluids. The paper
   concludes with estimated WHR ORC vehicle fuel consumption improvement

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{We study the Fermi energy level dependence of the nonlinear terahertz
   (THz) transmission of gated multilayer and single-layer graphene
   transferred onto sapphire and quartz substrates. The two samples
   represent two limits of low-field impurity scattering: short-range
   neutral and long-range charged impurity scattering, respectively. We
   observe an increase in the transmission as the field amplitude is
   increased due to intraband absorption bleaching starting at THz fields
   above 8 kV/cm. This effect arises from a field-induced reduction in THz
   conductivity that depends strongly on the Fermi energy. We account for
   intraband absorption using a free carrier Drude model that includes
   neutral and charged impurity scattering as well as optical phonon
   scattering. We find that although the Fermi-level dependence in the
   monolayer and five-layer samples is quite different due to the dominance
   of long- and short-range momentum scattering, respectively, both exhibit
   a strong dependence on the field amplitude that cannot be explained on
   the basis of an increase in the lattice temperature alone. Our results
   provide a deeper understanding of transport in graphene devices
   operating at THz frequencies and in modest kV/cm field strengths where
   nonlinearities exist.}},

Title = {{Hierarchical management for integrated community energy systems}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{231-243}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Due to the presence of combined heat and power plants (CHP) and
   thermostatically control loads, heat, natural gas, and electric power
   systems are tightly coupled in community areas. However, the
   coordination among these systems has not yet been fully researched,
   especially with the integration of renewable energy. This paper aims to
   develop a hierarchical approach for an integrated community energy
   system (ICES). The proposed hierarchical framework is presented as
   day-ahead scheduling and two-layer intra-hour adjustment systems. Two
   objectives, namely the operating cost minimization and tie-line power
   smoothing, are integrated into the framework. In the intra-hour
   adjustment, a master-client structure is designed. The CUP and
   thermostatically controlled loads are coordinated by a method with two
   different time scales in order to execute the schedule and handle
   uncertainties from the load demand and the renewable generation. To
   obtain the optimal set-points for the CHP, an integrated optimal power
   flow method is developed, which also incorporates three-phase electric
   power flow and natural gas flow constraints. Furthermore, based on a
   time priority list method, a three-phase demand response approach is
   proposed to dispatch thermostatically controlled loads at different
   phases and locations. Numerical studies confirm that the ICES can be
   economically operated, and the tie-line power between the ICES and
   external energy network can be effectively smoothed. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{After fractionation using sequential solid phase extraction, the
   presence of toxic components in oil sands process-affected water (OSPW)
   was detected by the Microtox (R) acute toxicity assay using
   effect-directed analysis. The composition of each fraction was
   determined by high-resolution electrospray ionization-Orbitrap mass
   spectrometry. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was
   used to determine which chemical constituents in all seven fractions
   co-varied most strongly with toxicity. Although O-2 compounds with
   double bond equivalence (DBE) between 3 and 9 positively correlated with
   toxicity, C-15-C-18 O-2-NAs with DBE = 4 (tricyclic structure), as well
   as C-14-C-17 O-2-NAs with DBE = 3 (bicyclic structure), were found to be
   most likely associated with OSPW toxicity, consistent with published
   toxicity studies of surrogate NAS. O-4, many O-3 (i.e. possibly
   hydroxylated O-2 c-NM) and a few O-2 compounds were found to negatively
   correlate with toxicity. The results demonstrate the utility of the
   fractionation and the PLS-DA approach for evaluating
   composition-response relationships in a complex mixture and also
   contribute to a better understanding of the toxic compounds in OSPW.
   These findings will help to focus study on the most environmentally
   significant components in OSPW. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A systematic approach is presented to study the effect of a catalyst
   coating microstructure on its performance in a wall-coated steam methane
   reformer using response surface methodology. Three-dimensional
   simulation of diffusion and reaction are performed in several catalyst
   microstructures represented by packing of overlapping spheres. A
   surrogate model is developed based on Latin hypercube design of
   experiment and response surface methodology that relates the rate of
   hydrogen production in the catalyst coating microstructure to
   inter-particle porosity and average particle size. Two sets of
   simulations are done based on a kinetic model with two different sets of
   kinetic parameters and the results are compared. The comparison shows
   that the maximum rate of hydrogen production occurs at higher
   inter-particle porosity and smaller particle size, when the kinetics is
   faster and diffusion limitation is more severe. Copyright (C) 2015,

Title = {{QoE optimization of video multicast with heterogeneous channels and
   playback requirements}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{We propose an application-layer forward error correction (AL-FEC) code
   rate allocation scheme to maximize the quality of experience (QoE) of a
   video multicast. The allocation dynamically assigns multicast clients to
   the quality layers of a scalable video bitstream, based on their
   heterogeneous channel qualities and video playback capabilities.
   Normalized mean opinion score (NMOS) is employed to value the client's
   quality of experience across various possible adaptations of a
   multilayer video, coded using mixed spatial-temporal-amplitude
   scalability. The scheme provides assurance of reception of the video
   layers using fountain coding and effectively allocates coding rates
   across the layers to maximize a multicast utility measure. An
   advantageous feature of the proposed scheme is that the complexity of
   the optimization is independent of the number of clients. Additionally,
   a convex formulation is proposed that attains close to the best
   performance and offers a reliable alternative when further reduction in
   computational complexity is desired. The optimization is extended to
   perform suppression of QoE fluctuations for clients with marginal
   channel qualities. The scheme offers a means to trade off service
   utility for the entire multicast group and clients with the worst
   channels. According to the simulation results, the proposed optimization
   framework is robust against source rate variations and limited amount of
   client feedback.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on investigation into the effect of helium
   implantation on microstructure evolution in Inconel X-750 superalloy
   during dual-beam (Ni+/He+) irradiation. The 1MeV Ni+ ions with the
   damage rate of 10(-3) dpa/s as well as 15keV He+ ions using rate of 200
   appm/dpa were simultaneously employed to irradiate specimens at 400
   degrees C to different doses. Microstructure characterization has been
   conducted using high-resolution analytical transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). The TEM results show that simultaneous helium
   injection has significant influence on irradiation-induced
   microstructural changes. The disordering of (Ni-3(Al, Ti)) precipitates
   shows noticeable delay in dose level compared to mono heavy ion
   irradiation, which is attributed to the effect of helium on promoting
   the dynamic reordering process. In contrast to previous studies on
   single-beam ion irradiation, in which no cavities were reported even at
   high doses, very small (2-5nm) cavities were detected after irradiation
   to 5 dpa, which proved that helium plays crucial role in cavity
   formation. TEM characterization also indicates that the helium
   implantation affects the development of dislocation loops during
   irradiation. Large 1/3 < 111 > Frank loops in the size of 10-20nm
   developed during irradiation at 400 degrees C, whereas similar big loops
   detected at higher irradiation temperature (500 degrees C) during sole
   ion irradiation. This implies that the effect of helium on trapping the
   vacancies can help to develop the interstitial Frank loops at lower
   irradiation temperatures.}},

   The results of ambient pressure dielectric experiments combined with

   have revealed a fundamental difference between the conducting properties
   of the examined poly-IL and its low-molecular-weight counterpart. While
   the dc conductivity is practically coupled to structural relaxation in
   aprotic ionic liquid, a significant separation between the time scale of
   charge and mass transport is found for the polymerized system. However,
   squeezing of the studied macromolecular system is found to reduce the
   decoupling between tau(sigma) and tau(alpha) that is attributed to
   significant slowing down in anions mobility under conditions of high
   compression. Thereby, our studies provide a fundamental understanding of

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{The peptides derived from envelope proteins have been shown to inhibit
   the protein-protein interactions in the virus membrane fusion process
   and thus have a great potential to be developed into effective antiviral
   therapies. There are three types of envelope proteins each exhibiting
   distinct structure folds. Although the exact fusion mechanism remains
   elusive, it was suggested that the three classes of viral fusion
   proteins share a similar mechanism of membrane fusion. The common
   mechanism of action makes it possible to correlate the properties of
   self-derived peptide inhibitors with their activities. Here we developed
   a support vector machine model using sequence-based statistical scores
   of self-derived peptide inhibitors as input features to correlate with
   their activities. The model displayed 92\% prediction accuracy with the
   Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.84, obviously superior to those
   using physicochemical properties and amino acid decomposition as input.
   The predictive support vector machine model for self-derived peptides of
   envelope proteins would be useful in development of antiviral peptide
   inhibitors targeting the virus fusion process.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes a new analytical method for transmission power loss
   allocation in hybrid market power systems. It is based on circuit laws
   and the orthogonal projection. In this method, the current flow in each
   branch is divided into two components. The first one is due to the power
   transfer from generators to loads. The second component is due to the
   voltage differences between generator buses. The later currents are
   called no-load or circulating currents. These current components are
   computed by using the superposition principle. The responsibility of
   each load and generator to power losses in each branch of the network is
   derived analytically. Hence, the share of each load or generator in the
   overall transmission network losses is estimated. Furthermore, the
   impact of bilateral/multilateral contracts is included in the
   transmission network power loss allocation algorithm. The method is
   extended to consider the time variation of loads and wind generation.
   The proposed method is applied to four test systems and compared with
   other methods.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was verify the design of a novel Helmet System
   Support Device (HSSD) that can be used by military aircrew to help
   intervene on and reduce the high prevalence of neck trouble. Twelve
   healthy participants repeated simulated helicopter aircrew tasks on 3
   separate days. On each day they wore a different helmet configuration,
   where measures of performance, perceived demand/preference and muscular
   demand were recorded. The results showed that vigilance tasks were
   performed over 10\% faster with the HSSD configuration compared to
   wearing the normal helmet configuration. Participants were able to
   maintain static (endurance) postures for 28\% longer, and use of the
   HSSD helped to prevent neck muscle fatigue in the most demanding task.
   The results of this design verification study indicate that the HSSD may
   be a realistic, feasible near-term solution to intervene on the high
   prevalence of neck trouble among rotary-wing aircrew. Practitioner
   Summary: This paper verifies the effectiveness of the Helmet System
   Support Device (HSSD) as an on-body personal protective device to help
   control exposures associated with aircrew neck trouble. The HSSD reduced
   perceived demand, reduced cumulative muscle activity in select muscles
   and provided improved fatigue resistance, meeting its desired design
   objectives.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the use of maximum likelihood estimation to
   localize a stationary source from total gamma ray counts, in an open
   area setting with a highly fluctuating background. As this turns out to
   be a highly nonconcave maximization, convergence rates of global
   convergent algorithms, such as simulated annealing, can be very slow and
   iterative algorithms such an Newton's method for maximization can be
   captured by local maxima while fast. Thus, the selection of the initial
   estimate is critical to how well they perform. This paper proposes a way
   to generate such an initial estimate using an averaging process that is
   shown to be asymptotically convergent to the maximum likelihood source
   estimate. This ensures that with a sufficiently large number of samples,
   the initial estimate is indeed within of the basin of attraction of such
   iterative algorithms. Analytical results are supported by numerical
   simulations based on a measured background data and synthetically
   injected source data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an update on single point incremental forming (SPIF)
   of sheet metal since 2005. It includes a description of the process with
   new information on the maximum forming angle, phi(max), for 5052-H32. An
   in-depth example of the successful design and production of parts is
   given for industry. This includes discussion on production times and
   surface roughness with details that will help designers. A general
   design guide for users of SPIF is provided. It is based upon experience
   gained in the last decade. In general, materials show a trend of
   decreasing formability with increasing initial thickness. It is shown
   that for thicker sheet metal, it is recommended using large spherical
   tools (12.7 mm or larger), or a large flat-ended tool. The flat- ended
   tool provides the best combination of good formability and very low
   surface roughness. For aluminum, galvanized steel and stainless steel,
   it is recommended using a flat- ended tool. Advances in multi-pass
   techniques and information on successful and useful numerical models
   which predict forming behaviour are included. Finally, there is a
   discussion on future work needed in SPIF.}},

Abstract = {{Burn wound healing involves a complex set of overlapping processes in an
   environment conducive to ischaemia, inflammation and infection costing
   \$7.5 billion/year in the U.S.A. alone, in addition to the morbidity and
   mortality that occur when the burns are extensive. We previously showed
   that insulin, when topically applied to skin excision wounds,
   accelerates re-epithelialization and stimulates angiogenesis. More
   recently, we developed an alginate sponge dressing (ASD) containing
   insulin encapsulated in PLGA {[}poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)]
   microparticles that provides a sustained release of bioactive insulin
   for >20 days in a moist and protective environment. We hypothesized that
   insulin-containing ASD accelerates burn healing and stimulates a more
   regenerative, less scarring healing. Using heat-induced burn injury in
   rats, we show that burns treated with dressings containing 0.04 mg
   insulin/cm(2) every 3 days for 9 days have faster closure, a higher rate
   of disintegration of dead tissue and decreased oxidative stress. In
   addition, in insulin-treated wounds, the pattern of neutrophil
   inflammatory response suggests faster clearing of the burned dead
   tissue. We also observe faster resolution of the pro-inflammatory
   macrophages. We also found that insulin stimulates collagen deposition
   and maturation with the fibres organized more like a basket weave
   (normal skin) than aligned and cross-linked (scar tissue). In summary,
   application of ASD-containing insulin-loaded PLGA particles on burns
   every 3 days stimulates faster and more regenerative healing. These
   results suggest insulin as a potential therapeutic agent in burn healing
   and, because of its long history of safe use in humans, insulin could
   become one of the treatments of choice when repair and regeneration are
   critical for proper tissue function.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1293-1319}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It is generally recognized that large-scale turbulent coherent
   structures play an important role in the transport of sediment and
   contaminants in rivers. They are also believed to be related to the
   origin and development of a variety of fluvial bed and plan forms. While
   intensive laboratory and field research has been devoted in recent years
   to the study of large-scale vertical coherent structures, no such
   efforts have yet been directed to the study of large-scale horizontal
   coherent structures. This paper is intended as a contribution to address
   the existing lack of information on the latter structures. Its objective
   is to report an application of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to the
   detection and establishment of the length and time scales of the largest
   coherent structures existing in a shallow open channel flow (width to
   depth ratio equal to 25), focusing primarily on the horizontal
   structures. The analysis is based on measurements of instantaneous flow
   velocity previously carried out in a 21 m long, 1 m wide flume. These
   include 306 single point velocity measurements collected throughout the
   flow field at a constant distance from the bed surface, the duration of
   each measurement being 120 s; and 20 min long measurements carried out
   at selected locations. The velocity was measured with the aid of a 2D
   Micro Acoustic Doppler Velocity meter. Large-scale horizontal coherent
   structures could be identified in all of the velocity records, and
   appeared as quasi-cyclic, sustained features in the flow. The intervals
   of time where such structures could not be detected were invariably
   short in comparison to the measurement time. CWT was found to be
   particularly well suited to determine the average time and length scales
   of the structures, two quantities of special significance in river
   morphodynamics. The average time scale of the large-scale horizontal
   structures for the investigated flow was found to be equal to 22.3 s,
   which implies a length scale of five times the flow width. Individual
   horizontal coherent structures with characteristic times approximately
   twice larger than the value of average time scale could be identified in
   the flow. However, these were infrequent occurrences in the flow.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of oscillatory versus unidirectional flow on the growth
   and nitrate-uptake rates of juvenile kelp, Laminaria digitata, was
   determined seasonally in experimental treatments that simulated as
   closely as possible natural environmental conditions. In winter,
   regardless of flow condition (oscillatory and unidirectional) or water
   velocity, no influence of water motion was observed on the growth rate
   of L. digitata. In summer, when ambient nitrate concentrations were low,
   increased water motion enhanced macroalgal growth, which is assumed to
   be related to an increase in the rate of supply of nutrients to the
   blade surface. Nitrate-uptake rates were significantly influenced by
   water motion and season. Lowest nitrate-uptake rates were observed for
   velocities <5 cm . s(-1) and nitrate-uptake rates increased by 20\%-50\%
   under oscillatory motion compared to unidirectional flow at the same
   average speed. These data further suggested that the diffusion boundary
   layer played a significant role in influencing nitrate-uptake rates.
   However, while increased nitrate-uptake in oscillatory flow was clear,
   this was not reflected in growth rates and further work is required to
   understand the disconnection of nitrate-uptake and growth by L. digitata
   in oscillatory flow. The data obtained support those from related
   field-based studies, which suggest that in summer, when insufficient
   nitrogen is available in the water to saturate metabolic demand, the
   growth rate of kelps will be influenced by water motion restricting mass
   transfer of nitrogen.}},

Abstract = {{The evaporator is an important component in the Organic Rankine Cycle
   (ORC)-based Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) system since the effective heat
   transfer of this device reflects on the efficiency of the system. When
   the WHR system operates under supercritical conditions, the heat
   transfer mechanism in the evaporator is unpredictable due to the change
   of thermo-physical properties of the fluid with temperature. Although
   the conventional finite volume model can successfully capture those
   changes in the evaporator of the WHR process, the computation time for
   this method is high. To reduce the computation time, this paper develops
   a new fuzzy based evaporator model and compares its performance with the
   finite volume method. The results show that the fuzzy technique can be
   applied to predict the output of the supercritical evaporator in the
   waste heat recovery system and can significantly reduce the required
   computation time. The proposed model, therefore, has the potential to be
   used in real time control applications.}},

Abstract = {{Generative algorithms for random graphs have yielded insights into the
   structure and evolution of real-world networks. Most networks exhibit a
   well-known set of properties, such as heavy-tailed degree distributions,
   clustering and community formation. Usually, random graph models
   consider only structural information, but many real-world networks also
   have labelled vertices and weighted edges. In this paper, we present a
   generative model for random graphs with discrete vertex labels and
   numeric edge weights. The weights are represented as a set of Beta
   Mixture Models (BMMs) with an arbitrary number of mixtures, which are
   learned from real-world networks. We propose a Bayesian Variational
   Inference (VI) approach, which yields an accurate estimation while
   keeping computation times tractable. We compare our approach to
   state-of-the-art random labelled graph generators and an earlier
   approach based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Our results allow us
   to draw conclusions about the contribution of vertex labels and edge
   weights to graph structure.}},

Title = {{Performance assessment of cascade control loops with non-Gaussian
   disturbances using entropy information}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{68-80}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Cascade control is one of the routinely used control strategies in
   industrial processes because it can dramatically improve the performance
   of single-loop control, reducing both the maximum deviation and the
   integral error of the disturbance response. Currently, many control
   performance assessment methods of cascade control loops are developed
   based on the assumption that all the disturbances are subject to
   Gaussian distribution. However, in the practical condition, several
   disturbance sources occur in the manipulated variable or the upstream
   exhibits nonlinear behaviors. In this paper, a general and effective
   index of the performance assessment of the cascade control system
   subjected to the unknown disturbance distribution is proposed. Like the
   minimum variance control (MVC) design, the output variances of the
   primary and the secondary loops are decomposed into a cascade-invariant
   and a cascade-dependent term, but the estimated ARMA model for the
   cascade control loop based on the minimum entropy, instead of the
   minimum mean squares error, is developed for non-Gaussian disturbances.
   Unlike the MVC index, an innovative control performance index is given
   based on the information theory and the minimum entropy criterion. The
   index is informative and in agreement with the expected control
   knowledge. To elucidate wide applicability and effectiveness of the
   minimum entropy cascade control index, a simulation problem and a
   cascade control case of an oil refinery are applied. The comparison with
   MVC based cascade control is also included. (C) 2015 The Institution of

Abstract = {{We investigate the cell coverage optimization problem for the massive
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) uplink. By deploying
   tilt-adjustable antenna arrays at the base stations (BSs), cell coverage
   optimization can become a promising technique that is able to strike a
   compromise between covering cell-edge users and pilot contamination
   suppression. We formulate a detailed description of this optimization
   problem by maximizing the cell throughput, which is shown to be mainly
   determined by the user distribution within several key geometrical
   regions. Then, the formulated problem is applied to different example
   scenarios. For a network with hexagonal cells and uniformly distributed
   users, we derive an analytical lower bound of the ergodic throughput in
   the objective cell; based on this, it is shown that the optimal choice
   for the cell coverage should ensure that the coverage of different cells
   does not overlap. For a more generic network with sector-shaped cells
   and nonuniformly distributed users, we propose an analytical
   approximation of the ergodic throughput. After that, a practical
   coverage optimization algorithm is proposed, where the optimal solution
   can be easily obtained through a simple 1-D line searching within a
   confined searching region. Our numerical results show that the proposed
   coverage optimization method is able to greatly increase the system
   throughput in macrocells for the massive MIMO uplink transmission,
   compared with the traditional schemes where the cell coverage is fixed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the achievable sum-rate of massive
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in the presence of channel
   aging. For the uplink, by assuming that the base station (BS) deploys
   maximum ratio combining (MRC) or zero-forcing (ZF) receivers, we present
   tight closed-form lower bounds on the achievable sum-rate for both
   receivers with aged channel state information (CSI). In addition, the
   benefit of implementing channel prediction methods on the sum-rate is
   examined, and closed-form sum-rate lower bounds are derived. Moreover,
   the impact of channel aging and channel prediction on the power scaling
   law is characterized. Extension to the downlink scenario and multicell
   scenario is also considered. It is found that, for a system with/without
   channel prediction, the transmit power of each user can be scaled down
   at most by 1/root M (where M is the number of BS antennas), which
   indicates that aged CSI does not degrade the power scaling law, and
   channel prediction does not enhance the power scaling law; instead,
   these phenomena affect the achievable sum-rate by degrading or enhancing
   the effective signal to interference and noise ratio, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A relay network in which a source wishes to convey a confidential
   message to a legitimate destination with the assistance of trusted
   relays is considered. In particular, cooperative beamforming and user
   selection techniques are applied to protect the confidential message.
   The secrecy rate (SR) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the
   network are investigated first, and a tight upper bound for the SR and
   an exact formula for the SOP are derived. Next, asymptotic
   approximations for the SR and SOP in the high signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) regime are derived for two different schemes: 1) cooperative
   beamforming and 2) multiuser selection. Furthermore, a new concept of
   cooperative diversity gain, namely, adapted cooperative diversity gain
   (ACDG), which can be used to evaluate the security level of a
   cooperative relaying network, is investigated. It is shown that the ACDG
   of cooperative beamforming is equal to the conventional cooperative
   diversity gain of traditional multiple-input single-output networks,
   while the ACDG of the multiuser scenario is equal to that of traditional
   single-input multiple-output networks.}},

Journal = {{BIOINSPIRATION \& BIOMIMETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rapid pitch-up has been highlighted as a mechanism to generate large
   lift and drag during landing manoeuvres. However, pitching rates had not
   been measured previously in perching birds, and so the direct
   applicability of computations and experiments to observed behaviour was
   not known. We measure pitch rates in a small, wild bird (the
   black-capped chickadee; Poecile atricapillus), and show that these rates
   are within the parameter range used in experiments. Pitching rates were
   characterized by the shape change number, a metric comparing the rate of
   frontal area increase to acceleration. Black-capped chickadees increase
   the shape change number during perching in direct proportion to their
   total kinetic and potential energy at the start of the manoeuvre. The
   linear relationship between dissipated energy and shape change number is
   in accordance with a simple analytical model developed for
   two-dimensional pitching and decelerating airfoils. Black-capped
   chickadees use a wing pitch-up manoeuvre during perching to dissipate
   energy quickly while maintaining lift and drag through rapid area
   change. It is suggested that similar pitch-and-decelerate manoeuvres
   could be used to aid in the controlled, precise landings of small
   manoeuvrable air vehicles.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The step-up-and-over test has been used successfully to examine knee
   function after knee injury. Knee function is quantified using the
   following variables extracted from force plate data: the maximal force
   exerted during the lift, the maximal impact force at landing, and the
   total time to complete the step. For various reasons, including space
   and cost, it is unlikely that all clinicians will have access to a force
   plate. The purpose of the study was to determine if the step-up-and-over
   test could be simplified by using an accelerometer. The step-up-and-over
   test was performed by 17 healthy young adults while being measured with
   both a force plate and a 3-axis accelerometer mounted at the low back.
   Results showed that the accelerometer and force plate measures were
   strongly correlated for all 3 variables (r = .90.98, Ps < .001) and that
   the accelerometer values for the lift and impact indices were 6-7\%
   higher (Ps < .01) and occurred 0.07-0.1 s later than the force plate (Ps
   < .05). The accelerometer returned values highly correlated to those
   from a force plate. Compared with a force plate, a wireless, 3-axis
   accelerometer is a less expensive and more portable system with which to
   measure the step-up-and-over test.}},

Title = {{Evolving national park models: The emergence of an economic imperative

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{National park models have evolved in tandem with the emergence of a
   multifunctional countryside. Sustainable development has been added to
   the traditional twin aims of conservation and recreation. This is
   typified by recent national park designations, such as the Cairngorms
   National Park in Scotland. A proposed Mournes national park in Northern
   Ireland has evolved a stage further with a model of national park to
   deliver national economic goals envisaged by government. This seeks to
   commodify the natural landscape. This paper compares Cairngorm and
   Mourne stakeholders' views on the principal features of both models:
   park aims, management structures and planning functions. While Cairngorm
   stakeholders were largely positive from the outset, the model of
   national park introduced is not without criticism. Conversely, Mourne
   stakeholders have adopted an anti-national park stance. Nevertheless,
   the model of national park proposed possessing a strong economic
   imperative, an absence of the Sandford Principle as a means to manage
   likely conflicts, and lacking any planning powers in its own right, may
   still be insufficient to bring about widespread support for a Mourne
   national park. Such a model is also likely to accelerate the degradation
   of the Mourne landscape. Competing national identities (British and
   Irish) provide an additional dimension to the national park debate in
   Northern Ireland, Deep ideological cleavages are capable of derailing
   the introduction of a national park irrespective of the model proposed.
   In Northern Ireland the national park debate is not only about
   reconciling environmental and economic interests but also political and
   ethno-national differences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Small mixer impeller design is not tailored for granulation because

   granulation. Lactose granules were produced using wet granulation with
   water as a binder. A Kenwood KM070 mixer was used as a standard
   apparatus and five impeller designs with different shapes and surface
   areas were used. The efficacy of granulate formation was measured by
   adding an optically sensitive tracer to determine variations in active
   ingredient content across random samples of granules from the same size
   classes. It was found that impeller design influenced the homogeneity of
   the granules and therefore can affect final product performance. The
   variation in active ingredient content across granules of differing size
   was also investigated. The results show that small granules were more
   potent than larger granules. (C) 2015 Chinese Society of Particuology

Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{1023-1036}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A flat-plate solar collector can reach ``stagnation{''} temperatures
   exceeding 170 degrees C particularly during power failures or periods
   when there is minimal energy demand. Excessive pressures may occur in a
   solar collector during stagnation conditions a potentially danger for
   residents. In this work the authors propose experimental and numerical
   investigations of natural cooling of flat plate solar collectors to
   control their overheating under stagnation conditions. Experimental and
   numerical investigations have been conducted on a commercially available
   Enerworks Heat Safe (EHS) residential flat plate solar collector
   integrated with a back mounted air channel. Numerical investigations
   have been performed employing a three-dimensional finite-volume
   numerical model validated against experiments carried out by the
   authors. The validated numerical tool was applied to explore the
   dissipation of heat from the collector through natural convection and
   its dependence on collector geometrical parameters, tilt angle and
   operational conditions. It was found that a solar collector integrated
   with a well designed back mounted air cooling channel and a control
   valve at the outlet opening would be able to provide suitable heat
   transfer rates and keeps the maximum temperature of the absorber plate
   over a practical range of stagnation conditions. From the conducted
   investigations it has been evidenced that an optimal size of
   back-mounted collector air-channel can be found with suitable tilt
   angle, corresponding to which the overheating of collectors can be
   controlled passively under stagnation conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We consider a three-node decode-and-forward (DF) half-duplex relaying

   relay. We assume that the information transfer and wireless power
   transfer phases alternate over time in the same frequency band, and
   their time fraction (TF) may change or be fixed from one transmission
   epoch (fading state) to the next. For this system, we maximize the
   achievable average data rate. Thereby, we propose two schemes: (1)
   jointly optimal power and TF allocation, and (2) optimal power
   allocation with fixed TF. Due to the small amounts of harvested power at
   the source, the two schemes achieve similar information rates, but yield
   significant performance gains compared to a benchmark system with fixed
   power and fixed TF allocation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the achievable ergodic sum-rate of multiuser
   multiple-input multiple-output downlink systems in Rician fading
   channels. We first derive a lower bound on the average
   signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio by using the Mullen's inequality, and
   then use it to analyze the effect of channel mean information on the
   achievable ergodic sum-rate. A novel statistical-eigenmode
   space-division multiple-access (SE-SDMA) downlink transmission scheme is
   then proposed. For this scheme, we derive an exact analytical
   closed-form expression for the achievable ergodic rate and present
   tractable tight upper and lower bounds. Based on our analysis, we gain
   valuable insights into the impact of the system parameters, such as the
   number of transmit antennas, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Rician
   K-factor, on the system sum-rate. Results show that the sum-rate
   converges to a saturation value in the high SNR regime and tends to a
   lower limit for the low Rician K-factor case. In addition, we compare
   the achievable ergodic sum-rate between SE-SDMA and zero-forcing
   beamforming with perfect channel state information at the base station.
   Our results reveal that the rate gap tends to zero in the high Rician
   K-factor regime.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates simultaneous wireless information and power
   transfer (SWIPT) in energy harvesting (EH) relay systems. Unlike the
   existing SWIPT schemes requiring the instantaneous channel state
   information (CSI) for coherent information delivery, we propose a
   noncoherent SWIPT framework for decode-and-forward (DF) relay systems
   bypassing the need for the instantaneous CSI and consequently saving
   energy in the network. The proposed SWIPT framework embraces both the
   power-splitting noncoherent DF (PS-NcDF) and time-switching noncoherent
   DF (TS-NcDF) in a unified form, and supports arbitrary M-ary noncoherent
   frequency-shift keying (FSK) and differential phase-shift keying (DPSK).
   The exact (noncoherent) maximum-likelihood detectors (MLDs) for PS-NcDF
   and TS-NcDF are derived in a unified form, which involves integral
   evaluations yet serves as the optimum performance benchmark for
   noncoherent SWIPT. To reduce the computational cost of the exact MLDs,
   we also propose closed-form approximate MLDs achieving near-optimum
   performance, thus serving as a practical solution for noncoherent SWIPT.
   Numerical results demonstrate a performance tradeoff between the first
   and second hops through the adjustment of time switching or power
   splitting parameters, whose optimal values minimizing the symbol-error
   rate (SER) are strictly between 0 and 1. We demonstrate that M-FSK
   results in a significant energy saving over M-DPSK for M >= 8; thus
   M-FSK may be more suitable for EH relay systems.}},

Abstract = {{In energy harvesting (EH) relay networks, the coherent communication
   requires accurate estimation/tracking of the instantaneous channel state
   information (CSI) which consumes extra power. As a remedy, we propose
   two noncoherent EH relaying protocols based on the amplify-and-forward
   (AF) relaying, namely, power splitting noncoherent AF (PS-NcAF) and time
   switching noncoherent AF (TS-NcAF), which do not require any
   instantaneous CSI. We develop a noncoherent framework of simultaneous
   wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), embracing PS-NcAF and
   TS-NcAF in a unified form. For arbitrary M-ary noncoherent
   frequency-shift keying (FSK) and differential phase-shift keying (DPSK),
   we derive maximum-likelihood detectors (MLDs) for PS-NcAF and TS-NcAF in
   a unified form, which involves integral evaluations yet serves as the
   optimum performance benchmark. To avoid expensive integral computations,
   we propose a closed-form detector using the Gauss-Legendre
   approximation, which achieves almost identical performance as the MLD
   but at substantially lower complexity. These EH-based noncoherent
   detectors achieve full diversity in Rayleigh fading. Numerical results
   demonstrate that our proposed PS-NcAF and TS-NcAF may outperform the
   conventional grid-powered relay system under the same total power
   constraint. Various insights which are useful for the design of
   practical SWIPT relaying systems are obtained. Interestingly, PS-NcAF
   outperforms TS-NcAF in the single-relay case, whereas TS-NcAF
   outperforms PS-NcAF in the multi-relay case.}},

Abstract = {{Erbil (Hawler in Kurdish), is the capital and the largest city of Iraqi
   Kurdistan. Having been continuously inhabited for about 6000 years, the
   city has recently been regarded by UNESCO World Heritage as one of the
   world's oldest urban settlements. The city is witnessing remarkable
   urban growth and rapid spatial expansion compounded by a dramatic
   increase in population due to emigration from the countryside and rural
   areas over the last three decades. Following the changing geopolitical
   landscape of post-war Iraq, urban changes and socio-political
   transformation are largely driven by Erbil's growing autonomous status
   as the capital of northern region of Kurdistan since 2003. This paper
   explores the layers of historical, spatial and social developments of
   the contemporary urban context of Kurdistan in general and of Erbil in
   particular as a reflection of the changing status of the city, as well
   as the polarization of Iraq and the emergence of neoliberal urbanism.
   The tension between the global and modern from one side and traditional
   and authentic from another is ever present and evident in everyday
   challenges in the planning of the city. In large part, Erbil's built
   fabric embodies the dichotomy of identity and contests between its past
   and future, in which the present remains a transition between two
   disconnected realities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Neoproterozoic Sete Lagoas Formation (ca 610Ma) of the SAo Francisco
   Basin, Brazil, is a succession of siltstone, limestone and phosphorite.
   Phosphorite forms part of a previously unrecognized 150 to 200m thick,
   unconformity bounded depositional sequence. Lithofacies stacking
   patterns indicate that deposition was punctuated by higher order
   fluctuations in base level that produced aggradational parasequences.
   These shallowing-upward cycles record the progradation of phosphate-rich
   intertidal flats over shallow subtidal deposits as accommodation filled.
   The presence of mudcracks, authigenic chert nodules, lack of coarse
   terrigenous clastics and the abundance of silt with fine, abraded quartz
   grains suggests accumulation along an arid coastline with significant
   aeolian input. Delivery of phosphorus adsorbed on aeolian
   Fe-(oxyhydr)oxide and clay is interpreted as having stimulated
   phosphogenesis in peritidal environments. Lithofacies associations
   indicate that windblown phosphorus promoted the establishment of
   cyanobacterial communities along the coast, which produced
   photosynthetic oxygen and the suboxic conditions necessary for the
   precipitation of authigenic carbonate fluorapatite. As in other
   Precambrian phosphatic systems, nearshore oxygen oases were a
   prerequisite for phosphorite accumulation because redox sensitive
   phosphogenic processes were pushed into the sediment to concentrate
   phosphorus. In more distal, anoxic environments phosphorite could not
   form because these biotic and abiotic processes were suspended in the
   water column, which cycled phosphorus in sea water rather than at the
   sediment-water interface. Such shallow-water phosphorite is unlike
   larger, younger Neoproterozoic-Phanerozoic phosphatic deposits inferred
   to have formed in deeper-upwelling related environments. The increasing
   size of phosphatic deposits through the latest Precambrian is
   interpreted as reflecting the progressive ventilation of the oceans
   during the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event, and resultant expansion of
   phosphogenic environments into distal settings. The widespread cycling
   of bioavailable phosphorus at the sea floor not only produced the first
   true phosphorite giants, but may have also been an important
   precondition for the evolution of multicellular animals.}},

Abstract = {{Aeolianites are integral components of many modern and ancient carbonate
   depositional systems. Southern Australia contains some of the most
   impressive and extensive late Cenozoic aeolianites in the modern world.
   Pleistocene aeolianites on Yorke Peninsula are sculpted into imposing
   seacliffs up to 60m high and comprise two distinct imposing complexes of
   the Late Pleistocene Bridgewater Formation. The lower aeolianite
   complex, which forms the bulk of the cliffs, is a series of stacked
   palaeodunes and intervening palaeosols. The diagenetic low Mg-calcite
   sediment particles are mostly bivalves, echinoids, bryozoans and small
   benthic foraminifera. This association is similar to sediments forming
   offshore today on the adjacent shelf in a warm-temperate ocean. By
   contrast, the upper aeolianite complex is a series of mineralogically
   metastable biofragmental carbonates in a succession of stacked
   lenticular palaeodunes with impressive interbedded calcretes and
   palaeosols. Bivalves, geniculate coralline algae and benthic
   foraminifera, together with sparse peloids and ooids, dominate sediment
   grains. Fragments of large benthic foraminifera including Marginopora
   vertebralis, a photosymbiont-bearing protist, are particularly
   conspicuous. Palaeocean temperatures are interpreted as having been
   sub-tropical, somewhat warmer than offshore carbonate factories in the
   region today. The older aeolianite complex is tentatively correlated
   with Marine Isotope Stage 11, whereas the upper complex is equivalent to
   Marine Isotope Stage 5e. Marine Isotope Stage 5e deposits exposed
   elsewhere in southern Australia (Glanville Formation) are distinctive
   with a subtropical biota, including Marginopora vertebralis. Thus, in
   this example, palaeodune sediment faithfully records the nature of the
   adjacent inner neritic carbonate factory. By inference, aeolianites are
   potential repositories of information about the nature of long-vanished
   marine systems that have been removed due to erosion, tectonic
   obliteration or are inaccessible in the subsurface. Such information
   includes not only the nature of marine environments themselves but also
   palaeoceanography.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to be a cursory relative comparison between applications
   of custom-designed constructed wetland systems for specific water
   resources protection in Canada and northern China. Comparing constructed
   wetlands can be difficult and at times misleading; they are custom built
   to deal with specific target wastewater at specific locations and differ
   not only in physical shape and dimension, but in vegetation cover,
   hydraulic retention time, and pollutant loading rates. Treatment
   efficiencies defined by the Canadian and northern Chinese experience
   vary considerably. Experience in both countries shows that the majority
   of effluent values are generally better than those required by discharge
   standards in Canada and China. Examples provided from both countries
   demonstrated that plants can play a role in constructed wetland systems
   and make a difference in treatment efficiency. A review of the available
   case studies on cold weather treatment in both countries indicates that
   this technology is feasible in Canada and northern China, although
   further monitoring data are needed to optimize wetland design and ensure
   that the effluent quality standards are consistently met. Constructed
   wetland systems in both countries have an apparent advantage in
   construction costs, and the costs for treatment and operation and
   maintenance of these systems are much lower than those of conventional
   wastewater treatment plants. Land requirements for constructed wetlands
   present one of the factors most limiting their broader use, especially
   in China, where land resources are scarce and population density is
   high.}},

   system monitoring. Existing islanding detection methods, such as
   rate-of-change-of-frequency and vector shift are fast for processing
   local information; however, with the growth in installed capacity of
   DGs, they suffer from several drawbacks. Incumbent genset islanding
   detection cannot distinguish a system-wide disturbance from an islanding
   event, leading to maloperation. The problem is even more significant
   when the grid does not have sufficient inertia to limit frequency
   divergences in the system fault/stress due to the high penetration of
   DGs. To tackle such problems, this paper introduces PCA methods for
   islanding detection. A simple control chart is established for intuitive
   visualization of the transients. A recursive PCA scheme is proposed as a
   reliable extension of the PCA method to reduce the false alarms for
   time-varying process. To further reduce the computational burden, the
   approximate linear dependence condition errors are calculated to update
   the associated PCA model. The proposed PCA and RPCA methods are verified
   by detecting abnormal transients occurring in the U.K. utility network.}},

Abstract = {{As an emerging hole-machining methodology, helical milling process has
   become increasingly popular in aeromaterials manufacturing research,
   especially in areas of aircraft structural parts, dies, and molds
   manufacturing. Helical milling process is highly demanding due to its
   complex tool geometry and the progressive material failure on the
   workpiece. This paper outlines the development of a 3D finite element
   model for helical milling hole of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V using
   commercial FE code ABAQUS/Explicit. The proposed model simulates the
   helical milling hole process by taking into account the damage
   initiation and evolution in the workpiece material. A contact model at
   the interface between end-mill bit and workpiece has been established
   and the process parameters specified. Furthermore, a simulation
   procedure is proposed to simulate different cutting processes with the
   same failure parameters. With this finite element model, a series of
   FEAs for machined titanium alloy have been carried out and results
   compared with laboratory experimental data. The effects of machining
   parameters on helical milling have been elucidated, and the capability
   and advantage of FE simulation on helical milling process have been well
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Structural sandwich panels with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) skins are
   becoming an increasingly popular system because of their remarkable
   light weight, ease and speed of installation, and high thermal
   insulation capabilities. This paper looks into the potential for
   replacing conventional glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) skins with
   bio-based skins made of unidirectional flax fibers and a resin blend
   consisting of epoxidized pine oil. A comprehensive material testing
   program was first carried out on 70 standard tension and compression
   coupons. Then, 36 sandwich panels of 1,000 x 150 x 75 mm were tested
   under four-point loading. The number of flax fiber-reinforced polymer
   layers of skin was varied from one to five {[}in comparison to one layer
   of GFRP, an epoxidized pine oil resin blend to epoxy, and the wet layup
   (WL) fabrication method to vacuum bag molding]. Sandwich panels with
   three layers of flax fibers provided equivalent strength and stiffness,
   but better deformability, compared to panels with one layer of glass
   fibers. Epoxidized pine oil-based skins decreased strength by up to 23\%
   compared to epoxy-based skins. Vacuum-bagged panels decreased strength
   by up to 27\% compared to WL as a result of thinner skins. As the number
   of flax layers increased from one to five, failure modes transitioned
   from skin wrinkling in the constant moment region to core shear failure
   or compression skin crushing in the shear span. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{The increasing popularity of the social networking service, Twitter, has
   made it more involved in day-to-day communications, strengthening social
   relationships and information dissemination. Conversations on Twitter
   are now being explored as indicators within early warning systems to
   alert of imminent natural disasters such as earthquakes and aid prompt
   emergency responses to crime. Producers are privileged to have limitless
   access to market perception from consumer comments on social media and
   microblogs. Targeted advertising can be made more effective based on
   user profile information such as demography, interests and location.
   While these applications have proven beneficial, the ability to
   effectively infer the location of Twitter users has even more immense
   value. However, accurately identifying where a message originated from
   or an author's location remains a challenge, thus essentially driving
   research in that regard. In this paper, we survey a range of techniques
   applied to infer the location of Twitter users from inception to state
   of the art. We find significant improvements over time in the
   granularity levels and better accuracy with results driven by
   refinements to algorithms and inclusion of more spatial features.}},

Abstract = {{Combustion of switchgrass, a low-carbon fuel, generates energy and ash
   that can be recycled as a pozzolan in cement. This study aimed to
   optimize switchgrass combustion to achieve high-energy conversion and
   ash recycling value for cement. Combustion factors under investigation
   included temperature (350 degrees C, 450 degrees C, 550 degrees C, or
   650 degrees C) and retention time (1 h or 4 h). Energy release was
   quantified by thermogravimetric analysis-differential scanning
   calorimetry, and ash pozzolanic activity was assessed with the concrete
   strength test. A numeric simulation model of the pozzolanic reaction,
   based on unbiased experimental data from Ca(OH)(2)-ash suspensions,
   provided insight into how combustion conditions affected the pozzolanic
   properties of switchgrass ash. Consequently, combustion at 550 degrees C
   for 4 h was recommended for concurrently optimizing the ash pozzolanic
   activity (114\%) and energy output (4.21 kJ/g) from switchgrass. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the accuracy of new test methods developed to
   measure the air and water permeability of high-performance concretes
   (HPCs). Five representative HPC and one normal concrete (NC) mixtures
   were tested to estimate both repeatability and reliability of the
   proposed methods. Repeatability acceptance was adjudged using values of
   signal-noise ratio (SNR) and discrimination ratio (DR), and reliability
   was investigated by comparing against standard laboratory-based test
   methods (i.e., the RILEM gas permeability test and BS EN water
   penetration test). With SNR and DR values satisfying recommended
   criteria, it was concluded that test repeatability error has no
   significant influence on results. In addition, the research confirmed
   strong positive relationships between the proposed test methods and
   existing standard permeability assessment techniques. Based on these
   findings, the proposed test methods show strong potential to become
   recognized as international methods for determining the permeability of

Abstract = {{Throughout the European Union there is an increasing amount of wind
   generation being dispatched-down due to the binding of power system
   operating constraints from high levels of wind generation. This paper
   examines the impact a system non-synchronous penetration limit has on
   the dispatch-down of wind and quantifies the significance of
   interconnector counter-trading to the priority dispatching of wind
   power. A fully coupled economic dispatch and security constrained unit
   commitment model of the Single Electricity Market of the Republic of
   Ireland and Northern Ireland and the British Electricity Trading and
   Transmission Arrangement was used in this study. The key finding was
   interconnector counter-trading reduces the impact the system
   non-synchronous penetration limit has on the dispatch-down of wind. The
   capability to counter-trade on the interconnectors and an increase in
   system non-synchronous penetration limit from 50\% to 55\% reduces the
   dispatch-down of wind by 311 GW h and decreases total electricity
   payments to the consumer by (sic)1.72/MW h. In terms of the European
   Union electricity market integration, the results show the importance of
   developing individual electricity markets that allow system operators to
   counter-trade on interconnectors to ensure the priority dispatch of the
   increasing levels of wind generation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

   ETDM signal using DP 16-QAM is demonstrated by applying a fixed look-up
   table (LUT) based on maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) detection. The MAP
   detector is used to mitigate the effect of pattern dependent distortion
   in the transmitted signal arising from the high symbol rates. Different
   decision rules for the MAP detector are considered based on multiple
   observations of the same symbol as the detection window advances through
   the received symbol sequence. The back-toback optical signal-to-noise
   ratios for a bit error ratio of 10(-3) are 26.9 and 26.4 dB for the 448
   Gb/s signal (12\% overhead with 7\% for forward error correction (FEC)
   coding overhead) and 1.206 Tb/s superchannel signal (20\% overhead with
   15\% for FEC coding overhead), respectively. Compared to conventional
   MAP detection, a seven-symbol minimum distance MAP detector reduces the
   required OSNR by about 0.8 and 1 dB at the FEC thresholds of 3.8 x
   10(-3) and 1.9 x 10(-2) for the 448 Gb/s signal and 1.206 Tb/s

Abstract = {{Two phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs) improve the efficiency of
   fermentative processes by limiting the exposure of microorganisms to
   toxic solutes by sequestering them into a non-aqueous phase (NAP). A
   potential limitation of this technology, when using immiscible organic
   solvents as the NAP, is the cytoxicity that these materials may exert on
   the microbes. An improved TPPB configuration is one in which polymeric
   NAPs are used to replace organic solvents in order to take advantage of
   their low cost, improved handling qualities, and biocompatibility. A
   recent study has shown that low molecular weight polymers may confer
   improved solute uptake relative to high molecular weight polymers (i.e.,
   have higher partition coefficients), but it is unknown whether
   sufficiently low molecular weight polymers may inhibit cell growth. This
   study has investigated the biocompatibility of a range of low molecular
   weight polymers, and compared trends in biocompatibility to the
   well-established critical log P concept. This was achieved by
   determining the biocompatibility of polypropylene glycol polymers over a
   molecular weight (MW) range of 425-4,000 to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
   Pseudomonas putida, two organisms which have been previously used in
   TPPB systems. The lower MW polymers were shown to have lower average log
   P values, and showed more cytotoxicity than polymers of the same
   structure but with higher molecular weight. Since polymers are generally
   polydisperse (i.e., polymer samples contain a distribution of MWs),
   removal of the lower MW fractions via water washing was found to result
   in improved polymer biocompatibility. These results suggest that the
   critical log P concept remains useful for describing the toxicity of
   polymeric substances of different MWs, although it is complicated by the
   presence of the low MW fractions in the polymers arising from
   polydispersity. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2015;112: 2450-2458. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{The biosorption process of anionic dye Alizarin Red S (ARS) and cationic
   dye methylene blue (MB) as a function of contact time, initial
   concentration and solution pH onto olive stone (OS) biomass has been
   investigated. Equilibrium biosorption isotherms in single and binary
   systems and kinetics in batch mode were also examined. The kinetic data
   of the two dyes were better described by the pseudo second-order model.
   At low concentration, ARS dye appeared to follow a two-step diffusion
   process, while MB dye followed a three-step diffusion process. The
   biosorption experimental data for ARS and MB dyes were well suited to
   the Redlich-Peterson isotherm. The maximum biosorption of ARS dye,
   q(max) = 16.10 mg/g, was obtained at pH 3.28 and the maximum biosorption
   of MB dye, q(max) = 13.20 mg/g, was observed at basic pH values. In the
   binary system, it was indicated that the MB dye diffuses firstly inside
   the biosorbent particle and occupies the biosorption sites forming a
   monodentate complex and then the ARS dye enters and can only bind to
   untaken sites; forms a tridentate complex with OS active sites. (C) 2015

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{Decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) has shown promise as an adipogenic
   bioscaffold for soft tissue augmentation and reconstruction. The
   objective of the current study was to investigate the effects of
   allogeneic adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) on in vivo fat
   regeneration in DAT bioscaffolds using an immunocompetent rat model. ASC
   seeding significantly enhanced angiogenesis and adipogenesis, with cell
   tracking studies indicating that the newly-forming tissues were
   host-derived. Incorporating ASCs also mediated the inflammatory response
   and promoted a more constructive macrophage phenotype. A fraction of the
   CD163(+) macrophages in the implants expressed adipogenic markers, with
   higher levels of this ``adipocyte-like{''} phenotype in proximity to the
   developing adipose tissues. Our results indicate that the combination of
   ASCs and adipose extracellular matrix (ECM) provides an inductive
   microenvironment for adipose regeneration mediated by infiltrating host
   cell populations. The DAT scaffolds are a useful tissue-specific model
   system for investigating the mechanisms of in vivo adipogenesis that may
   help to develop a better understanding of this complex process in the
   context of both regeneration and disease. Overall, combining
   adipose-derived matrices with ASCs is a highly promising approach for
   the in situ regeneration of host-derived adipose tissue. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A radiofrequency heated micro-trickle bed reactor with two adjacent
   thermal zones was designed. In the first thermal zone, citronellal is
   converted to isopulegol over a H-ZSM-5 catalyst at 80 degrees C. This is
   followed by the second thermal zone where hydrogenation isopulegol to
   menthol occurs over a Pd/TiO2 catalyst at 70 degrees C. The two
   catalytic zones are separated by heating zones made of nickel ferrite
   particles that produce heat under radiofrequency field at 180 kHz. The
   position of the catalytic zones was determined based on a one
   dimensional heat transfer model, in which the actual flow pattern was
   approximated. Such configuration allows achieving desired temperatures
   in the catalyst beds whereas the inlet and outlet gas temperatures are
   close to ambient temperature which increases energy efficiency of the
   system. The overall product yield was increased by 9 times as compared
   with a single thermal zone configuration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Due to its efficiency and simplicity, the finite-difference time-domain
   method is becoming a popular choice for solving wideband, transient
   problems in various fields of acoustics. So far, the issue of extracting
   a binaural response from finite difference simulations has only been
   discussed in the context of embedding a listener geometry in the grid.
   In this paper, we propose and study a method for binaural response
   rendering based on a spatial decomposition of the sound field. The
   finite difference grid is locally sampled using a volumetric array of
   receivers, from which a plane wave density function is computed and
   integrated with free-field head related transfer functions, in the
   spherical harmonics domain. The volumetric array is studied in terms of
   numerical robustness and spatial aliasing. Analytic formulas that
   predict the performance of the array are developed, facilitating spatial
   resolution analysis and numerical binaural response analysis for a
   number of finite difference schemes. Particular emphasis is placed on
   the effects of numerical dispersion on array processing and on the
   resulting binaural responses. Our method is compared to a binaural
   simulation based on the image method. Results indicate good spatial and
   temporal agreement between the two methods.}},

Abstract = {{The current study reports original vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) for

   performed over the entire pressure-composition range for the T =
   (303.15, 313.15 and 328.15) K isotherms. The values obtained have been
   used for comparison of four predictive approaches, namely the equation
   of state (EoS) of Peng and Robinson (PR), the Soave modification of
   Benedict-Webb-Rubin (SBWR) EoS, the Critical Point-based Revised
   Perturbed-Chain Association Fluid Theory (CP-PC-SAFT) EoS, and the
   Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS). It has been
   demonstrated that the three EoS under consideration yield similar and
   qualitatively accurate predictions of VLE, which is not the case for the
   COSMO-RS model examined. Although CP-PC-SAFT EoS exhibits only minor
   superiority in comparison with PR and SBWR EoS in predicting VLE in the
   system under consideration, its relative complexity can be justified
   when taking into account the entire thermodynamic phase space and, in
   particular, considering the liquid densities and sound velocities over a
   wider pressure-volume-temperature range. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{It is important to understand how laser energy scatters within the
   transparent component in order to predict and optimize the laser
   transmission welding process. This paper examines the influence of part
   thickness, glass fiber and crystallinity levels on the distribution of
   laser light after transmission through amorphous polycarbonate (PC) and
   semi-crystalline polymers such as polyamide 6 (PA6), polypropylene (PP),
   and polyethylene (PE). An experimental technique based on laser-scanned
   lines of progressively increasing power was used to assess the
   transmitted energy distribution. This distribution was characterized
   using a two-parameter model that captures scattered and un-scattered
   components of the laser beam. The results clearly show how the
   scattering is increased by increasing the numbers of interactions
   between laser light and phase boundaries either by increasing the
   particle concentration (i.e., glass fiber level and crystallinity) or
   increasing part thickness. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{This letter provides a generalization of the well-known Wald test. The
   proposed generalized Wald test (GWT) is a Separating Function Estimation
   Test (SFET) which is a type of detector recently introduced for a wide
   class of composite problems. The test statistics of an SFET is an
   estimate of a real-valued Separating Function (SF). It is already proved
   that a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator of any SF leads to the
   optimal Uniformly Most Powerful unbiased detector. In many practical
   cases, such an optimal detector does not exist; hence, suboptimal ones
   are used, instead. Selecting an SF with a guaranteed performance is
   still an open problem which is investigated in this letter. First, we
   derive a lower bound for the detection probability of the SFET in terms
   of corresponding SF and the Fisher Information Matrix. Then we optimize
   the proposed bound with respect to the SF. The solution of the
   optimization problem leads to a generalization of the Wald test which is
   asymptotically optimal and reduces to the Wald detector in some special
   cases. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed GWT over
   its counterparts, namely, the Wald test and GLR detector in some
   examples.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with power oscillation damping in standalone
   microgrids (MGs) using an integrated series compensator. Power
   oscillation is the result of dynamic interaction between generating
   units and/or loads in a power system, which results in increased losses,
   power quality degradation, and momentary overloading of the converters
   used in converter-based grid-connected microsources (MSs) in MGs.
   Designing an MS controller to mitigate these oscillations is not
   straightforward as other performance criteria may need to be
   compromised. The proposed structure employs a small series compensator
   to mitigate the oscillations. In this paper, the dependence of
   power/frequency variation is analytically shown. It is explained how by
   introduction of a series voltage, this dependence can be minimized. The
   derivation of the small-signal model used for eigenvalue analysis is
   briefly explained. To validate the modeling and show the performance and
   robustness of the proposed controller, time-domain simulations are used.
   Discussions on the size of the proposed compensator and also on using
   different control parameters are presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors propose simple methods to evaluate the
   achievable rates and outage probability of a cognitive radio (CR) link
   that takes into account the imperfectness of spectrum sensing. In the
   considered system, the CR transmitter and receiver correlatively sense
   and dynamically exploit the spectrum pool via dynamic frequency hopping.
   Under imperfect spectrum sensing, false-alarm and miss-detection occur
   which cause impulsive interference emerged from collisions due to the
   simultaneous spectrum access of primary and cognitive users. That makes
   it very challenging to evaluate the achievable rates. By first examining
   the static link where the channel is assumed to be constant over time,
   they show that the achievable rate using a Gaussian input can be
   calculated accurately through a simple series representation. In the
   second part of this study, they extend the calculation of the achievable
   rate to wireless fading environments. To take into account the effect of
   fading, they introduce a piece-wise linear curve fitting-based method to
   approximate the instantaneous achievable rate curve as a combination of
   linear segments. It is then demonstrated that the ergodic achievable
   rate in fast fading and the outage probability in slow fading can be
   calculated to achieve any given accuracy level.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution circular spectropolarimetric observations, obtained with
   ESPaDOnS in the context of the BinaMIcS Large Program, have revealed a
   magnetic field in the B3V secondary component of the SB2 binary system
   epsilon Lupi (B2/B3). As the B2V primary is already known to be
   magnetic, this is the first detection of a magnetic field in both
   components of an earlytype binary system. The longitudinal magnetic
   field of the primary is similar to-200 G; that of the secondary similar
   to+100 G. Observations can be approximately reproduced by a model
   assuming the magnetic axes of the two stars are anti-aligned, and
   roughly parallel to their respective rotation axes. Estimated
   magnetospheric radii indicate a high probability that their
   magnetospheres are interacting. As many of the arguments for the
   different proposed formation scenarios of fossil magnetic fields rely
   upon evidence drawn from investigations of close binaries, in particular
   the rarity of magnetic ABO stars in close binaries and the previous
   absence of any known close binary with two magnetic, massive stars, this
   discovery may be an important new constraint on the origin of fossil
   magnetic fields.}},

Abstract = {{In diabetic patients the development of chronic non-healing wounds is a
   common complication. A methacrylic acid-based biomaterial is a vascular
   regenerative material that enhances diabetic healing without the use of
   cells or growth factors. The bioactive nature of this material is
   thought to be associated with its anionic charge or surface chemistry.
   Contact between the methacrylic acid-based biomaterial and tissue begins
   with protein (including complement) adsorption and is followed by
   interaction of the biomaterial with resident and infi ltrating cells in
   the wound bed (e.g., macrophages and endothelial cells). This results in
   changes to their surface receptors to activate phosphorylation cascades
   that lead to differential activation of signalling pathways such as
   those involving osteopontin and sonic hedgehog. These changes modulate
   the phenotype of the cells in the wound bed, eventually improving vessel
   formation and wound healing. Understanding the molecular and cellular
   mechanisms will have broad implications for biomaterials, not just the
   methacrylic acid-based material, and will facilitate the advancement of
   regenerative biomaterials for diverse applications.}},

   An intuitive and accurate quantum optics approach using quasinormal

Volume = {{92}},

Abstract = {{We study the quantum dynamics of two quantum dots (QDs) or artificial
   atoms coupled through the fundamental localized plasmon of a gold
   nanorod resonator. We derive an intuitive and efficient time-local
   master equation, in which the effect of the metal nanorod is taken into
   consideration self-consistently using a quasinormal mode (QNM) expansion
   technique of the photon Green function. Our efficient QNM technique
   offers an alternative and more powerful approach over the standard
   Jaynes-Cummings model, where the radiative decay, nonradiative decay,
   and spectral reshaping effect of the electromagnetic environment is
   rigorously included in a clear and transparent way. We also show how one
   can use our approach to compliment the approximate Jaynes-Cummings model
   in certain spatial regimes where it is deemed to be valid. We then
   present a study of the quantum dynamics and photoluminescence spectra of
   the two plasmon-coupled QDs. We first explore the non-Markovian regime,
   which is found to be important only on the ultrashort time scale of the
   plasmon mode which is about 40 fs. For the field free evolution case of
   excited QDs near the nanorod, we demonstrate how spatially separated QDs
   can be effectively coupled through the plasmon resonance and we show how
   frequencies away from the plasmon resonance can be more effective for
   coherently coupling the QDs. Despite the strong inherent dissipation of
   gold nanoresonators, we show that qubit entanglements as large as 0.7
   can be achieved from an initially separate state, which has been limited
   to less than 0.5 in previous work for weakly coupled reservoirs. We also
   study the superradiance and subradiance decay dynamics of the QD pair.
   Finally, we investigate the rich quantum dynamics of QDs that are
   incoherently pumped, and study the polarization dependent behavior of
   the emitted photoluminescence spectrum where a double-resonance
   structure is observed due to the strong photon exchange interactions.
   Our general quantum plasmonics formalism can easily be extended to
   include multiple QDs interacting through the QNMs of metallic resonator
   structures, fully accounting for radiative and nonradiative coupling, as
   well as nonlinear light-matter interaction processes.}},

Abstract = {{Electroless nickel composite coatings with silicon carbide, SiC, as
   reinforcing particles deposited with Ni-P onto aluminium alloy, LM24,
   having zincating as under layer were subjected to heat treatment using
   air furnace. The changes at the interface were investigated using
   scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) to
   probe the chemistry changes upon heat treatmen{[}. Microharclness tester
   with various loads using both Knoop and Vickers inclenters was used to
   study the load effect clubbed with the influence of second phase
   particles on the coating at the vicinity of the interface. It was
   observed that zinc was absent at the interface after elevated
   temperature heat treatment at 400-500 degrees C. Precipitation of copper
   and nickel with a distinct demarcafion (copper rich belt) along the
   coating interface was seen with irregular thickness of the order of 1
   pm. Migration of copper from the bulk aluminium alloy could have been
   the factor. Brittleness of the coating was confirmed on heat treatment
   when indened with Vickers. However, in composite coating the propagation
   of the microcrack was stopped by the embedded particles but the
   microcracks continue in the matrix when not interrupted by second phase
   particles (SiC). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved}},

Title = {{Systematic network coding for two-hop lossy transmissions}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider network transmissions over a single or
   multiple parallel two-hop lossy paths. These scenarios occur in
   applications such as sensor networks or WiFi offloading. Random linear
   network coding (RLNC), where previously received packets are re-encoded
   at intermediate nodes and forwarded, is known to be a capacity-achieving
   approach for these networks. However, a major drawback of RLNC is its
   high encoding and decoding complexity. In this work, a systematic
   network coding method is proposed. We show through both analysis and
   simulation that the proposed method achieves higher end-to-end rate as
   well as lower computational cost than RLNC for finite field sizes and
   finite-sized packet transmissions.}},

Title = {{Liquids with permanent porosity}},
Journal = {{NATURE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Porous solids such as zeolites(1) and metal-organic frameworks(2,3) are
   useful in molecular separation and in catalysis, but their solid nature
   can impose limitations. For example, liquid solvents, rather than porous
   solids, are the most mature technology for post-combustion capture of
   carbon dioxide because liquid circulation systems are more easily
   retrofitted to existing plants. Solid porous adsorbents offer major
   benefits, such as lower energy penalties in adsorption-desorption
   cycles(4), but they are difficult to implement in conventional flow
   processes. Materials that combine the properties of fluidity and
   permanent porosity could therefore offer technological advantages, but
   permanent porosity is not associated with conventional liquids(5). Here
   we report free-flowing liquids whose bulk properties are determined by
   their permanent porosity. To achieve this, we designed cage
   molecules(6,7) that provide a well-defined pore space and that are
   highly soluble in solvents whose molecules are too large to enter the
   pores. The concentration of unoccupied cages can thus be around 500
   times greater than in other molecular solutions that contain
   cavities(8-10), resulting in a marked change in bulk properties, such as
   an eightfold increase in the solubility of methane gas. Our results
   provide the basis for development of a new class of functional porous
   materials for chemical processes, and we present a one-step, multigram
   scale-up route for highly soluble `scrambled' porous cages prepared from
   a mixture of commercially available reagents. The unifying design
   principle for these materials is the avoidance of functional groups that
   can penetrate into the molecular cage cavities.}},
