Abstract = {{Solid-state rheometry and model compound reactions are used to
   investigate free radical reactions of N-arylmaleimide coagents with
   saturated and unsaturated polymers. N,N'-m-phenylene dimaleimide (BMI)
   is shown to provide superior cross-link densities over diacrylate and
   diallyl coagents for all of the polymers studied, including linear low
   density polyethylene (LLDPE), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO),
   cis-poly(butadiene) (PBD) and cis-poly(isoprene) (PIP). Studies of the
   N-phenylmaleimide (NPM) + cis-cyclooctane system show that C-H bond
   addition to yield N-aryl-2-alkylsuccimide grafts is the predominant
   reaction pathway, as opposed to maleimide homopolymerization. In
   contrast, peroxide-initiated reactions of cis-cyclooctene with small NPM
   concentrations generate highly alternating
   poly(cycloctene-alt-N-phenylmaleimide) in high yield, indicating that
   unsaturated mers in materials such as PBD engage maleimides in an
   efficient alternating copolymerization between electron-rich and
   electron-deficient monomer pairs. Factors that affect the reactivity of
   different polymers in these C-H bond additions and alternating
   copolymerizations are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Relay selection (RS) has widely been studied for both decode-and-forward
   (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) protocols, and relay ordering (RO) was
   recently proposed for the AF protocol only {[}1]. The two strategies, RS
   and RO, have been individually shown to be very effective to enhance the
   performance of cooperative relay networks. In this letter, we first
   discuss the fundamental difference of the two schemes and investigate an
   important tradeoff in terms of spectral efficiency and energy efficiency
   between RS and RO. Specifically, RS is more spectrally efficient,
   whereas RO can be more efficient in energy consumption. Then we
   demonstrate that indeed RS and RO generally have different outage
   performance and may complement each other depending on channel
   conditions. To optimize the outage performance, therefore, we combine
   the two strategies, RS and RO, and we propose joint RS-RO, followed by
   exact outage probability derivation of the joint RS-RO in closed-form.
   Finally, we obtain some interesting insights into the issue of selecting
   efficient transmission schemes between RS and RO.}},

Abstract = {{A unique infiltration tracer experiment Was performed whereby a
   fluorescent dye was applied to the land surface in an agricultural
   field, near Perth, Ontario, Canada. to simulate the transport of solutes
   to two pumped monitoring wells drilled into the granitic gneiss aquifer.
   This experiment, interpreted using the discrete-fracture capability of
   the numerical model HydroGeoSphere, showed that solute transport from
   the surface through thin soil (less than 2 m) to wells in fractured
   bedrock can be extremely rapid (on the order of hours). Also, it was
   demonstrated that maximum concentrations of contaminants originating
   from the ground surface will not necessarily be the highest in the
   shallow aquifer horizon. These are important considerations for both
   private and government-owned drinking water systems that draw water from
   shallow fractured bedrock aquifers. This research illustrates the
   extreme importance of protecting drinking water at the source. (C) 2012

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{233}},
Pages = {{34-39}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{It is shown that NMR is a very effective method for monitoring the
   semiconductor photocatalytic oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde and
   benzoic acid and that this is achieved in situ in an NMR tube on a much
   smaller scale than commonly used in the literature, using either a
   dispersion or film of the semiconductor. Maximum percentage conversions
   to benzaldehyde and benzoic acid of 27\% (after 45 min) and 41\% (after
   75 min), respectively are reported using a titania film coated NMR tube.
   Similar percentage conversion values using a dispersion of the
   semiconductor in an NMR tube were obtained but over a slightly longer
   time scale (60 min c.f. 45 min). On a much larger scale (100 mL instead
   of 1.5 mL), the yields were also similar but much slower to reach (ca.
   10 times). The marked reduction in photocatalytic efficiency using a
   dispersion on a large scale is probably due to the increased degree of
   light scattering and poor light penetration compared with the
   translucent titania film coating or dispersion in an NMR tube. The
   benefits and use of this titania film/NMR approach as a rapid screening
   method in semiconductor photocatalytic organic synthesis are discussed.

Abstract = {{Although many gold heterogeneous catalysts have been shown to exhibit
   significant activity and high selectivity for a wide range of reactions
   in both the liquid and gas phases, they are prone to irreversible
   deactivation. This is often associated with sintering or loss of the
   interaction of the gold with the support. Herein, we report on the use
   of methyl iodide as a method of dispersing gold nanoparticles supported
   on silica, titania, and alumina supports. In the case of titania- and
   alumina-based catalysts, the gold was transformed from nanometer
   particles into small clusters and some atomically dispersed gold. In
   contrast, although there was a drop in the gold particle size on the
   silica support following CH3I treatment, the size remained in the
   submicrometer range. The structural changes were correlated with changes
   in the selectivity and activity for ethanol dehydration and benzyl
   alcohol oxidation. From these observations, it is clear that this
   treatment provides a method by which deactivated gold catalysts can be
   reactivated via redispersion of the gold.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation was carried out to evaluate the hydration
   characteristics and compressive strength development of cement paste
   containing various supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), viz.
   pulverised fuel ash (PFA), ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS)
   and microsilica (MS). Cement pastes were prepared in two series (A and
   B). Mixes of series A were manufactured with a fixed water-binder ratio
   of 0.30 and a superplasticiser, whereas the water-binder ratios of mixes
   in series B were equivalent to those needed for standard consistencies.
   The XRD and TG data showed that the addition of PFA, GGBS and MS reduced
   the intensity of Ca(OH)(2) peaks at test ages of 3, 7, 28 and 91 days.
   The incorporation of PFA and GGBS in the cement paste mixes produced a
   lower strength value at early age. However, at later ages, the strength
   was either greater or comparable to the control specimen. Although the
   compressive strength of cement paste containing 15\% MS was greater than
   that of the PFA and GGBS pastes at all ages, from a cost point of view,
   it can be suggested that combinations of 40\% PFA and 7.5\% MS or 50\%
   GGBS and 7.5\% MS may be best to improve the hydration properties and

Abstract = {{The effect of foil orientation on damage accumulation behavior in
   commercial purity magnesium is investigated by in situ electron and ion
   irradiation. Transmission electron microscope has been used to study the
   dislocation loops formed by the agglomeration of point defects during
   irradiation. It has been observed that the ratio of prism plane to basal
   plane defects increases as the foil orientation is changed from basal to
   the prism foil. The ratio of vacancy to interstitial defects also
   increases in prism foils as compared to the basal foils. This point
   defect accumulation behavior is reversed when magnesium is irradiated
   with 1 MeV Kr2+ ions and the formation of basal plane dislocation loops
   were only observed in prism foils and did not take place in the basal
   foils. Analysis showed that all the basal plane dislocation loops have
   Burgers vector of the type 1/6(2 0 2 3) and are interstitial in nature
   whereas prism plane dislocation loops have Burgers vector of the type
   1/3(1 1 2 0) and are of mixed interstitial/vacancy in character.
   In situ annealing experiments at different temperatures performed on
   electron irradiated magnesium foils suggest that those dislocation loops
   that become thermodynamically unstable anneal out in a matter of few
   seconds whereas other stable dislocation loops continue to shrink by
   absorbing surrounding vacancy clusters. The activation energy for the
   shrinkage of the interstitial dislocation loops has been derived and the
   results show that the shrinkage of interstitial dislocation loops takes
   place by the mechanism of vacancy assisted self diffusion. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{A method for registration of speckle-tracked freehand 3D ultrasound (US)
   to preoperative CT volumes of the spine is proposed. We register the US
   volume to the CT volume by creating individual US ``sub-volumes{''},
   each consisting of a small section of the entire US volume. The
   registration proceeds incrementally from the beginning of the US volume
   to the end, registering every sub-volume, where each sub-volume contains
   overlapping images with the previous sub-volume. Each registration is
   performed by generating simulated US images from the CT volume. As a
   by-product of our registration, the significant drift error common in
   speckle-tracked US volumes is corrected for. Results are validated
   through a phantom study of plastic spine phantoms created from clinical
   patient CT data as well as an animal study using a lamb cadaver. Results
   demonstrate that we were able to successfully register a speckle-tracked
   US volume to CT volume in four out of five phantoms with a success rate
   of greater than 98\%. The final error of the registered US volumes
   decreases by over 50 percent from the speckle tracking error to
   consistently below 3 mm. Studies on the lamb cadaver showed a mean
   registration error consistently below 2 mm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Time-dependent behaviour of the Bearpaw Shale in oedometric loading and

Journal = {{CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{427-441}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Time-dependent behaviour can have a significant influence on the
   compressibility characteristics of soils. However, most of the research
   on this topic has investigated the behaviour of soft soils. In this
   paper, the time-dependent behaviour of a hard clay shale (Bearpaw Shale)
   is investigated using both one-dimensional multi-staged loading (MSL)
   oedometer and constant rate of strain (CRS) oedometer consolidation
   tests conducted on 25.0 and 16.9 mm diameter specimens. The results show
   that soft clays and hard clay shales that share the same C-alpha
   e/C-c{*} ratio (where C-alpha e is the secondary compression index and
   C-c{*} is the incremental compression index) will show the same
   approximately 7\% change in pre-consolidation pressure for an increase
   of one log cycle of strain rate despite the many orders of magnitude
   difference in pre-consolidation pressure. In the case of the Bearpaw
   Shale, this 7\% change in pre-consolidation pressure corresponds to
   approximately 700 kPa. The time-dependent behaviour of the Bearpaw Shale
   during unloading (C-alpha e/C-s{*}, where C-s{*} is the incremental
   swelling index) was observed to follow a similar ratio to that observed
   in compression (C-alpha e/C-c{*}). While the exact nature of the
   compression and swelling events that have occurred over the life of the
   Bearpaw Formation is not clear, the influence of secondary compression
   cannot be ignored for interpretation of the geological history of this
   deposit.}},

Title = {{Physical models of rock avalanche spreading behaviour with dynamic

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{460-476}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The dynamic fragmentation of rock during avalanche motion has been
   postulated as a mechanism explaining the long runout of large rock
   avalanches or Sturzstrome. This paper investigates whether test
   conditions that produce dynamic fragmentation can lead to greater runout
   or spreading of physical model rock avalanches. Model avalanche
   experiments were carried out under enhanced acceleration to generate
   breakage in coal, a fragmentable, brittle solid. Coal blocks were
   released from a stationary position on a slope to run out on a plane.
   The motion of the ensuing fragmenting debris was captured using a
   high-speed camera placed above the horizontal plane. The average
   position of the front was tracked and the degree of fragmentation of the
   model avalanches was quantified. The paper presents results of the
   frontal velocity of the avalanches, corrected for centrifuge Coriolis
   effects. Comparison is made between the peak and impulsive front
   velocities, the final runout, and the degree of fragmentation of the
   model avalanches. Strong relationships are found between runout
   normalized by the cube root of volume, impulse velocity, and Hardin's
   relative breakage parameter, B-R. Results are discussed in light of the
   mechanics involved and are compared with field-scale events.}},

Abstract = {{An approximate analysis of gas absorption with instantaneous reaction in

   diffusivity ratio of the liquid reactant to the dissolved gas (?), the
   enhancement factor tends to be either lower or higher than the
   prediction of the classical enhancement factor equation based on the
   penetration theory (Ei,pen) at Fourier numbers typically larger than
   0.1. An empirical correlation valid for all Fourier numbers is proposed
   to allow a quick estimation of the enhancement factor, which describes
   the prediction of the approximate solution and the simulation data with

   temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), such as high electrical conductivity,
   negligible vapor pressure and good thermal stability. It consists of
   three Pt wires piercing through a Teflon rod, whose exposed head is
   coated with a steadily adhesive thin RTIL film assuring the necessary
   electrical conductivity among the electrodes. The negligible vapor
   pressure of the immobilized RTIL layer makes possible to eliminate the
   need for the use of membranes, thus avoiding the involvement of a slow
   limiting step such as analyte permeation. Preliminary voltammetric tests
   performed at this sensor in gaseous atmospheres proved that the
   oxidation of NO2 and NO occurs at very close potentials, thus allowing
   effective NOx determinations. Instead, other atmospheric components able
   to act as possible interfering species (CO, H2S and SO2) were found to
   undergo oxidation only at quite higher potentials. The performance of
   this device was assayed under flowing conditions on synthetic nitrogen
   atmospheres with controlled NOx contents, which was changed in a wide
   range (0.01103 ppm v/v). At room temperature, repeatable (+/- 3.9\%) and
   linearly dependent current signals were recorded, allowing a detection
   limit of 0.96 ppb v/v to be inferred. At higher temperatures (100
   degrees C) a lower detection limit (0.55 ppb v/v) could be instead
   estimated. The possibility of using this sensor for monitoring NOx in
   reduced pressure atmospheres was also assayed.}},

Abstract = {{In order to understand how an energy storage system (ESS)-based
   stabiliser suppresses a power system inter-area oscillation in a
   multi-machine power system, this study proposes a tie-line power
   oscillation-related ESS linearised model. Based on the linearised model,
   a general conclusion is established to assess the capability of the
   ESS-based stabiliser to affect the damping of the inter-area power
   oscillation. Analysis derived from the general conclusion explains how
   and why the robustness of the ESS stabiliser is different to the
   variations of the loading conditions of the tie transmission line when
   the stabiliser is realised by controlling the exchange of either active
   or reactive power between the ESS and the rest of the power system. It
   is analytically concluded that when the stabiliser is implemented via
   controlling the exchange of active power, the stabiliser is of better
   robustness. The study presents an example multi-machine power system
   installed with a battery energy storage system (BESS)-based stabiliser.
   Results of eigensolutions computation and non-linear simulation
   demonstrate and confirm the analytical conclusion about the robustness
   of the ESS-based stabiliser in suppressing the inter-area power

Abstract = {{With the increasing interest of using inertial measurement units (IMU)
   in human biomechanics studies, methods dealing with inertial sensor
   measurement errors become more and more important. Pre-test calibration
   and in-test error compensation are commonly used to minimize the sensor
   errors and improve the accuracy of the walking speed estimation results.
   However, the performance of a given sensor error compensation method
   does not only depend on the accuracy of the calibration or the sensor
   error evaluation, but also strongly relies on the selected sensor error
   model. The best performance could be achieved only when the essential
   components of sensor errors are included and compensated. Two new sensor
   error models, with the concerns about sensor acceleration measurement
   biases and sensor attachment misalignment, have been developed. The
   performance of these two error models were evaluated in the
   shank-mounted IMU-based walking speed/inclination estimation algorithm
   with a comparison of an existing error model. The treadmill walking
   experiment, conducted at both level and incline conditions, demonstrated
   the importance of sensor error model selection on the spatio-temporal
   gait parameter estimation performance. Accurate walking inclination
   estimation was made possible with a newly developed sensor error model.}},

Abstract = {{Over recent years, a number of marine autopilots designed using linear
   techniques have underperformed owing to their inability to cope with
   nonlinear vessel dynamics. To this end, a new design framework for the
   development of nonlinear autopilots is proposed. Local Control Networks
   (LCNs) can be used in the design of nonlinear control systems. In this
   paper, a LCN approach is taken in the design of a nonlinear autopilot
   for controlling the nonlinear yaw dynamics of an unmanned surface
   vehicle known as Springer. It is considered the approach is the first of
   its kind to be used in marine control systems design. Simulation results
   are presented and the performance of the nonlinear autopilot is compared
   with that of an existing Springer Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG)
   autopilot using standard system performance criteria. From the results
   it can be concluded the LCN autopilot out-performed that based on LQG
   techniques in terms of the selected criteria. Also it provided more
   energy saving control strategies and would thereby increase operational
   duration times for the vehicle during real-time missions.}},

Abstract = {{A technique for automatic exploration of the genetic search region
   through fuzzy coding (Sharma and Irwin. 2003) has been proposed. Fuzzy
   coding (FC) provides the value of a variable on the basis of the optimum
   number of selected fuzzy sets and their effectiveness in terms of
   degree-of-membership. It is an indirect encoding method and has been
   shown to perform better than other conventional binary, Gray and
   floating-point encoding methods. However, the static range of the
   membership functions is a major problem in fuzzy coding, resulting in
   longer times to arrive at an optimum solution in large or complicated
   search spaces.
   This paper proposes a new algorithm, called fuzzy coding with a dynamic
   range (FCDR), which dynamically allocates the range of the variables to
   evolve an effective search region, thereby achieving faster convergence.
   Results are presented for two benchmark optimisation problems, and also
   for a case study involving neural identification of a highly non-linear
   pH neutralisation process from experimental data. It is shown that
   dynamic exploration of the genetic search region is effective for
   parameter optimisation in problems where the search space is
   complicated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the concept of in-loop filters in phase-locked loop
   (PLL) systems. The in-loop filters are derived from an optimization
   perspective, and an analytical method to design the controlling
   parameters of a PLL with in-loop filters is also presented. Such filters
   can also be selected as conventional window functions in which case they
   can be tuned to reject certain frequency components similar to the
   discrete Fourier transform. In this paper, a rigorous method to
   introduce the concept of in-loop filters and window functions into PLL
   systems is presented. This method enables smoother estimation of the
   signal parameters such as phase angle, frequency, and amplitude in the
   presence of noise and harmonics. The in-loop filters can be adjusted to
   completely remove specific harmonics. The method is first developed for
   a single-phase enhanced PLL system and is then extended to three-phase
   PLLs including the well-known synchronous-reference-frame PLL.
   Simulation and experimental results are also included.}},

Abstract = {{Kar3 kinesins are microtubule (MT) minus-end-directed motors with
   pleiotropic functions in mitotic spindle formation and nuclear movement
   in budding and fission yeasts. A Kar3-like kinesin is also expressed by
   the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypi, which exhibits different nuclear
   movement challenges from its yeast relatives. Presented here is a 2.35
   angstrom crystal structure and enzymatic analysis of the AgKar3 motor
   domain (AgKar3MD). Compared to the previously published Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae Kar3MD structure (ScKar3MD), AgKar3MD displays differences in
   the conformation of some of its nucleotide-binding motifs and peripheral
   elements. Unlike ScKar3MD, the salt bridge between Switch I and Switch
   II in AgKar3MD is broken. Most of the Switch I, and the adjoining region
   of helix a3, are also disordered instead of bending into the active site
   cleft as is observed in ScKar3MD. These aspects of AgKar3MD are highly
   reminiscent of the ScKar3 R598A mutant that disrupts the Switch ISwitch
   II salt bridge and impairs MT-stimulated ATPase activity of the motor.
   Subtle differences in the disposition of secondary structure elements in
   the small lobe (beta 1a, beta 1b, and beta 1c) at the edge of the MD are
   also apparent even though it contains approximately the same number of
   residues as ScKar3. These differences may reflect the unique enzymatic
   properties we measured for this motor, which include a lower
   MT-stimulated ATPase rate relative to ScKar3, or they could relate to
   its interactions with different regulatory companion proteins than its
   budding yeast counterpart. Proteins 2011;. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Simulated lung fluids are solutions designed to mimic the composition of
   human interstitial lung fluid as closely as possible. Analysis of
   mineral dusts using such solutions has been used to evaluate the
   respiratory bioaccessibility of various elements for which solubility in
   the lungs is a primary determinant of reactivity. The objective of this
   study was to employ simulated lung fluid analysis to investigate the
   respiratory bioaccessibility of nickel in soils. Current occupational
   guidelines in Australia regulate nickel compounds in terms of water
   solubility, though this may not be an accurate estimation of the total
   nickel that will dissociate in the lungs. Surface soils were collected
   from the city of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, the site of an
   operational nickel smelter and metal mining activities. The fraction of
   the samples less than 10 mu m was extracted from the soil, and it was
   this sub-10-mu m fraction that was found to hold most of the total
   nickel present in the soil. The fine fraction was analyzed using a
   simulated lung fluid (modified Gamble's solution) to isolate the nickel
   phases soluble in the lungs. In addition, a sequential extraction was
   employed to compare the bioaccessible fraction to those dissolved from
   different binding forms in the soil. In all samples, the simulated lung
   fluid extracted more nickel than the two weakest leaches of the
   sequential extraction combined, providing a more representative nickel
   bioaccessibility value than the current water leach method.}},

Abstract = {{Contractual incentives have been increasingly practised in construction
   projects. In this study, a questionnaire survey is carried out in the
   United Kingdom (UK) and the Republic of Ireland (ROI) to analyse the
   relationship between the use of incentives and the performance of a
   project. The analysis is made in a comparative way. First of all, four
   payment methods are compared in terms of their impact on cost
   performance. Secondly, incentive projects are compared with
   non-incentive projects in terms of time and quality performance.
   Thirdly, both time and quality performances are compared between the
   projects with a single incentive and those with multiple incentives. The
   analysis results provide empirical evidence for the significant impact
   of incentive mechanisms on project performance. Subsequent to the
   questionnaire survey, a case study is conducted to examine how to
   appropriately apply incentives in practice, revealing that the use of
   incentives aligns the contractor's objectives with the client's
   expectations in a project and in order to ensure the success of
   incentive mechanisms the contractor needs to make extra efforts for the
   enhancement of project management processes, the creation of
   collaborative working environments, and the motivation of his staff and
   workforce. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. and IPMA. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Suitable alpha-cellulose and cellulose II powders for use in the
   pharmaceutical industry can be derived from maize cob. alpha-Cellulose
   was extracted from an agricultural residue (maize cobs) using a
   non-dissolving method based on inorganic substances. Modification of
   this alpha-cellulose was carried out by its dissolution in the ionic
   liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ({[}C(4)mim]Cl), and
   subsequent regeneration by addition of either water or acetone at room
   temperature, or of boiling water. X-ray diffraction and infrared
   spectroscopy results showed that the regenerated celluloses had lower
   crystallinity, and proved that the treatment with {[}C(4)mim]Cl led to
   the conversion of the crystalline structure of alpha-cellulose from
   cellulose I to cellulose II. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential
   scanning calorimetry data showed quite similar thermal behavior for all
   cellulose samples, although with somewhat lower stability for the
   regenerated celluloses, as expected. The comparison of physicochemical
   properties of the regenerated celluloses and the native cellulose mainly
   suggests that the regenerated ones might have better flow properties.
   For some of the characterizations carried out, it was generally observed
   that the sample regenerated with boiling water had more similar
   characteristics to the alpha-cellulose sample, evidencing an influence
   of the regeneration strategy on the resulting powder after the ionic
   liquid treatment.}},

Abstract = {{An adaptive phase-locked loop (PLL) structure is proposed which offers
   fast and smooth tracking of phase-angle jumps. Correlatively, it offers
   soft startup stage and avoids undesired frequency swings caused by phase
   jumps. The adaptive mechanism adjusts the gain of frequency estimation
   loop in order to mitigate large transients of frequency during sudden
   phase angle variations. This reduces the coupling of phase and frequency
   variables and allows tremendously faster and smoother estimation of both
   variables. The proposed adaptive mechanism can be applied to different
   PLL and adaptive notch-filter systems three of which including the
   enhanced PLL (EPLL), the synchronous reference frame PLL (SRF-PLL), and
   the second order generalized integrator frequency-locked loop (SOGI-FLL)
   are studied in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
   examine the mechanism by which acetaldehyde is formed on platinum in a
   typical direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC). A pathway is found involving
   the formation of a strongly hydrogen-bonded complex between adsorbed
   ethanol and the surface hydroxyl (OH) species, followed by the facile
   alpha-dehydrogenation of ethanol, with spontaneous weakening of the
   hydrogen bond in favor of adsorbed acetaldehyde and water. This
   mechanism is found to be comparably viable on both the close-packed
   surface and the monatomic steps. Comparison of further reactions on
   these two sites strongly indicates that the steps act as net removers of
   acetaldehyde from the product stream, while the flat surface acts as a
   net producer.}},

Title = {{Oligocene-Miocene back-thrusting in southern Mexico linked to the rapid
   subduction erosion of a large forearc block}},
Journal = {{TECTONICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{31}},
Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Both the timing and mechanism for the removal of a similar to 150-250 km
   wide forearc block from southern Mexico during the Cenozoic are
   controversial. Principal competing hypotheses are (1) removal due to
   sinistral strike-slip shear, in which slow, diachronous removal of the
   Chortis Block throughout the Cenozoic is inferred, and (2) removal due
   to subduction erosion, in which rapid removal of a large forearc block
   during the late Oligocene/early Miocene is inferred to be synchronous
   with the rapid landward migration of the southern Mexican arc. New data
   indicate northeast-directed back-thrusting in (1) the Chacalapa shear
   zone west of -96.5 degrees E, with the timing of shear deformation
   bracketed by a 25.5 +/- 0.5 Ma U/Pb zircon age and a 20.7 +/- 0.6 Ma
   Ar/Ar biotite age, and (2) in an unnamed shear zone to the south, with
   the timing of deformation bracketed by a 27.5 +/- 0.5 Ma U/Pb zircon age
   and a 25.1 +/- 0.2 Ma Ar/Ar biotite age. Zircon and biotite ages date
   the emplacement and cooling of deformed plutons, respectively. The
   observed back-thrusting is consistent with a model of forearc removal
   due to subduction-erosion processes because it is evidence for
   subduction-orthogonal shortening occurring within the upper plate just
   before the landward migration of the southern Mexican arc. Rapid
   subduction of the southern Mexican forearc could have recycled
   continental lithosphere into the upper mantle at a rate up to half the
   global average rate of subduction erosion during the late
   Oligocene/early Miocene.}},

Abstract = {{We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the resonance
   fluorescence spectra of an coherently-driven quantum dot (QD) placed
   inside a high-Qsemiconductor cavity and interacting with an
   acoustic-phonon bath. We derive a quantum master equation (ME) in the
   polaron frame, which includes exciton-phonon and exciton-cavity coupling
   to all orders. This work details and extends the theory used in a recent
   paper {[}C. Roy and S. Hughes, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 247403 (2011)] to
   describe the QD Mollow triplet in the regime of semiconductor cavity
   QED. Here, we introduce two ME forms, Nakajima-Zwanzig and time
   convolutionless (TC), both to second order in the
   system-phonon-reservoir perturbation. In the polaron frame, these two ME
   forms are shown to yield equivalent population dynamics and fluorescence
   spectra for a continuous wave (cw) driving field. We also demonstrate
   that a Markov approximation is valid for computing the incoherent
   scattering processes, and we subsequently exploit the TC ME to explore
   the resonance fluorescence spectra of an exciton-driven QD. Both
   cavity-emitted and exciton-emitted spectra are studied, and these are
   found to have qualitatively different spectral features. Using a
   coherent driving field, the well-known characteristics of the atomic
   Mollow triplet are shown to be considerably modified with
   electron-acoustic-phonon scattering, and we highlight the key effects
   arising from both cavity coupling and electron-phonon coupling. Regimes
   of pronounced cavity feeding and anharmonic cavity QED are exemplified,
   and we find that the cavity coupling depends sensitively on the
   exciton-cavity detuning and the temperature of the phonon bath. We show
   how the full width at half maximum (linewidth) of the Mollow-triplet
   sidebands varies as a function of the square of the Rabi frequency of
   the cw pump. Phonon-mediated cavity coupling also contributes to the
   spectral broadening of the Mollow triplet, depending upon the
   exciton-cavity detuning and the strength of the exciton-cavity coupling
   rate. Finally, we calculate the fluorescence spectra for off-resonance
   cw driving and investigate the resulting Mollow-triplet linewidths.}},

Title = {{Discretizing a discrete fracture model for simulation of radial
   transport}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{In this study we examine the required spatiotemporal discretization for
   numerical simulation of field-scale radial solute transport using a
   discrete fracture model. Point-to-point and borehole-to-point scenarios
   considering a single fracture, hydrodynamic dispersion, and matrix
   diffusion were modeled in two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional
   (3-D) domains, and were verified using existing semianalytical
   solutions. The results clearly show the need for accurate spatiotemporal
   discretization in numerical simulations of this type. Spatial
   discretization away from the injection point/well in the horizontal
   plane was found to be more demanding than away from the fracture in the
   vertical direction. Concentration control, which was used in the time
   step discretization of the transport solution, varied over two orders of
   magnitude depending on the scenario being modeled. The fine
   spatiotemporal discretization required may significantly limit the
   ability to simulate radial transport in more complex hydrogeological
   conditions (i.e., multiple fractures and injection points/wells)
   particularly in 3-D because of long computational runtimes.}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Some up-to-date modeling techniques, which include nonlinear support
   vector machine (SVM), least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM),
   random forest (RF) and Gaussian process (GP), together with linear
   methods (multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least-squares
   regression (PLS)) were employed to establish quantitative relationships
   between the structural descriptors and the minimum alveolar
   concentration (MAC). It has been found that a set of physical quantities
   extracted from electrostatic potential on molecular surface, together
   with some usual quantum chemical descriptors, such as the energy level
   of the frontier molecular orbital, can be well used to construct the
   quantitative structure-activity relationships for the present data set.
   Systematical validations including internal 10-fold cross-validation,
   the validation for external test set, as well as a more rigorous Monte
   Carlo cross-validation were also performed to confirm the reliability of
   the constructed models. Among these modeling methods, the GP, which can
   handle linear and nonlinear-hybrid relationship through a mixed
   covariance function, shows the best fitting and predictive abilities.
   The coefficient of determination r(pred)(2) and root mean square error
   of prediction (RMSEP) for the external test set are 0.911 and 0.475,

Abstract = {{Densification and mechanical properties (fracture toughness, flexural
   strength and hardness) of SiC-TiB2 composite were studied. Pressureless
   sintering experiments were carried out on samples containing 0-50 vol\%
   of TiB2 created by in situ reaction between TiO2, B4C and carbon. Al2O3
   and Y2O3 were used as sintering additives to create liquid phase and
   promote densification at sintering temperature of 1940 degrees C. The
   sintered samples were subsequently heat treated at 1970 degrees C. It
   was found that the presence of TiB2 serves as an effective obstacle to
   SiC grain growth as well as crack propagation thus increasing both
   strength and fracture toughness of sintered SiC-TiB2 composite. The
   subsequent heat treatment of sintered samples promoted the elongation of
   SIC matrix and further improved mechanical properties of the composite.
   The best mechanical properties were measured in heat-treated samples
   containing 12-24 vol\% TiB2. The maximum flexural strength of similar to
   600 MPa was obtained in samples with 12 vol\%TiB2 whereas the maximum
   fracture toughness of 6.6 MPa m(1/2) was obtained in samples with 24
   vol\% TiB2. Typical microstructures of samples with the mentioned volume
   fractions of TiB2 consist of TiB2 particles (<5 mu m) uniformly
   dispersed in a matrix of elongated SiC plates. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Implications of centrifuge simulations of channel flow for opening out
   or destruction of folds}},
Journal = {{TECTONOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{526}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{67-87}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{Centrifuge models of modelling clay and silicone microlaminates upon
   silicone putty layers simulate folding and subsequent opening out and
   unfolding of a layered sedimentary cover sequence (the superstructure)
   upon a ductile substrate, e.g. migmatitic gneiss in the infrastructure
   of large hot orogens or Archaean terrains. After initial layer-parallel
   shortening a process akin to channel flow in nature is induced in models
   by removal of material to simulate foreland erosion. Isostatic
   readjustments due to lateral difference in gravitational loading without
   further shortening result in extrusion and exhumation of lower ductile
   layers and vertical collapse, opening out, and unfolding of
   microlaminate layers of the cover sequence. Many active folds developed
   in the superstructure during initial layer-parallel shortening open out
   and unfold during subsequent ductile flow of the infrastructure,
   especially where they are rounded in profile and a basal decollement to
   the cover sequence is present. Angular to chevron folds tend to be
   translated or passively rotated and undergo less increase in interlimb
   angle. Isolated synforms or synform-antiform pairs separated by broad
   areas of gentle undulations or plateaux in nature may be indicative that
   unfolding during channel flow has taken place. Fold axial surfaces,
   especially for folds of finely laminated layers, may also be rotated so
   that folds become hinterland-verging. Experiments suggest that where
   channel flow has occurred in nature, if unfolding were not recognised
   through detailed field observations, the amount of regional shortening
   would be underestimated. Field criteria to recognise unfolding in nature
   are suggested. Our models predict that veins and saddle reefs developed
   during folding may be potentially preserved in an area of open or
   sub-horizontal strata following unfolding, which has implications in
   exploration for fold-related mineralisation in large hot orogens or
   Archaean terrains. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown that a handheld Raman spectrometer can be used to
   determine hydrogen peroxide concentration in aqueous solutions in
   seconds. To allow quantitative analysis, the aqueous peroxide samples
   were mixed 50/50 (v/v) with a 4 mol/dm(3) sodium perchlorate solution
   which acted as the internal standard. Standard calibration using
   relative peak heights of the strongest perchlorate (932 cm(-1)) and
   peroxide bands (876 cm(-1)) gave an average error of 1.43\% for samples
   in the range 5-30\% peroxide. PLS regression of the same data set gave
   an average error of 0.98\%. In addition, the concentrations of the
   samples were estimated by searching spectra against a library of
   standard spectra prepared using the same range of peroxide
   concentrations at 5\% increments and with the same perchlorate internal
   standard. It was found that the library searching method classified all
   the test samples correctly, matching either the spectra of the same
   concentration, if they were present, or matching to the closest
   concentration if an exact match was not possible. This method thus
   provides a very rapid technique to allow determination of hydrogen
   peroxide concentrations in the field, for example at suspected
   improvised explosives manufacturing sites, without complex calibration
   procedures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(methyl methacrylate)/poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) (PMMA/SMA)
   blends with various compositions were prepared through solution casting
   and melt blending. Two preparation routes, solution casting and melt
   blending, were used to achieve different degrees of molecular
   entanglement in the samples with solution casting giving rise to a lower
   degree of entanglement. Therefore, the effect of molecular entanglement
   on molecular dynamics and phase-separation kinetics of PMMA/SMA blends
   was investigated by using broadband dielectric spectroscopy and
   small-angle laser light scattering (SALLS). Molecular entanglement is
   found to have a pronounced effect on the alpha-relaxation process. The
   glass transition temperature (T-g) is related to the degree of
   entanglement and a higher degree of entanglement can result in a higher
   T-g which shifts to a higher temperature after annealing. The relaxation
   time (tau) of the alpha-relaxation process is lower for lower degrees of
   entanglement. Neither the dynamics nor the distribution width of the
   beta-relaxation process is affected by degree of entanglement,
   regardless of the blend composition. The kinetics of phase-separation by
   spinodal decomposition (SD) in PMMA/SMA blends are however significantly
   influenced by the degrees of entanglement with decomposition rate being
   higher at lower degrees of entanglement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The authors assume a linear equidistance antenna array as the receiver
   for a fixed frame-length multiple-access system, which employs
   variable-gain receiver power and repetition encoding. They propose a
   robust maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) blind bit-rate detector
   (BBRD). This detector considers the rate detection (RD) as a
   multi-hypothesis test and maximises the likelihood functions (LFs) to
   find the true bit-rate, whereas the complex amplitude of the received
   signal, the noise variance and the direction of arrival are unknown
   parameters. First, assuming that the location parameter is known and the
   information sequence are independent and uniformly distributed random
   variables, the authors propose a hybrid likelihood ratio test (HLRT).
   The proposed HLRT requires to solve a set of non-linear equations that
   have no closed-form solution. Thus, an iterative numerical algorithm is
   proposed. In addition, a quasi-HLR detector which has a significantly
   lower computational complexity is also proposed. In the case of unknown
   location parameter, the authors develop two quasi-HLR methods. They use
   fast Fourier transform and search to estimate the unknown location. In
   Q-HLRT-Method-I, the non-linear equation similar to the one in known
   location parameter is iteratively solved. In Q-HLRT-Method-II, a low
   complexity solution is proposed. Simulation examples evaluate and
   compare the performances of the proposed BBRDs.}},

Abstract = {{Particulate colloids often occur together with proteins in
   sewage-impacted water. Using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as a surrogate
   for protein in sewage, column experiments investigating the capacity of
   iron-oxide coated sands to remove latex microspheres from water revealed
   that microsphere attenuation mechanisms depended on antecedent BSA
   coverage. Dual pulse experiment (DPE) results suggested that where all
   BSA was adsorbed, subsequent multiple pore volume microsphere
   breakthrough curves reflected progressively reduced colloid deposition
   rates with increasing adsorbed BSA content. Modeling colloid responses
   suggested adsorption of 1 mu g BSA generated the same response as
   blockage by between 7.1 x 10(8) and 2.3 x 10(9) deposited microspheres.
   By contrast, microsphere responses in DPEs where BSA coverage of the
   deposition sites approached/reached saturation revealed the coated sand
   maintained a finite capacity to attenuate microspheres, even when
   incapable of further BSA adsorption. Subsequent microsphere breakthrough
   curves demonstrated the matrix's colloid attenuation capacity
   progressively increased with continued microsphere deposition.
   Experimental findings suggested BSA adsorption on the sand surface
   approaching/reaching saturation generated attractive deposition sites
   for colloids, which became progressively more attractive with further
   colloid deposition (filter ripening). Results demonstrate that
   adsorption of a single type of protein may either enhance or inhibit
   colloid mobility in saturated porous media.}},

Abstract = {{The use of spatially nonuniform electric fields for the contact-free
   colloidal particle assembly into ordered structures of various length
   scales is a research area of great interest. In the present work,
   numerical simulations are undertaken in order to advance our
   understanding of the physical mechanisms that govern this colloidal
   assembly process and their relation to the electric field
   characteristics and colloidal system properties. More specifically, the
   electric-field driven assembly of colloidal silica (d(p) = 0.32 and 2 mu
   m) in DMSO, a near index matching fluid, is studied numerically over a
   range of voltages and concentration by means of a continuum
   thermodynamic approach. The equilibrium ((u) over right arrow (f) = 0)
   and nonequilibrium ((u) over right arrow (f) not equal 0) cases were
   compared to determine whether fluid motion had an effect on the shape
   and size of assemblies. It was found that the nonequilibrium case was
   substantially different versus the equilibrium case, in both size and
   shape of the assembled structure. This dependence was related to the
   relative magnitudes of the electric-field driven convective motion of
   particles versus the fluid velocity. Fluid velocity magnitudes on the
   order of mm/s were predicted for 0.32 mu m particles at 1\% initial
   solids content, and the induced fluid velocity was found to be larger at
   the same voltage/initial volume fraction as the particle size decreased,
   owing to a larger contribution from entropic forces.}},

   composites were prepared using a melt-blending procedure combining

   electron microscopy for the nanocomposites with MWCNT contents ranging
   from 0.5 to 8.0 wt \%. The mechanical properties of PPS were markedly
   enhanced by the incorporation of MWCNTs. Halpin-Tsai equations, modified
   with an efficiency factor, were used to model the elastic properties of
   the nanocomposites. The calculated modulus showed good agreement with
   the experimental data. The presence of the MWCNTs exhibited both
   promotion and retardation effects on the crystallization of PPS. The

Abstract = {{Trajectory surveying in drilling application applications in oil fields,
   especially using the Rotary Steerable System (ASS) require the
   Measurement-While-Drilling (MWD) tool to have exact attitude
   measurements. Currently, inertial systems based on gyroscopes and
   accelerometers are widely used in different fields such as the field of
   flight navigation and land vehicle positioning. Gyroscopes-based method
   of measuring orientation is not sensitive to the earth's magnetic field
   or surrounding magnetic interference which is the main shortage of the
   current magnetometers-based MWD tools. This is the reason that inertial
   technology shows great potential for drilling surveying applications.
   MEMS-based Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is regarded as a perfect
   candidate for MWD because of two reasons. Firstly, due to its small size
   the MEMS IMU can be installed directly with the ASS package into one
   collar which makes the MWD tool very close to the drill bit. Secondly,
   when surveying sensors get close to the drill bit, the harsh environment
   becomes very challenging where low-cost MEMS makes it affordable to lose
   and replace the sensors without considerable cost. Unfortunately,
   current MEMS sensors have low precision which leads to large errors in
   surveying results that accumulate with time. As known in general, for an
   inertial system to have good accuracy in long-term navigation, it has to
   either have precise gyroscopes (but usually expensive), or to benefit
   from other high precision aiding system (like GPS in land vehicle).
   However, similar aiding sources are extremely limited in drilling
   applications. Therefore, an appropriate aiding scheme for MEMS IMU must
   be carefully explored as well as a suitable solution. This paper aims at
   studying a practical solution to update the MEMS measurements. A Kalman
   Filter (KF) scheme is designed to optimally estimate and compensate for
   inertial errors, where only the forward axial speed of the drill pipe
   that can be measured at all time is applied as the moving update.
   Laboratory experiments and emulation results indicated that this new
   integrated KF solution significantly improved the MEMS performance.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the current search techniques represent approaches that are
   largely adapted for specific search problems. There are many real-world
   scenarios where the development of such bespoke systems is entirely
   appropriate. However, there are other situations where it would be
   beneficial to have methodologies which are generally applicable to more
   problems. One of our motivating goals for investigating hyper-heuristic
   methodologies is to provide a more general search framework that can be
   easily and automatically employed on a broader range of problems than is
   currently possible. In this paper, we investigate a simulated annealing
   hyper-heuristic methodology which operates on a search space of
   heuristics and which employs a stochastic heuristic selection strategy
   and a short-term memory. The generality and performance of the proposed
   algorithm is demonstrated over a large number of benchmark datasets
   drawn from two very different and difficult problems, namely; course
   timetabling and bin packing. The contribution of this paper is to
   present a method which can be readily (and automatically) applied to
   different problems whilst still being able to produce results on
   benchmark problems which are competitive with bespoke human designed
   tailor made algorithms for those problems.}},

Abstract = {{A linear/nonlinear digital controller is presented that allows a Buck
   converter to recover from a load transient event with near-optimal
   voltage deviation and recovery time. A novel digital double accumulator
   calculation block is used to calculate the appropriate pulse width
   modulation switching time instants. The proposed controller possesses
   many advantages not demonstrated by a single controller in the previous
   literature. For example, unlike many previously proposed time-optimal
   digital controllers, the proposed controller provides an excellent
   transient response as it is capable of reacting asynchronously to a load
   transient event. In addition, it is demonstrated that the proposed
   controller can operate without requiring information pertaining to the
   Buck converter's output inductor. Furthermore, the proposed controller
   can be extended to applications that require load-line regulation.
   Lastly, unlike all previous digital time-optimal controllers, the
   proposed controller does not require digital multiplier or divider
   blocks nor does it require 2-D lookup tables. Thus, the controller can
   be implemented through the use of low-cost field programmable gate
   arrays or complex programmable logic devices.}},

   style, wavelength, and deformation of the interface with the ductile
   substrate differ depending on whether a low-viscosity and low-density
   layer is present at the base of the cover sequence, there is no marked
   systematic curvature of fold axes as seen in previous sandbox models for
   fault-bend or fault propagation folding during bulk shortening. Bulk
   shortening of a layered sequence with relatively thick individual layers
   above a ductile substrate promotes a regular and upright train of buckle
   folds, whereas thinner layers promote a more irregular distribution of
   buckle folds with variable vergence, style, and amplitude. Buckle folds
   above a ductile substrate progressively develop during bulk shortening
   from open and upright, to angular and tight, and may further develop
   into cuspate structures above relatively weak horizons. Relatively thick
   weak horizons within the layered sequence during bulk shortening
   interrupt regular fold patterns up structural section and allow
   out-of-phase folds to develop above and below the weak horizon.}},

Abstract = {{In conditional probabilistic logic programming, given a query, the two
   most common forms for answering the query are either a probability
   interval or a precise probability obtained by using the maximum entropy
   principle. The former can be noninformative (e.g., interval {[}0, 1])
   and the reliability of the latter is questionable when the priori
   knowledge is imprecise. To address this problem, in this paper, we
   propose some methods to quantitatively measure if a probability interval
   or a single probability is sufficient for answering a query. We first
   propose an approach to measuring the ignorance of a probabilistic logic
   program with respect to a query. The measure of ignorance (w.r.t. a
   query) reflects how reliable a precise probability for the query can be
   and a high value of ignorance suggests that a single probability is not
   suitable for the query. We then propose a method to measure the
   probability that the exact probability of a query falls in a given
   interval, e.g., a second order probability. We call it the degree of
   satisfaction. If the degree of satisfaction is high enough w.r.t. the
   query, then the given interval can be accepted as the answer to the
   query. We also prove our measures satisfy many properties and we use a
   case study to demonstrate the significance of the measures.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the population dynamics of migratory animals and
   predicting the consequences of environmental change requires knowing how
   populations are spatially connected between different periods of the
   annual cycle. We used stable isotopes to examine patterns of migratory
   connectivity across the range of the western sandpiper Calidris mauri.
   First, we developed a winter isotope basemap from stable-hydrogen (dD),
   -carbon (d13C), and -nitrogen (d15N) isotopes of feathers grown in
   wintering areas. dD and d15N values from wintering individuals varied
   with the latitude and longitude of capture location, while d13C varied
   with longitude only. We then tested the ability of the basemap to assign
   known-origin individuals. Sixty percent of wintering individuals were
   correctly assigned to their region of origin out of seven possible
   regions. Finally, we estimated the winter origins of breeding and
   migrant individuals and compared the resulting empirical distribution
   against the distribution that would be expected based on patterns of
   winter relative abundance. For breeding birds, the distribution of
   winter origins differed from expected only among males in the
   Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta and Nome, Alaska. Males in the Y-K Delta
   originated overwhelmingly from western Mexico, while in Nome, there were
   fewer males from western North America and more from the Baja Peninsula
   than expected. An unexpectedly high proportion of migrants captured at a
   stopover site in the interior United States originated from eastern and
   southern wintering areas, while none originated from western North
   America. In general, we document substantial mixing between the breeding
   and wintering populations of both sexes, which will buffer the global
   population of western sandpipers from the effects of local habitat loss
   on both breeding and wintering grounds.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents mechanical, microstructural, and physical
   characterization of aged glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) tubes
   used in the concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) tube (CFFT)
   system for bridge columns and marine pile applications, or used hollow
   as tubular poles or in pipelines. The main objective of the study is to
   evaluate the durability and predict the long-term behavior of the
   filament-wound GFRP tubes. CFFTs were exposed to salt solution at 23,
   40, and 50 degrees C for 365 days to accelerate the environmental
   effect. Given the significance of confinement in a CFFT system, the
   measured hoop tensile strength of the tube before and after exposure was
   considered the primary indicator of durability performance of the
   specimens. In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the aging effect on GFRP
   tubes. Test results showed that the GFRP tubes investigated in this
   study, and exposed to a rather aggressive environment, performed well.
   The reduction in hoop tensile strength at the end of exposure ranged
   from 11 to 21\%, depending on temperature. Using the Arrhenius theory,
   the predicted reduction in strength after 100 years at a mean annual
   temperature of 6 degrees C, representing some northern regions, was
   estimated at approximately 32\%. DOI:

Pages = {{49-61}},

Abstract = {{This article explores how the design and layout of the urban environment
   can have significant social impacts on working class communities whose
   access to employment and other necessary services depends largely on
   public transport and safe walk-able streets. It does so by considering a
   case study of Belfast. Although Belfast has a distinctive recent history
   as the site of political violence and territorial division, it also has
   a spatial configuration that emerged out of a modernising roads and
   redevelopment programme in the 1960s and 1970s. However, an
   understanding of contemporary Belfast, particularly its urban structure
   and form, requires an analysis of how the social impacts of such
   ubiquitous regional and urban planning practices were not addressed. The
   article argues that a culture of `politically safe' bureaucratic
   inaction developed during the `war years' has been sustained in the `new
   democracy'. In turn, this has had significant consequences for the
   functioning of the city. Major areas of derelict land around the city
   core together with the impediments created by regional road
   infrastructure have combined to create a doughnut city that, on the one
   hand, facilitates a commuting middle class, while on the other,
   discriminates against the poorest inner city communities.
   The article goes on to examine how an activist urban design group, known
   as the Forum for Alternative Belfast, has responded to these challenges.
   It focuses particularly on action-research undertaken during its 2010
   Summer School which aimed to address issues of disconnection in inner
   North Belfast that affect some of the most territorialised and deprived
   communities in the city. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{138}},

Abstract = {{Although the individual building system has been designed to meet the
   specific performance criteria, the way people will perceive and react to
   a total office environment is only known after it is in use and
   subjected to diagnostic. Evaluation of office space has gone beyond
   looking at a single building requirement. There exists the need to look
   at the interrelationship of performance mandates to provide healthy
   buildings for building occupants and most importantly, to reduce energy
   consumption during the construction and operation of buildings. This
   study aims to demonstrate the use of total building performance (TBP)
   evaluation and diagnostic to assess the performance of an existing
   office building in Singapore. Two floors of the evaluated high-rise
   commercial building have been evaluated by using the TBP paradigm.
   Objective measurements and observations (walkthrough) coupled with
   occupant survey (subjective measurement) has been conducted. The
   analysis demonstrates that there is concurrence between the objective
   and subjective measures, and that the holistic approach of TBP elicited
   the interrelationships between the performance's mandates and
   constitutes a sound basis for diagnostics and sustainability
   improvement. This study is significant because it provides an evaluation
   tool for ensuring sustainable buildings. DOI:

Abstract = {{Tree bark has been shown to be a useful biomonitor of past air quality

   barks are strongly enriched in Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb. To assess the
   degree of pollution of the different sites in the cities, a
   geoaccumulation index I-geo was applied. Global pollution by V, Ni, Cr,
   Sb, Sn and Pb was observed in barks sampled close to traffic axes. Cr,
   Mo, Cd pollution principally occurred in the industrial area. A total
   geoaccumulation index IGEO-tot was defined; it is based on the total of
   the investigated elements and allows to evaluate the global pollution of
   the studied environment by assembling the I-geo indices on a pollution

Abstract = {{The results on structural damage in germanium wafers caused by hydrogen
   and helium implants of typical doses used in Smart Cut (TM) Technology
   (16 x 10(16) atoms/cm2) are investigated using Raman mapping and
   spreading resistance profiling techniques. Raman line-mapping
   measurements were performed up to the depth of similar to 400nm into a
   Ge substrate (well beyond the limit of visible light penetration depth)
   using a bevelling technique. From analysis of the GeGe Raman peak it was
   found that implantation of H and He introduced a different type of
   stress, tensile and compressive, respectively and significant structural
   damage with maximum at the projected range. The obtained data shows that
   hydrogen incorporation in Ge can act as an acceptor. This is undesirable
   when the hydrogen ion-cut technology is applied to high resistivity Ge.
   The crystalline structure after implantation is completely recovered
   when annealed at 600 degrees C for both types of implants. Spreading
   resistance profiling results reveal that 4-8x1015 acceptors/cm3 remain
   after 600 degrees C, and these are thought to be because of vacancy

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of proposed Canadian
   climate change mitigation policies (discounting and carbon pricing) on
   cost, energy use, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the
   single-objective design/expansion optimization of the Amherstview water
   distribution system in Amherstview, Ontario, Canada. The
   single-objective optimization problem is solved with the elitist genetic
   algorithm (EGA). The optimization approach is used in a parametric
   analysis to examine the impact of discounting and carbon pricing on GHG
   reductions for cement-mortar ductile iron and polyvinyl chloride pipe
   materials. Preliminary results indicate that the discount rate and
   carbon prices investigated had no significant influence on energy use
   and GHG mass in the Amherstview system and did not meet the
   emission-reduction targets set by the Canadian government. This result
   was attributed to a number of factors, including adequately installed
   hydraulic capacity in the Amherstview system, the use of a
   time-declining GHG emission intensity factor, and the scope of the

Journal = {{LASERS IN SURGERY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{249-256}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objective During tissue ablation, laser light can be
   delivered with high precision in the transverse dimensions but final
   incision depth can be difficult to control. We monitor incision depth as
   it progresses, providing feedback to ensure that material removal occurs
   within a localized target volume, reducing the possibility of
   undesirable damage to tissues below the incision.
   Materials and Methods: Ex vivo cortical and cancellous bone was ablated
   using pulsed lasers with center wavelengths of 1,064 and 1,070 nm, while
   being imaged in real-time using inline coherent imaging (ICI) at rates
   of up to 300 kHz and axial resolution of similar to 6 mm. With real-time
   feedback, laser exposure was terminated before perforating into natural
   inclusions of the cancellous bone and verified by brightfield microscopy
   of the crater cross-sections accessed via side-polishing.
   Results: ICI provides direct information about incision penetration even
   in the presence of intense backscatter from the pulsed laser and plasma
   emissions. In this study, ICI is able to anticipate structures 176 +/- 8
   mm below the ablation front with signal intensity 9 +/- 2 dB above the
   noise floor. As a result, the operator is able to terminate exposure of
   the laser sparing a 50 mm thick layer of bone between the bottom of the
   incision to a natural inclusion in the cancellous bone. Versatility of
   the ICI system was demonstrated over a wide range of light-tissue
   interactions from thermal regime to direct solid-plasma transition.
   Conclusions: ICI can be used as non-contact real-time feedback to
   monitor the depth of an incision created by laser ablation, especially
   in heterogeneous tissue where ablation rate is less predictable.
   Furthermore, ICI can image below the ablation front making it possible
   to stop laser exposure to limit unintentional damage to subsurface
   structures such as blood vessels or nervous tissue. Lasers Surg. Med.

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess the influence of design parameters
   on the plug flow and dead volume ratios in a sub-surface horizontal-flow
   packed-bed reactor (HPBR), as a representative model of a subsurface
   horizontal-flow constructed wetland (SSHFCW), to provide a further
   understanding of SSHFCW, and to assist in the design and application of
   these systems on a larger scale. Design parameters included the aspect
   ratio, the size of the porous media and the loading rate of the HPBR.
   Integral parameters, such as plug flow, dead volume and short-circuiting
   ratios, were determined using tracer tests and the Wolf-Resnick
   empirical flow model. The experiment was conducted in three packed-bed
   reactors with volumes of 192 Land different length-to-width aspect
   ratios (1:1, 1.5:1 and 3:1). Each packed-bed reactor received three
   different controlled influent hydraulic loading rates (0.3 L/min, 0.6
   L/min, and 1.5 L/min), and the size of the porous media was varied in
   the individual beds, using three nominal diameters (4.7 mm, 9.2 mm and
   12.7 mm). Results showed that the aspect ratio had the greatest effect
   on the hydraulic behaviour of the system. An increase in the aspect
   ratio resulted in a experimental retention time that was closer to the
   theoretical retention time, and exhibited higher plug flow and lower
   dead volume ratios compared to an ideal plug flow system operated under
   similar conditions. An increase in loading rate negatively affected the
   plug flow portion in the system by increasing dispersion. The retention
   time increased, making it more similar to ideal plug flow and reducing
   the dead volume ratio. Finally, it was demonstrated that a decrease in
   the nominal diameter increased dispersion and reduced the plug flow
   ratio; however, the retention times obtained were closer to those of the
   ideal plug flow system. It was concluded that a constructed sub-surface
   flow wetland design should incorporate a combination of higher aspect
   ratios, higher loading rate and finer porous media to induce a hydraulic
   behaviour closer to an ideal plug flow system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wireless systems
   have the potential to increase system capacity significantly by
   separating multiple users in the space domain through appropriate signal
   processing. These techniques require accurate channel state information
   at transmitter (CSIT) for their proper operations. With inevitable
   channel imperfections in practice, robustness has become an important
   issue in the development of beamforming techniques. In this work, we
   propose a robust leakage-based transmit beamforming design for
   multi-user MIMO systems by introducing a probabilistic constraint. In a
   multi-user system, the main challenge for transmit beamforming is to
   suppress the co-channel interference (CCI) from other users. Our
   approach optimizes the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
   (SINR) performance implicitly by maximizing the average signal power
   subject to probabilistic leakage and noise power constraint. Moreover,
   both the single-stream-per-user and multiple-stream-per-user cases are
   considered. In the latter case, a hybrid scheme is suggested by
   incorporating Alamouti code into the proposed design. Simulation results
   show that under proper control of the probabilistic constraint, both
   beamformers achieve good bit-error-rate (BER) performances, reliability
   of SINR levels as well as robustness against channel uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{Composites of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) of varied
   functionality (unfunctionalised and carboxyl and amine functionalised)
   with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) were prepared for use as a bone
   cement. The MWCNT loadings ranged from 0.1 to 1.0 wt.\%. The fatigue
   properties of these MWCNT-PMMA bone cements were characterised at MWCNT
   loading levels of 0.1 and 0.25 wt.\% with the type and wt.\% loading of
   MWCNT used having a strong influence on the number of cycles to failure.
   The morphology and degree of dispersion of the MWCNT in the PMMA matrix
   at different length scales were examined using field emission scanning
   electron microscopy. Improvements in the fatigue properties were
   attributed to the MWCNT arresting/retarding crack propagation through
   the cement through a bridging effect and hindering crack propagation.
   MWCNT agglomerates were evident within the cement microstructure and the
   degree of agglomeration was dependent on the level of loading and
   functionality of the MWCNT. The biocompatibility of the MWCNT-PMMA
   cements at MWCNT loading levels upto 1.0 wt.\% was determined by means
   of established biological cell culture assays using MG-63 cells. Cell
   attachment after 4 h was determined using the crystal violet staining
   assay. Cell viability was determined over 7 days in vitro using the
   standard colorimetric MTT assay. Confocal scanning laser microscopy and
   SEM analysis was also used to assess cell morphology on the various
   substrates. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the
   accuracy of an augmented reality image overlay system in MRI-guided
   spinal injection procedures.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. An augmented reality prototype was used in
   conjunction with a 1.5-T MRI system. A human lumbar spine phantom was
   used in which 62 targets were punctured to assess the accuracy of the
   system. Sixty anatomic targets (facet joint, disk space, and spinal
   canal) were punctured to assess how the accuracy of the system
   translated into practice. A visualization software interface was used to
   compare planned needle paths and final needle locations on coregistered
   CT images (standard of reference). Outcome variables included entry
   error, angle error, depth error, target error, successful access of
   anatomic targets, number of needle adjustments, and time requirements.
   RESULTS. Accuracy assessments showed entry error of 1.6 +/- 0.8 mm,
   angle error of 1.6 +/- 1.0, depth error of 0.7 +/- 0.5 mm, and target
   error of 1.9 +/- 0.9 mm. All anatomic targets (60 of 60 insertions) were
   successfully punctured, including all 20 facet joints, all 20 disks, and
   all 20 spinal canals. Four needle adjustments (6.7\%) were required.
   Planning of a single needle path required an average of 55 seconds. A
   single needle insertion required an average of 1 minute 27 seconds.
   CONCLUSION. The augmented reality image overlay system evaluated
   facilitated accurate MRI guidance for successful spinal procedures in a
   lumbar spine model. It exhibited potential for simplifying the current
   practice of MRI-guided lumbar spinal injection procedures.}},

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model for groundwater flow and solute transport was employed
   to examine the influence of the screen and sandpack on the collection of
   a representative geochemical sample from a piezometer monitoring well
   installation in a discretely fractured bedrock aquifer. The optimization
   of screen and sandpack combinations was explored for the potential to
   reduce purging times and volumes in practice. Simulations accounted for
   the location of the fractures along the well screen, fracture aperture,
   screen length, and the pumping rate. The variability in the required
   purging times (t99the time required to achieve 99\% fractional
   contribution from the formation to pump discharge) can be explained by:
   (1) the relative hydraulic conductivities of the components of the
   system (fracture, sandpack, and screen), (2) the truncation of the flow
   field from the fracture to the screen by the upper and/or lower boundary
   of the sandpack of the flow field from another fracture, and (3)
   time-dependent drawdown. During pumping, only a portion of the sandpack
   may actually become hydraulically active. The optimal configuration
   (shortest purging time) is achieved when the ratios of the screen,
   sandpack, and fracture hydraulic conductivities are close to 1:1:1. More
   importantly, the role of the fracture hydraulic conductivity in the
   ratios is not as crucial to reducing t99 as having the hydraulic
   conductivities of the screen and sandpack as similar as possible. This
   study provides a better understanding of well dynamics during pumping
   for the purpose of obtaining representative groundwater samples.}},

Abstract = {{In the manufacturing industry, there is a growing need for an adaptable
   automated visual inspection (AVI) system that can be used to perform
   different inspection tasks without excessive retuning or retraining
   efforts. This paper presents an automated visual inspection scheme to
   improve the adaptability of an AVI system. In doing so, we propose the
   design of an adaptable inspection model composed of two sub-models: one
   for localizing the region of useful features and the other for defect
   classification. The localization sub-model contains invariant features
   common to all inspection samples. Through an edge-based geometric
   template-matching process, the localization sub-model is used to locate
   a verification region containing the subject of inspection such as a
   clip or a screw in an assembly piece. Through principal component
   analysis (PCA), the verification sub-model is constructed based on the
   reconstruction error distribution of non-defective samples.
   Consequently, this sub-model can be used to identify defective samples.
   In addition, an efficient online training algorithm is proposed for the
   construction of the verification sub-model during system operation. This
   algorithm allows minimum manual inspection effort while ensuring model
   training sufficiency. Through case study, the proposed AVI scheme
   demonstrates its capability of self-tuning while inspecting different
   parts or under different operating conditions in an assembly process.
   The feature of adaptability will help increase the benefit and
   functionality of an AVI technique to the manufacturing industry.}},

Abstract = {{Periacetabular osteotomies are a family of surgical procedures used to
   treat hip dysplasia. In a periacetabular osteotomy, the operating
   surgeon aims to increase acetabular coverage of the femoral head. The
   surgical correction has mechanical goals of increasing the stability of
   the joint and to improving the pressure distribution across the
   acetabulum. Although it is known that bone will remodel under changing
   load at the microstructural level, it is unclear whether there is any
   gross remodeling of the acetabulum or the femoral head in response to
   the change in loading following a periacetabular osteotomy. This
   observational study aims to quantify the shape of operative and
   contralateral hip joint surfaces pre and postoperatively to determine
   whether there are gross morphological changes in the shape of any of the
   bony articular surfaces of the joint.
   Preoperative and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were
   segmented as triangulated meshes. The bony articular surfaces of these
   meshes were then isolated. The vertices of these surfaces were fit to
   spheres and to general ellipsoids and, in the case of the acetabulum,
   examined in anatomical coordinate frames to look for changes between pre
   and postoperative segmentations.
   Spherical fit results were consistent preoperatively and
   postoperatively, with small changes in the radii of the spheres of best
   fit for both operative and nonoperative hips. Ellipsoid fitting showed
   variations between preoperative and postoperative scans in both
   eccentricity and orientation.
   Because there is no clear evidence of gross articular surface
   remodeling, periacetabular osteotomy for an adult should be planned with
   the expectation that the patient's existing articular structure will be
   preserved.}},

Abstract = {{A model is developed to predict rates of undesirable reactions in the
   low-moisture, high-temperature finishing stage of nylon 66 production.
   The model contains 56 unknown parameters and initial conditions, which
   are ranked based on their influence on model predictions, correlation
   with other parameters and uncertainty in their initial guesses. A
   mean-square-error criterion is used to determine that 43 of 56
   parameters should be estimated. The proposed model, which describes the
   effect of melt-phase water concentration on degradation, matches the
   data well with typical errors of 6.1 and 2.9\%, respectively, for amine
   ends (A) and carboxyl ends (C) and 4.3, 27.2, and 29.4\%, respectively,
   for evolution rates of CO2, NH3, and cyclopentanone (CPK).}},

Abstract = {{Contact friction plays a critical role in all the major thermoforming
   processes for polymers. However, these effects are very difficult to
   measure in practice and, as a result, have received little scientific
   investigation. In this work, two independently developed test methods
   for the measurement of elevated temperature polymer-to-polymer contact
   friction are presented, and their results are compared in detail for the
   first time. One is based on a modified moving sled friction test,
   whereas the other uses a rotational rheometer. In each case, friction
   tests were conducted between two plug and two sheet materials. The
   results show that broadly similar coefficients of friction were obtained
   from the two test methods. The measured values were quite low (<0.3) at
   lower temperatures and typically were higher for polypropylene (PP)
   sheet than for polystyrene (PS). On approaching the glass transition
   temperature for PS (95 degrees C) and the crystalline melting point for
   PP (165 degrees C), the friction coefficients rose very sharply, and
   both test techniques became increasingly unreliable. It was concluded
   that despite their physical differences, both test techniques were able
   to capture the highly temperature sensitive nature of friction between
   polymer materials used in thermoforming. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2012. (c)

Abstract = {{Nanocomposites of poly(ethylene terephthalate) PET with a partially

   electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the mica tactoids showed that
   biaxial stretching had caused the tactoids to be more orientated and
   with improved exfoliation. The moduli of the nanocomposites were
   enhanced with increasing mica loading and the reinforcement effect was
   higher when the stretch ratio was 2 or 2.5, accommodated by having more
   aligned tactoids and reduced agglomeration. Enhancement in modulus was
   less pronounced for a stretch ratio of 3. Storage modulus was enhanced
   more significantly above the glass transition temperature. The barrier
   properties were enhanced by addition of mica before and after
   stretching. The Halpin-Tsai theory underpredicted the relative modulus
   of the PET nanocomposites, whereas the Nielsen model over-predicted the

   was undertaken to investigate the potential of groundwater contamination

   concentrations greater than those observed in surface-water bodies.
   Potential sources include manure, septic tanks, and the atmosphere. From
   this scoping study, it is evident that additional surveys of PBDE

Abstract = {{Two approaches for extending a quantitative Bayesian network (BN) to
   deal with qualitative information include a qualitative probability
   network extension and causal independence. Both approaches help
   developers to remedy the gap between the complicated BN formalism and
   the actual problem. Lucas utilizes these two methods in establishing a
   theory of qualitative causal (QC) interaction patterns where qualitative
   probability influences (QPIs) (considering whether it is better to hold
   a single cause than not) affect the network model. QC patterns help to
   offer developers a high-level starting point when developing BNs.
   However, in real-world applications, usually, we need to know QPIs on
   multiple causes, namely, whether holding some subset of the causes will
   be a better choice than holding other subsets. To this end, we introduce
   a concept called causality probability from which QPIs can be easily
   induced. We investigate the local optima and global optima of causality
   probabilities considering multiple causes. For the local optima, we
   present the qualitative influences on all binary interaction types,
   while for the global optima, we achieve an upper bound of causality
   probability and discuss the conditions to reach the upper bound. Our
   results are useful for BN developers to get an overview of causality
   relations.}},

Abstract = {{Polyamide and polystyrene particles were coated with titanium dioxide
   films by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and then melt-compounded to form
   polymer nanocomposites. The rheological properties of the ALD-created
   nanocomposite materials were characterized with a melt flow indexer, a
   melt flow spiral mould, and a rotational rheometer. The results suggest
   that the melt flow properties of polyamide nanocomposites were markedly
   better than those of pure polyamide and polystyrene nanocomposites. Such
   behavior was shown to originate in an uncontrollable decrease in the
   polyamide molecular weight, likely affected by a high thin-film impurity
   content, as shown in gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and scanning
   electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive
   spectrometer. Transmission electron microscope image showed that a thin
   film grew on both studied polymer particles, and that subsequent
   melt-compounding was successful, producing well dispersed ribbon-like
   titanium dioxide with the titanium dioxide filler content ranging from
   0.06 to 1.12wt\%. Even though we used nanofillers with a high aspect
   ratio, they had only a minor effect on the tensile and flexural
   properties of the polystyrene nanocomposites. The mechanical behavior of
   polyamide nanocomposites was more complex because of the molecular
   weight degradation. Our approach here to form polymeric nanocomposites
   is one way to tailor ceramic nanofillers and form homogenous polymer
   nanocomposites with minimal work-related risks in handling powder form
   nanofillers. However, further research is needed to gauge the commercial
   potential of ALD-created nanocomposite materials. Copyright (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Colloidal gas aphrons (CGAs), first described by Felix Sebba in his book
   Foams and Biliquid Foams-Aphrons in 1987, consist of a system of
   spherical microbubbles with diameters mostly above 25 mu m and
   classified as kugelschaums (ball foam). They possess some colloidal
   properties and can be pumped at uniform rate through pipes and channels,
   much like liquids. Also, they have high stability due to very small size
   and thick surfactant shells. Research work published over the past two
   decades indicate effective applications of CGAs for clarification of
   particles and microorganisms, protein separation, gas and nutrient
   transfer and pollutant separation from water and soil matrices. In this
   review paper, the techniques for generating CGAs and their application
   to pollution abatement are discussed. Some mineral separation processes
   by CGA flotation have also been reviewed because of their relevance to
   contaminant removal processes. The CGAs were found to function on the
   principles of bubble entrained floc flotation, electrostatic and ionic
   interaction, diffusion of entrapped gas and hydrophobicity of the
   pollutant particles. Two tables have also been provided to present a
   comparative overview of the generation technologies and the
   effectiveness of pollution remediation techniques. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix (ECM) environment plays
   a critical role in mediating normal cellular behavior and tissue
   organization. While commercially available microcarriers have shown
   promise, limited research has been conducted on the design of
   tissue-specific, custom-fabricated microcarriers, engineered to mimic
   the composition of the native ECM of cells or tissues of interest.
   Moving toward this goal, methods were developed to fabricate
   microcarriers from decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) via
   minimally-cytotoxic protocols. Characterization by microscopy confirmed
   the production of stable spherical microcarriers, with a microporous
   surface topography and porous interior. The mean diameter of the DAT
   microcarriers was 934 +/- 51 mu m, while the porosity was estimated as
   29\% +/- 4\% using liquid displacement. Stability and swelling behavior
   over 4 weeks indicated that the DAT microcarriers were effectively
   stabilized with the photochemical crosslinking agent rose bengal, with
   total protein release in a simulated physiological environment remaining
   below 10 mu g/mL at all time points. Preliminary cell culture studies
   with human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in a spinner flask system
   indicated enhanced cell attachment and proliferation of ASCs on DAT
   microcarriers over 14 days, as compared with gelatin control
   microcarriers fabricated using similar methods. Testing confirmed
   injectability of the DAT microcarriers, further supporting the clinical
   potential of the approach for localized cell delivery and small volume
   augmentation in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Overall,
   tissue-specific microcarriers prepared from solubilized DAT were found
   to be highly supportive of human ASCs cultured in a 3D dynamic
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of cosurfactant and initiator concentration on the ab initio
   production of nanolatexes using low surfactant levels was investigated.
   While the use of cosurfactants (acrylic acid and pentanol) increased the
   amount of monomer that can be used in styrene-SDS microemulsion
   formulations to 13 wt \%, high surfactant concentrations are still
   required, resulting in polymer-to-polymerization of these
   microemulsions. The Pol/Surf can be significantly increased by
   increasing the initiator concentration of emulsion polymerization
   recipes. Particle sizes are comparable with microemulsion latexes,
   however, less surfactant is required. The reduction in the particle size
   with higher initiator concentration is attributed to a higher efficiency
   of particle nucleation and to a higher nucleation rate relative to the
   rate of monomer transfer. Nanolatexes (particle size < 30 nm) were
   obtained with 19 wt \% solids content and Pol/Surf of 3.6 in ab initio.

Abstract = {{Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are an important source of cardiomyocytes
   for regenerating injured myocardium. The successful use of ESC-derived
   cardiomyocytes in cardiac tissue engineering requires an understanding
   of the important scaffold properties and culture conditions to promote
   cell attachment, differentiation, organization, and contractile
   function. The goal of this work was to investigate how scaffold
   architecture and coculture with fibroblasts influences the
   differentiated phenotype of murine ESC-derived cardiomyocytes (mESCDCs).
   Electrospinning was used to process an elastomeric biodegradable
   polyurethane (PU) into aligned or unaligned fibrous scaffolds.
   Bioreactor produced mESCDCs were seeded onto the PU scaffolds either on
   their own or after pre-seeding the scaffolds with mouse embryonic
   fibroblasts (MEFs). Viable mESCDCs attached to the PU scaffolds and were
   functionally contractile in all conditions tested. Importantly, the
   aligned scaffolds led to the anisotropic organization of rod-shaped
   cells, improved sarcomere organization, and increased mESCDC aspect
   ratio (length-to-diameter ratio) when compared to cells on the unaligned
   scaffolds. In addition, pre-seeding the scaffolds with MEFs improved
   mESCDC sarcomere formation compared to mESCDCs cultured alone. These
   results suggest that both fiber alignment and pre-treatment of scaffolds
   with fibroblasts improve the differentiation of mESCDCs and are
   important parameters for developing engineered myocardial tissue
   constructs using ESC-derived cardiac cells. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012;

Abstract = {{Low melting-point poly(1,3-trimethylene
   carbonate-co-epsilon-caprolactone)-b-poly(ethylene
   glycol)-b-poly(1,3-trimethylene carbonate-co-epsilon-caprolactone),
   P(TMC-CL)(2)-PEG, was employed to fabricate microspheres for sustained
   growth factor delivery in a photocrosslinked N-methacrylate glycol
   chitosan hydrogel matrix. The P(TMC-CL)(2)-PEG had a melting range such
   that it was solid at 10 degrees C, yet liquid with a low degree of
   crystallinity at 37 degrees C. The in vitro degradation of
   P(TMC-CL)(2)-PEG microspheres was slow, regardless of the triblock
   copolymer molecular weight and so did not influence protein release. The
   size of protein loaded P(TMC-CL)(2)-PEG microspheres manufactured using
   a low-temperature electrospray technique was between 65 and 85 mu m.
   Initial formulation work was done with the model protein lysozyme,
   co-lyophilized with trehalose and encapsulated as approximately 2 mu m
   particles within P(TMC-CL)(2)-PEG microspheres. This work indicated a
   sustained release could be achieved with high trehalose content (90\%
   w/w) in the particles. Under these conditions, the release rate of bone
   morphogenetic protein-6 was more sustained than that of the excipient
   bovine serum albumin (BSA) and closely followed that of lysozyme. On the
   other hand, transforming growth factor-beta 3 and the stabilizing agent
   BSA generated similar release profiles. This difference in release was
   proposed to be linked to the protein isoelectric point, with positively
   charged proteins possibly being more strongly adsorbed to the
   P(TMC-CL)(2)-PEG. Both growth factors were released in highly bioactive
   form, indicating the potential of the release approach. (c) 2011

   was employed to study the microstructure after austenitization at 950

   was employed to calculate equilibrium phase mole fractions. Hardness and
   Charpy impact toughness of the steel were measured. Intercritical
   annealing treatments did not result in significant increase of hardness
   either before or after aging. The Charpy impact toughness of the alloy
   in aged condition was enhanced after austenitization at 950 degrees C.
   No austenite was observed in XRD. However, suspected reverted austenite
   was found after austenitization at 950 degrees C followed by aging at

Abstract = {{The partial substitution of Co by Ru in lanthanum cobaltite perovskites
   (LaCo1-xRuxO3, x=0.05 and 0.2) and its influence on the reducibility and
   structural modifications in the perovskite lattice have been evaluated
   by N-2 adsorption isotherms, in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS). Characterization of LaCo1-xRuxO3 perovskite
   precursors reveals that Ru is incorporated into the perovskite lattice,
   producing a distortion of the original rhombohedral structure, a
   decrease in mean crystallite size and some increase in the surface area.
   The structural evolution of the LaCo1-xRuxO3 precursors under a
   reductive treatment indicates that Ru promotes the reducibility of the
   perovskite leading to a greater reduction degree of cobalt species.
   Moreover, the smaller perovskite crystallites obtained with the partial
   substitution of cobalt by ruthenium evolve to smaller crystal domains of
   both Co-0 and La2O3 after reduction. The catalysts formed after the
   reduction of perovskite precursors present very high catalytic
   efficiency to extract hydrogen from diesel molecules by oxidative
   reforming. However, those catalysts derived from Ru-substituted
   perovskites show better catalytic performance associated with the higher
   development of active metallic phases achieved on the surface of these
   catalysts. Additionally. Ru promotes the catalytic activity and
   stability for this reaction increasing the reduction degree of cobalt
   and decreasing coke formation and sulfur poisoning through the formation
   of smaller cobalt crystallites. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We present an alternative method for the preparation of high solids

   subsequent miniemulsification using a high-shear technique. Herein high
   solid content dispersions of up to 80 w/w\% solids content
   monomer-in-water emulsions are prepared by catastrophic phase inversion
   followed by miniemulsification with a rotor-stator mixer. The subsequent
   miniemulsification of these monomer-in-water emulsions proves to be
   almost four times more energy efficient than is possible with direct
   miniemulsification using the same mixers and recipes. The highly
   concentrated miniemulsions thus obtained can be successfully diluted to
   different solid contents for polymerisation. without compromising the

Abstract = {{Porous media are often used in flame arresters because of the high
   surface area to volume ratio that is required for flame quenching.
   However, if the flame is not quenched, the flow obstruction within the
   porous media can promote explosion escalation, which is a well-known
   phenomenon in obstacle-laden channels. There are many parallels between
   explosion propagation through porous media and obstacle-laden channels.
   In both cases, the obstructions play a duel role. On the one hand, the
   obstruction enhances explosion propagation through an early shear-driven
   turbulence production mechanism and then later by shock-flame
   interactions that occur from lead shock reflections. On the other hand,
   the presence of an obstruction can suppress explosion propagation
   through momentum and heat losses, which both impede the unburned gas
   flow and extract energy from the expanding combustion products. In
   obstacle-laden channels, there are well-defined propagation regimes that
   are easily distinguished by abrupt changes in velocity. In porous media,
   the propagation regimes are not as distinguishable. In porous media the
   entire flamefront is affected, and the effects of heat loss, turbulence
   and compressibility are smoothly blended over most of the propagation
   velocity range. At low subsonic propagation speeds, heat loss to the
   porous media dominates, whereas at higher supersonic speeds turbulence
   and compressibility are important. This blending of the important
   phenomena results in no clear transition in propagation mechanism that
   is characterized by an abrupt change in propagation velocity. This is
   especially true for propagation velocities above the speed of sound
   where many experiments performed with fuel-air mixtures show a smooth
   increase in the propagation velocity with mixture reactivity up to the
   theoretical detonation wave velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon stable isotope (C-13) fractionation in chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)
   compounds arising from abiotic (chemical) degradation using zero-valent
   iron (ZVI) and biotic (landfill gas attenuation) processes is
   investigated. Batch tests (at 25 degrees C) for CFC-113 and CFC-11 using
   ZVI show quantitative degradation of CFC-113 to HCFC-123a and CFC-1113
   following pseudo-first-order kinetics corresponding to a half-life
   (tau(1/2)) of 20.5 h, and a ZVI surface-area normalized rate constant
   (k(SA)) of -(9.8 +/- 0.5) x 10(-5) L m(-2) h(-1). CFC-11 degraded to
   trace HCFC-21 and HCFC-31 following pseudo-first-order kinetics
   corresponding to tau(1/2) = 17.3 h and k(SA) = -(1.2 +/- 0.5) x 10(-4) L
   m(-2) h(-1). Significant kinetic isotope effects of epsilon(parts per
   thousand) = -5.0 +/- 0.3 (CFC-113) and -17.8 +/- 4.8 (CFC-11) were
   observed. Compound-specific carbon isotope analyses also have been used
   here to characterize source signatures of CFC gases (HCFC-22, CFC-12,
   HFC-134a, HCFC-142b, CFC-114, CFC-11, CFC-113) for urban (UAA),
   rural/remote (RAA), and landfill (LAA) ambient air samples, as well as
   in situ surface flux chamber (FLUX; NO FLUX) and landfill gas (LFG)
   samples at the Dargan Road site, Northern Ireland. The latter values
   reflect biotic degradation and isotopic fractionation in LFG production,
   and local atmospheric impact of landfill emissions through the cover.
   Isotopic fractionations of Delta C-13 similar to -13 parts per thousand
   (HCFC-22), Delta C-13 similar to -35 parts per thousand (CFC-12) and
   Delta C-13 similar to -15 parts per thousand (CFC-11) were observed for
   LFG in comparison to characteristic solvent source signatures, with the
   magnitude of the isotopic effect for CFC-11 apparently similar to the
   kinetic isotope (abiotic) ZVI degradation.}},

   embankments on rate-sensitive soil are investigated: soil viscosity,
   reinforcement type and construction rate. Based on a series of finite
   element analyses, the ideal allowable long-term reinforcement strains

   maximizing the long-term service height of reinforced embankments,
   considering the combined effect of soil and reinforcement viscosity, are

Title = {{Interpretation of laboratory creep testing for reliability-based
   analysis and load and resistance factor design (LRFD) calibration}},
Journal = {{GEOSYNTHETICS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{39-53}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Load and resistance factor design (LRFD) is now recommended in North
   American design codes for reinforced-soil structures, including internal
   stability limit states. The selection of load and resistance factors
   that appear in limit state equations is best carried out using
   reliability-based analysis. In this paper the conventional approach to
   compute the limit state for geosynthetic reinforcement tensile rupture
   is reviewed, and is then recast in a reliability-based analysis
   framework suitable for LRFD calibration using bias statistics. The paper
   describes how to compute bias statistics from product-specific
   laboratory creep tests for the reinforcement rupture limit state. A
   database of results from creep tests on 94 different geosynthetic
   products was collected from 21 different sources. A total of 1086 in-air
   tensile test results and 540 creep-rupture data points were examined.
   This database is used to compute virgin and creep-reduced strength bias
   statistics for three different geosynthetic product categories. The
   results of analysis show that variability in the prediction of
   creep-reduced strength is very low, and is probably captured by the
   magnitude of variance in the original tensile strength of the test
   specimens. This greatly simplifies future LRFD calibration for the
   geosynthetic rupture limit state. An important implication of this study
   for LRFD design is that creep strength reduction factors can be taken as
   deterministic. The paper also provides a summary of computed
   creep-reduction factors that is a useful reference for future estimates
   of this factor from laboratory creep testing, and for preliminary design
   purposes using allowable stress design or LRFD approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In-situ electron irradiation damage within the transmission electron
   microscope has been studied and compared with ion irradiation on
   commercial purity magnesium. Magnesium has the same crystal structure
   (hcp) and a similar c/a ratio to that of zirconium and is considered a
   suitable model system and useful analogue to zirconium (an important
   structural material for nuclear reactors). The results presented in this
   paper suggest that microstructure developed during irradiation is
   modified by the nature of the irradiating particles. The basal plane
   dislocation loops with Burgers vector 1/6(20 (2) over bar3) are formed
   by electron irradiation and analysis showed that all of these
   dislocation loops are interstitial in nature. Vacancy type prism plane
   dislocation loops with Burgers vector 1/3(11 (2) over bar0) also form
   but to a lesser degree than the basal plane dislocation loops. Ion
   irradiation for a dose up to 0.1 dpa produces a majority of interstitial
   type prism plane dislocation loops with Burgers vector 1/3(11 (2) over
   bar0). Void formation also takes place in ion irradiated samples
   subjected to a higher dose of 0.7 dpa. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents criteria for the design of a flow distributor for
   even distribution of gas and liquid flows over parallel microchannels.
   The design criteria are illustrated for the case of a nitrogen-water
   Taylor flow (1 <Re-GL <30 and 3 x 10(-5) < Ca-GL < 4 x 10(-4)) in four
   parallel microchannels of 0.9 mm inner diameter. The distributor
   consists of a gas manifold, a liquid manifold, four barrier channels for
   the gas and four for the liquid, and four T-mixers for mixing of the gas
   and liquid flows. The four barrier channels have equal inner diameters
   and length: four different diameters have been studied: 0.05, 0.1, 0.15
   and 0.2 mm. Uniform distribution of the gas and liquid flows over the
   microchannels is achieved when the pressure drop over the barrier
   channels is in the range of around 4-25 times the pressure drop over the
   corresponding T-mixers and microchannels. Gas-liquid channeling is
   prevented at equal pressures in the gas and liquid manifolds. An optimal
   operational window is realized when the gas to liquid flow ratio kept
   constant and the ratio of the maximum over the minimum flow rates remain
   less than 20. The effect of variations in the inner diameters (result of
   the fabrication process) of the barrier channels and the microchannels
   on the flow distribution is demonstrated. It is suggested that these
   design criteria can also be applied at larger numbers of parallel
   microchannels. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The harmful effect of manmade particles on natural processes and human
   health is documented by a large number of studies showing a positive
   correlation between particulate matter (PM) concentration and health
   effects. Diminution of this health risk necessitates among others the
   precise knowledge of the particle sources, their physical and chemical
   properties and their dissemination in the environment. PI) isotope
   ratios have been successfully used during the past decades as tracers of
   anthropogenic Pb disseminated in the biosphere. Here we show that tree
   bark biomonitoring with lead (Pb), strontium (Sr) and neodymium (Nd)
   isotope ratios as tracers allow a thorough analysis of the impacts of
   industrial and other anthropogenic emissions on the urban environment.
   This is the first comprehensive multi-isotope tracer study of
   atmospheric pollution in an urban environment allowing to identify and
   to integrate the different plume paths of emissions in a digital map
   system. This innovative approach might become an important tool for
   environmental management and policy-making processes dealing especially
   with risks and surveillance of air quality in the urban environment. (C)

Abstract = {{The performance of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
   systems is highly impacted by clipping distortions caused by non-linear
   amplifiers. One approach known as Tone Reservation (TR) method is to
   allocate/use a small number of sub-carriers to generate more suited
   signals and reduce the impact of these non-linear distortions.
   Traditionally, existing TR algorithms attempt to minimize the
   Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). In this paper, we show that
   maximization of the Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) is a better
   criterion which achieves a better symbol error rate performance. Our
   results reveal that the proposed approach outperforms in terms of error
   probability rate for the same transmit power and same order of
   computational cost. Interestingly, the PAPR value for the proposed
   algorithm is not better than the state of the art algorithm in {[}1]
   which directly optimizes the PAPR.}},

   The various decomposition phases formed were identified using X-ray

   microscopy. The results indicated that Na2SO4 activated slag has a
   better resistance to the degradation caused by exposure to elevated
   temperature up to 600 degrees C than Portland cement system as its
   relative strengths are superior. The finer slag and higher Na2SO4
   concentration gave better temperature resistance. Whilst the pH of the
   hardened pastes decreased with an increase in temperature, it still
   maintained a sufficiently high pH for the protection of reinforcing bar

Abstract = {{Secondary sludge from pulp and paper mills can be considered as
   potential filler for composite industry. Enzymatic modifications of the
   waste secondary sludge from pulp and paper mills to reduce the
   hydrophobicity and increase the molecular weight have been carried out
   by lipase and laccase, respectively. The enzymatic modification was
   performed to enhance the reinforcing capability of the secondary sludge
   for further composite production. The lipid content of the secondary
   sludge, which was measured to be 6 +/- 0.5\%, was hydrolyzed by lipase
   from Candida rugosa and the structural changes were followed by Fourier
   transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Laccase from Trametes versicolor
   was tested for its activity and reaction rate in the secondary sludge
   and the alkali-extracted lignin. Characterization of the sludge before
   and after the laccase treatment was carried out by FTIR spectroscopy.
   High pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was applied to
   determine the molecular weight distribution of the lignin samples and
   also as a means for comparing modified and unmodified samples.
   Biokinetic parameters for the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model as a
   function of dissolved oxygen concentrations were determined the K-m
   values to be 3.491 and 2.318 g/m(3) for sludge and the alkali extract,
   respectively. The FTIR results on the laccase-treated secondary sludge
   showed clear changes in the molecular structure, which was mainly
   attributed to the crosslinking reactions and generation of new bonds.
   Moreover, the HPSEC results revealed that laccase modifies the sludge by
   increasing the molecular weight. The manufactured nylon/sludge
   composites showed lower tensile strength for the lipase treated
   sludge/nylon composite. However, the laccase-treated sludge/nylon
   composite showed a statistically significant increase in the mechanical
   strength, which is attributed to the increase in the components
   molecular weight.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid composites of PP/NC/GF were prepared by extrusion and injection
   molding. Molded specimens were analyzed by XRD, SEM, and TEM, together
   with characterization of thermal and mechanical properties. XRD results
   revealed that the interaction between NC particles and the PP matrix
   results in intercalation of the polymer chains, which increases the clay
   interlayer distance. TEM results revealed NC particle intercalation. TGA
   results showed that the incorporation of clay into the GF composite
   improves the thermal stability of the material. The initial thermal
   decomposition temperatures also shifted to higher values. Incorporation
   of GF into PP lowers the tensile strength of the binary composite,
   indicating poor fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion; however, introducing
   NC increased the strength of the ternary composites. Tensile modulus was
   enhanced with the incorporation of GF and further increased with an
   introduction of NC. Flexural strength and flexural modulus are both
   enhanced with an increase in fiber loading. The addition of clay
   nanoparticles further improved these properties.}},

Abstract = {{Construction projects often suffer from poor performance in terms of
   time delays, cost overruns and quality defects. The causes of poor
   performance have often been analysed. However, few studies have
   addressed the influence of supply chain relationships on project
   performance in construction. To fill in this gap, a questionnaire survey
   is carried out in the UK construction industry to explore the specific
   characteristics of supply chain relationships in construction and to
   assess their impact on project performance. In this study, a supply
   chain relationship is described by key indicators in ten areas: mutual
   objectives, gain and pain sharing, trust, no-blame culture, joint
   working, communication, problem solving, risk allocation, performance
   measurement, and continuous improvement. The analysis reveals that the
   deterioration of the relationship between project parties may increase
   the likelihood of poor performance. Poor performance can be effectively
   reduced by improving some aspects of the relationship. The adoption of
   supply chain collaboration and partnering helps to solve the performance
   problems, in which a long-term collaboration is more favourable for
   performance improvement than a short-term collaboration. In addition to
   the questionnaire survey, a series of industrial experts are interviewed
   to provide a deeper insight into the effect of relationship management
   on project performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. PMA and IPMA. All rights

Abstract = {{Radon diffusion in different materials has been measured in the past.
   Usually the diffusion measurements are based on a direct determination
   of the amount of radon that diffuses through a thin layer of material.
   Here we present a method based on the measurement of the radon daughter
   products which are deposited inside the material. Looking at the decay
   of Po-210 allows us to directly measure the exponential diffusion
   profile characterized by the diffusion length. In addition we can
   determine the solubility of radon in PE. We also describe a second
   method to determine the diffusion constant based on the short-lived
   radon daughter products Po-218 and Po-214, using the identical
   experimental setup.
   Measurements for regular polyethylene (PE) and High Molecular Weight
   Polyethylene (HMWPE) yielded diffusion lengths of (1.3 +/- 0.3) mm and
   (0.8 +/- 0.2) mm and solubilities of 0.5 +/- 0.1 and 0.7 +/- 0.2,
   respectively, for the first method; the diffusion lengths extracted from
   the second method are noticeably larger which may be caused by different
   experimental conditions during diffusion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

   structured mesoporous or non-porous titania thin films. The Cu and CuZn
   nanoparticles, synthesized using a reduction by solvent method, were
   deposited onto calcined films to obtain a Cu loading of 2 wt\%. The
   catalysts were characterized by inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
   spectroscopy, temperature-programmed oxidation/reduction (TPO/TPR)
   techniques, Cu-63 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), scanning and transmission electron microscopy
   (S/TEM-EDX) and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS). The activity
   and stability of the catalysts obtained have been studied in the C-O
   Ullmann coupling of 4-chloropyridine and potassium phenolate. The
   titania-supported nanoparticles retained catalyst activity for up to 12
   h. However, catalyst deactivation was observed for longer operation
   times due to oxidation of the Cu nanoparticles. The oxidation rate could
   be significantly reduced over the CuZn/TiO2 catalytic films due to the
   presence of Zn. The 4-phenoxypyridine yield was 64\% on the Cu/nonporous
   TiO2 at 120 degrees C. The highest product yield of 84\% was obtained on
   the Cu/mesoporous TiO2 at 140 degrees C, corresponding to an initial
   reaction rate of 104 mmol g(cat)(-1) s(-1). The activation energy on the
   Cu/mesoporous TiO2 catalyst was found to be (144 +/- 5) kJ mol(-1),
   which is close to the value obtained for the reaction over unsupported
   CuZn nanoparticles (123 +/- 3 kJ mol(-1)) and almost twice the value
   observed over the catalysts deposited onto the non-porous TiO2 support
   (75 +/- 2 kJ mol(-1)).}},

Abstract = {{New polyethylene glycol (PEG)/ionic liquid aqueous biphasic systems
   (ABS) are presented. Distinct pairs of PEG polymers and ionic liquids
   can induce phase separation in aqueous media when dissolved at
   appropriate concentrations. Phase diagrams have been determined for a
   large array of systems at 298, 308 and 323 K. A comparison of the
   binodal curves allowed the analysis of the tunable structural features
   of the ionic liquid (i.e., anionic nature, cationic core, cationic alkyl
   side chain length and functionalisation, and number of alkyl
   substituents in the cation) and the influence of the molecular weight of
   the PEG polymer on the ability of these solutes to induce an ABS. It was
   observed that contrary to typical ABS based on ionic liquids and
   inorganic salts, in which the phase behaviour is dominated by the
   formation of the hydration complexes of the ions, the interactions
   between the PEG polymers and ionic liquids control the phase demixing in
   the polymer-type ABS studied herein. It is shown that both the ionic
   liquids and PEG polymers can act as the salting-out species; that is, it
   is an occurrence that is dependent on the structural features of the
   ionic liquid. For the first time, PEG/ionic liquid ABS are reported and
   insight into the major interactions that govern the polymer/ionic liquid
   phase behaviour in aqueous media are provided. The use of two different
   nonvolatile and tunable species (i.e., ionic liquids and PEG polymers)
   to form ABS allows the polarities of the phases to be tailored. Hence,
   the development of environmentally friendly separation processes that
   make use of these novel systems is envisaged.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple distributed nodes in cooperative networks generally are subject
   to multiple carrier frequency offsets (MCFOs) and multiple timing
   offsets (MTOs), which result in time varying channels and erroneous
   decoding. This paper seeks to develop estimation and detection
   algorithms that enable cooperative communications for both
   decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying networks
   in the presence of MCFOs, MTOs, and unknown channel gains. A novel
   transceiver structure at the relays for achieving synchronization in
   AF-relaying networks is proposed. New exact closed-form expressions for
   the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for the multi-parameter estimation
   problem are derived. Next, two iterative algorithms based on the
   expectation conditional maximization (ECM) and space-alternating
   generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithms are proposed for
   jointly estimating MCFOs, MTOs, and channel gains at the destination.
   Though the global convergence of the proposed ECM and SAGE estimators
   cannot be shown analytically, numerical simulations indicate that
   through appropriate initialization the proposed algorithms can estimate
   channel and synchronization impairments in a few iterations. Finally, a
   maximum likelihood (ML) decoder is devised for decoding the received
   signal at the destination in the presence of MCFOs and MTOs. Simulation
   results show that through the application of the proposed estimation and
   decoding methods, cooperative systems result in significant performance
   gains even in presence of impairments.}},

Abstract = {{Composites of poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) and molybdenum sulfur iodine
   (MoSI) nanowires were prepared using twin-screw extrusion. Extensive
   microscopic examination of the composites revealed the nanowires were
   well dispersed in the PCL matrix, although bundles of Mo6S3I6 ropes were
   evident at higher loadings. Secondary electron imaging (SEI) showed the
   nanowires had formed an extensive network throughout the PCL matrix,
   resulting in increased electrical conductivity of PCL, by eight orders
   of magnitude, and an electrical percolation threshold of 6.5x10(-3)
   vol\%. Thermal analysis (DSC), WAXD, and hot stage polarized optical
   microscopy (HSPOM) experiments revealed Mo6S3I6 addition altered PCL
   crystallization kinetics, nucleation density, and crystalline content. A
   greater number of smaller spherulites were formed via heterogeneous
   nucleation. The onset of thermal decomposition (TGA) of PCL decreased by
   70 degrees C, a consequence of the thermal degradation of Mo6S3I6 to
   MoO3, which in turn accelerates the formation of volatile gases during
   the first stage of PCL decomposition. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{OligoMiocene carbonates associated with the Padthaway Ridge form the
   southern margin of the Murray Basin, South Australia. The carbonates are
   a thin, somewhat condensed succession of echinoid and bryozoan-rich
   limestones that record accumulation in the complex of islands and
   seaways and progressive burial of the Ridge through time. The rocks are
   grainy to muddy bioclastic packstones, grainstones and floatstones,
   composed of infaunal echinoderms, bryozoans, coralline algae and benthic
   foraminifera, with lesser contributions from molluscs and serpulid
   worms. Locally as much as half of these skeletal components are
   Fe-stained, relict grains that imbue the lithologies with a conspicuous
   yellow to orange hue. This variably lithified succession is partitioned
   into metre-scale, firmground-bounded and hardground-bounded beds
   textured by extensive Thalassinoides burrows. Dominant lithologies are
   interpreted as temperate seagrass facies. Limestones contain attributes
   indicative of both seagrass-dominated palaeoenvironments and carbonate
   production and accumulation on unconsolidated, barren sandflat
   palaeoenvironments. Together these two depositional systems are thought
   to have generated a single multigenerational, amalgamated facies
   recording sedimentation within a complex temperate seagrass environment.
   Limestones overlying the Padthaway Ridge reflect a gradually warming
   climate, increasing water temperature and decreasing nutrient content,
   within the framework of a ridge gradually being buried in sediment. This
   succession from cooltemperate to warmtemperate to subtropical through
   time permits recognition of the relative influence of changing
   oceanography on a seagrass-dominated shallow inter-island sea floor.
   Criteria are proposed herein to enable future recognition of similar
   temperate seagrass facies in Cenozoic limestones elsewhere.}},

   1130, 1131 and 1132, which penetrate southern Australian slope
   sediments, and isotopic analyses of large benthic foraminifera from
   southern Australian continental shelf sediments, indicate that
   PleistoceneHolocene meso-haline salinity reflux is occurring along the
   southern Australian margin. Ongoing dolomite formation is observed in
   slope sediments associated with marine waters commonly exceeding 50
   parts per thousand salinity. A well-flushed zone at the top of all holes
   contains pore waters with normal marine trace element contents,
   alkalinities and pH values. Dolomite precipitation occurs directly below
   the well-flushed zone in two phases. Phase 1 is a nucleation stage
   associated with waters of relatively low pH (ca 7) caused by oxidation
   of H2S diffusing upward from below. This dolomite precipitates in
   sediments < 80 m below the sea floor and has d13C values consistent with
   having formed from normal sea water (- 1 parts per thousand to + 1 parts
   per thousand Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite). The Sr content of Phase 1
   dolomite indicates that precipitation can occur prior to substantial
   metastable carbonate dissolution (< 300 ppm in Holes 1129 and 1127).
   Dolomite nucleation is interpreted to occur because the system is
   undersaturated with respect to the less stable minerals aragonite and
   Mg-calcite, which form more readily in normal ocean water. Phase 2 is a
   growth stage associated with the dissolution of metastable carbonate in
   the acidified sea water. Analysis of large dolomite rhombs demonstrates
   that at depths > 80 m below the sea floor, Phase 2 dolomite grows on
   dolomite cores precipitated during Phase 1. Phase 2 dolomite has d13C
   values similar to those of the surrounding bulk carbonate and high Sr
   values relative to Phase 1 dolomite, consistent with having formed in
   waters affected by aragonite and calcite dissolution. The nucleation
   stage in this model (Phase 1) challenges the more commonly accepted
   paradigm that inhibition of dolomitization by sea water is overcome by
   effectively increasing the saturation state of dolomite in sea water.}},

Abstract = {{This case study examines how the lean ideas behind the Toyota production
   system can be applied to software project management. It is a detailed
   investigation of the performance of a nine-person software development
   team employed by BBC World-wide based in London. The data collected in
   2009 involved direct observations of the development team, the kanban
   boards, the daily stand-up meetings, semistructured interviews with a
   wide variety of staff, and statistical analysis.
   The evidence shows that over the 12-month period, lead time to deliver
   software improved by 37\%, consistency of delivery rose by 47\%, and
   defects reported by customers fell 24\%.
   The significance of this work is showing that the use of lean methods
   including visual management, team-based problem solving, smaller batch
   sizes, and statistical process control can improve software development.
   It also summarizes key differences between agile and lean approaches to
   software development.
   The conclusion is that the performance of the software development team
   was improved by adopting a lean approach. The faster delivery with a
   focus on creating the highest value to the customer also reduced both
   technical and market risks. The drawbacks are that it may not fit well
   with existing corporate standards.}},

Abstract = {{The eluent droplet size defines the number of sampling compartments in a
   continuously operated annular electrochromatograph and therefore
   influences separation efficiency. In this work, an assembly of two
   capillaries, a feeding capillary on the top and a receiving capillary
   placed under it, has been investigated to control droplet size. The
   receiving capillary prevents the liquid droplet formation beyond a
   critical size, which reduces the volume of sampling compartment as
   compared with the case of the electrolyte flow driven solely by gravity.
   With a receiving capillary, the electrolyte droplet size was reduced
   from 1.5 to 0.46?mm. Further decrease of droplet size was not possible
   due to a so-called droplet jump upwards effect which has been observed
   on a hydrophilic glass surface with water. A typical electrolyte used in
   CAEC has high methanol content. In an attempt to improve the
   methanol-repellent properties of the glass surface, two approaches have
   been implemented: (i) self-assembled chemisorbed monolayers of an
   alkylsiloxane and (ii) fabrication of a nano-pin film. The
   methanol-repellent surface of the feeding capillary suppressed the
   droplet jump upwards effect. The surface remained methanol repellent in
   different solutions with lower polarity than that of water.}},

Abstract = {{Higher heating value (HHV) is probably the most important property of
   the fuels. Bomb calorimeter and derived empirical formulae are often
   used for accurate determination of HHV of fuels. A useful empirical
   equation was derived to estimate HHV of petro-diesels from their C and H
   contents: HHV (in MJ/kg) = 0.3482(C) + 1.1887(H), r (2) = 0.9956. The
   derived correlation was validated against the most common formulae in
   the literature, Boie and Channiwala-Parikh correlations. Accordingly,
   accurate determination of C and H contents is essential for estimation
   of HHV and avoids using a bomb calorimeter. However, accurate estimation
   of C and H contents requires using expensive and laborious gas
   chromatographic techniques. In this work, chemometry offered a simple
   method for HHV determination of petro-diesels without using bomb
   calorimeter or even gas chromatography. PLS-1 calibration was used
   instead of gas chromatography to find C and H contents from the
   non-selective mid-infrared (MIR) spectra of petro-diesels, HHV was then
   estimated from the earlier empirical equation. The proposed method
   predicts HHV of petro-diesels with high accuracy and precision, with
   modest analysis costs. The present method may be extended to other
   fuels.}},

Abstract = {{A novel bipolar current source driver (CSD) for power MOSFETs is
   proposed in this paper. The proposed bipolar CSD alleviates the gate
   current diversion problem of the existing CSDs by clamping the gate
   voltage to a flexible negative value (such as -3.5 V) during turn-off
   transition. Therefore, the proposed driver is able to turn off the
   MOSFET much faster with a higher effective gate current. The idea
   presented in this paper can also be extended to other CSDs to further
   improve the efficiency with high output currents. The experimental
   results verify the benefits of the proposed CSD. For buck converters
   with 12 V input at 1 MHz switching frequency, the proposed driver
   improves the efficiency from 80.5\% using the existing CSD to 82.5\% (an
   improvement of 2\%) at 1.2 V/30 A, and at 1.3 V/30 A output, from 82.5\%
   using the existing CSD to 83.9\% (an improvement of 1.4\%).}},

Abstract = {{A new analytical switching loss model for power MOSFETs driven by the
   current source driver (CSD) is presented in this paper. The gate current
   diversion problem, which commonly exists in existing CSDs, is analyzed
   mathematically. In addition, a new accurate switching loss model
   considering every switching interval piecewisely is proposed. Based on
   the proposed loss model, the optimal design of the CSD inductor is
   achieved to minimize the total power loss for the buck converter. The
   experimental result verifies the proposed switching loss model and
   optimal design. The measured loss matches the calculated loss very well;
   the error between the calculated loss and measured one is less than 10\%
   from 5A load to 30A load with 12V input and 1.3V output. As compared
   with the previous study, the efficiency with the optimal CSD inductor is
   improved from 86.1\% to 87.6\% at 12V input and 1.3V/20A output and from
   82.4\% to 84.0\% at 12V input and 1.3V/30A output at 1 MHz switching

Abstract = {{The rheological properties of fresh cement asphalt paste (CA paste) were
   investigated, in which influencing factors such as type of asphalt
   emulsion, temperature, and time were discussed. CA pastes with two types
   of asphalt emulsions and varied asphalt contents were prepared at 0, 20
   and 40 degrees C. The initial yield stress and its development over
   shelf time were tested to characterize the rheological properties of
   the,pastes. The measurement of semi-adiabatic temperature development
   during hydration and optical microscopic observation were carried out to
   determine the hydration kinetics and microstructure evolution of the
   pastes. Results indicate that the initial flowability and flowability
   retention over shelf time of the pastes visibly improve because of the
   plasticizing effect of the asphalt emulsion and its retardation effect
   on cement hydration. The anionic asphalt emulsion is more effective than
   the cationic type because the former exhibits favorable adsorption onto
   the surface of cement grains. The temperature sensitivity of the
   rheological properties of the CA paste depends on the type and content
   of asphalt emulsion. The effects of time and temperature on rheological
   behavior were integrated into the effect of cement hydration degree. A
   generalized model linking yield stress and relative hydration degree
   alpha' was established. Experimental results show that yield stress
   increases in a roughly linear fashion with 1/(1-alpha') for all tested
   CA pastes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tungsten carbide (WC) with controlled pore size distribution was
   synthesized using a novel ``precursor reassembly{''} method. The
   precursor crystal was assembled by mixing ammonium metatungstate (AMT)
   and ammonium carbonate (AC) in distilled water, followed by hydrothermal
   treatment. The mesostructure, crystal phase, and amount of deposited
   graphitic carbon can be conveniently tuned by controlling carburizing
   atmosphere (CO or a CO/H(2) mixture). Moreover, the influence of
   precursor preparation (AMT/AC mass ratio and hydrothermal temperature)
   on the materials was also investigated. The resultant materials with low
   carbon content were mesoporous WCs, which showed high specific surface
   areas (11.3-20.4 m(2) g(-1)) and adjustable pore-size distributions
   (average pore size: 15.3-22.3 nm). A mechanism for the formation of WC
   with a controllable porous framework is proposed. Finally, cyclic
   voltammetry was used to investigate the inference of different
   mesoporous structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   magnitude of the LBM's overprediction of the pressure fluctuations in
   the near-wall region is on the order of that expected from
   compressibility effects. However, the relationship between density,
   temperature, and pressure in the LBM is different from that found in a
   fully-compressible simulation. For this reason, it is recommended that
   the athermal LBM should not be used for simulations in which the density

Abstract = {{Oscillating wave surge converters (OWSCs) are a class of wave power
   technology that exploits the enhanced horizontal fluid particle movement
   of waves in the nearshore coastal zone with water depths of 10-20 m.
   OWSCs predominantly oscillate horizontally in surge as opposed to the
   majority of wave devices, which oscillate vertically in heave and
   usually are deployed in deeper water. The characteristics of the
   nearshore wave resource are described along with the hydrodynamics of
   OWSCs. The variables in the OWSC design space are discussed together
   with a presentation of some of their effects on capture width, frequency
   bandwidth response and power take-off characteristics. There are notable
   differences between the different OWSCs under development worldwide, and
   these are highlighted. The final section of the paper describes
   Aquamarine Power's 315kW Oyster 1 prototype, which was deployed at the
   European Marine Energy Centre in August 2009. Its place in the OWSC
   design space is described along with the practical experience gained.
   This has led to the design of Oyster 2, which was deployed in August
   2011. It is concluded that nearshore OWSCs are serious contenders in the
   mix of wave power technologies. The nearshore wave climate has a
   narrower directional spread than the offshore, the largest waves are
   filtered out and the exploitable resource is typically only 10-20\% less
   in 10 m depth compared with 50 m depth. Regarding the devices, a key
   conclusion is that OWSCs such as Oyster primarily respond in the working
   frequency range to the horizontal fluid acceleration; Oyster is not a
   drag device responding to horizontal fluid velocity. The hydrodynamics
   of Oyster is dominated by inertia with added inertia being a very
   significant contributor. It is unlikely that individual flap modules
   will exceed 1 MW in installed capacity owing to wave resource,
   hydrodynamic and economic constraints. Generating stations will be made
   up of line arrays of flaps with communal secondary power conversion
   every 5-10 units.}},

   2,2'-azobis{[}2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane] can be switchable between
   ionic and nonionic forms by addition and removal of CO2. Measurements of
   particle size and zeta potential were used to study the aggregation and
   redispersion of the latexes. The latex is aggregated by heating and
   bubbling with argon to remove CO2 and convert the active cyclic
   amidinium groups to their neutral form. When treated with sonication and
   bubbling with CO2, the aggregated polystyrene latex can be redispersed
   successfully, as evidenced by restoration of the original latex particle
   size and zeta potential from the large aggregated polymer particles.

Abstract = {{Raman spectra of a representative range of beta-ketophenethylamine
   (beta-KP), the rapidly growing family of cathinone-related ``legal
   high{''} recreational drugs, have been recorded. These spectra showed
   characteristic changes that were associated with the pattern of
   substitution on the aromatic rings, for example, the compounds carrying
   substituents at the 4- position could be distinguished from
   3,4-methylenedioxy ``ecstasy{''} derivatives. They also showed small but
   detectable changes with differences in substitution on the ethylamine
   substituent. These features allowed the beta-KPs present in seized
   casework samples to be identified. The seized samples typically
   contained only small amounts of bulking agents, which meant that the
   band intensities of these components within averaged data were very
   small. In contrast, grid sampling normally gave at least some spectra
   which had a higher than average proportion of the bulking agent(s),
   which allowed them to also be identified. This study therefore
   demonstrates that Raman spectroscopy can be used both to provide a
   rapid, non-destructive technique for identification of this class of
   drugs in seized samples and to detect minor constituents, giving a
   composition profile which can be used for drugs intelligence work. Crown

Abstract = {{As a promising method for pattern recognition and function estimation,
   least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) express the training in
   terms of solving a linear system instead of a quadratic programming
   problem as for conventional support vector machines (SVM). In this
   paper, by using the information provided by the equality constraint, we
   transform the minimization problem with a single equality constraint in
   LS-SVM into an unconstrained minimization problem, then propose reduced
   formulations for LS-SVM. By introducing this transformation, the times
   of using conjugate gradient (CG) method, which is a greatly
   time-consuming step in obtaining the numerical solution, are reduced to
   one instead of two as proposed by Suykens et al. (1999). The comparison
   on computational speed of our method with the CG method proposed by
   Suykens et al. and the first order and second order SMO methods on
   several benchmark data sets shows a reduction of training time by up to
   44\%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two electrochemical techniques have been used to measure the pK(a) of
   N-bases in several ionic liquids (ILs). The first method corresponds to
   a potentiometric titration of a strong acid with the N-base using a
   platinized Pt indicator electrode immersed in the IL solution and
   maintained under dihydrogen atmosphere via gas bubbling. The second
   approach involves performing cyclic voltammetry at a platinized Pt
   electrode in a solution containing both strong acid and the conjugate
   weak acid of the N-base. Values of pK(a) obtained by one or the other
   approach are in good agreement with each other. The experimental data
   clearly demonstrated that acid/base chemistry in Its is similar to that
   observed in molecular nonaqueous solvents; i.e., the relative strengths
   of the bases were in the right order and spaced (Delta pK(a)). It was
   also observed that the strength of N-bases is highly dependent on the
   anion of the ionic liquid; this observation indicates that pH-dependent
   reactions could be controlled by the appropriate choice of anion for
   bulk ILs or as an added co-ion to bulk IL.}},

Abstract = {{The production of vanillin from sodium lignosulfonate under highly
   alkaline conditions, catalyzed by Cu2+ and at elevated temperature and
   pressures, has been studied in two sizes of stirred reactors. The larger
   reactor (3 L) was operated in both the dead end and the gas throughflow
   modes; the sparged gas was nitrogen and ``simulated air{''} in the
   former case and air in the latter. The smaller reactor (300 mL) was only
   operated in the batch mode with oxygen. In the 3 L reactor, with
   nitrogen gas alone in the dead end mode, vanillin was produced by
   hydrolysis. With the other conditions, both hydrolysis and oxidation
   occurred and the amount of vanillin produced was greater. In addition,
   for the first time since this process was first introduced in 1936, the
   composition of the gas phase produced by the reaction was investigated,
   too. The measurements were made on samples taken from the headspace of
   the 300 mL batch reactor and the headspace of the 3 L reactor in the
   dead end mode and in the exhaust gases in the throughflow mode. It was
   found that, whenever vanillin was produced, hydrogen was detected in the
   gas phase. In the 3 L reactor in the dead end mode, the amount of H-2
   formed was so great (similar to 7\% by volume) in the case of
   ``simulated air{''} that the production of vanillin ceased as no further
   air (oxygen) was able to enter the reactor. In the throughflow mode, the
   concentration of hydrogen detected in the exit gas was much lower as it
   was flushed out in the exhaust. As a result of the different levels of
   oxygen and hydrogen in the reactor in the dead end and throughflow
   modes, the amount of vanillin produced was greater in the latter case.
   Thus, it is difficult to use studies in the dead end mode to predict the
   behavior in throughflow, the mode generally used industrially.}},

Title = {{Boundary-layer-separation-driven vortex shedding beneath internal
   solitary waves of depression}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{690}},
Pages = {{321-344}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{We investigate global instability and vortex shedding in the separated
   laminar boundary layer beneath internal solitary waves (ISWs) of
   depression in a two-layer stratified fluid by performing high-resolution
   two-dimensional direct numerical simulations. The simulations were
   conducted with waves propagating over a flat bottom and shoaling over
   relatively mild (S = 0.05) and steep (S = 0.1) slopes. Over a flat
   bottom, the potential for vortex shedding is shown to be directly
   dependent on wave amplitude, for a particular stratification, owing to
   increase of the adverse pressure gradient (dP/dx > 0 for leftward
   propagating waves) beneath the trailing edge of larger amplitude waves.
   The generated eddies can ascend from the bottom boundary to as high as
   33\% of the total depth in two-dimensional simulations. Over sloping
   boundaries, global instability occurs beneath all waves as they steepen.
   For the slopes considered, vortex shedding begins before wave breaking
   and the vortices, shed from the bottom boundary, can reach the
   pycnocline, modifying the wave breaking mechanism. Combining the results
   over flat and sloping boundaries, a unified criterion for vortex
   shedding in arbitrary two-layer continuous stratifications is proposed,
   which depends on the momentum-thickness Reynolds number and the
   non-dimensionalized ISW-induced pressure gradient at the point of
   separation. The criterion is generalized to a form that may be readily
   computed from field data and compared to published laboratory
   experiments and field observations. During vortex shedding events, the
   bed shear stress, vertical velocity and near-bed Reynolds stress were
   elevated, in agreement with laboratory observations during re-suspension
   events, indicating that boundary layer instability is an important
   mechanism leading to sediment re-suspension.}},

Abstract = {{We derive a master equation for the total-system density matrix to treat
   the evolution of quantum dots and photons in a photonic crystal slab

   resonant lossy quasimodes of the system overlap in frequency and space,
   they are generally nonorthogonal. We find that this nonorthogonality can
   have important consequences for the system evolution. Our formalism
   allows for the calculation of multiple-photon effects in the presence of
   quasimode nonorthogonality. It can be applied to the calculation of
   strong- and weak-coupling dynamics and to first- and second-order photon
   correlation functions in a wide variety of complicated coupled-cavity
   systems. As an example, we apply the formalism to an asymmetric
   two-cavity photonic crystal slab and demonstrate how quasimode

Abstract = {{Durability and kinematics are two critical factors which must be
   considered during total knee replacement (TKR) implant design. It is
   hypothesized, however, that there exists a competing relationship
   between these two performance measures, such that improvement of one
   requires sacrifice with respect to the other. No previous studies have
   used rigorous and systematic methods to quantify this relationship.
   During this study, multiobjective design optimization (MOO) using the
   adaptive weighted sum (AWS) method is used to determine a set of
   Pareto-optimal implant designs considering durability and kinematics
   simultaneously. Previously validated numerical simulations and a
   parametric modeller are used in conjunction with the AWS method in order
   to generate a durability-versus-kinematics Pareto curve. In terms of
   kinematics, a design optimized for kinematics alone outperformed a
   design optimized for durability by 61.8\%. In terms of durability, the
   design optimized for durability outperformed the kinematics-optimized
   design by 70.6\%. Considering the entire Pareto curve, a balanced (1:1)
   trade-off could be obtained when equal weighting was placed on both
   performance measures; however improvement of one performance measure
   required greater sacrifices with respect to the other when the weighting
   was extremized. For the first time, the competing relationship between
   durability and kinematics was confirmed and quantified using
   optimization methods. This information can aid future developments in
   TKR design and can be expanded to other total joint replacement designs.

Abstract = {{GPS signal interruption is a primary cause which affects the continuity
   and reliability of navigation systems that rely on standalone GPS
   solution. In order to obtain continuous positioning services in all
   environments, GPS can be integrated with inertial sensors.
   Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System (MEMS) based inertial sensors are
   preferred for vehicular navigation due to their low cost, small size,
   and low power consumption. However, these sensors suffer from severe
   stochastic error characteristics that can cause large positional error
   growth. To enhance the performance of vehicular navigation along with
   reducing the reliance on inertial sensors, three-dimensional reduced
   inertial sensors system (RISS) relies on measurements from one
   gyroscope, two accelerometers and a speed sensor (i.e. speed
   measurements in a vehicle are obtained from the vehicle's odometer)
   which are integrated with measurements from a GPS receiver. To address
   the nonlinear error characteristics in the integrated navigation system,
   Mixture Particle filter (M-PF), a nonlinear filtering technique is
   employed to perform tightly-coupled integration of RISS with GPS.
   Tightly-coupled systems can provide GPS aiding during limited GPS
   satellite availability and thus can improve the operation and
   performance of the navigation system. Tightly-coupled integration
   utilizes pseudoranges and pseudorange rates measured by the GPS
   receiver. The accuracy of the positional estimates is highly dependent
   on the accuracy of the range measurements. This paper introduces a
   nonlinear system identification technique called Parallel Cascade
   Identification (PCI) to model pseudoranges correlated errors in the
   measurement model of the PF filter. When less than four satellites are
   visible, the identified parallel cascades for the remaining visible
   satellites will be used to predict the pseudorange errors for these
   respective satellites and correct the pseudorange value to be provided
   to M-PF. The proposed technique enhances the overall positioning
   accuracy, especially during partial GPS outages by modelling the
   pseudoranges correlated errors using PCI and MEMS-based RISS/GPS
   integration using M-PF to compute a 3D navigation solution.
   The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by different
   real-life road tests during GPS signal degradation and blockage using
   low cost MEMS-based RISS. Results for scenarios with intentionally
   inserted GPS outages where the number of visible satellites varies
   between 3, 2, 1, and 0 are presented to demonstrate the usefulness and
   performance of the proposed technique. The results are examined and
   compared with PF tightly-coupled RISS/GPS integration without the
   pseudorange corrections using the PCI modules. The results are also
   compared with KF tightly-coupled RISS/GPS integration with and without
   pseudorange corrections using PCI modules. The comparison demonstrates
   the advantages of using PCI modules for correcting pseudoranges for
   tightly-coupled integration using PF.
   The proposed navigation system, including the PCI modules used with PF,
   provides continuous determination of the navigational states with higher
   performance along with considerable reduction in the cost, size, and
   power consumption due to the use of fewer low-cost MEMS-based inertial
   sensors, vehicle odometer, and a low-cost GPS receiver. These features
   make the proposed system a viable product that can provide an accurate,
   always available positioning solution for the common consumer.}},

Abstract = {{The extreme weakness of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS)
   signal makes it vulnerable to a wide variety of interfering signals,
   falling within the GNSS frequency bands. Most of acquisition techniques
   used now days are depends on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The FFT is
   numerically ill-posed method especially when noise corrupts the signal
   extensively. Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS) algorithm has been developed
   to acquire very weak Global Positioning System (GPS) coarse/acquisition
   (C/A) signals in a software receiver instead of FFT. Simulations
   indicate that the proposed method can acquire signal below
   signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) below 25 dB. The percentage of improvement
   due to use FOS instead of FFT is 18 \% at low SNR.}},

Abstract = {{The notion of absolute stability has been used to analyze the stability
   of man-machine interfaces in which a human operator commands a robot to
   do a task in a real or simulated environment. In this paper, we present
   and prove an extended version of the Zeheb-Walach absolute stability
   theorem that can be applied to n-port networks with ``simple imaginary
   poles{''}. Conditions on the Laurent expansion of the elements and the
   principal minors of the impedance matrix are added to the theorem and
   the proof is conducted using the zero set of multiparameter functions.
   The unique feature of the proposed method is the graphical
   representation of the loci of the roots of the system, which allows for
   studying the effect of various system and control parameters on
   stability margins. To demonstrate the applicability of the new theorem,
   the stability of a position-position controlled teleoperation system,
   modeled by a 2-port network, coupled with the passive impedances of the
   human operator's hand, and the environment, is investigated.}},

   time-varying parameters for a class of continuous-time nonlinear system
   is proposed for the estimation of unknown heat loads and heat sinks in

   estimation that can be used to estimate the time-varying parameters
   along with an uncertainty set. The proposed method is such that the
   uncertainty set update is guaranteed to contain the true value of the
   parameters. Unlike existing techniques that rely on the use of
   polynomial approximations of the time-varying behaviour of the
   parameters, the proposed technique does not require a functional
   representation of the time-varying behaviour of the parameter estimates.
   A simulation example is used to illustrate the developed procedure.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes a joint power control, rate adaptation and channel
   selection strategy for Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) operating over
   vacant TV bands, also known as TV Bands Devices (TVBDs). To exploit the
   abundance of vacant channels available at the disposal of these devices,
   we combine the well-studied power and rate adaptation strategies with
   adaptive channel selection. The combined strategy maximizes the
   achievable throughput while guaranteeing a desired level of performance,
   i.e., error and outage probabilities. It also reduces the chances of
   causing or being subject to harmful interference to/from other
   co-channel users. Furthermore, to waive the processing complexity
   resulting from the frequent channel switching, we propose an alternative
   strategy that switches the operating channel only when the operating
   channel fails to support the least supportable data rate. For the two
   strategies, we derive closed form expressions for the average data rates
   and transmission powers. The accuracy of the derived results as well as
   the performance gains achieved are verified using intensive numerical
   and simulations results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a dynamic symbol adaptation scheme for downlink and
   point-to-point multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems aiming at
   the minimization of the overall system bit error rate. The proposed
   scheme adaptively changes the order or the values of the symbols to be
   transmitted within a sub-frame of symbols with the objective to enhance
   the received symbols' power. The adaptation is based on the
   instantaneous interference between the symbols taking into account the
   channel's characteristics as well as the actual symbol values. This
   procedure is targeted to optimizing, rather than strictly minimizing the
   interference between the symbols. In this way, constructive
   instantaneous interference is utilized in enhancing the decision
   variables at the receiver on a symbol-by-symbol basis, so that detection
   is made more reliable. The proposed scheme can be used in conjunction
   with various conventional MIMO precoding and detection techniques. The
   presented simulations show that it provides significant benefits to the
   corresponding conventional system's error rate performance.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of thermal mass is becoming increasingly important under the
   scope of low energy use building construction and energy conservation.
   In this paper the dynamic behaviour of the effect of the thermal mass of
   external walls on the development of solar-assisted buoyancy-driven
   ventilation flow rates, air flow patterns and temperature distributions
   in a simple three-storied atrium building was investigated using
   unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS) modelling
   approach. The SST-k-omega turbulence model and the Discrete Transfer
   Radiation Model (DTRM) were used in the CFD simulations. The
   unsteady-state governing equations were solved using a commercial CFD
   solver FLUENT(C). The numerical results were obtained for indoor
   transient thermal conditions by assuming the external concrete walls of
   the building under three situations: (i) walls with internal insulation
   covering (ii) walls with external insulation covering, and (iii) walls
   without insulation covering. The buoyancy-driven ventilation volume flow
   rates and internal temperature variations from 8:00 to 15:00hrs on July
   15, 2011 were calculated using CFD simulations. Numerical results
   obtained indicate that the transient CFD simulations provide important
   information about the effect of the thermal mass on the thermal
   behaviour of the building. It was found that the thermal mass of
   external walls with external insulation covering was a better option
   which helped to control the diurnal temperature swings making the
   conditions within the building more comfortable. Heat stored in the
   walls can be useful for the night-time buoyancy-driven ventilation when
   there is no solar radiation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a study whose objective is to explore the
   potential of intelligent algorithms such as fuzzy rules and neural
   networks (NN) as applied to the control of pneumatic servosystems.
   Current application is position control of a pneumatic gantry robot.
   Preliminary experiments with adaptive fuzzy and NN controllers showed
   improvement in tracking performance by upwards of 70\%. This level of
   improvement was expected given the adaptive nature of both controllers.
   However, both methods also required significant effort to setup. An
   on-line autotuner was developed to improve the ease of implementation.
   Comparative results are given for five controllers: 1) manually tuned
   Pm, 2) autotuned PD, 3) adaptive NN PID, 4) fuzzy adaptive PD and 5)
   autotuned fuzzy adaptive PID. Experiments,were conducted at 2 different
   supply pressures and 3 different tracking frequencies. Once again the
   fuzzy adaptive MD controller improved performance over fixed gain PD,
   this time by upwards of 80\%, even when both were given the benefit of
   autotuning.}},

Abstract = {{Realising memory intensive applications such as image and video
   processing on FPGA requires creation of complex, multi-level memory
   hierarchies to achieve real-time performance; however commerical High
   Level Synthesis tools are unable to automatically derive such structures
   and hence are unable to meet the demanding bandwidth and capacity
   constraints of these applications. Current approaches to solving this
   problem can only derive either single-level memory structures or very
   deep, highly inefficient hierarchies, leading in either case to one or
   more of high implementation cost and low performance. This paper
   presents an enhancement to an existing MC-HLS synthesis approach which
   solves this problem; it exploits and eliminates data duplication at
   multiple levels levels of the generated hierarchy, leading to a
   reduction in the number of levels and ultimately higher performance,
   lower cost implementations. When applied to synthesis of C-based Motion
   Estimation, Matrix Multiplication and Sobel Edge Detection applications,
   this enables reductions in Block RAM and Look Up Table (LUT) cost of up
   to 25\%, whilst simultaneously increasing throughput.}},

Title = {{BEHAVIOUR OF PLASTERED STRAW-BALE ASSEMBLIES SUBJECTED TO THREE-POINT
   BENDING}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The search for more sustainable construction methods has renewed
   interest in straw-bale construction. Rectangular straw bales stacked in
   a running bond and plastered on the interior and exterior faces have
   been shown to have adequate strength to resist typical loads found in
   one- and two-storey structures. The straw bales provide excellent
   insulation, while possessing low embodied energy compared to
   conventional insulation materials.
   The structural behaviour of a load-bearing plastered straw-bale wall
   subject to uniform compressive loading has been the focus of a number of
   studies reported in the literature. However, in a typical building wall,
   there will be numerous locations (such as around window and door
   openings) where the load paths produce areas of concentrated stress. The
   behaviour in these regions cannot necessarily be predicted using tests
   from uniformly loaded wall assemblies.
   This paper describes experiments on plastered single bale assemblies
   subjected to three-point bending. These assemblies develop shear and
   flexural stresses, and so simulate the stresses that exist around door
   and window openings in a wall. The specimens were rendered with
   lime-cement plaster, and were either unreinforced, or contained steel
   ``diamond lath{''} mesh embedded within the plaster. The specimens were
   pin-supported at various centre-to-centre distances (L) ranging from 200
   mm to 500 mm. The height (H) of all specimens was constant at 330 mm.
   This gave a range of H/L values of 0.66 to 1.65.
   Two distinct types of failure were observed. For tests with H/L < 1,
   failure was due to flexural tension cracks in the plaster which
   propagated through the depth of the plaster skin. For tests with H/L >
   1, failure was due to crushing of the plaster in compression under one
   of the loading points.
   It was shown that models based on simple mechanics were able to
   adequately predict the assembly strength. In particular, analysing the
   assemblies with H/L < 1 as simple beams, and using the transformed
   section concept to deal with the straw and steel mesh, was adequate for
   predicting their strength.
   The results suggest that current practice for straw bale construction is
   generally appropriate. To avoid tensile cracking of plaster due to
   flexure, regions around doors, windows, and other openings should be
   designed such that H/L > 1. In regions where H/L < 1, the use of steel
   reinforcing mesh can increase the plastered bale strength by 30\% on
   average.}},

Abstract = {{Natural convective heat transfer from a wide isothermal plate which has
   a wavy surface, i.e., has a surface which periodically rises and falls,
   has been numerically studied. The main purpose of the study was to
   examine the effect of the surface waviness on the conditions under which
   transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurred and to study the
   effect of the surface waviness on the heat transfer rate. The surface
   waves, which have a saw-tooth cross-sectional shape, are normal to the
   direction of flow over the surface and have a relatively small
   amplitude. The range of Rayleigh numbers considered in the present study
   extends from values that for a non-wavy plate would be associated with
   laminar flow to values that would be associated with fully turbulent
   flow. The flow has been assumed to be steady and fluid properties have
   been assumed constant except for the density change with temperature
   that gives rise to the buoyancy forces, this being treated by means of
   the Boussinesq type approximation. A standard k-epsilon turbulence model
   with full account being taken of the effects of the buoyancy forces has
   been used in obtaining the solution. The solution has been obtained
   using the commercial CFD solver FLUENT. The solution has the following
   parameters: the Rayleigh number based on the plate height, the Prandtl
   number, the dimensionless amplitude of the surface waviness, and the
   dimensionless pitch of the surface waviness. Results have been obtained
   for a Prandtl number of 0.7 and for a single dimensionless pitch value
   for Rayleigh numbers between approximately 10(6) and 10(12). The effects
   of Rayleigh number and dimensionless amplitude on the mean heat transfer
   rate have been studied. It is convenient in presenting the results to
   introduce two mean heat transfer rates, one based on the total surface
   area and the other based on the projected frontal area of the surface.}},

Abstract = {{Most numerical studies of convective heat transfer between a
   window-blind system and a room are based on the assumption that the flow
   remains laminar. However, in the case of larger windows it is to be
   expected that transition to turbulent flow will occur in the system. The
   aim of the present study was to numerically determine when transition to
   turbulent flow occurs in a recessed window system and the effect of a
   simple partially open plane blind on when transition occurs. An
   approximate model of a recessed window that is covered by a partially
   open plane blind has been considered. The inner surface of the window is
   modeled as a plane vertical isothermal surface and the blind as a thin
   plane surface that offers no resistance to heat transfer. The fluid
   properties have been assumed constant except for the density change with
   temperature that gives rise to the buoyancy forces, this being dealt
   with using the Boussinesq approach. Radiant heat transfer effects have
   been neglected. The k-epsilon turbulence model with the full effects of
   the buoyancy forces being accounted for has been used in obtaining the
   solution. The governing equations have been solved using the commercial
   finite-volume based cfd code FLUENT. The solution has as parameters: (1)
   the Rayleigh number, (2) the Prandtl number, (3) the dimensionless
   `window' recess depth, (4) the dimensionless blind opening, and (5)
   whether the `window' surface is at a higher or lower temperature than
   the room air. Because of the application being considered results have
   only been obtained for Pr = 0.7 and for the case where the `window'
   surface is at a higher temperature than the room air. The effect of
   transition on the mean Nusselt number variation with Rayleigh number
   with various blind openings for various dimensionless window recess
   depths has in particular been studied.}},

Abstract = {{Mixing of liquids in micro mixers at low Reynolds numbers is a
   challenging task since the flow regime is laminar and it is difficult to
   engage instabilities of the flow. In many microfluidic systems, mixing
   can be improved by means of electrokinetic effects. A favorable micro
   mixer design consists of a Y-junction, where the different liquid
   streams merge, and a subsequent meandering microchannel. A pressure
   gradient pumps the liquids to be mixed through the microchannel. An
   oscillating electrical field is superimposed onto the pressure-driven
   base flow which generates an additional electrokinetic (electro osmotic)
   flow. These oscillating secondary flows in conjunction with the
   meandering geometry are responsible for stretching and folding of the
   contact area of the liquids to be mixed which enhances the mass transfer
   rates considerably. In this contribution, we present a mathematical
   model which allows for the numerical simulation of flow, electrical
   potential, and species concentration. The model is validated by
   experiments relying on Micro Particle Image Velocimetry (mu PIV).
   Consequently, this model can be used to numerically optimize the
   electrical field in order to achieve fast and high mixing even at low
   Reynolds numbers.}},

Abstract = {{A major goal of many manufacturers is to minimize production downtime
   caused by machine faults and equipment breakdowns. This goal is
   typically achieved using sensor-based systems that can quickly detect
   and diagnose machine faults of various types. This paper proposes the
   use of a video event detection method based on spatiotemporal volumes
   (STVs) in a fault monitoring application to complement and improve upon
   existing systems. To detect faults, a set of image sequences are
   captured using a single web cam from the part dispensing region of an
   assembly machine testbed. The motion is segmented in each image creating
   binary frames which are stacked to build a STV. Normal operation of the
   machine is modeled by building a STV from several training sequences.
   New STVs are compared to the model and classified as either normal or
   faulty behaviour based on a calculated similarity measure. Both full-STV
   and partial-STV matching methods are tested. Test results show that the
   system is very effective on the data set collected. Recommendations for
   further exploration of this concept are made that include alternative
   video event detection techniques and different testbeds.}},

Abstract = {{In harsh operational conditions, machines lose components on a frequent
   basis, causing a significant footprint to the surrounding environment.
   This affects operational up-time, safety measures and cost
   effectiveness. This paper proposes the use of an integrated RFID-WSN
   architecture to reduce the footprint of mining equipment used in the
   Canadian Oil Sands industry. Sensors and RFID tags provide both
   identification and positioning data for detecting broken parts from
   Ground Engaging Tools (GETs), such as huge shovel teeth. A
   delay-tolerant delivery approach utilizes mobile couriers, placed on
   loading trucks available in the vicinity, to store and carry data from
   readers and relays to remote base-stations. Delivering data in such
   harsh mining environments poses several challenges including power
   scarcity, vast transmission distances and the lack of an accessible
   communication infrastructure. We provide a use case to demonstrate how
   this architecture successfully overcomes these challenges within the
   harsh industrial environment of the Oil Sands.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to the capacity approaching performance of iteratively
   decoded low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, many practical
   finite-length LDPC codes exhibit performance degradation, manifested in
   a so-called error floor, corresponding to a significant flattening in
   the error probability curves. Recent works have shown that the dominant
   trapping sets in the generator-based Tanner Graph (TG) of Fountain codes
   are the absorbing sets. In this paper, we demonstrate how these
   absorbing sets are damaging to the realized rate, delay, and decoding
   cost of Fountain codes. We further introduce the properties of these
   dominant trapping sets and propose a new encoder and decoder for
   Fountain codes. Our experimental results show that this new codec leads
   to improvements in realized rate, decoding cost and error performance.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of using stored hot water generated during the day by
   using solar energy to assist in the provision of adequate buoyancy
   driven natural ventilation flow rates through small theatres during the
   evening hours has been numerically investigated in a very basic manner.
   The hot water would be used to heat the air using a plate type heat
   exchanger system mounted in a roof-top chimney-like air discharge
   system. A simple building with a given cross-sectional design has been
   considered. Two-dimensional steady flow has been assumed to exist and
   the flow has been assumed to be symmetrical about the vertical
   centre-line through the building. The Boussinesq approximation has been
   adopted, i.e., the air properties have been assumed constant except for
   the density change with temperature that gives rise to the buoyancy
   forces, this being treated assuming a linear relation between the
   density changes and the temperature change. Radiant heat transfer
   effects have been neglected. The standard k-epsilon turbulence model
   with buoyancy effects being fully accounted for has been used. The heat
   generation from the audience has been treated as a uniformly distributed
   heat flux over the floor, the smaller the audience, the lower being this
   heat flux. The solution has been obtained using the commercial CFD
   solver FLUENT(C). The results, while of a very preliminary nature,
   indicate that the proposed system could provide an adequate natural
   ventilation flow rate.}},

Abstract = {{Kinematics testing is essential during the development of total knee
   replacement (TKR) designs. Although computational analysis cannot
   replace physical testing, it offers repeatability and consistency at a
   much lower cost and shorter time, making it an excellent complement to
   experiments. Previous numerical models have been limited by several
   factors: the validity of the models is usually only considered for a
   single TKR design, friction models are typically overly simplified and
   the determination of simulation parameters is often inadequate, or
   tedious and expensive. The objective of this study is to develop,
   calibrate and validate a TKR kinematics simulation considering multiple
   TKR geometries, an accurate friction model and simulation parameters
   determined using a systematic optimisation method. The calibrated model
   was able to predict TKR kinematics for different TKR geometries, and is
   ideal for screening new implant designs, reducing the number of
   experiments required at the design stage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a scheme to enumerate the incident waves impinging
   on a high dimensional uniform linear array using relatively few samples.
   The approach is based on Minimum Description Length (MDL) criteria and
   statistical properties of eigenvalues of the Sample Covariance Matrix
   (SCM). We assume that several models, with each model representing a
   certain number of sources, will compete and MDL criterion will select
   the best model with the minimum model complexity and maximum model
   decision. Statistics of noise eigenvalue of SCM can be approximated by
   the distributional properties of the eigenvalues given by
   Marcenko-Pastur distribution in the signal-free SCM. In this paper we
   use random matrix theory to determine the statistical properties of the
   moments of noise eigenvalues of SCM to separate noise and signal
   eigenvalues. Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the
   performance of proposed estimator compared with some other enumerators
   in sample starved regime.}},

   performance of the microgrid, a novel transient control strategy based
   on the static droop characteristics is presented in this paper. To
   provide the active damping of the low-frequency power sharing modes at
   different loading conditions, the derivative terms of active and
   reactive powers have been added to droop functions. The transient droop
   gains are adaptively scheduled in order to yield desired transient and
   steady-state response. The proposed controller ensures a stable and

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the performance investigation of
   single-phase grid-connected inverters in which rotating reference frame
   control strategy is used. Single-phase grid-connected inverters have
   found wide applications in interfacing small renewable energy sources to
   the grid. Naturally the single phase structure of these systems prevents
   using some well-known three-phase control strategies. One method to
   overcome this limitation is to virtually generate an orthogonal quantity
   and then exploit the existing three-phase control methods. This approach
   requires a phase-shifting block to generate the additional control
   signal. In this paper, several methods used to accomplish this task are
   investigated and compared from the standpoints of dynamic and
   steady-state performance. Therefore, the complete state-space model of
   the system is derived and linearized for small-signal studies. The
   results of comparison between different approaches are given.}},

Abstract = {{The integration between Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) and Global
   Positioning System (GPS) based on Kalman Filter (KF) has been widely
   used. In INS/GPS systems, KF utilizes linearized dynamic models for INS
   errors modeling and GPS measurements. If Low-Cost MEMS-based inertial
   sensors with complex stochastic error nonlinearity are used, performance
   degrades significantly during short periods of GPS-outages due to the
   approximation introduced in the linearized INS errors dynamic model.
   This paper proposes a nonlinear data-driven INS-errors modeling based on
   Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). During reliable GPS availability, the
   correct vehicle state, sensors measurements, and INS output deviations
   from GPS measurements are collected. During GPS-outages, GPR is applied
   to recently collected data set to predict INS deviations from GPS. The
   predicted INS deviations are then fed to KF as a virtual update to
   estimate all INS errors. The proposed technique was tested with a
   low-cost Reduced Inertial Sensors System (RISS) for land-vehicles in
   which the vehicle odometer is used along with inertial sensors. Real
   road experiments on two different trajectories showed significant
   improvements during long GPS-outages.}},

Abstract = {{With the rise of internet of things an immense number of RFID tags will
   be associated with different systems that require not only strong
   authentication protocols, but also time-and power-efficient protocols to
   authenticate more tags in a given time window. In current tag
   authentication protocols, a tag is considered authentic if the
   interrogators find a match to the tag's encrypted (e. g., using some
   hashing function) reply in the system's database. Tree-based
   authentication protocols provide rapid authentication by limiting the
   searched keys at the interrogator from O(N) to O(log(N)), where N is the
   number of leaves in the balanced tree. However, if one tag is
   compromised in such protocols, other tags will be at risk of being
   compromised. In this paper we propose Unique Hash Sequence
   Authentication (UHSA) protocol. The protocol utilizes tag-interrogator
   interaction, with a continuous wave (CW) sensor at the tag to cut off
   tags encrypted reply when the received bits are enough to determine next
   node in the tree without receiving the whole reply. Cutting off the
   encrypted reply limits the information that can be obtained by the
   adversary to compromise the tag. In addition, the reduction in tag reply
   length greatly enhances the time and power efficiency of the RFID system
   during the authentication process by more than 90\% when compared to
   existing authentication protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Web services are widely used as basic constructs to build complex
   distributed applications with fast speed and low cost. However, existing
   service discovery techniques provide users with poor results which
   require substantial human intervention to filter the services to locate
   the desired ones. In particular, users often have no prior knowledge of
   the functional description of the available services on the Web. The
   queries formulated by the users may not match well with the service
   descriptions of existing services. As a consequence, a user's query can
   result in a large number of returned services. In this paper, we propose
   an approach that derives the semantic concepts conveyed in the service
   descriptions and clusters the services based on the concepts. As a
   result, each concept is associated with a set of relevant services. To
   understand the semantic meanings of a user's query, we identify concepts
   behind the query and recommend related concepts associated with
   services. Our approach also guides users to formulate their queries. We
   conducted a case study and found that the average precision and recall
   of our approach for service discovery are respectively, 83\% and 100\%.
   We also performed a user study which shows that for 85\% of time, a user
   reformulates their queries using the suggestion provided by our approach
   to improve the precision of the retrieved services.}},

Abstract = {{The Message Passing Interface (MPI) message queues have been shown to
   grow proportionately to the job size for many applications. With such a
   behaviour and knowing that message queues are used very frequently,
   ensuring fast queue operations at large scales is of paramount
   importance in the current and the upcoming exascale computing eras.
   Scalability, however, is two-fold. With the growing processor core
   density per node, and the expected smaller memory density per core at
   larger scales, a queue mechanism that is blind on memory requirements
   poses another scalability issue even if it solves the speed of operation
   problem. In this work we propose a multidimensional queue traversal
   mechanism whose operation time and memory overhead grow sub-linearly
   with the job size. We compare our proposal with a linked list-based
   approach which is not scalable in terms of speed of operation, and with
   an array-based method which is not scalable in terms of memory
   consumption. Our proposed multidimensional approach yields queue
   operation time speedups that translate to up to 4-fold execution time
   improvement over the linked list design for the applications studied in
   this work. It also shows a consistent lower memory footprint compared to
   the array-based design.}},

Abstract = {{Designing reliability solutions for WSNs poses intricate challenges due
   to limitations in processing power and available energy. Such networks
   are often deployed in harsh and inaccessible environments and are
   therefore required to be highly reliable. However, reliability normally
   translates to redundancy in hardware and other resources implying both
   complexity and higher costs. In this study, we consider data
   survivability in WSNs. We present a data-centric framework based on
   Decentralized Erasure Codes (DEC) to increase the likelihood of data
   survivability in case of sensor nodes failure. The proposed framework
   enables network engineers to estimate the redundancy in hardware and
   data to achieve a given data survivability level. We also show two
   approaches to reduce the energy requirements of the proposed coding
   scheme using Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC). In addition to being
   decentralized, the proposed schemes are low in complexity requiring only
   binary coding over F-2. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
   schemes by simulations and compare them to schemes with no network
   coding.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an adaptive power control scheme capable of online
   learning and self-tuning for microgrid applications. Conventional PI
   controllers, typically implemented in synchronous (dq) reference frame,
   have been traditionally used in power control of distributed generators
   (DGs). Despite having good behavior in controlling dc variables, these
   controllers show poor response in case of load changes and high
   penetration of DGs in the microgrid. In our proposed approach a fuzzy
   logic inspired critic-based control is combined with traditional PI
   regulators to consolidate intelligence and robustness in the system. The
   resulted control scheme is a self-tuning and adaptive control with
   on-line learning capability. Simulation results verify the superiority
   and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to traditional
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Recently announced magnetic models for four slowly pulsating B (SPB) and
   beta Cep stars, along with magnetic detections for two additional stars,
   have potentially doubled the number of known magnetic SPB and beta Cep
   stars, a result that stands in contrast to MiMeS survey results (see
   Grunhut et al., these proceedings). We have reanalyzed the published
   data and re-reduced archival low resolution spectropolarimetry collected
   with the FORS1/2 instruments at VLT on which the models were based and
   compare them with high resolution data from the ESPaDOnS
   spectropolarimeter at CFHT, investigating previously noted
   inconsistencies between results from the two instruments.}},

Abstract = {{Germanium is one of the most promising materials for high performance
   infra-red photovoltaic devices. High quality single-crystal germanium on
   insulator structures can be produced by a Rapid Melt Growth process.
   Experiments show that thin-film germanium deposited by physical vapor
   deposition provides better quality in comparison with chemical vapor
   deposition. The longitudinal optical Ge-Ge peak in Raman spectrum is
   shifted from the expected 300.2 cm(-1) position due to tensile stress
   resulting from the thermal expansion differences of the materials. The
   importance of silicon in the rapid melt process is confirmed by the fact
   that germanium films on sapphire substrates yielded polycrystalline
   structure. Films produced at high temperature (980 degrees C) show Ge-Ge
   Raman peak with linewidth of 3.3 cm(-1) indicating good crystalline
   quality, comparable to bulk germanium (3.2 cm(-1)), and thus
   demonstrating the potential to produce low cost high quality germanium
   films.}},

Abstract = {{Earth scientists have long known of the existence of black coatings on
   exposed rocks in smelter-impacted areas such as Sudbury, Ontario or
   Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. Black rock coatings in the Greater Sudbury area
   are remarkable geological records of atmospheric conditions, including
   mixing, scavenging, and oxidation processes, deposition rates, and the
   nature and source of anthropogenic releases to the atmosphere. The
   coatings are composed of an amorphous silica matrix that has trapped
   atmosphere-borne nanoparticles and has preserved their chemical and
   isotopic signature. These coatings are the product of high emissions of
   SO2 and subsequent non-stoichiometric dissolution of exposed siliceous
   rocks. The coatings contain spherical smelter-derived Cu-Ni-oxide
   particulate matter (micrometre and nanometre-sized) and
   metal-sulphaterich layers composed of nanometre aggregates of Fe-Cu
   sulphates. Lead, As, and Se-bearing nanoparticles emitted from smelters
   are incorporated in metal-sulphate-rich layers along the
   atmosphere-coating interface, presumably during coating formation. On a
   regional scale, ratios between different metal(loid)s in the coatings
   indicate that small diameter primary Pb, As and Se-bearing sulphate
   aerosols have been deposited at higher rates compared to larger,
   Ni-bearing particulate matter. High sulphur isotope values in coatings
   closer to smelting centres and their decrease with distance from the
   smelters is attributed to an increase in mixing of primary and secondary
   sulphates.}},

Abstract = {{In software product lines, multiple products of a software product
   family, share source code of common components. New features added to
   the common components of a software product family, are integrated into
   products following a selective code integration process. Selective code
   integration is a process in which developers pick the commits (i.e.,
   code changes) related to a feature from one code branch and integrate
   them into another code branch. Developers often manually link the
   commits to the features to enable the selective integration of features.
   In current practice, not all dependent commits are always linked to
   features and developers might miss the unlinked commits during selective
   code integration. In this paper, we propose two grouping approaches that
   identify dependencies among commits and create groups of dependent
   commits that need to be integrated as a whole into a code branch. Our
   first approach is automatic and the other is developer-guided. Through a
   case study on data derived from a product line of mobile software
   applications, we show that our approaches can help to reduce by up to
   94\% integration failures caused by missing commit dependencies.}},

Abstract = {{To deliver a high quality software system in a short release cycle time,
   many software organizations chose to reuse existing mature software
   systems. Google has adapted one of the most reused computer operating
   systems (i.e., Linux) into an operating system for mobile devices (i.e.,
   Android). The Android mobile operating system has become one of the most
   popular adaptations of the Linux kernel with approximately 60 millions
   new mobile devices running Android each year. Despite many studies on
   Linux, none have investigated the challenges and benefits of reusing and
   adapting the Linux kernel to mobile platforms. In this paper, we conduct
   an empirical study to understand how Android adapts the Linux kernel.
   Using software repositories from Linux and Android, we assess the effort
   needed to reuse and adapt the Linux kernel into Android. Results show
   that (1) only 0.7\% of files from the Linux kernel are modified when
   reused for a mobile platform; (2) only 5\% of Android files are affected
   by the merging of changes on files from the Linux repository to the
   Android repository; and (3) 95\% of bugs experienced by users of the
   Android kernel are fixed in the Linux kernel repository. These results
   can help development teams to better plan software adaptations.}},

Abstract = {{We present a needle deflection estimation method to compensate for
   needle bending during insertion into deformable tissue. We combine a
   kinematic needle deflection estimation model, electromagnetic (EM)
   trackers, and a Kalman filter (KF). We reduce the impact of error from
   the needle deflection estimation model by using the fusion of two EM
   trackers to report the approximate needle tip position in real-time. One
   reliable EM tracker is installed on the needle base, and estimates the
   needle tip position using the kinematic needle deflection model. A
   smaller but much less reliable EM tracker is installed on the needle
   tip, and estimates the needle tip position through direct noisy
   measurements. Using a KF, the sensory information from both EM trackers
   is fused to provide a reliable estimate of the needle tip position with
   much reduced variance in the estimation error. We then implement this
   method to compensate for needle deflection during simulated prostate
   cancer brachytherapy needle insertion. At a typical maximum insertion
   depth of 15 cm, needle tip mean estimation error was reduced from 2.39
   mm to 0.31 mm, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method,
   offering a clinically practical solution.}},

Abstract = {{A modification method based on integrated contact pressure and surface

   times SEMG signals are significantly more correlated to the force
   induced at the wrist (F-W), yielding SEMG-force models with superior
   performance in force estimation. A sensor patch, combining six SEMG and
   six contact pressure sensors was designed and built. SEMG, and contact
   pressure data over the biceps brachii and induced wrist force data were
   collected from 5 subjects. Polynomial fitting was used to find a mapping
   between biceps SEMG and wrist force. Comparison between evaluation

Abstract = {{Distributed air-gap inductors have the advantage of low fringing effect
   loss. However, the flux density uniformly distributes in the magnetic
   cores, which results in the magnetic material closer to conductor
   becoming saturated while the magnetic material far away from the
   conductor is still not fully utilized. This paper proposes a
   multi-permeability distributed air-gap inductor structure to increase
   inductance without the necessity of increasing the inductor volume. The
   discrete permeability values are investigated. Inductance variations
   versus number of permeability layers are obtained under the condition
   that the inductor thickness is constant. To evaluate the proposed
   method, a three-permeability inductor together with a single
   permeability inductor is fabricated. The measured results show that the
   three-permeability inductor has much higher inductance than the
   single-permeability inductor for the whole load range. Both inductors
   are tested in a 5V input, 3V output DC/DC converter to compare their
   performances. The results show the three-permeability inductor could
   further improve light load efficiency of high frequency DC/DC
   converters.}},

Abstract = {{The interleaving and phase shedding techniques on LLC resonant
   converters will increase the load capacity, reduce the output current
   ripple and improve the efficiency. However, conventional
   frequency-controlled LLCs will lose regulation in individual phases if
   all phases are synchronized for interleaving, causing current imbalance.
   Existing load-sharing solutions for multiphase LLCs cannot achieve
   voltage regulation, phase shedding, and expandable load capacity all at
   the same time. In this paper, a switch-controlled capacitor (SCC)
   modulated LLC converter (SCC-LLC) is presented for multiphase
   paralleling. It features constant switching frequency, which results in
   a simple structure for paralleling and the ability for phase shedding to
   improve light-load efficiency. In the proposed structure, a SCC unit is
   used in each individual LLC stage to regulate the output gain, thereby
   inherently solves the conflict between the interleaving and the load
   sharing.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs) have recently been proposed as
   a way to bring cognitive radio technology to traditional ad hoc
   networks. An important problem is to design a medium access control
   (MAC) protocol that addresses the decentralized control and local
   observation for spectrum management. In this paper, we propose a
   cognitive MAC protocol with mobility support (CM-MAC) based on Carrier
   Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) technique, where
   CM-MAC protocol can respond to the CRs vicinity state to primary
   exclusive regions. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the throughput
   performance for the proposed MAC protocol with the consideration of
   multiple primary user activities and CR node mobility. Our analytical
   results show that the proposed MAC protocol has desired upper bound of
   spectrum utilization as well as outperforms the throughput performance
   of CSMA/CA MAC and statistical channel allocation (SAC) MAC protocols
   given a certain condition.}},

Abstract = {{Realising high performance image and signal processing applications on
   modern FPGA presents a challenging implementation problem due to the
   large data frames streaming through these systems. Specifically, to meet
   the high bandwidth and data storage demands of these applications,
   complex hierarchical memory architectures must be manually specified at
   the Register Transfer Level (RTL). Automated approaches which convert
   high-level operation descriptions, for instance in the form of C
   programs, to an FPGA architecture, are unable to automatically realise
   such architectures. This paper presents a solution to this problem. It
   presents a compiler to automatically derive such memory architectures
   from a C program. By transforming the input C program to a unique
   dataflow modelling dialect, known as Valved Dataflow (VDF), a mapping
   and synthesis approach developed for this dialect can be exploited to
   automatically create high performance image and video processing
   architectures. Memory intensive C kernels for Motion Estimation (CIF
   Frames at 30 fps), Matrix Multiplication (128x128 @ 500 iter/sec) and
   Sobel Edge Detection (720p @ 30 fps), which are unrealisable by current
   state-of-the-art C-based synthesis tools, are automatically derived from
   a C description of the algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{For modern FPGA, implementation of memory intensive processing
   applications such as high end image and video processing systems
   necessitates manual design of complex multi-level memory hierarchies
   incorporating off-chip DDR and on-chip BRAM and LUT RAM. In fact,
   automated synthesis of multi-level memory hierarchies is an open problem
   facing high level synthesis technologies for FPGA devices. In this paper
   we describe the first automated solution to this problem. By exploiting
   a novel dataflow application modelling dialect, known as Valved
   Dataflow, we show for the first time how, not only can such
   architectures be automatically derived, but also that the resulting
   implementations support real-time processing for current image
   processing application standards such as H.264. We demonstrate the
   viability of this approach by reporting the performance and cost of
   hierarchies automatically generated for Motion Estimation, Matrix
   Multiplication and Sobel Edge Detection applications on Virtex-5 FPGA.}},

Abstract = {{PKM (parallel kinematic machine) based production systems have shown
   their potential for large volume manufacturing. However, integrating
   5-axis PKM machine tools directly into an existing system will lead to
   unnecessary redundant motions, which may cause many negative effects on
   the accuracy and productivity of the system. To cope with this problem,
   a new PKM based production system for aircraft wing assembly, named PAW,
   is proposed by using a holistic design approach in this paper. PAW is
   constructed by a unique PKM architecture mounted on a gantry-like
   worktable. Mobility, kinematics and Jacobian analyses are conducted, as
   well as dimensional optimization for the new PKM. Specially, the task
   space variables are directly employed for kinematic analysis, and the
   task workspace is directly utilized for the dimensional synthesis. As a
   result, the PAW system shows a better performance comparing to the those
   currently in production. It is not only suitable for wing assembly tasks
   (e. g. drilling) but also for other large volume manufacturing tasks,
   such as trimming and sealing.}},

Abstract = {{Decision makers are required to make critical decisions throughout all
   stages of a life-cycle in large-scale projects. These decisions are
   important as they impact upon the outcome and the success of projects.
   In this paper we present an evidential reasoning framework to aid
   decision-makers in the decision making process. This approach utilizes
   the Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSm) to fuse heterogeneous evidence
   sources that suffer from levels of uncertainty, imprecision and
   conflicts to provide beliefs for decision options. To analyze the impact
   that source reliability and priority has upon the decision making
   process a reliability discounting technique along with a priority
   discounting technique are applied. Application of the evidential
   reasoning framework is illustrated using a Case Study based in the
   Aerospace domain.}},

Abstract = {{Mean shift (MS) and subspace constrained mean shift (SCMS) algorithms
   are iterative methods to find an underlying manifold associated with an
   intrinsically low dimensional data set embedded in a high dimensional
   space. Although the MS and SCMS algorithms have been used in many
   applications related to information and signal processing, a rigorous
   study of their convergence properties is still missing. This paper aims
   to fill some of the gaps between theory and practice. We present
   theoretical results about convergence of the MS and SCMS algorithms. As
   well, we discuss potential applications of the SCMS algorithm as a
   preprocessing step for noisy source vector quantization and nonlinear

Abstract = {{This paper describes performance optimizations of a transfer controller
   for an FPGA-based blocked parallel matrix multiplication accelerator.
   One of the key challenges of the controller is the generation of a
   sequence of host memory addresses to transfer blocks of matrices between
   host and on-chip memories. These addresses are not contiguous, thereby
   introducing complexity for the controller design. This paper first
   outlines the intended system architecture for this controller. Next,
   detailed controller specifications are presented for generating host
   memory addresses. Various pipeline configurations that yield incremental
   performance improvements are then described. Finally, experimental
   results are presented, with the best configuration having an operating
   frequency exceeding 470 MHz on an Altera Stratix III chip. This level of
   performance is comparable to that of the pipelined floating-point
   arithmetic units in the complete system.}},

Abstract = {{The commonly employed the H-2/N-2 cell impedance method for the
   determination of PEMFC catalyst layer ionic resistance often results in
   significant deviations from the predicted idealized homogeneous catalyst
   layer properties. In this study, the effect of the distribution of
   resistance and capacitance within the thickness of the CL is modeled to
   examine whether it explains the observed deviations. It is found that
   uniformly and non-uniformly distributed CLs show limiting real impedance
   (vertical line on Nyquist plot) at low frequency, as long as the
   impedance has no faradaic contribution. However, using this value of
   real impedance for obtaining the ionic resistance of the catalyst layer
   leads to significant errors if the system is non-uniformly distributed.
   It is shown that Nyquist plots with non-vertical mid-frequency regions,
   resembling experimentally measured H-2/N-2 cell response, can be
   generated with a ``nested{''} transmission line circuit (agglomerate
   model) if there is a significant difference in resistance in different
   agglomerates. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Eastern Lake Ontario and the upper St. Lawrence River provide drinking
   water for approximately 175,000 people. To understand the flow dynamics
   surrounding the eight drinking water intakes in this region, the
   hydrodynamics were simulated using the Estuary and Lake Computer Model
   (ELCOM) for the period April-October 2006. Model simulated water levels,
   temperatures, and current velocities were compared with observations.
   Root-mean-square errors in temperature and current simulation were
   similar to 2 degrees C and similar to 5-8 cm s(-1), respectively.
   Normalized Fourier norms ranged from 0.8 to 1.2. These errors are
   consistent with other applications of Reynolds-averaged models to the
   Great Lakes. ELCOM thus reasonably captures the dynamics of the flow
   regimes in the nearshore region. The flow was found to be predominantly
   wind induced in the southwestern lacustrine portion of the domain, with
   observed but not modeled weak near-inertial oscillations, and
   hydraulically driven in the northeastern riverine portion. Diurnal and
   semi-diurnal forcing influenced the flow throughout the domain. Flow
   reversal of the St. Lawrence River near Kingston occurred during strong
   easterly storm events. The model results were applied to delineate
   Intake Protections Zones surrounding the municipal drinking water
   intakes. (C) 2011 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Abstract = {{Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is the most widely used technique
   for studying all aspects of phase transformations in steels over the

   TEM to this subject. It includes brief descriptions of sample
   preparation techniques and CTEM. The main body of the chapter considers
   modern TEM techniques and emerging TEM techniques, which offer new
   capabilities. For complete characterization of microstructures at all

Abstract = {{Reliable prediction of long-term medical device performance using
   computer simulation requires consideration of variability in surgical
   procedure, as well as patient-specific factors. However, even
   deterministic simulation of long-term failure processes for such devices
   is time and resource consuming so that including variability can lead to
   excessive time to achieve useful predictions. This study investigates
   the use of an accelerated probabilistic framework for predicting the
   likely performance envelope of a device and applies it to femoral
   prosthesis loosening in cemented hip arthroplasty.
   A creep and fatigue damage failure model for bone cement, in conjunction
   with an interfacial fatigue model for the implant-cement interface, was
   used to simulate loosening of a prosthesis within a cement mantle. A
   deterministic set of trial simulations was used to account for
   variability of a set of surgical and patient factors, and a response
   surface method was used to perform and accelerate a Monte Carlo
   simulation to achieve an estimate of the likely range of prosthesis
   loosening. The proposed framework was used to conceptually investigate
   the influence of prosthesis selection and surgical placement on
   prosthesis migration.
   Results demonstrate that the response surface method is capable of
   dramatically reducing the time to achieve convergence in mean and
   variance of predicted response variables. A critical requirement for
   realistic predictions is the size and quality of the initial training
   dataset used to generate the response surface and further work is
   required to determine the recommendations for a minimum number of
   initial trials. Results of this conceptual application predicted that
   loosening was sensitive to the implant size and femoral width.
   Furthermore, different rankings of implant performance were predicted
   when only individual simulations (e. g. an average condition) were used
   to rank implants, compared with when stochastic simulations were used.
   In conclusion, the proposed framework provides a viable approach to
   predicting realistic ranges of loosening behaviour for orthopaedic
   implants in reduced timeframes compared with conventional Monte Carlo
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{CCTV systems are broadly deployed in the present world. To ensure
   in-time reaction for intelligent surveillance, it is a fundamental task
   for real-world applications to determine the gender of people of
   interest. However, normal video algorithms for gender profiling (usually
   face profiling) have three drawbacks. First, the profiling result is
   always uncertain. Second, for a time-lasting gender profiling algorithm,
   the result is not stable. The degree of certainty usually varies,
   sometimes even to the extent that a male is classified as a female, and
   vice versa. Third, for a robust profiling result in cases were a
   person's face is not visible, other features, such as body shape, are
   required. These algorithms may provide different recognition results -
   at the very least, they will provide different degrees of certainties.
   To overcome these problems, in this paper, we introduce an evidential
   approach that makes use of profiling results from multiple algorithms
   over a period of time. Experiments show that this approach does provide
   better results than single profiling results and classic fusion results.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy rains spread over some interval preceding large landslides in
   sensitive glaciomarine clay in eastern Canada are often noted as a
   triggering or causative factor in case studies or research reports for
   individual landslides, although the quantity or duration of the
   triggering rain event has never been characterized adequately. We
   selected five large landslide events that occurred in the glaciomarine
   clay in eastern Canada, and calculated cumulative antecedent
   precipitation for intervals ranging between one and 365 days preceding
   each event. We also calculated the antecedent precipitation values for
   every other day in the record, and computed the relative rank of the
   landslide day within the complete record. Our results show that several
   intervals for each landslide event are highly ranked - including those
   preceding a presumably earthquake-triggered landslide - but overall the
   rankings were highly variable, ranging between 99\% and 6 \%. The set of
   highest-ranking intervals are unique for each event, including both
   short and long-term cumulative precipitation. All of the landslides
   occurred in the spring months, and the release of sequestered surface
   and ground water during the spring ground thaw may be related to the
   timing of the large landslides, so that the evolution of ground frost in
   the early winter may be of interest for landslide prediction. We found
   no simple precipitation threshold for triggering large landslides in
   sensitive glaciomarine clay in eastern Canada, suggesting that some
   complex temporal and spatial combination of pre-conditions, external
   energy (e. g. earthquakes), precipitation triggers and other factors
   such as ground frost formation and thaw are required to trigger a
   landslide.}},

Abstract = {{Ceria (CeO2) and ceria-based composite materials, especially Ce1-xZrxO2
   solid solutions, possess a wide range of applications in many important
   catalytic processes, such as three-way catalysts, owing to their
   excellent oxygen storage capacity (OSC) through the oxygen vacancy
   formation and refilling. Much of this activity has focused on the
   understanding of the electronic and structural properties of defective
   CeO2 with and without doping, and comprehending the determining factor
   for oxygen vacancy formation and the rule to tune the formation energy
   by doping has constituted a central issue in material chemistry related
   to ceria. However, the calculation on electronic structures and the
   corresponding relaxation patterns in defective CeO2-x oxides remains at
   present a challenge in the DFT framework. A pragmatic approach based on
   density functional theory with the inclusion of on-site Coulomb
   correction, i.e. the so-called DFT + U technique, has been extensively
   applied in the majority of recent theoretical investigations. Firstly,
   we review briefly the latest electronic structure calculations of
   defective CeO2(111), focusing on the phenomenon of multiple
   configurations of the localized 4f electrons, as well as the discussions
   of its formation mechanism and the catalytic role in activating the O-2
   molecule. Secondly, aiming at shedding light on the doping effect on
   tuning the oxygen vacancy formation in ceria-based solid solutions, we
   summarize the recent theoretical results of Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions
   in terms of the effect of dopant concentrations and crystal phases. A
   general model on O vacancy formation is also discussed; it consists of
   electrostatic and structural relaxation terms, and the vital role of the
   later is emphasized. Particularly, we discuss the crucial role of the
   localized structural relaxation patterns in determining the superb
   oxygen storage capacity in kappa-phase Ce1-xZr1-xO2. Thirdly, we briefly
   discuss some interesting findings for the oxygen vacancy formation in
   pure ceria nanoparticles (NPs) uncovered by DFT calculations and compare
   those with the bulk or extended surfaces of ceria as well as different
   particle sizes, emphasizing the role of the electrostatic field in
   determining the O vacancy formation.}},

Abstract = {{The performance optimization of automotive catalysts has been the focus
   of in-depth research for many years as the automotive industry has
   endeavoured to reduce the emission of toxic and pollutant gases
   generated from internal combustion engines. Just as the emissions from
   diesel and gasoline combustion vary, so do the emissions from the
   combustion of alternative fuels such as ethanol, with variation in both
   quantity and chemical composition. In particular, when ethanol is
   contained in the fuel, ethanol and acetaldehyde are present in the
   exhaust gas stream, and these are two compounds which the catalytic
   converter has not traditionally been designed to manage. The aim of the
   study outlined in this paper was to assess the performance of various
   catalyst formulations when subjected to a representative ethanol exhaust
   gas mixture. Three automotive catalytic converter formulations were
   tested, including a fully platinum sample, a palladium/rhodium three-way
   catalyst sample and a fully palladium sample. Initially the samples were
   tested using single component hydrocarbon light-off tests followed by a
   set of tests with carbon monoxide included as an inlet gas to observe
   its effect on each individual hydrocarbon oxidation. Finally, each
   formulation was tested using a full E85 exhaust gas mixture. The study
   was carried out using a synthetic gas reactor along with Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy and flame ionization detector exhaust
   gas analysers. All formulations showed selectivity toward acetaldehyde
   formation from ethanol dehydrogenation which resulted in negative
   acetaldehyde conversion across each of the samples during the mixture
   tests. The fully platinum sample was the most detrimentally affected by
   the introduction of carbon monoxide into the gas feed. The palladium and
   palladium/rhodium samples exhibited a tendency toward acetaldehyde
   decomposition resulting in methane and carbon monoxide formation. The
   platinum sample did not form methane but did form ethylene as a result
   of ethanol dehydration.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, stiffness of planar translational wire-actuated parallel
   manipulators is studied. The complete form of the stiffness matrix of
   the two degrees of freedom manipulators is formulated parametrically.
   The differential form of the static force balance equations is used to
   incorporate the variation of wire stiffness with wire length and the
   change in the Jacobian matrix under external force in the stiffness
   model. Failure of a wire, for the cases that the wire is disconnected or
   slack, as well as reconfiguring the anchor positions are investigated
   and their effects on the workspace of manipulators are presented while
   satisfying the constraints on wire tension and minimum stiffness.. The
   stiffness characteristics of an example manipulator, before and after a
   wire failure, are discussed. Optimum layouts of the manipulator, by
   reconfiguring the positions of wire anchors, are identified to maximize
   the area of the stiffness maps.}},

Abstract = {{Collective communication operations in the Message Passing Interface
   (MPI) consume a significant amount of time at scale, degrading the
   performance of scientific applications. Optimizing collectives is key to
   application performance and scalability. This paper focuses on hiding
   the latency of the allgather collective by efficiently offloading it to
   the networking hardware. We have investigated the use of Mellanox
   CORE-Direct offloading technology for independent progression of
   communication within the collective in order to achieve high
   communication/computation overlap. This study evaluates several design
   options for the nonblocking allgather collective and discusses
   implementations of offloaded Standard Exchange, Ring and Bruck
   algorithms in flat and hierarchical communicators under single-port and
   k-port modelling. We have applied our findings to improving the
   performance of the redesigned Radix Sort application kernel. Performance
   results suggest that our offloaded nonblocking allgather compares
   favourably to the blocking variant (with improvements of up to 68\% for
   medium messages in a hierarchical collective) while providing high
   overlap capability. Multiport modelling is shown to be beneficial,
   especially in a flat communicator. Radix Sort enjoys up to 40\%
   improvement in its runtime.}},

Abstract = {{Tetrahexahedral Pt nanocrystals (THH Pt NCs), bound by high index
   facets, belong to an emerging class of nanomaterials that promise to
   bridge the gap between model and practical electrocatalysts. The
   atomically stepped surfaces of THH Pt NCs are extremely active for the
   electrooxidation of small organic molecules but they also readily
   accommodate the dissociative chemisorption of such species, resulting in
   poisoning by strongly adsorbed CO. Formic acid oxidation is an ideal
   reaction for studying the balance between these competing catalyst
   characteristics, since it can proceed by either a direct or a CO
   mediated pathway. Herein, we describe electrochemical and in situ FTIR
   spectroscopic investigations of formic acid electrooxidation at both
   clean and Au adatom decorated THH Pt NC surfaces. The Au decoration
   leads to higher catalytic currents and enhanced CO2 production in the
   low potential range. As the CO oxidation behaviour of the catalyst is
   not improved by the presence of the Au, it is likely that the role of
   the Au is to promote the direct pathway. Beyond their fundamental
   importance, these results are significant in the development of stable,
   poison resistant anodic electrocatalysts for direct formic acid fuel
   cells.}},

Abstract = {{Strenuous physical work puts expectant mothers at risk of experiencing
   back pain during the gestational months. Pregnant women in Benin perform
   physically demanding occupational tasks that include the lifting and
   carriage of heavy loads on their heads for commercial activities. A
   large percentage of pregnant subjects (58\%) reported having back pain
   episodes since the start of their pregnancy. However, the mean Oswestry
   score of the affected participants was relatively low with a mean score
   of 0.2 (SD: 0.12), on a scale form 0 to 1. An evaluation of the postural
   demands of the occupational activities of these women revealed that they
   performed on average 328 trunk flexions at angles exceeding 608, with 66
   of these flexions sustained for more than 4 s, during the average 7.9 h
   where trunk postures were recorded. They also spent on average 36\% of
   the recording time at trunk flexion angles larger than 20 degrees. These
   results show that the merchant pregnant women in the Porto-Novo area in
   Benin are at great risk for developing back disorders during pregnancy.}},

Title = {{ENHANCING KALMAN FILTERING-BASED TIGHTLY COUPLED NAVIGATION SOLUTION
   THROUGH REMEDIAL ESTIMATES FOR PSEUDORANGE MEASUREMENTS USING PARALLEL
   CASCADE IDENTIFICATION}},
Journal = {{INSTRUMENTATION SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Integrated global positioning system (GPS) solutions that utilize
   micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based inertial sensors provide a
   more accurate navigation solution than stand-alone GPS in challenging
   scenarios. To keep the integrated solution less affected by sensor
   errors and to decrease the cost, a reduced inertial sensor system
   (RISS), which consists of only one gyroscope and two accelerometers,
   together with an odometer and integrated with GPS, is proposed. Tightly
   coupled integration is a better choice in demanding scenarios, as it can
   provide GPS aiding even when the number of visible satellites is three
   or less. However, inaccuracies of pseudoranges measured by the GPS
   receiver and used as aiding in the RISS/odometer/GPS integration
   solution will affect the overall positioning accuracy. This article
   explores the benefits of using parallel cascade identification (PCI), a
   nonlinear system identification technique that improves the overall
   navigation solution by modeling residual pseudorange correlated errors
   to be used by a Kalman filter (KF)-based tightly coupled
   RISS/odometer/GPS navigational solution. When less than four satellites
   are visible, the identified parallel cascade model for the still visible
   satellites is used to predict the residual pseudorange errors for these
   respective satellites, and the corrected pseudorange value is provided
   to KF. The performance of PCI for correcting the pseudoranges is
   examined and verified using road test trajectories and compared to a
   traditional tightly coupled RISS/odometer/GPS KF solution. The results
   demonstrate the advantages of this technique in correcting the
   pseudoranges and enhancing the positional solution.}},

Abstract = {{Naphthalenic compounds are a rich resource for designers of fluorescent
   sensing/switching/logic systems. The degree of internal charge transfer
   (ICT) character in the fluorophore excited states can vary from
   negligible to substantial. Naphthalene-1,8;4,5-diimides (11-13),
   1,8-naphthalimides (16) and 4-chloro-1,8-naphthalimides (15) are of the
   former type. The latter type is represented by the
   4-alkylamino-1,8-naphthalimides (1). Whether ICT-based or not, these
   serve as the fluorophore in `fluorophore-spacer-receptor' switching
   systems where PET holds sway until the receptor is bound to H+. On the
   other hand, 4-dialkylamino-1,8-naphthalimides (3-4) show modest
   H+-induced fluorescence switching unless the 4-dialkylamino group is a
   part of a small ring (5). Electrostatic destabilization of a
   non-emissive twisted internal charge transfer (ICT) excited state is the
   origin of this behaviour. An evolution to the non-emissive twisted ICT
   excited state is responsible for the weak emission of the model compound
   6 (and related structures 7 and 8) across the pH range. Twisted ICT
   excited states are also implicated in the switch 9 and its model
   compound 10, which are based on the
   6-dialkylamino-3H-benzimidazo{[}2,1-a]benz{[}d,e]isoquinolin-3-one
   fluorophore.}},

Abstract = {{The oro-pharyngeal-laryngeal human airway is a complex geometry; the
   flow physics within are subjected to and influenced by a variety of
   different factors that produce jet-like flow, re-circulating flows that

   experiment are the tools available to the fluid dynamics researcher.
   Simulation results obtained from direct and large-eddy simulation, and
   Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and associated models of turbulence are
   reviewed. Experimental data obtained through the use of flow
   visualisation, hot-wire anemometry and particle image velocimetry are
   also reviewed. A comparison of data obtained from the application of
   these tools reveals many inconsistencies that are explored in this
   article. While much progress has been made to understand some of the
   physics of the flow in the human airway, we continue to uncover new and
   significant fluid dynamic behaviour. Finally, future research directions

   doping concentrations show steeper S-slope values at lower drain bias
   than those doped with lower doping concentrations. It is demonstrated
   that for certain set of parameters, steep S-slope JL nanotransistors can
   latch to the on state and fail to turn-off. The work identifies the
   possible set of device parameters for which steep S-slope values can be

   excellent activity and selectivity toward oxygen reduction with hydrogen
   in the presence of ethylene. TAP vacuum pulse experiments have been
   utilised to understand the catalytic behaviour of the Ag/gamma-Al2O3
   catalyst. TAP multi-pulse experiments have determined the types of
   active sites that are found on the Ag/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst, and the
   intrinsic activity of these sites. The lifetime of the reactive adsorbed
   oxygen intermediate has also been determined through TAP consecutive
   pulse experiments. Multi-pulse and consecutive pulse data have been
   combined with ethylene adsorption/desorption rate constants to provide

Abstract = {{Polymeric tertiary amines react reversibly with CO2 in the presence of
   water to form trialkylammonium-bicarbonate polyelectrolytes. These
   polyamines are useful as ionogens for ``switchable water{''}, meaning an
   aqueous solution having switchable ionic strength. The performance of
   the polymeric ionogens in two different water purification applications
   was evaluated. Moderate results were obtained in the salting out of
   organic contaminants from aqueous solutions with up to 77\% of CH3CN
   forced out from a 1 : 1 (w/w) mixture of CH3CN-H2O. However, very
   promising results were obtained in the sedimentation of clay particles.
   A notable enhancement in both the settling time required and the
   supernatant turbidity was observed even with low loadings of the
   polymers (>10 ppm). The addition of CO2 is required for the polymers to
   induce settling. Dimethylamino-functionalized polymethyl methacrylate
   proved to be the best polymer evaluated thus far in this process. In
   addition to enhancing the settling of both kaolinite and montmorillonite
   suspensions at different concentrations, it was also successfully shown
   to enhance the settling of oil sand tailings.}},

Pages = {{3071-3076}},
Abstract = {{The ionic liquid, tributylmethylammonium methylcarbonate, has been
   employed as a catalytic base for clean N-methylation of indole with
   dimethylcarbonate. The reaction conditions were optimised under
   microwave heating to give 100\% conversion and 100\% selectivity to
   N-methylindole, and subsequently transferred to a high temperature/high
   pressure (285 degrees C/150 bar) continuous flow process using a short
   (3 min) residence time and 2 mol\% of the catalyst to efficiently
   methylate a variety of different amines, phenols, thiophenols and
   carboxylic acid substrates. The extremely short residence times,
   versatility, and high selectivity have significant implications for the
   synthesis of a wide range of pharmaceutical intermediates, as high
   product throughputs can be obtained via this scalable continuous flow
   protocol. It has also been shown that the ionic liquid can be generated
   in situ from tributylamine, which has the net effect of transforming an
   ineffective stoichiometric base into a highly efficient catalyst for
   this broad class of reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Spectrum sharing fairness is an important topic in cognitive radio ad
   hoc networks (CRAHNs) and cognitive radio sensor networks (CRSNs).
   Consensus-based protocols can provide light-weight and efficient
   solutions for CRAHNs and CRSNs but the theoretical ground needs to be
   investigated for spectrum sharing fairness. In this paper, we
   investigate the convergence condition when applying a consensus-based
   protocol to spectrum sharing while ensuring spectrum sharing fairness.
   Based on the local observation and local control scheme using
   spectrum-related information, an individual cognitive node can
   effectively perform the spectrum sharing. Then we propose a
   consensus-based protocol for spectrum sharing. Supported with computer
   simulation results, we show the effectiveness of using the proposed
   consensus-based protocol to solve the spectrum sharing problems in
   CRAHNs and CRSNs.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been what can only be described as an
   explosion in the types of processing devices one can expect to find
   within a given computer system. These include the multi-core CPU, the
   General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) and the Accelerated
   Processing Unit (APU), to name but a few. The widespread uptake of these
   systems presents would-be users with at least two problems. Firstly,
   each device exposes a complex underlying architecture which must be
   appreciated in order to attain optimal performance. This is coupled with
   the fact that a single system can support an arbitrary number of such
   devices. Consequently, fully leveraging the performance capabilities of
   such a system must come at a cost - increasingly prolonged development
   times. Adhering to a methodology will have the significant industrial
   impact of reducing these development times. This paper describes the
   continued formulation of such a novel methodology. Two real world
   scientific programs are optimized for execution on the CUDA platform.
   Double precision accuracy and optimized speedups (which include PCI-E
   transfer times) of 15x and 17x are achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Power management and energy savings in high-performance computing has
   become an increasingly important design constraint. The foundation of
   many power/energy saving methods is based on power consumption models,
   which commonly rely on hardware performance monitoring counters (PMCs).
   Various events are provided by processor manufacturers to be monitored
   using PMCs. PMC event selection has been mainly based on architectural
   intuitions. However, efficient use of PMCs requires a carefully selected
   set of events. Therefore, a comprehensive study of PMC events with
   regards to power modeling is needed to understand and enhance such power
   models.
   In this paper, we study the relationship of PMC events with power
   consumption in the context of single-PMC and multi-PMC power models. Our
   OpenMP applications are from NAS Parallel Benchmark (BT, CG, LU, and SP)
   running on an AMD machine. We present the single-PMC selection results
   for each of our test applications, as well as a unified list for all
   four applications. Unlike other work that do not consider PMCs as each
   others' covariates, we present a method to select the most correlated
   set of PMC events for a given application. Our method finds the desired
   set of events with 6 times less number of executions compared to a
   principal component analysis (PCA) method. In addition, we have
   investigated variability of measurement for correlation coefficients.
   The 95\% confidence interval of power-PMC and PMC-PMC correlation
   coefficients falls within 1.6\% and 2.3\% of their measured values,
   respectively. Furthermore, we study the power and PMC trends in the
   context of time-series and show that power estimates can be enhanced
   more than common regression methods. We show that the ARMAX model, a
   time-series candidate for real-time power estimation, can estimate
   system power consumption with a mean absolute error (total signal) of
   0.1-0.5 \% in our applications.}},

   networks (WiFi). Unlike current RSS-based indoor systems, the proposed
   system doesn't require time-consuming offline radio survey or
   prior-knowledge about the area or new hardware. Similar to GPS, the
   system consists of three segments; network segment (WiFi), control
   segment, and user segment. RSS observations are exchanged periodically
   between network segment and control segment. The control segment uses a
   novel hybrid propagation modeling (PM) technique using logarithmic decay
   model augmented by a nonlinear Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) that
   models RSS residuals that cannot be modeled by the traditional
   logarithmic decay models indoors. PM parameters are periodically
   estimated and sent to each AP. The user segment receives RSS and PM
   parameters from APs and performs trilateration weighting each
   observation by a variance calculated by GPR. Real experiments in indoor
   area show reliable meter accuracy comparable to those obtained from
   similar RSS-based indoor methods that uses offline time-consuming
   training such as fingerprinting.}},

Title = {{The analysis of large-scale turbulence characteristics in the Indonesian
   seas derived from a regional model based on the Princeton Ocean Model}},
Journal = {{OCEAN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{615-631}},
Abstract = {{Turbulence characteristics in the Indonesian seas on the horizontal
   scale of order of 100 km were calculated with a regional model of the
   Indonesian seas circulation in the area based on the Princeton Ocean
   Model (POM). As is well known, the POM incorporates the Mellor-Yamada
   turbulence closure scheme. The calculated characteristics are: twice the
   turbulence kinetic energy per unit mass, q(2); the turbulence master
   scale, l; mixing coefficients of momentum, K-M; and temperature and
   salinity, K-H; etc. The analyzed turbulence has been generated
   essentially by the shear of large-scale ocean currents and by the
   large-scale wind turbulence. We focused on the analysis of turbulence
   around important topographic features, such as the Lifamatola Sill, the
   North Sangihe Ridge, the Dewakang Sill, and the North and South
   Halmahera Sea Sills. In general, the structure of turbulence
   characteristics in these regions turned out to be similar. For this
   reason, we have carried out a detailed analysis of the Lifamatola Sill
   region because dynamically this region is very important and some
   estimates of mixing coefficients in this area are available.
   Briefly, the main results are as follows. The distribution of q(2) is
   quite adequately reproduced by the model. To the north of the Lifamatola
   Sill (in the Maluku Sea) and to the south of the Sill (in the Seram
   Sea), large values of q(2) occur in the deep layer extending several
   hundred meters above the bottom. The observed increase of q(2) near the
   very bottom is probably due to the increase of velocity shear and the
   corresponding shear production of q(2) very close to the bottom. The
   turbulence master scale, l, was found to be constant in the main depth
   of the ocean, while l rapidly decreases close to the bottom, as one
   would expect. However, in deep profiles away from the sill, the effect
   of topography results in the l structure being unreasonably complicated
   as one moves towards the bottom. Values of 15 to 20 x 10(-4) m(2) s(-1)
   were obtained for K-M and K-H in deep water in the vicinity of the
   Lifamatola Sill. These estimates agree well with basin-scale averaged
   values of 13.3 x 10(-4) m(2) s(-1) found diagnostically for KH in the
   deep Banda and Seram Seas (Gordon et al., 2003) and a value of 9.0 x
   10(-4) m(2) s(-1) found diagnostically for KH for the deep Banda Sea
   system (van Aken et al., 1988). The somewhat higher simulated values can
   be explained by the presence of steep topography around the sill.}},

   power factor correction (PFC) AC/DC boost converter based on
   Control-Lyapunov function theory. It is shown in this paper that the
   dynamics of the boost converter can be significantly improved by
   implementing the proposed controller, which introduces a Lyapunov
   function to the system and determines the optimal converter duty-ratio
   needed to minimize the Lyapunov function. The performance of the
   proposed controller is confirmed on a digitally controlled 3 kW boost
   PFC converter operating at 100 kHz switching frequency. Experimental
   results show that the proposed controller causes the boost converter to
   operate with low input current harmonics and very fast output voltage
   transient responses that are much less than a single input line cycle,
   compared to responses of several input line cycle transient periods seen
   in conventional control schemes.}},

Abstract = {{DC/DC converters in electric vehicles (EVs) use planar magnetics to
   minimize their size and weight an to increase their ability to withstand
   mechanical vibrations. Typical planar transformers (PT) in DC/DC
   converters used in EVs have high inter-turn and inter-layer capacitances
   that cause them to draw high peak currents, increase voltage overshoot
   across secondary rectifying devices, and increase leakage current, which
   causes EMI problems. The paper proposes a novel winding layout strategy
   to mitigate the stray capacitance of planar transformers and also reduce
   overall EMI of a full-bridge DC-DC converter. The effectiveness of the
   proposed winding strategy is validated by analytical and experimental
   results that are presented in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed air-gap inductors have the advantage of reducing winding
   loss in high switching frequency DC/DC converters. However, they also
   have the disadvantage of uneven distribution of flux density, which
   inevitably leads to the incomplete utilization of magnetic material.
   This paper proposes a horizontal-winding multi-permeability distributed
   air-gap inductor structure to increase inductance without the increase
   of inductor volume. To evaluate the proposed method, a two-permeability
   inductor together with a single permeability inductor is fabricated. The
   measured results show the two-permeability inductor has higher
   inductance than the single-permeability one, especially at light load.
   Both inductors are tested in a 12V input, 1.6V output DC/DC converter to
   show their performance. The results show the two-permeability inductor
   could further improve light load efficiency of high frequency DC/DC
   converters.}},

Abstract = {{A new soft-switching PWM full-bridge converter is proposed in this
   paper. The outstanding feature of the new converter is that it allows
   its main power switches to operate with zero current switching (ZCS) and
   with fewer conduction losses than conventional full-bridge converters.
   This is achieved by using a very simple active auxiliary circuit and a
   few passive components. The paper presents the new converter and then
   discusses its operation, steady-state characteristics and design.
   Experimental results obtained from a converter prototype are presented
   to validate the converter's performance and the concepts presented in
   the paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a control scheme for a grid-connected three-phase
   voltage source inverter with an LCL filter, which is suited for
   renewable energy applications. The proposed method has the following
   properties: fast tracking, optimized dynamics, grid disturbance
   rejection, and active resonance damping. The controller is based on an
   augmented linear quadratic regulation (LQR) scheme, which is optimized
   based on a weighted cost function. The LQR controller is augmented to
   include two complex conjugate poles at the grid frequency for sinusoidal
   voltage disturbance rejection upon connection to the grid. Furthermore,
   this control scheme actively damps the resonance introduced into the
   closed-loop system through the third-order LCL filter. Finally, the
   current reference is found by calculating the instantaneous power, which
   allows for faster power tracking compared to using the technique of
   measuring average power. Results verify the validity of the proposed
   control scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Plugs are a common feature of most deep-draw thermoforming processes and
   are used to ensure that the wall thickness distribution in the final
   product is controlled and balanced. Through contact with a moving
   mechanical plug, the heated sheet is locally captured and protected from
   excessive deformation and thinning. Previous work has clearly
   demonstrated that slip plays a critical role during this process and
   that its magnitude is determined by frictional properties that are
   strongly dependent on temperature. Work to discover the appropriate
   friction relationships has been very limited to date and this has
   greatly hampered the progress towards effective thermoforming process
   simulations. In this paper the magnitude of slip that occurs during the
   plugging stage of the thermoforming process was experimentally
   investigated. Preform shapes were created by pushing a specially
   designed plug into a heated sheet and then freezing it at the end of the
   plug displacement. A variety of processing parameters such as the plug
   and sheet materials, the temperature and plug displacement were
   evaluated. The results show that large variations in slip occur when
   different combinations of plug and sheet materials are employed and
   these are most affected by the contact temperature. A finite element
   based simulation of the plugging process is currently being constructed
   and it will be used to investigate different friction relationships and
   compare their performance with the experimental behaviour.}},

   The algorithm relies upon the fact that substructures in a halo will

Abstract = {{A novel experimental investigation of both high and medium stacking
   fault energy bicrystals of aluminum and copper, respectively, show that
   orientation, grain interaction and material are all key factors in the
   stability of some ideal rolling texture components. Ideal
   \{110\}<1<(1)over bar>2> or \{112\}<11<(1)over bar>> orientations
   obtained from high purity aluminum or copper single crystals were
   embedded within a \{110\}< 001 > crystal orientation of the same
   material and reduced 60 percent by channel die compression at room
   temperature. Spatial misorientations developed inside the deformation
   bands were analyzed using SEM-based EBSD. The presence of long-range
   orientation gradients in some of the crystals revealed the interacting
   nature of polycrystalline deformation. From the results it is proposed
   that f.c.c. polycrystalline grains can be classified according to their
   stability and susceptibility to deformation: (i) stable and interacting;
   (ii) unstable and interacting; (iii) stable and non-interacting; (iv)
   unstable and non-interacting.}},

   (3b; tpy-Fc-C  C-C  C-Fc-tpy) and their Ru2+ complexes 6a and 6b have
   been synthesized and characterized by cyclic voltammetry, UV-vis and
   luminescence spectroscopy, and in the case of 3b by single-crystal X-ray
   diffraction. Cyclic voltammograms of both compounds, 3a and 3b, display
   two severely overlapping ferrocene-based oxidative peaks with only one
   reductive peak. The redox behavior of 6a and 6b is dominated by the
   Ru2+/Ru3+ redox couple (E-1/2 from 1.33 to 1.34 V), the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox
   couples (E-1/2 from 0.46 to 0.80 V), and the tpy/tpy(-)/tpy(2-)redox
   couples (E-1/2 from -1.19 to -1.48 V). The UV-vis spectra of 6a and 6b
   show absorption bands assigned to the (1){[}(d(pi)(Fe))(6)] ->
   (1){[}(d(pi)(Fe))(5)(pi{*}(Ru)(tpy))(1)] MMLCT transition at similar to
   555 nm. Complexes 6a and 6b are luminescent in H2O-CH3CN (4 : 1, v/v)
   solution at room temperature, and 6b exhibits the strongest luminescence
   intensity (lambda(em)(max): 710 nm, Phi(em): 2.28 x 10(-4), tau: 358 ns)

Abstract = {{Laser processing can achieve high transverse precision but control of
   the axial penetration depth in percussion drilling and keyhole welding
   has proved problematic. Processing can be highly stochastic (due to
   plasma, gas and melt flow dynamics). Normal imaging techniques can
   provide only minimal depth information and may be blinded by intense
   backscatter, black body and plasma emission. Inline coherent imaging
   (ICI) provides in situ, micron-scale depth measurements of laser
   machining processes at >300 kHz without any requirement for sample
   transparency or specialized geometry. The imaging beam is delivered
   coaxially with the laser processing beam facilitating integration into
   most laser processing platforms. With the ability to image deep
   (multi-mm) into high aspect features at high acquisition rates, ICI is a
   promising tool for both process development and online control of laser
   manufacturing systems.}},

Abstract = {{This study has demonstrated biorefining steps for ryegrass and silage at
   a pilot scale to extrude fibre cake for the production of
   nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC), a potentially green biomaterial for
   replacing conventional fillers in the manufacture of polymer composites.
   Further treatments of processed ryegrass fibres with mechanical
   shearing, microfluidising, hydrochloric acid (HCl)/sulphuric acid and a
   four stage \{ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid, sodium hydroxide, sodium
   hypochlorite and HCl\} hydrolysis yielded 43.8, 36.1, 25.6 and 39.8 kg
   t(-1) DM of NFCs respectively. The NFCs were characterised using
   microscopy, X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, spectroscopy
   and thermogravimetry. The NFC had diameters from 3.0-9.1 nm and length
   308 nm-4.6 mm. NFC-polyvinyl alcohol composites containing NFC (5 wt\%)
   exhibited enhanced Young's modulus and thermal stability by factors of
   2.5 and 2 respectively compared with control. The mass, energy, water
   and chemical balances of the four process steps were assessed to
   evaluate technical feasibility and also to provide baseline production
   data for scaling up. The microfluidised product has been identified as
   the best NFC product, but production cost needs to be reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Lysozyme is a naturally occurring enzyme in egg white and has high
   commercial importance due to its antimicrobial properties. The main
   objective of this work was to study the growth rate of lysozyme crystals
   isolated from egg for the first 72 hours and verify the results with
   McCabe's constant crystal growth theory. The separation of lysozyme was
   carried out by adsorption onto a cationic Amberlite resin using
   phosphate buffer at pH 4.8. Hanging drop crystallization method was used
   to form high purity lysozyme crystals from the embryonic stage. To this
   end, this work differs from an earlier work of Forsythe et al., who used
   seed crystals in the size range of 10 mu m-40 mu m for face growth
   measurements at different pH values. The maximum crystal size recorded
   in the present work was 392.86 mu m, which is within the typical size
   range of 50 mu m-500 mu m for which constant crystal growth is expected
   to hold according to McCabe's Delta L law. Electron micrographs (SEM)
   revealed the structure and dimensions of the crystals while SDS-Page was
   used to measure the purity of the crystals. The SEM results showed that
   lysozyme growth rate was linear and agreed with McCabe's constant growth
   theory, producing a growth rate of 1.77 x 10(-3) mu m . s(-1).}},

Pages = {{231-250}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of detecting multiple point-like
   targets in the presence of steering vector mismatches and Gaussian
   disturbance with unknown covariance matrix. To this end, we first model
   the actual useful signal as a vector belonging to a proper cone whose
   axis coincides with the whitened direction of the nominal array
   response. Then we develop two robust adaptive detectors resorting to the
   two-step GLRT-based design procedure without assignment of a distinct
   set of secondary data. The performance assessment has been conducted by
   Monte Carlo simulation, also in comparison to previously proposed
   detectors, and confirms the effectiveness of the newly proposed ones. In
   the last part of the work, in order to restore the detection performance
   of the newly proposed detectors in the presence of a large number of
   range cells contaminated by useful signals, we consider two adaptive
   detectors which resort to the structure information of the disturbance
   covariance matrix, and show that the a-priori information on the
   covariance structure can lead to a noticeable performance improvement.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{263-274}},
Abstract = {{We developed and tested a simple technique to predict, for flow
   visualisation purposes only, the evolution of coherent structures in
   between two given realisations of a turbulent flow. Classic
   coherent-structure eduction methods are adopted, such as the
   Q-criterion, pressure fluctuations and contours of velocity
   fluctuations. The kinematics of the evolving structures are
   reconstructed by means of an advection-based reconstruction technique
   and captured in a movie. The resulting quality of the animations has
   been assessed via the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). The
   sensitivity to increasing spacing in time of the available flow
   realisations has been tested and several improvements implemented. The
   abrupt transition from reconstructed frames of the animation to the
   available realisations results in a noticeable lack of smoothness. The
   replacement of the available realisations with a similar advection-based
   average increases the perceived smoothness of the movies. This is
   confirmed by the reduced total variation of the SSIM index. The residual
   minor periodic variations of accuracy have been reduced by introducing a
   stochastic weighting function. The sensitivity of the results to changes
   in Reynolds number, resolution and structure representation methods has
   been tested.}},

Abstract = {{A novel heating efficiency analysis of the microwave heated stop-flow
   (i.e. stagnant liquid) and continuous-flow reactors has been presented.
   The thermal losses to the surrounding air by natural convection have
   been taken into account for heating efficiency calculation of the
   microwave heating process. The effect of the load diameter in the range
   of 4-29 mm on the heating efficiency of ethylene glycol was studied in a
   single mode microwave cavity under continuous flow and stop-flow
   conditions. The variation of the microwave absorbing properties of the
   load with temperature was estimated. Under stop-flow conditions, the
   heating efficiency depends on the load diameter. The highest heating
   efficiency has been observed at the load diameter close to the half
   wavelength of the electromagnetic field in the corresponding medium.
   Under continuous-flow conditions, the heating efficiency increased
   linearly. However, microwave leakage above the propagation diameter
   restricted further experimentation at higher load diameters. Contrary to
   the stop-flow conditions, the load temperature did not raise
   monotonously from the inlet to outlet under continuous-flow conditions.
   This was due to the combined effect of lagging convective heat fluxes in
   comparison to volumetric heating. This severely disturbs the uniformity
   of the electromagnetic field in the axial direction and creates areas of
   high and low field intensity along the load length decreasing the
   heating efficiency as compared to stop-flow conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent isothermal-wall bounded

   concave/convex curvature on the top wall of a plane channel. The flows
   on the bottom and top walls are a tripped turbulent and laminar boundary
   layers, respectively. It is observed that the flow reaches equilibrium
   in the FPG region and the first and second order statistics are strongly
   influenced by the pressure gradients. For FPG/APG regions very near the
   bottom plane wall, the correlations between the streamwise pressure
   gradient and the spanwise vorticity flux and between the spanwise
   pressure gradient and the streamwise vorticity flux in the wall-normal
   direction are high on the wall and quickly drops to a negligible value
   within the viscous sublayer. Related flow physics and linkage to energy

Abstract = {{In this article, the vibration and energy transmission characteristics
   at the multiple interfaces of layered and jointed plates associated with
   friction are studied as a function of the shock loading amplitude using
   the established `sphere-joint assembled multi-layered plates' model. The
   dynamic responses at the multiple interfaces under shock excitation are
   calculated using finite element analysis. The transmissions of vibration
   and energy through the multiple interfaces are characterized by the
   defined vibration and energy transmission ratios. Results show that the
   acceleration amplitudes at different interfaces increase nonlinearly
   with the shock amplitude and they are approximated by a third-order
   polynomial function. The acceleration amplitude nonlinearly decreases
   along the transmitting interfaces and the maximum attenuation occurs
   between the first and second transmitting interfaces. A minimum
   vibration transmission ratio is observed for the range of shock
   amplitude considered and the value of shock amplitude leading to the
   minimum is identical for different transmitting interfaces. It is also
   shown that the energy transmission ratio exhibits a nonlinear behaviour
   similar to that of the vibration transmission ratio. The expression for
   determining the shock amplitude resulting in peak energy transmission
   ratio at the input interface is also presented. Experimental validation
   is performed, which shows good agreement with numerical results.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the advantages of small size and low cost,
   micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) inertial navigation systems (INS)
   show good prospects for use as a part of measurement-while-drilling
   (MWD) equipment to guarantee proper directional drilling procedure.
   Since current MEMS sensors have inaccurate measurements, an update
   aiding solution is developed using the Kalman filtering (KF) technique.
   However, because of the inherent poor behavior of MEMS sensors, KF
   technique with its linearized models has limited capability in providing
   accurate solution through the entire surveying process. In addition,
   certain realistic problems from the rugged environment would interrupt
   the updates in KF, without which the performance of the inertial system
   would deteriorate badly. This research proposes a fast orthogonal search
   (FOS)/KF solution where the FOS (a nonlinear modeling technique) method
   is proposed to augment KF. The experimental results illustrate that the
   FOS/KF solution outperforms the KF-only solution. Velocity and position
   performance are greatly enhanced during the interruptions of measurement
   updates.}},

Abstract = {{The ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) time series method has been shown to
   be an effective approach for accurate tissue classification and cancer
   detection. Previous studies of the RF time series method were based on a
   serial MATLAB implementation of feature calculation that involved long
   running times. Clinical applications of the RF time series method
   require a fast and efficient implementation that enables realistic
   imaging studies within a short time frame. In this paper, a parallel
   implementation of the RF time series method is developed to support
   clinical ultrasound imaging studies. The parallel implementation uses a
   Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to compute the tissue classification
   features of the RF time series method. Moreover, efficient graphical
   representations of the RF times series features are obtained using the
   Qt framework. Tread computing is used to concurrently compute and
   visualize the RF time series features. The parallel implementation of
   the RF time series is evaluated for various configurations of number of
   frames and number of scan lines per frame acquired in an imaging study.
   Results demonstrate that the parallel implementation enables imaging of
   tissue classification at interactive time. A typical RF time series of
   128 frames and 128 scan lines per frame, the parallel implementation be
   processed in 0.8128 +/- 0.0420 sec.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of two new tripodal complexes {[}Ru(L-3)](PF6)(2) and

   successfully achieved and the products fully characterized, including by
   X-ray structural determination. The smaller cavity, built around a
   tris(2-aminoethyl) amido scaffold demonstrated only moderate and
   predictable interactions with a range of anions and no significant
   spectroscopic change with nitrate, chloride and bromide, although
   dihydrogen phosphate did result in an almost stoichiometric
   precipitation. The expansion of the cavity to include the more rigid
   1,3,5-benzenetricarbonylamide group creates a larger cavity, which shows
   a decrease in the emission on the introduction of chloride, bromide,
   hydrogen sulfate and nitrate salts, with the H-1 NMR titrations giving a
   surprisingly high binding affinity for nitrate over the smaller and

Abstract = {{Electrodeposition of metals onto conductive supports such as graphite
   potentially provides a lower-waste method to form heterogeneous
   catalysts than the standard methods such as wet impregnation. Copper
   electrodeposition onto pressed graphite disc electrodes was investigated
   from aqueous CuSO4-ethylenediamine solutions by chronoamperometry with
   scanning electron microscopy used to ascertain the particle sizes
   obtained by this method. The particle size was studied as a function of
   pH, CuSO4-ethylenediamine concentration, and electrodeposition time. It
   was observed that decreasing the pH, copper-ethylenediamine
   concentration and time each decreased the size of the copper particles
   observed, with the smallest obtained being around 5-20 nm. Furthermore,
   electroless aerobic oxidation of copper metal in the presence of
   ethylenediamine was successfully coupled with the electrodeposition in
   the same vessel. In this way, deposition was achieved sequentially on up
   to twenty different graphite discs using the same ethylenediamine
   solution, demonstrating the recyclability of the ligand. The materials
   thus prepared were shown to be catalytically active for the
   mineralisation of phenol by hydrogen peroxide. Overall, the results
   provide a proof-of-principle that by making use of aerobic oxidation
   coupled with electrochemical deposition, elemental base metals can be
   used directly as starting materials to form heterogeneous catalysts
   without the need to use metal salts as catalyst precursors.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last 5-10 years, marine spatial planning (MSP) has emerged as a
   new management regime for national and international waters and has
   already attracted a substantial body of multi-disciplinary research on
   its goals and policy processes. This paper argues that this literature
   has generally lacked deeper reflexive engagement with the emerging
   system of governance for our seas that has meant that many of MSP's core
   concepts, assumptions and institutional arrangements have not been
   subject rigorous intellectual debate. In an attempt to initiate such an
   approach, this article explores the relationship between MSP and its
   land-based cousin, terrestrial spatial planning (TSP). While it is
   recognized that there are inherent limitations to a comparison of these
   two systems, it is argued that the tradition of social science debate
   over the purpose and processes of TSP can be used as a useful stimulus
   for a more rigorous reflection of such issues as they relate to MSP. The
   article therefore explores some of the parallels between MSP and TSP and
   then discusses some of the key intellectual traditions that have shaped
   TSP and the implications these may have for future marine planning
   practice. The article concludes with a number of potentially useful new
   avenues that may form the basis of a critical research agenda for MSP.}},

Journal = {{IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{24-37}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates one of the most fundamental issues of
   integrating fuel cell (FC) generation into power systems - its effect on
   power system small-signal stability when it operates jointly with
   conventional power generation. The study first presents a comprehensive
   mathematical model of the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) power plant
   integrated with the single-machine infinite-bus power system. Based on
   the model, conventional damping torque analysis is carried out to study
   the effect of SOFC power generation on power system small-signal
   stability. The analysis concludes that system small-signal stability can
   be affected either positively or negatively by the SOFC power plant when
   system operating conditions change. Two examples of power systems with
   gird-connected SOFC power plants are presented. Small-signal stability
   of the first example of single-machine power system was examined when
   the power system operated at different load conditions and levels of
   mixtures of conventional and FC power generation. The second example is
   a four-machine two-area power system where the power supplied by the
   gird-connected SOFC power plant is variable. Results of simulation using
   full non-linear model of the power systems and the SOFC power plants are
   given. All the results from the example power systems confirm and
   further demonstrate the analysis presented and conclusions obtained.}},

   palaeogeography of Pangea}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{779-798}},
Abstract = {{High-pressure (HP) rocks are critical for palinspastic restorations
   because they mark inferred subducted/extruded oceanic crust; knowledge
   of their geometric, geodynamic, and age relationships provide essential
   constraints on palaeogeographic reconstructions. The westernmost HP belt
   (Ixcamilpa) in the Acatlan Complex of southern Mexico has been inferred
   to be a mid-Late Ordovician backarc basin on the southern Iapetan margin
   that was subducted beneath eastern Laurentia and extruded up the
   subduction zone during the Early Silurian. Re-examination of Ixcamilpa
   HP rocks has revealed that they comprise lower Palaeozoic rift-passive
   margin protoliths and occur in a W-vergent klippe (not a suture) formed
   during polyphase deformation. Peak metamorphic mineral assemblages of
   blueschist-amphibole eclogite facies underwent retrogression through
   epidote amphibolite to greenschist facies. Ar-40/Ar-39 dating of various
   rocks yielded plateau ages of 344-339 Ma for calcic amphibole, 318 +/- 4
   Ma for glaucophane, and 329-325 +/- 2 Ma for muscovite (excess argon),
   which clearly indicate a Carboniferous tectonothermal event. We
   interpret the 20 million years range in amphibole ages as reflecting
   progressive unroofing. The terminal stage of progressive thrusting
   placed the HP rocks above the middle Mississippian Zumpango Unit, during
   which a single penetrative sub-greenschist fabric was produced.
   Subsequent Permian or Laramide deformation refolded all the rocks about
   NE-trending upright folds. We postulate that the root zone of the HP
   nappe lies to the east in the median HP belt, which has a structure
   consistent with an extrusion zone. Inasmuch as similar units of the
   Acatlan Complex bound this HP root zone on either side, it is inferred
   to have been extruded into the upper plate above the subduction zone,
   and thus is not an oceanic suture. Our new data provide constraints for
   a Carboniferous palaeogeographic reconstruction, whereby subduction
   erosion of passive margin rocks took place along the western margin of
   Pangea and were subsequently extruded into the upper (Acatlan) plate.}},

Pages = {{163-189}},
Abstract = {{The hawari (local communities) of Old Cairo resemble a unique societal
   context whose history is actively involved in the contemporary everyday
   production of local habits, traditions and social practice. By the
   virtue of its durability and ability to survive, Architecture brings
   events and traditions of the past alive into the present through spatial
   transformation, social practice and the value of the historical fabric.
   The presence of buildings and houses from different historical periods
   has helped the local community's memory to carry social practices over
   from one generation to another. This article explores the relationship
   between architecture, memory and everyday social practices through
   determining the way architecture moderates community experiences and
   communicates narratives among generations in Haret al-Darb al-Asfar in
   old Cairo. Architecture emerges as a moderator of cross-time
   communication and as physical elements that help visualise history,
   situate values and materialise local traditions in old Cairo.
   Architecture, as process and product, this article reports, works as
   agent of continuity, which in conjunction with the narrators, brings the
   full experience of the past alive in the present and helps guide future
   generations.}},

Abstract = {{Using the derived relation for point defect generation according to a
   new constitutive relation, the notion of nano-void formation at grown-in
   nano-particles is examined and its consequences deduced as the
   nano-voids grow in size with continued deformation. Assuming that void
   growth is due only to point defect accumulation, the analysis of
   fracture strains in tension of natural-aged AA6111 suggests that
   coalescence by micro-plastic activity occurs when the void diameter
   becomes about one third of the evolving inter-void spacing. Hence, the
   derived limit strain to incipient void-coalescence is inversely
   proportional to the square root of point defect generation as determined
   from the stress-strain data. Using this criterion, failure prediction
   maps can be constructed for strain modes of plane-strain and balanced
   bi-axial to result in the outer bounds of the forming limit diagram.
   Trial examinations with AA5754 and AA3003 show great promise.}},

Title = {{The Effect of Serial Passaging on the Proliferation and Differentiation
   of Bovine Adipose-Derived Stem Cells}},
Journal = {{CELLS TISSUES ORGANS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{195}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{414-427}},
Abstract = {{Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) represent an excellent cell source for
   the development of regenerative therapies for a broad variety of tissue
   disorders. Commonly, in vitro expansion is necessary to obtain
   sufficient cell populations for research purposes and clinical
   applications. Although it has been demonstrated that human ASCs can
   maintain their adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic potential in
   long-term culture (up to 15 passages), it is not guaranteed that a
   satisfactory level of differentiation is achievable in later passages.
   In this study, we investigated the self-renewal and multilineage
   differentiation capacity of bovine ASCs, isolated from the interdigital
   fat pad, and explored how serial passaging influences the cells. A
   proliferation study examined the changes in growth kinetics from passage
   1 to 5, and multilineage (adipogenesis, chondrogenesis and osteogenesis)
   differentiation studies were conducted to compare the potential between
   passage 2 (P2) and passage 5 (P5). From the proliferation study, a
   statistically significant change in the doubling time did not appear
   until P5. In the differentiation study, both P2 and P5 ASCs could be
   stimulated to undergo multilineage differentiation under specific
   culturing conditions. However, adipogenic and chondrogenic cultures
   showed significantly lower levels of differentiation in the P5-induced
   cultures. In contrast, P5-induced osteogenic cultures had higher
   alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity than P2-induced cultures,
   suggesting an increase in the osteogenic response with serial passaging.
   Overall, bovine ASCs are capable of self-renewal and multilineage
   differentiation; however, long-term in vitro expansion has a negative
   effect on adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation, while potentially
   favoring osteogenesis. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Title = {{An Approach for Improving Design and Innovation Skills in Engineering
   Education: The Multidisciplinary Design Stream}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{339-348}},
Abstract = {{Engineering practice is multidisciplinary by nature. While some
   engineering projects may require discipline-specific specialists, the
   vast majority of engineering practice is carried out either by an
   engineering team of mixed disciplines, or by individual engineers who
   are competent across multiple fields. In both Canada and the US,
   engineering accreditation boards have recognized the need for students
   to develop at least a modest level of competency to function in
   multidisciplinary teams prior to graduation. Recognizing the growing
   need for enhanced design education and multidisciplinary competency for
   undergraduate students, in 2005 Queen's University introduced an
   elective series or courses known as the Multidisciplinary Design Stream
   (MDS), available to students from all engineering disciplines. The first
   course in the stream is offered over one term at the third year level
   and incorporates a broad range of lecture topics and interactive
   learning activities that are further reinforced with a concurrent design
   project in multidisciplinary teams of four students. The continuing
   course spans the final two terms at the fourth year level and enhances
   students' design, professional, and problem solving skills through their
   application in multidisciplinary teams on funded, industry-sponsored
   projects. Every team is supervised by one or more faculty members or
   `engineers in residence', all of whom have significant engineering
   professional practice experience. The MDS has been filled to capacity
   since its second year of operation. Student feedback after graduation is
   very positive, and client response has typically been outstanding,
   reinforced with a very high rate of year over year client return.
   Student surveys and a design skills assessment provide significant
   evidence of increased design competency.}},

Title = {{Locally regularised two-stage learning algorithm for RBF network centre
   selection}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1157-1170}},
Abstract = {{Nonlinear system models constructed from radial basis function (RBF)
   networks can easily be over-fitted due to the noise on the data. While
   information criteria, such as the final prediction error (FPE), can
   provide a trade-off between training error and network complexity, the
   tunable parameters that penalise a large size of network model are hard
   to determine and are usually application dependent. This article
   introduces a new locally regularised, two-stage stepwise construction
   algorithm for RBF networks. The main objective is to produce a
   parsimonious network that generalises well over unseen data. This is
   achieved by utilising Bayesian learning within a two-stage stepwise
   construction procedure to penalise centres that are mainly interpreted
   by the noise. Specifically, each output layer weight is assigned a
   hyperparameter, a large value of such a parameter forcing the associated
   output layer weight to be near to zero. Sparsity is achieved by removing
   irrelevant RBF centres from the network. The efficacy of proposed
   algorithm from the original two-stage construction method is retained.
   Numerical analysis shows that this new method only needs about half of
   the computation involved in the locally regularised orthogonal least
   squares (LROLS) alternative. Results from two simulation examples are
   presented to show that the nonlinear system models resulting from this
   new approach are superior in terms of both sparsity and generalisation
   capability.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Raman microscopy, a rapid nondestructive technique that
   profiles the composition of biological samples, was used to characterize
   retinal biochemistry in the retinal dysplasia and degeneration (rdd) and
   wild-type (wt) chick retina during retinogenesis and at hatching.
   METHODS. Embryonic day (E) 13 and posthatch day (P) 1 rdd and wt retinal
   cross-sections (n = 3 of each line at each age) were profiled using 633
   helium-neon laser excitation. The biochemical composition was determined
   using computational analysis of the Raman spectra. In parallel
   histology, TUNEL and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
   immunostaining were used to visualize retinal dysfunction.
   RESULTS. Principal component (PC) analysis of the Raman spectra
   identified 50 major biochemical profiles, but only PCs that made
   significant contributions to variation within rdd and wt retina were
   mapped. These significant PCs were shown to arise from DNA, various
   fatty acids, melanin, and a number of proteins. Distinct patterns of
   GFAP immunostaining and a larger population of TUNEL-positive nuclei
   were observed in the rdd versus wt retina.
   CONCLUSIONS. This study has demonstrated that Raman microscopy can
   discriminate between major retinal biomolecules, thus providing an
   unbiased account of how their composition varies due to the impact of
   the MPDZ null mutation in the rdd chick relative to expression in the
   normal wt retina. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2012; 53: 413-420)

Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{1322-1333}},
Abstract = {{Controlled radical polymerization of methyl acrylate catalyzed by copper
   was conducted in a continuous tubular reactor. A length of copper tubing
   was used to initiate polymerization and generate soluble copper species,
   while the bulk of polymerization took place in inert stainless steel
   tubing. To mediate polymerization in the absence of copper surface,
   environmentally benign ascorbic acid was used for the first time in
   single electron transfer-living radical polymerization (SET-LRP) as a
   reducing agent to regenerate activating copper species. Polymerizations
   were conducted at ambient temperature with 30 wt\% DMSO as solvent,
   producing well defined living polymer at a steady state conversion of
   78\% for a residence time of 62 min. Chain extensions using outlet
   polymer solutions were well-controlled and proceeded to high conversion
   in a short period of time, with a final concentration of 10 ppm of
   residual copper. The results illustrate the significant potential of
   using a continuous tubular reactor with ascorbic acid as a reducing
   agent as an efficient means to scale-up production of well controlled
   polyacrylics and other multiblock copolymers.}},

Title = {{Phase Equilibria of Binary and Ternary Systems Containing ILs, Dodecane,

Abstract = {{This paper reports both the binary and ternary phase behavior of ionic
   liquids for extracting cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (CCA) from dodecane.
   This system is a model for the extraction of acids representative of
   naphthenic acids found in crude oils. In order to develop an effective
   ternary liquid-liquid extraction system the preliminary selection of
   ionic liquids was based on CCA miscibility and the dodecane
   immiscibility with selected ILs. A wide range of ILs based on different
   cations, anions, cation alkyl-chain length, as well as the effect of
   temperature on the overall fluid phase behavior is reported. Factors
   such as variation of cation group, anion effect, alkyl-chain length, and
   temperature all impact the extraction to various degrees. The largest
   effects were found to be the lipophilicity of the IL cation and the
   co-ordination ability of the anion. While CCA capacity increased with
   lipophilicity of the cation, as did the dodecane. Highly coordinating
   anions such as trifluoroacetate and triflate demonstrated that highly
   efficient extraction could be obtained producing favorable tie-lines in
   the ternary phase diagram. Overall, this study demonstrates that ILs can
   selectively extract acids from hydrocarbon streams and offers possible
   treatment solutions for problems associated with the processing of high
   acid crude oils.

Title = {{Selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene rich feed streams at
   high pressure over ligand modified Pd/TiO2}},
Journal = {{CATALYSIS SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{632-638}},
Abstract = {{The selective hydrogenation of acetylene from ethylene rich streams was
   conducted at high pressure and in the presence of CO over two 1 wt\%
   loaded Pd/TiO2 catalysts with differing dispersions. Although, the more
   poorly dispersed sample did not result in high acetylene conversion only
   a small proportion of the total available ethylene was hydrogenated to
   ethane. The more highly dispersed sample was able to remove acetylene to
   a level below the detection limit but this was at the expense of
   significant proportion (ca. 30\%) of the available ethylene.
   Modification of the catalysts by exposure to triphenyl phosphine or
   diphenyl sulfide and subsequent reduction at 393 K led to improved
   performance with increased conversion of acetylene and decreased
   propensity to hydrogenate ethylene resulting in an overall net gain in
   ethylene. The higher dispersed sample which had been ligand modified
   provided the best results overall and in particular for the diphenyl
   sulfide treated sample which was able to completely eliminate acetylene
   and still obtain a net gain in ethylene. The differences observed are
   thought to be due to the creation of appropriate active ensembles of Pd
   atoms which are able to accommodate acetylene but have limited ability
   to adsorb ethylene. Sub-surface hydrogen formation was suppressed, but
   not eliminated, by exposure to modifier.}},

Abstract = {{The critical chain length (j(crit)) in dispersion polymerization is
   systematically investigated utilizing low molecular weight poly(methyl
   methacrylate) oligomers synthesized by catalytic chain transfer
   polymerization. The solubility of these oligomers in methanol/water
   media of different compositions and at different temperatures has been
   visually determined. The results show that the solubility of the

   temperature. The constructed solubility map allows for an estimate of
   j(crit) as a function of these important polymerization parameters.
   Furthermore, it is found that the value of j(crit) changes with the
   concentration of the oligomers in the methanol/water medium, an
   important consideration for understanding the nucleation stage of a
   dispersion polymerization. The obtained results have been successfully
   correlated to earlier data reported on the dispersion polymerization of

   subsurface flow constructed wetlands}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{54-69}},
Abstract = {{The growing of finfish, crustaceans, molluscs, and aquatic plants is
   termed aquaculture and it is currently the fastest growing animal food
   producing sector in the world. Flow-through aquaculture facilities are
   the most commonly used production system for the culture of salmonids.
   Flow-through land-based aquaculture facilities place great demands on
   water resources because they require large volumes of high quality
   source water to grow fish and they also discharge their wastewaters into
   the aquatic environment. The main source of waste in aquaculture
   wastewaters is the addition of formulated feed to the culture structure.
   Discharge of untreated aquaculture wastewaters can lead to
   physicochemical and biological degradation of receiving waters. Despite
   advances in feed quality and feeding practices, the treatment of
   wastewaters from flow-through land-based aquaculture facilities is a
   necessary practice. Conventional wastewater treatment from flow-through
   land-based aquaculture facilities has focused on gravitational
   sedimentation and mechanical screening of the wastewater, which
   successfully addresses the particulate fraction of the waste. In the
   past decade, the use of subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSFCWs),
   which treat both the particulate and the dissolved fraction of the waste
   have been gaining attention for the treatment of wastewater from
   flow-through land-based salmonid farms. Existing studies have
   demonstrated that SSFCWs have the potential to successfully remove
   solids, oxygen demanding materials and nutrients from flow-through
   land-based salmonid wastewaters.}},

Pages = {{992-1001}},
Abstract = {{A novel approach is presented for the synthesis of block-copolymers that
   resemble the architecture of a core cross-linked micelle. The polymers
   are synthesized from a combination of catalytic chain transfer
   polymerization (CCTP), thiol-Michael addition chemistry and reductive
   amination. A hydrophobic hyperbranched core is synthesized via CCTP of
   methyl methacrylate (MMA) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA),
   which affords control over the polymer architecture and the degree of
   chain end-functionality. The vinyl unsaturations of the hyperbranched
   polymers are converted in nucleophilic pendant amines by thiol-Michael
   addition using cysteamine hydrochloride. A polysaccharide shell is
   grafted onto the hyperbranched core via reductive amination with dextran
   (DEX). The synthesized poly(MMA-co-EGDMA)-b-DEX polymers possess an
   amphiphilic character, are colloidally stable and resemble the topology
   of a core cross-linked micelle. The presented methodology provides a

Abstract = {{Hybrid-passive landfill leachate treatment systems employ active
   pretreatment to remove dissolved inorganic constituents and decrease the

   a 1-year pilot-scale study, two passive treatment systems - a peat and

   wetland - were installed to treat leachate from the Merrick Landfill in
   North Bay, Ontario, Canada. Leachate was pretreated in a fixed-film
   aerobic reactor, which provided reductions in COD (26\%), and masses of
   ammonia (21\%), Al (69\%), Ca (57\%), Fe (73\%) and Sr (37\%). A
   comparison of the performance of the hybrid-passive treatment systems
   indicated different extents of heterotrophic nitrification: the peat and
   wood shaving filter removed 49\% of the ammonia and nitrified 29\%,
   while the constructed wetland removed 99\% of the ammonia and nitrified
   90\%. Hybrid-passive landfill leachate treatment was determined to be

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the performance of a walking speed estimation
   system based on using an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a combination

   segments the walking sequence into individual stride cycles (two steps)
   based on the inverted pendulum-like behaviour of the stance leg during
   walking and it integrates the angular velocity and linear accelerations
   of the shank to determine the displacement of each stride. The
   evaluation was performed in both treadmill and overground walking
   experiments with various constraints on walking speed, step length and
   step frequency to provide a relatively comprehensive assessment of the
   system. Promising results were obtained in providing accurate and
   consistent walking speed/step length estimation in different walking
   conditions. An overall percentage root mean squared error (\%RMSE) of
   4.2 and 4.0\% was achieved in treadmill and overground walking
   experiments, respectively. With an increasing interest in understanding
   human walking biomechanics, the IMU-based ambulatory system could
   provide a useful walking speed/step length measurement/control tool for

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{In this study, pultruded glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP)
   corrugated plates, connected together through pin-and-eye connections,
   were investigated as stay-in-place (SIP) forms for concrete decks. The
   SIP form completely replaced the bottom layer of reinforcement, whereas
   a top GFRP mesh was provided. Special attention was given in simulating
   the details of deck connection to supporting girders. Full-scale deck
   specimens, including a control deck with conventional steel
   reinforcement, were cast on concrete supports simulating a girder
   spacing of 1,780 mm. The 410-mm-wide supports had a rough surface finish
   along with protruding steel stirrups to simulate the flange of an AASHTO
   type III girder. An additional cantilevered specimen was tested to
   examine the feasibility of using SIP forms in deck overhangs at exterior
   girders. The study also investigated the effects of GFRP plate thickness
   and bond with concrete on performance. All specimens, except the
   cantilevered one that failed in flexure, had a punching shear failure
   while the GFRP pin-and-eye connections remained intact. The system
   demonstrated excellent performance, with safety factors ranging from 3.5
   to 4.9, relative to the half-axle service load, including impact factor,
   of standard design trucks. Deflections at service were less than
   span/1,600. The system also displayed significant deformability
   associated with gradual loss of strength beyond punching shear, a major
   advantage over conventional decks. Adhesive bond improved stiffness but
   had little effect on strength. Constructability issues are also
   addressed along with the detailing particular to this system.

Abstract = {{Using a small planetary ball mill, liquid-assisted grinding (LAG) of

   equivalents of isonicotinic acid (HINA) and small amounts of water ( up

   trans-{[}M(INA)(2)(OH2)(4)] (M = Zn, Cd, Cu, Fe, Co, Ni, Mn) efficiently

   further LAG with non-aqueous liquids such as methanol or DMF. Overall,
   the mechanochemical dehydrations are more effective than heating or
   immersion in bulk solvents. The work demonstrates a two-step
   mechanochemical synthesis of coordination networks via discrete aquo
   complexes which may be preferable to single step reactions or
   grinding-annealing procedures in some cases. For example, the two step
   method was the only way to prepare {[}Cd(INA)(2)(OH2)]center dot DMF

Abstract = {{The influence of spanwise geometrical undulations of the leading edge of
   an infinite wing is investigated numerically at low Reynolds number, in
   the context of passive separation control and focusing on the physical
   mechanisms involved. Inspired by the tubercles of the humpback whale
   flippers, the wavy leading edge is modeled using a spanwise sinusoidal
   function whose amplitude and wavelength constitute the parameters of
   control. A direct numerical simulation is performed on a NACA0020 wing
   profile in a deep stall configuration (alpha = 20 degrees), with and
   without the presence of the leading edge waviness. The complex solid
   boundaries obtained by varying the sinusoidal shape of the leading edge
   are modeled using an immersed boundary method (IBM) recently developed
   by the authors {[}Pinelli et al., J. Comput. Phys. 229 (2010)
   9073-9091]. A particular set of wave parameters is found to change
   drastically the topology of the separated zone, which becomes dominated
   by streamwise vortices generated from the sides of the leading edge
   bumps. A physical analysis is carried out to explain the mechanism
   leading to the generation of these coherent vortical structures. The
   role they play in the control of boundary layer separation is also
   investigated, in the context of the modifications of the hydrodynamic
   performances which have been put forward in the literature in the last
   decade. (C) 2011 Academic des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson

   an active contributor to hepatic glucose production and the treatment
   with oral delivered insulin nanoparticles did not alter this
   contribution, suggesting that under this treatment, protocol hepatic
   glucose metabolism is not the most relevant target of insulin action but
   instead a more generalised effect in peripheral tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are able to accomplish difficult and
   challenging tasks both in civilian and defence sectors without
   endangering human lives. Their ability to work round the clock makes
   them well-suited for matters that demand immediate attention. These
   issues include but not limited to mines countermeasures, measuring the
   extent of an oil spill and locating the source of a chemical discharge.
   A number of USV programmes have emerged in the last decade for a variety
   of aforementioned purposes. Springer USV is one such research project
   highlighted in this paper. The intention herein is to report results
   emanating from data acquired from experiments on the Springer vessel
   whilst testing its advanced navigation, guidance and control (NGC)
   subsystems. The algorithms developed for these systems are based on
   soft-computing methodologies. A novel form of data fusion navigation
   algorithm has been developed and integrated with a modified optimal
   controller. Experimental results are presented and analysed for various
   scenarios including single and multiple waypoints tracking and fixed and
   time-varying reference bearings. It is demonstrated that the proposed
   NGC system provides promising results despite the presence of modelling
   uncertainty and external disturbances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   dissociation is favoured in comparison with homolytic dissociation of
   molecular hydrogen at the perimeter sites. However, the surface oxygen
   of the rutile TiO2(110) surface at these sites can be readily passivated
   by the formed OH, suggesting that further dissociation of molecular

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{193-202}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{The chromium bearing wastewater in this study was used to simulate the
   low concentration discharge from a major aerospace manufacturing
   facility in the UK. Removal of chromium ions from aqueous solutions
   using raw dolomite was achieved using batch adsorption experiments. The
   effect of; initial Cr(VI) concentration, amount of adsorbent, solution
   temperature, dolomite particle size and shaking speed was studied.
   Maximum chromium removal was found at pH 2.0. A kinetic study yielded an
   optimum equilibrium time of 96 h with an adsorbent dose of 1 g/L
   Sorption studies were conducted over a concentration range of 5-50 mg/L
   Cr(VI) removal decreased with an increase in temperature (q(max): 20
   degrees C = 10.01 mg/g; 30 degrees C = 8.385 mg/g; 40 degrees C = 6.654
   mg/g; and 60 degrees C = 5.669 mg/g). Results suggest that the
   equilibrium adsorption was described by the Freundlich model. The
   kinetic processes of Cr(VI) adsorption onto dolomite were described in
   order to provide a more clear interpretation of the adsorption rate and
   uptake mechanism. The overall kinetic data was acceptably explained by a
   pseudo first-order rate model. Evaluated Delta G degrees and Delta H
   degrees specify the spontaneous and exothermic nature of the reaction.
   The adsorption takes place with a decrease in entropy (Delta S degrees
   is negative). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{74-80}},

Abstract = {{Little attention has been paid to the fast-growing biohazardous
   wastewater (BHW) in recent years, even though it may pose severe
   biohazards and toxicity to the general public and environment. Two
   processes including Fenton oxidation (FO) and a sequential combination
   of coagulation/flocculation (CF) and FO were evaluated for treatment of
   actual BHW from biological and pathological laboratories in China. The
   {[}H2O2]/{[}Fe2+] molar ratio was controlled at 20 throughout all FO
   experiments. The FO performed noticeably well in reducing biohazards and
   toxicity with 6 g/l H2O2 at initial pH 3 for 24 h, but was unable to
   remove the organic contaminants efficiently. To reduce the organic load,
   CF was introduced as a pretreatment. When the CF and FO were operated in
   sequence, the dosage of H2O2 and its reaction time were significantly
   reduced to 3 g/l and 4 h at an initial pH of 3.5. Under these
   conditions, the total plate count (TPC), adenosine triphosphate (ATP),
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) and linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS)
   decreased by 100, 100, 96, and 98\%, respectively, indicating the
   biohazards and organic pollutants were significantly reduced. The
   toxicity indicated by the inhibition ratio of luminescence (IR) was also
   greatly eliminated (99\% removal). This work demonstrates that a
   sequential combination of CF and FO offered a feasible alternative for
   treating real BHW by eliminating biohazards, toxicity and organic
   pollutants simultaneously and effectively. DOI:

Abstract = {{The volatilisation of a range of ferrocene compounds from a range of

   investigated. Namely, n-butylferrocene, 1,1'-dimethylferrocene and

   ({[}C(2)mim]{[}NTf2]) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate
   ({[}C(4)mim]{[}BF4]). Cyclic voltammetric and chronoamperometric
   monitoring of the ferrocene compound concentration allowed
   quantification of the rate constants of volatilisation, k, activation
   energies of volatilisation, E-a, and entropies of activation, Delta S
   double dagger. The rate of volatilisation was found to be ferrocene >
   1,1'-dimethylferrocene > n-butylferrocene, and trends in the rate
   constant of the volatilisation process as a function of molecular size
   and ionic liquid surface tension were investigated. These indicate that
   the transition state for the volatilisation is when the solute is
   located in the liquid surface, and that the creation of a cavity of some
   sort in the liquid surface is necessary to allow volatilisation.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{20-29}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{An analytical model is presented for the analysis of pulse interference
   tests conducted in a fractured porous medium with connection to a free
   surface boundary at the water table. The solution is applicable to open
   borehole pulse interference tests due to the accommodation of multiple
   horizontal fractures intersecting each wellbore and a connection from
   the uppermost horizontal fracture via a network of vertical fractures to
   a free surface boundary. The solution is derived using the Laplace
   transform method and evaluation of the solution is performed by
   numerical inversion. Based on an informal analysis, the model is
   sensitive to transmissivity, storativity, specific storage, vertical
   hydraulic conductivity and particularly specific yield over a range of
   realistic values for these parameters. A field example is presented to
   illustrate the application of the model in the estimation of specific
   yield in fractured rock settings with relatively low vertical
   permeability. Although a reasonable model fit was obtained, application
   to an additional field example having only one fracture was
   unsatisfactory, and further study on uniqueness is warranted. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The presence of NO during the regeneration period of a Pt-Ba/Al2O3 Lean
   NO Trap (LNT) catalyst modifies significantly the evolution of products
   formed from the reduction of stored nitrates, particularly nitrogen and
   ammonia. The use of isotope labelling techniques, feeding (NO)-N-14
   during the storage period and (NO)-N-15 during regeneration allows us to
   propose three different routes for nitrogen formation based on the
   different masses detected during regeneration, i.e. N-14(2) (m/e = 28),
   (NN)-N-14-N-15 (m/e = 29) and N-15(2) (m/e = 30). It is proposed that
   the formation of nitrogen via Route 1 involves the reaction between
   hydrogen and (NO5)-N-14 released from the storage component to form
   (NH3)-N-14 mainly. Then, ammonia further reacts with (NOx)-N-14 located
   downstream to form N-14(2). In Route 2, it is postulated that the
   incoming (NO)-N-15 reacts with hydrogen to form (NH3)-N-15 in the
   reactor zone where the trap has been already regenerated. This
   isotopically labelled ammonia travels through the catalyst bed until it
   reaches the regeneration front where it participates in the reduction of
   stored nitrates ((NOx)-N-14) to form (NN)-N-14-N-15. The formation of
   N-15(2) via Route 3 is believed to occur by the reaction between
   incoming (NO)-N-15 and H-2. The modification of the hydrogen
   concentration fed during regeneration affects the relative importance of
   H-2 or (NH3)-N-15 as reductants and thus the production of N-14(2) via
   Route 1 and (NiN)-Ni-14-N-15 via Route 2. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Navigation algorithms integrating measurements from multi-sensor systems
   overcome the problems that arise from using GPS navigation systems in
   standalone mode. Algorithms which integrate the data from 2D low-cost
   reduced inertial sensor system (RISS), consisting of a gyroscope and an
   odometer or wheel encoders, along with a GPS receiver via a Kalman
   filter has proved to be worthy in providing a consistent and more
   reliable navigation solution compared to standalone GPS receivers. It
   has been also shown to be beneficial, especially in GPS-denied
   environments such as urban canyons and tunnels. The main objective of
   this paper is to narrow the idea-to-implementation gap that follows the
   algorithm development by realizing a low-cost real-time embedded
   navigation system capable of computing the data-fused positioning
   solution. The role of the developed system is to synchronize the
   measurements from the three sensors, relative to the pulse per second
   signal generated from the GPS, after which the navigation algorithm is
   applied to the synchronized measurements to compute the navigation
   solution in real-time. Employing a customizable soft-core processor on
   an FPGA in the kernel of the navigation system, provided the flexibility
   for communicating with the various sensors and the computation
   capability required by the Kalman filter integration algorithm.}},

Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{217}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-19}},

Abstract = {{We re-examine the formation of the inner Oort comet cloud while the Sun
   was in its birth cluster with the aid of numerical simulations. This
   work is a continuation of an earlier study (Brasser, R., Duncan, M.J.,
   Levison, H.F. {[}2006]. Icarus 184, 59-82) with several substantial
   modifications. First, the system consisting of stars, planets and comets
   is treated self-consistently in our N-body simulations, rather than
   approximating the stellar encounters with the outer Solar System as
   hyperbolic fly-bys. Second, we have included the expulsion of the
   cluster gas, a feature that was absent previously. Third, we have used
   several models for the initial conditions and density profile of the
   cluster - either a Hernquist or Plummer potential - and chose other
   parameters based on the latest observations of embedded clusters from
   the literature. These other parameters result in the stars being on
   radial orbits and the cluster collapses. Similar to previous studies, in
   our simulations the inner Oort cloud is formed from comets being
   scattered by Jupiter and Saturn and having their pericentres decoupled
   from the planets by perturbations from the cluster gas and other stars.
   We find that all inner Oort clouds formed in these clusters have an
   inner edge ranging from 100 AU to a few hundred AU, and an outer edge at
   over 100,000 AU, with little variation in these values for all clusters.
   All inner Oort clouds formed are consistent with the existence of
   (90377) Sedna, an inner Oort cloud dwarf planetoid, at the inner edge of
   the cloud: Sedna tends to be at the innermost 2\% for Plummer models,
   while it is 5\% for Hernquist models. We emphasise that the existence of
   Sedna is a generic outcome. We define a `concentration radius' for the
   inner Oort cloud and fine. that its value increases with increasing
   number of stars in the cluster, ranging from 600 AU to 1500 AU for
   Hernquist clusters and from 1500 AU to 4000 AU for Plummer clusters. The
   increasing trend implies that small star clusters form more compact
   inner Oort clouds than large clusters. We are unable to constrain the
   number of stars that resided in the cluster since most clusters yield
   inner Oort clouds that could be compatible with the current structure of
   the outer Solar System. The typical formation efficiency of the inner
   Oort cloud is 1.5\%, significantly lower than previous estimates. We
   attribute this to the more violent dynamics that the Sun experiences as
   it rushes through the centre of the cluster during the latter's initial
   phase of violent relaxation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Canada's Near-Earth Object Surveillance Satellite (NEOSSat), set to
   launch in early 2012, will search for and track Near-Earth Objects
   (NEOs), tuning its search to best detect objects with a < 1.0 AU. In
   order to construct an optimal pointing strategy for NEOSSat, we needed
   more detailed information in the a < 1.0 AU region than the best current
   model (Bottke, W.F., Morbidelli, A., Jedicke, R., Petit, J.M., Levison,
   H.F., Michel, P., Metcalfe, T.S. {[}2002]. Icarus 156, 399-433)
   provides. We present here the NEOSSat-1.0 NEO orbital distribution model
   with larger statistics that permit finer resolution and less
   uncertainty, especially in the a < 1.0 AU region. We find that Amors =
   30.1 +/- 0.8\%, Apollos = 63.3 +/- 0.4\%, Atens = 5.0 +/- 0.3\%, Atiras
   (0.718 < Q < 0.983 AU) = 1.38 +/- 0.04\%, and Vatiras (0.307 < Q < 0.718
   AU) = 0.22 (103\% of the steady-state NEO population. Vatiras are a
   previously undiscussed NEO population clearly defined in our
   integrations, whose orbits lie completely interior to that of Venus. Our
   integrations also uncovered the unexpected production of retrograde
   orbits from main-belt asteroid sources; this retrograde NEA population
   makes up similar or equal to 0.1\% of the steady-state NEO population.
   The relative NEO impact rate onto Mercury, Venus, and Earth, as well as
   the normalized distribution of impact speeds, was calculated from the
   NEOSSat-1.0 orbital model under the assumption of a steady-state. The
   new model predicts a slightly higher Mercury impact flux. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Multilayer samples of white architectural paint potentially have very
   high evidential value in forensic casework, because the probability that
   two unrelated samples will have the same sequence of layers is extremely
   low. However, discrimination between the different layers using optical
   microscopy is often difficult or impossible. Here, lateral scanning
   Raman spectroscopy has been used to chemically map the cross-sections of
   multilayer white paint chips. It was found that the spectra did allow
   the different layers to be delineated on the basis of their spectral
   features. The boundaries between different layers were not as sharp as
   expected, with transitions occurring over length scales of > 20 mu m,
   even with laser spot diameters < 4 mu m. However, the blurring of the
   boundaries was not so large as to prevent recording and identification
   of spectra from each of the layers in the samples. This method clearly
   provides excellent discrimination between different multilayer white
   paint samples and can readily be incorporated into existing procedures
   for examination of paint transfer evidence. (c) 2011 Crown copyright.}},

Abstract = {{We have obtained 18 new high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations
   of the B2Vp star s Ori E with both the Narval and ESPaDOnS
   spectropolarimeters. The aim of these observations is to test, with
   modern data, the assumptions of the Rigidly Rotating Magnetosphere (RRM)
   model of Townsend \& Owocki, applied to the specific case of s Ori E by
   Townsend, Owocki \& Groote. This model includes a substantially offset
   dipole magnetic field configuration, and approximately reproduces
   previous observational variations in longitudinal field strength,
   photometric brightness and Ha emission. We analyse new spectroscopy,
   including H i, He i, C ii, Si iii and Fe iii lines, confirming the
   diversity of variability in photospheric lines, as well as the double
   S-wave variation of circumstellar hydrogen. Using the multiline analysis
   method of least-squares deconvolution (LSD), new, more precise
   longitudinal magnetic field measurements reveal a substantial variance
   between the shapes of the observed and RRM model time-varying field. The

Abstract = {{We report the discovery and analysis of a very strong magnetic field in
   the rapidly rotating early B-type star HR 5907, based on observations
   obtained as part of the Magnetism in Massive Stars (MiMeS) project. We
   infer a rotation period of 0.508 276+0.000 015-0.000 012 d from
   photometric and Ha EW measurements, making this the shortest period,
   non-degenerate, magnetic massive star known to date. From the comparison
   of IUE UV and optical spectroscopy with LTE bruce/kylie models we find a
   solid-angle integrated, uniform black-body temperature of 17 000 +/-
   1000 K, a projected rotational velocity of 290 +/- 10 km s-1, an
   equatorial radius of 3.1 +/- 0.2 R circle dot, a stellar mass of 5.5 +/-
   0.5 M circle dot, and an inclination angle of the rotation axis to our
   line-of-sight of 70 +/- 10 degrees. Our measurements of the longitudinal
   magnetic field, which vary between -500 and -2000 G, phase coherently
   with the rotation period and imply a surface dipole field strength of
   similar to 15.7 kG. On the other hand, from fits to mean Least-Squares
   Deconvolved Stokes V line profiles we infer a dipole field strength of
   similar to 10.4 kG. This disagreement may result from a magnetic
   configuration more complex than our model, and/or from the non-uniform
   helium surface abundance distribution. In either case we obtain a
   magnetic obliquity nearly aligned with the rotation axis (beta=7-1+2
   degrees). Our optical spectroscopy also shows weak variability in
   carbon, silicon and nitrogen lines. The emission variability in hydrogen
   Balmer and Paschen lines indicates the presence of a dense, highly
   structured magnetosphere, interpreted as a centrifugally supported,
   magnetically confined circumstellar disc.}},

Abstract = {{We report magnetic and spectroscopic observations and modelling of the
   Of?p star HD 148937 within the context of the Magnetism in Massive Stars
   (MiMeS) Large Program at the CanadaFranceHawaii Telescope. 32 high
   signal-to-noise ratio circularly polarized (Stokes V) spectra and 13
   unpolarized (Stokes I) spectra of HD 148937 were acquired in 2009 and
   2010. A definite detection of a Stokes V Zeeman signature is obtained in
   the grand mean of all observations {[}in both least-squares deconvolved
   (LSD) mean profiles and individual spectral lines]. The longitudinal
   magnetic field inferred from the Stokes V LSD profiles is consistently
   negative, in contrast to the essentially zero field strength measured
   from the diagnostic null profiles. A period search of new and archival
   equivalent width measurements confirms the previously reported 7.03 d
   variability period. The variation of equivalent widths is not strictly
   periodic: we present evidence for evolution of the amount or
   distribution of circumstellar plasma. Interpreting the 7.03 d period as
   the stellar rotational period within the context of the oblique rotator
   paradigm, we have phased the equivalent widths and longitudinal field
   measurements. The longitudinal field measurements show a weak sinusoidal
   variation of constant sign, with extrema out of phase with the H alpha
   variation by about 0.25 cycles. From our constraint on v sin i <= 45 km
   s(-1), we infer that the rotational axis inclination i <= 30 degrees.
   Modelling the longitudinal field phase variation directly, we obtain the
   magnetic obliquity beta= 38(-28)(+17)degrees and dipole polar intensity
   B-d = 1020(+310)(-380) G. Simple modelling of the H alpha equivalent
   width variation supports the derived geometry. The inferred magnetic
   configuration confirms the suggestion of Naze et al., who proposed that
   the weaker variability of HD 148937 as compared to other members of this
   class is a consequence of the stellar geometry. Based on the derived
   magnetic properties and published wind characteristics, we find a wind
   magnetic confinement parameter eta({*}) similar or equal to 20 and
   rotation parameter W = 0.12, supporting a picture in which the H alpha
   emission and other line variability have their origin in an oblique,
   rigidly rotating magnetospheric structure resulting from a magnetically
   channelled wind.}},

Abstract = {{We use a large sample of upper limits and accurate estimates of
   supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses coupled with libraries of host
   galaxy velocity dispersions, rotational velocities and photometric
   parameters extracted from Sloan Digital Sky Survey i-band images to
   establish correlations between the SMBH and host galaxy parameters. We
   test whether the mass of the black hole, M., is fundamentally driven by
   either local or global galaxy properties. We explore correlations
   between M. and stellar velocity dispersion sigma(e), i-band bulge
   luminosity L-i,L-bulge, bulge mass M-bulge, bulge Sersic index n, bulge
   mean effective surface brightness <mu(e,bulge)>, i-band luminosity of
   the galaxy L-i,L-gal, galaxy stellar mass M-star,M-gal, maximum circular
   velocity V-c, and galaxy dynamical and effective masses M-dyn,M-gal and
   M-e,M-gal. We verify the tightness of the M.-sigma(e) relation and find
   that correlations with other galaxy parameters do not yield tighter
   trends. We do not find differences in the M.-sigma(e) relation of barred
   and unbarred galaxies. The M.-sigma(e) relation of pseudo-bulges is also
   coarser and has a different slope than that involving classical bulges.
   The M.-M-bulge is not as tight as the M.-sigma(e) relation, despite the
   bulge mass proving to be a better proxy of M. than bulge luminosity, and
   despite adding the bulge effective radius as an additional fitting
   parameter. Contrary to various published reports, we find a rather poor
   correlation between M. and n (or <mu(e,bulge)>), suggesting that M. is
   not related to the bulge light concentration. The correlations between
   M. and galaxy luminosity or mass are not a marked improvement over the
   M.-sigma(e) relation. These scaling relations depend sensitively on the
   host galaxy morphology: early-type galaxies follow a tighter relation
   than late-type galaxies. If V-c is a proxy for the dark matter halo
   mass, the large scatter of the M.-V-c relation then suggests that M. is
   more coupled to the baryonic rather than the dark matter. We have tested
   the need for a third parameter in the M. scaling relations, through
   various linear correlations with bulge and galaxy parameters, only to
   confirm that the Fundamental Plane of the SMBH is mainly driven by
   sigma(e) with a small tilt due to the effective radius. We provide a
   compendium of galaxy structural properties for most of the SMBH hosts
   known to date.}},

Abstract = {{The current understanding of the boundary layer transition is reviewed
   briefly. The effects of leading edge geometry, inlet turbulence, and
   surface waviness, on boundary layer transition on a flat plate are
   predicted using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code,
   STAR-CCM+ which incorporates the gamma - R-theta correlation model. The
   investigations on surface waviness were focused on sinusoidal waves with
   the ratios of wave amplitude to wavelength h/L-w and wave amplitude to
   boundary layer displacement thickness h/delta{*} in the range
   0.0025-0.015 and 0.3-2.8, respectively. It is recommended that in wind
   tunnel testing/CFD analysis of boundary layer transition, a leading edge
   aspect ratio of 12 is maintained to avoid significant effect of leading
   edge geometry. The predictions for the effect of surface waviness on
   transition for multiple waves, using gamma - R-theta model, agree well
   with those using the stability theory. New correlations for the effect
   of waviness on transition Reynolds number are proposed. The correlations
   combine the effects of upstream boundary layer displacement thickness,
   wave height, and wavelength (h{*} or h{*}{*}). It is recommended that a
   value of h{*} < 2 or h{*}{*} < 0.03 is maintained on aircraft surfaces
   to avoid any significant effect of waviness on drag. The variation of
   transition Reynolds number with h{*} for a surface with waviness is of
   the same order to that on a surface with a forward facing step, but
   significantly smaller when compared with a surface with a backward
   facing step (BFS). A value of h{*} < 0.5 is recommended for a BFS to
   avoid significant effect on transition.}},

   localized exclusively in the PP phase. In the presence of a maleated PP
   compatibilizer addition of nanosilica leads to more finely dispersed EOC
   domains and a finer co-continuous morphology. The nanoparticles reduce
   the rate of coalescence of the dispersed phase domains. The mechanical
   properties depend on the EOC and PP-g-MA content. Tensile and flexural
   properties are significantly enhanced in the presence of the silica
   nanoparticles, whereas impact properties are not affected. These
   enhancements are attributed to the favorable microstructure of the

Abstract = {{The preparation and characterisation of a novel, water-proof,
   irreversible, reusable, UV-activated, O-2 sensitive, smart plastic film
   is described. A pigment, consisting of a redox dye, methylene blue (MB),
   and a sacrificial electron donor, DL-threitol, coated onto an inorganic
   support with semiconductor functionality, TiO2, has been extruded in
   low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The blue-coloured indicator is readily
   photobleached in <90 s using UVA light (4 mWcm(-2)), whereby MB is
   converted to its colourless, leuco form, leuco-methylene blue (LMB).
   This form persists in the absence of oxygen, but is re-oxidised to MB in
   similar to 2.5 days in air under ambient conditions (similar to 21
   degrees C, similar to 65\% RH) within the O-2 smart plastic film. The
   rate of recovery is linearly dependent upon the ambient level of O-2. At
   the lower temperature of 5 degrees C, the kinetics of the photobleaching
   activation step is largely unchanged, whereas that of recovery is
   markedly reduced to t(1/2) = 36 h at 5 degrees C (cf. 9 h at 21 degrees
   C); the activation energy for the recovery step was calculated as 28
   kJmol(-1) The O-2-sensitive recovery step was found to be moderately
   dependent upon humidity at 21 degrees C, but not significantly dependent
   upon humidity at 5 degrees C. The possible application of this type of
   indicator in food packaging is illustrated and discussed briefly.}},

Abstract = {{The use of accelerators, with compute architectures different and
   distinct from the CPU, has become a new research frontier in
   high-performance computing over the past five years. This paper is a
   case study on how the instruction-level parallelism offered by three
   accelerator technologies, FPGA, GPU and ClearSpeed, can be exploited in
   atomic physics. The algorithm studied is the evaluation of two electron
   integrals, using direct numerical quadrature, a task that arises in the
   study of intermediate energy electron scattering by hydrogen atoms. The
   results of our productivity study show that while each accelerator is
   viable, there are considerable differences in the implementation
   strategies that must be followed on each. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Decreasing the constriction size and residence time in hydrodynamic
   cavitation is predicted to give increased hot spot temperatures at
   bubble collapse and increased radical formation rate. Cavitation in a
   100 x 100 mu m(2) rectangular micro channel and in a circular 750 mu m
   diameter milli channel has been investigated with computational fluid
   dynamics software and with imaging and radical production experiments.
   No radical production has been measured in the micro channel. This is
   probably because there is no spherically symmetrical collapse of the gas
   pockets in the channel which yield high hot spot temperatures. The
   potassium iodide oxidation yield in the presence of chlorohydrocarbons
   in the milli channel of up to 60 nM min(-1) is comparable to values
   reported on hydrodynamic cavitation in literature, but lower than values
   for ultrasonic cavitation. These small constrictions can create high

Abstract = {{Asymmetric heteroatom oxidation of benzo{[}b]thiophenes to yield the
   corresponding sulfoxides was catalysed by toluene dioxygenase (TDO),
   naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) and styrene monooxygenase (SMO) enzymes
   present in P. putida mutant and E. coli recombinant whole cells.
   TDO-catalysed oxidation yielded the relatively unstable benzo{[}b]
   thiophene sulfoxide; its dimerization, followed by dehydrogenation,
   resulted in the isolation of stable tetracyclic sulfoxides as minor
   products with cis-dihydrodiols being the dominant metabolites. SMO
   mainly catalysed the formation of enantioenriched benzo{[}b] thiophene
   sulfoxide and 2-methyl benzo{[}b] thiophene sulfoxides which racemized
   at ambient temperature. The barriers to pyramidal sulfur inversion of 2-
   and 3-methyl benzo{[}b] thiophene sulfoxide metabolites, obtained using
   TDO and NDO as biocatalysts, were found to be ca.: 25-27 kcal mol(-1).
   The absolute configurations of the benzo{[}b] thiophene sulfoxides were
   determined by ECD spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and stereochemical
   correlation. A site-directed mutant E. coli strain containing an
   engineered form of NDO, was found to change the regioselectivity toward
   preferential oxidation of the thiophene ring rather than the benzene
   ring.}},

Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{486-497}},
Abstract = {{The controlled radical polymerization of methyl acrylate in DMSO
   mediated by copper wire in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was
   successfully demonstrated. Copper wire proved to be an easy to handle
   and reusable catalyst source, mediating chain growth through the SET-LRP
   mechanism. Polymerizations were conducted at 30 degrees C for three
   different residence times at varying copper surface area and ligand
   concentration. Doubling the available copper surface area led to an
   approximately 30\% increase in polymerization rate at the same residence
   time, in agreement with published literature. Experiments conducted at
   low ligand concentration showed only a slight drop in polymerization
   rate with no adverse effect on molecular weight control. Chain
   extensions were conducted using methyl acrylate to simulate a second
   polymer block; no significant dead chain fraction was observed,
   indicating that the polymer produced retained living characteristics.
   The life time of copper wire as a catalyst source was estimated from
   experimental data on copper consumption rates. Deviation from expected
   polydispersities and the effects of utilizing two CSTRs in series on the
   molecular weight distribution are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We present absorption line indices measured in the integrated spectra of
   globular clusters both from the Galaxy and from M31. Our samples include
   41 Galactic globular clusters, and more than 300 clusters in M31. The
   conversion of instrumental equivalent widths into the Lick system is
   described, and zero-point uncertainties are provided. Comparison of line
   indices of old M31 clusters and Galactic globular clusters suggests an
   absence of important differences in chemical composition between the two
   cluster systems. In particular, CN indices in the spectra of M31 and
   Galactic clusters are essentially consistent with each other, in
   disagreement with several previous works. We reanalyze some of the
   previous data, and conclude that reported CN differences between M31 and
   Galactic clusters were mostly due to data calibration uncertainties. Our
   data support the conclusion that the chemical compositions of Milky Way
   and M31 globular clusters are not substantially different, and that
   there is no need to resort to enhanced nitrogen abundances to account
   for the optical spectra of M31 globular clusters.}},

Abstract = {{Massive slow-moving landslides often exhibit deformation patterns which
   vary spatially across the landslide mass and temporally with changing
   boundary conditions. Understanding the parameters controlling this
   behaviour, such as heterogeneous material properties, complex landslide
   geometry and the distribution of groundwater, is fundamental when making
   informed design and hazard management decisions. This paper demonstrates
   that significant improvements to the geomechanical analysis of massive
   landslides can be achieved through rigorous, three-dimensional numerical
   modelling. Simulations of the Downie Slide incorporate complex shear
   zone geometries, multiple water tables and spatial variation of shear
   zone stiffness parameters to adequately reproduce real slope behaviour
   observed through an ongoing site monitoring program. These
   three-dimensional models are not hindered by shortfalls typically
   associated with two-dimensional analysis, for example the ability to
   accommodate lateral migration of material, and they out-perform more
   simplified three-dimensional models where bowl-shaped shear geometries
   are incapable of reasonably reproducing observed deformation patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropic impedance surfaces are employed as low-profile and broadband
   reflectors that convert orthogonal linear to right- and left-handed
   circular polarization respectively. By virtue of anisotropy, it is
   possible to independently control the reflection characteristics of two
   orthogonal linearly polarized incident plane waves and therefore achieve
   linear to circular polarization conversion. Equivalent circuits for
   anisotropic impedance surfaces with arbitrarily shaped elements are
   employed to demonstrate the operating principle and a design procedure
   is proposed. The proposed design procedure is demonstrated by means of
   an example involving a dipole array. A prototype is designed and its
   performance characteristics are evaluated. The 3-dB relative axial ratio
   bandwidth exceeds 60\%, while low loss and angular stability are also
   reported. Numerical and experimental results on a fabricated prototype
   are presented to validate the synthesis and the performance.}},

Abstract = {{An amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay
   network composed of a source, a relay, and a destination is considered,
   where transmit beamforming is employed both at the source and at the
   relay. The relay is a user who is willing to help the communication from
   the source to the destination. In our paper, however, the relay is
   untrusted in the sense that it may make a passive security attack; that
   is, it may decode messages of the source. We consider two ways to
   transmit confidential information of the source to the destination:
   noncooperative secure beamforming and cooperative secure beamforming. In
   the noncooperative scheme, the relay is simply treated as an
   eavesdropper, and does not participate in communication. In the
   cooperative scheme, the relay is asked to relay signals from the source
   to the destination. In this paper, the source and relay beamforming is
   jointly designed to maximize the secrecy rate in the cooperative scheme.
   The conditions under which the cooperative scheme achieves a higher
   secrecy rate than the noncooperative scheme are derived in the low and
   high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes of the source-relay and
   relay-destination links. The performance of the secure beamforming
   schemes is compared through extensive numerical simulations.}},

Title = {{The use of CO2 for reversible pH shifting, and the removal of succinic

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Succinic acid (SA) is an intermediate in the production of
   commodity chemicals, but SA bioproduction has not yet been
   commercialized due to end product inhibition and high product separation
   costs. Two-phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs) can increase
   volumetric productivity through in situ product removal, although SA
   uptake by polymers requires a pH below the pKA2 of SA (4.2). It was
   proposed to reversibly reduce the pH with CO2 sparging for absorption of
   SA, followed by nitrogen stripping to allow continued bioproduction
   after returning to metabolic pH levels.
   RESULTS: At 1 atm CO(2) sparging lowered the pH of RO water to 3.8 but
   only to 4.75 in medium, requiring acid/base pH adjustment in subsequent
   experiments. Actinobacillus succinogenes was temporarily exposed to pH
   4.2 for between 5 min and 4 h to observe the effect on subsequent
   growth; cells could grow after up to 4 h of low pH exposure, sufficient
   time for SA uptake. Because atmospheric CO(2) could not adequately lower
   the pH of medium, a TPPB was operated with the pH being shifted using
   strong acid/base; SA was recovered in situ, however, the accumulation of
   salts hindered further cell growth.
   CONCLUSION: Several key elements of this novel processing strategy were
   successfully demonstrated, and work is continuing with high pressure
   CO(2) to achieve the desired pH adjustment levels. (C) 2011 Society of

Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for addressing the dc component in the
   input signal of the phase-locked loop (PLL) and notch filter algorithms
   applied to filtering and synchronization applications. The dc component
   may be intrinsically present in the input signal or may be generated due
   to temporary system faults or due to the structure and limitations of
   the measurement/conversion processes. Such a component creates
   low-frequency oscillations in the loop that cannot be removed using
   filters because such filters will significantly degrade the dynamic
   response of the system. The proposed method is based on adding a new
   loop inside the PLL structure. It is structurally simple and, unlike an
   existing method discussed in this paper, does not compromise the
   high-frequency filtering level of the concerned algorithm. The method is
   formulated for three-phase and single-phase systems, its design aspects
   are discussed, and simulations/experimental results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{An ice-formation algorithm is implemented in the three-dimensional
   Estuary and Lake Computer Model, to allow simulation of hydrodynamics
   and the thermal structure beneath the ice during winter. The
   one-dimensional governing equation of heat conduction among the three
   layers of white ice, blue ice, and snow is solved for the formation of
   ice cover considering the heat flux through air and water. This
   algorithm is applied independently in each grid cell within the
   simulation domain, allowing for spatially variable ice formation. The
   model was validated against observed data from both a large and a small
   Canadian mid-latitude lake (Lake Ontario and Harmon Lake, respectively).
   The lake surface temperature and the distribution and thickness of ice
   cover on Lake Ontario were predicted successfully during the 2006-2007
   winter period. The model also accurately simulated spring 2007
   temperature profiles, as typically used for the initial conditions for a
   summer simulation. The variation of ice and snow thickness, and vertical
   temperature profiles, were well-simulated for Harmon Lake during winter
   1990-1991. These comparisons demonstrate the applicability of the model
   for year-round simulation of mid-latitude lakes of varying size.}},

   polyethylene (HBPE) and subsequently melt compounded with an
   ethylene-octene copolymer (EOC8100) matrix are examined in terms of
   their dispersion characteristics and electric field response. It was
   found that, when compared with their non-functionalized counterparts,
   HBPE-functionalized MWCNT produce substantially more uniform composites.
   On the other hand, MWCNT functionalization results in a higher
   electrical percolation threshold. Electrification of the composite melts
   showed that longer insulator-to-conductor transition times should be
   expected as a consequence of the improved dispersion quality. The
   functionalization, however, did not prevent MWCNT from forming highly
   electrically conducting networks in the melt, or exhibiting electric
   field-induced percolation thresholds of less than 1wt\% filler. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) is a least-squares
   version of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification problems.
   It aims to minimize the least-square error on the training dataset and
   simultaneously maximize the margin between two classes. In our recent
   work, a new solution was proposed for tackling the drawback of the
   conventional LS-SVMs, i.e. lacking of sparseness. The classifier based
   on the LS-SVM new solution only depends on Global Support Vectors (GSV),
   like Support Vectors (SVs) in SVMs. In the new LS-SVM solution, the
   regularization parameter and the parameters of global SVs, so called
   hyperparameters, should be optimized properly to achieve good
   generalization performance. In this paper, a systematic model selection
   approach for LS-SVM with a new solution is proposed, in which
   leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation is adopted to estimate the
   generalized error and three heuristic methods, namely Differential
   Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm
   (GA) are employed for optimizing the hyper-parameters. The three methods
   are tested on five UCI benchmark datasets. The results show the DE based
   model selection can quickly find better minimum LOO cross validation
   error than the other two methods and the generalization performance is
   also better.}},

Abstract = {{The Ediacaran System and Period was ratified in 2004, the first
   period-level addition to the geologic time scale in more than a century.
   The GSSP at the base of the Ediacaran marks the end of the Marinoan
   glaciation, the last of the truly massive global glaciations that had
   wracked the middle Neoproterozoic world, and can be further recognized
   worldwide by perturbations in C-isotopes and the occurrence of a unique
   ``cap carbonate{''} precipitated as a consequence of this glaciation. At
   least three extremely negative isotope excursions and steeply rising
   seawater Sr-87/Sr-86 values characterize the Ediacaran Period along with
   geochemical evidence for increasing oxygenation of the deep ocean
   environment. The Ediacaran Period (635e541 Ma) marks a pivotal position
   in the history of life, between the microscopic, largely prokaryotic
   assemblages that had dominated the classic ``Precambrian{''} and the
   large, complex, and commonly shelly animals that dominated the Cambrian
   and younger Phanerozoic periods. Diverse large spiny acritarchs and
   simple animal embryos occur immediately above the base of the Ediacaran
   and range through at least the lower half of the Ediacaran. The
   mid-Ediacaran Gaskiers glaciation (584-582 Ma) was immediately followed
   by the appearance of the Avalon assemblage of the largely soft-bodied
   Ediacara biota (579 Ma). The earliest abundant bilaterian burrows and
   impressions (555 Ma) and calcified animals (550 Ma) appear towards the
   end of the Ediacaran Period.

Abstract = {{During summer, temperate lakes often exhibit recurrent eutrophication
   and hypoxia and there has been significant research into the causes and
   effects. Phytoplankton blooms and low oxygen have also been observed in
   these lakes under winter ice; however, detailed studies coupling winter
   stratification to biogeochemistry are lacking. In this study, four years
   of continuous high resolution temperature and dissolved oxygen
   observations are analyzed from a small temperate lake in Ontario,
   Canada. The lake exhibits near-bed hypoxia and anoxia 2/3 and 1/3 of the
   time, respectively, and so a low oxygen concentration state should be
   considered typical for the lake. The watercolumn resets to atmospheric
   oxygen levels only during fall turnover (63-79 d) and long spring
   turnover (17-19 d) events. Short spring turnover events (1-8 d), which
   occur during anomalously warm and calm weather conditions, have uniform
   temperature profiles, through direct heating of the entire watercolumn
   with short wave solar radiation. The watercolumn subsequently stratifies
   and wind and convection induced mixing are insufficient to fully mix
   oxygen over the depth.}},

Abstract = {{A general method to prepare organic-inorganic hybrid aerogels has been
   presented. A series of organic-inorganic hybrid aerogels were
   successfully produced from 3d trivalent transition metals (Cr3+, Fe3+)
   and bridging carboxylic acids. Gelation of the Cr(III) gels was achieved
   by heating the precursor solution to temperatures above 80 degrees C,
   which is in sharp contrast to usual supramolecular gels. Among a range
   of ligands used, highly porous aerogels could be prepared from rigid
   carboxylate, e.g. 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate and
   1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate. The porous aerogels can be described as a
   coherent, rigid spongy network of continuous nanometre-sized particles,
   which is significantly different from the usual fibrous network of
   supramolecular gels. The aerogels have tunable porous structures with
   micro-and mesoporosity depending on their reactant concentrations. Their
   surface areas, pore volumes, and average pore sizes were analysed by
   using nitrogen sorption, and the accessibility of the pores to bulky
   molecules was also evaluated. It represents a strategy to prepare hybrid
   materials with large porosity utilising structurally simple building
   blocks as precursors.}},

   polymerization decreases with an increasing cobalt(II) catalyst loading.
   The course of the polymerization can be captured by the Morgan-Kaler
   model extended with radical desorption and aqueous phase termination.
   Proper molecular weight control (i.e. a molecular weight distribution
   with a dispersity of similar to 2) is achieved, however, proves to be
   strongly dependent on the balance of cobalt(II) molecules and
   propagating radicals. The presence of a cobalt(II) catalyst enhances the
   likelihood of homogeneous nucleation, which decreases the colloidal
   stability in the methyl methacrylate microemulsion polymerizations. The
   n-butyl methacrylate microemulsion polymerizations on the other hand,
   display good colloidal stability and a remarkable increase in the
   nucleation efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Some electrical component cooling problems can be approximately modeled
   as involving natural convective heat transfer from a vertical isothermal
   cylinder with a rectangular cross-section mounted on a flat horizontal
   adiabatic base plate. The cylinder may be pointing vertically upwards or
   vertically downwards. The heat transfer from the surface of the cylinder
   for this situation has been numerically and experimentally investigated
   here. Because of the applications being considered, the length-to-width
   ratios of the rectangular cross-section of the cylinders considered are
   relatively large. The cylinder is mounted on a flat horizontal adiabatic
   base plate and both the case where the cylinder points vertically
   upwards and where it points vertically downwards have been considered.
   In the numerical study the flow has been assumed to be steady and it has
   been assumed that the fluid properties are constant except for the
   density change with temperature which gives rise to the buoyancy forces,
   this having been treated by using the Boussinesq approach. The solution
   has been obtained by numerically solving the three-dimensional governing
   equations using the commercial CFD code FLUENT (c) Because of the
   applications that motivated this study, results have been obtained only
   for a Prandtl number of 0.74, i.e. essentially the value for air. A
   relatively wide range of the other governing parameters has been
   considered. A supporting experimental study has also been undertaken. In
   this study solid aluminum cylinders were used and the mean heat transfer
   rate from the cylinder was determined using the transient method in
   which the heat transfer rate is deduced from the rate at which a
   uniformly preheated cylinder cools. Experimental results were also
   obtained for the case where the cylinder points vertically upward and
   where it points vertically downward. Good agreement between the
   experimental and numerical results was obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Natural convective heat transfer from a wide isothermal plate which has
   a ``wavy{''} surface, i.e. a surface which periodically rises and falls,
   has been numerically studied. The surface waves run in the horizontal
   direction, i.e., are normal to the direction of flow over the surface.
   Attention has been restricted to the case where the waves have a
   sinusoidal cross-sectional shape. The plate is, in general, inclined to
   the vertical with consideration being given both to inclination angles
   at which the heated plate is facing upwards and to inclination angles at
   which the heated plate is facing downwards. The range of Rayleigh
   numbers considered extends from values that for a non-wavy vertical
   plate would be associated with laminar flow to values that would be
   associated with fully turbulent flow. The flow has been assumed to be
   steady and fluid properties have been assumed constant except for the
   density change with temperature that gives rise to the buoyancy forces,
   this being treated by means of the Boussinesq approximation. The
   Reynolds averaged governing equations in conjunction with a standard
   k-epsilon turbulence model with buoyancy force effects accounted for
   have been used in obtaining the solution. The governing equations have
   been solved using the commercial CFD code FLUENT.. The solution has the
   following parameters: i) the Rayleigh number based on the height of the
   heated plate, ii) the Prandtl number, iii) the ratios of the amplitude
   of the surface waviness and of the pitch of the surface waves to the
   height of the plate, and iv) the angle of inclination of the plate to
   the vertical. Results have been obtained for a Prandtl number of 0.74
   and for amplitude and pitch ratios of 0.1. The effects of Rayleigh
   number and angle of inclination on the mean and local surface Nusselt
   numbers have been numerically studied.}},

Abstract = {{The Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) is a modified SVM with
   a ridge regression cost function and equality constraints. It has been
   successfully applied in many classification problems. But, the common
   issue for LS-SVM is that it lacks sparseness, which is a serious
   drawback in its applications. To tackle this problem, a fast approach is
   proposed in this paper for developing sparse LS-SVM. First, a new
   regression solution is proposed for the LS-SVM which optimizes the same
   objective function for the conventional solution. Based on this, a new
   subset selection method is then adopted to realize the sparse
   approximation. Simulation results on different benchmark datasets i. e.
   Checkerboard, two Gaussian datasets, show that the proposed solution can
   achieve better objective value than conventional LS-SVM, and the
   proposed approach can achieve a more sparse LS-SVM than the conventional
   LS-SVM while provide comparable predictive classification accuracy.
   Additionally, the computational complexity is significantly decreased.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the monitoring of continuous processes using
   dynamic nonlinear principal component analysis (NPCA). Previously, it
   was shown that integrating the RBF networks with principal curves
   significantly had increased the sensitivity of fault detection for
   nonlinear processes. Despite this, the previous method may not function
   well for processes which exhibit strong dynamic characteristics. An
   effective method of capturing dynamic behaviour is to consider a
   timelagged data extension. However, the augmented data matrix may lead
   to the inclusion of a large number of variables in the RBF network
   input, and hence increase the computational load and network complexity.
   To prevent this, an input selection scheme, based on the nonlinear
   dynamic relationship underlying the process variables, is introduced.
   This selects the most important and relevant time-lagged variables
   before constructing the RBF network model. Consequently, a modified
   dynamic NPCA approach is now proposed. The advantages of this
   improvement are demonstrated using a benchmark simulation example from
   the literature.}},

   on the pressure recovery performance of the S-bend diffuser.
   The study revealed a substantial back-pressure penalty and wall pressure
   distribution alteration in the S-bend passage with full coverage
   effusion cooling. The outlet diffuser was shown to be not as effective

Abstract = {{In non-steady flows, dune dimensions are known to lag changes in
   discharge. This research examines the adjustment of equilibrium dunes,
   developed under steady and uniform flow conditions, to a sudden increase
   or decrease in discharge. For the present purposes, nineteen laboratory
   runs were carried out in a 21m long, 0.76m wide sediment transport flume
   at the Queen's University Coastal Engineering Research Laboratory. In
   these runs, the flow was kept uniform so that the sudden change in
   discharge is represented as a sudden change in flow depth. Dunes were
   observed to initially adapt to a change in flow by adjusting their
   heights. Only after some time had past, allowing for the coalescence and
   splitting of individual dunes, did the average dune length adjust to
   equilibrium dimensions. It was also found that dunes forming from an
   initially undulated bed produced by a different flow tended to acquire
   the same dimensions as those developed from an initially flat bed. This
   suggests that the developed dune dimensions are related only to the flow
   conditions, and are independent of the initial shape of the bed.}},

Pages = {{413-447}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this critical review is to provide a broad but digestible
   overview of mechanochemical synthesis, i.e. reactions conducted by
   grinding solid reactants together with no or minimal solvent. Although
   mechanochemistry has historically been a sideline approach to synthesis
   it may soon move into the mainstream because it is increasingly apparent
   that it can be practical, and even advantageous, and because of the
   opportunities it provides for developing more sustainable methods.
   Concentrating on recent advances, this article covers industrial
   aspects, inorganic materials, organic synthesis, cocrystallisation,
   pharmaceutical aspects, metal complexes (including metal-organic
   frameworks), supramolecular aspects and characterization methods. The
   historical development, mechanistic aspects, limitations and
   opportunities are also discussed (314 references).}},

Abstract = {{Two stable nanofluids comprising of mixed valent copper(I,II) oxide
   clusters (<1 nm) suspended in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate,

   suspended in trioctyl(dodecyl) phosphonium acetate, {[}P-88812]{[}OAc],
   were synthesised in a facile one-pot reaction from solutions of
   copper(II) acetate hydrate in the corresponding ionic liquids. Formation
   of the nanostructures was studied using C-13 NMR spectroscopy and
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). From a solution of Cu(OAc)(2)
   in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, {[}C(2)mim]{[}OAc], crystals
   were obtained that revealed the structure of
   {[}C(2)mim]{[}Cu-3(OAc)(5)(OH)(2)(H2O)]center dot H2O, indicating the
   formation of copper hydroxo-clusters in the course of the reaction.
   Synthesised nanostructures were studied using transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Physical
   properties of the prepared IL-nanofluids were examined using IR and
   UV-VIS spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC) and densitometry.}},

Title = {{Issues and Implications of Carbon-Abatement Discounting and Pricing for
   Drinking Water System Design in Canada}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{43-61}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Water utilities generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when they
   construct, retrofit, and operate their water distribution systems. The
   prospect of introducing carbon-abatement strategies such as carbon
   pricing and using low discount rates for project planning could
   potentially change the manner in which water utilities plan and design
   their drinking water systems. The objectives of this paper are to: (i)
   Review the current issues and controversies surrounding the choice of
   discounting rate and carbon prices in Canada to reduce the GHG emissions
   linked to operating water systems in Canada; (ii) Review previous
   research that has examined the impact of discounting and carbon pricing
   on design decisions in water supply and distribution systems, and; (iii)
   Illustrate the possible implications of carbon-abatement strategies
   (discounting and carbon pricing) on the design of Canadian water systems
   by way of a real-world case study. The implications of discount rate and
   carbon price uncertainty on water distribution system design are
   illustrated with the Amherstview-Odessa water transmission system in
   Ontario, Canada. The results of the Amherstview study indicated that
   lowering discount rate led to significant increases in electricity
   costs. The study results also suggested that for a sufficiently low
   discount rate of 1.4\%, increasing carbon price led to a larger pipe
   size and pipe cost to offset carbon costs levied on fossil-fuel based
   electricity to operated the pumps for the life of the system. Additional
   studies are needed on large-scale water systems to inform decisions on
   system upgrades taken by water utility managers.}},

Title = {{Current methods and advances in forecasting of wind power generation}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Wind power generation differs from conventional thermal generation due
   to the stochastic nature of wind. Thus wind power forecasting plays a
   key role in dealing with the challenges of balancing supply and demand
   in any electricity system, given the uncertainty associated with the
   wind farm power output. Accurate wind power forecasting reduces the need
   for additional balancing energy and reserve power to integrate wind
   power. Wind power forecasting tools enable better dispatch, scheduling
   and unit commitment of thermal generators, hydro plant and energy
   storage plant and more competitive market trading as wind power ramps up
   and down on the grid. This paper presents an in-depth review of the
   current methods and advances in wind power forecasting and prediction.
   Firstly, numerical wind prediction methods from global to local scales,
   ensemble forecasting, upscaling and downscaling processes are discussed.
   Next the statistical and machine learning approach methods are detailed.
   Then the techniques used for benchmarking and uncertainty analysis of
   forecasts are overviewed, and the performance of various approaches over
   different forecast time horizons is examined. Finally, current research
   activities, challenges and potential future developments are appraised.
