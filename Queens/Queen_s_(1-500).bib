Abstract = {{A numerical approach has been developed to capture the inhomogeneous and
   nonstationary processes of pulsed laser polymerization (PLP). The new
   simulation tool has been applied to systematically investigate how
   temperature gradients that develop in the sample cell influence the
   accuracy of propagation rate coefficients, k(p), determined by the
   PLP-SEC method. Although the temperature in the center of the sample
   cell may increase more than 30 degrees C during pulsing of bulk vinyl
   acetate (VAc), this increase does not greatly influence the accuracy of
   k(p) determined from the cumulative polymer molar mass distribution
   (MMD), provided that overall conversion in the system is kept low.
   Simulations indicate that the dependence of k(p) on laser pulse
   repetition rate observed experimentally for VAc is not caused by
   nonisothermal gradients. However, the temperature increases cause a
   widening of the peaks in MMDs, a loss of the expected PLP structure, and
   a slight increase in k(p) values with the number of pulses applied.
   These observations are demonstrated experimentally for vinyl pivalate
   (VPi), with simulated MMDs in good agreement with those measured
   experimentally. The pulse repetition dependence of k(p) observed in the
   literature for VPi is verified, with the value determined at 30 degrees
   C, k(p) = 7270 L mol(-1) s(-1), also in good agreement with literature.}},

Title = {{Probing different regimes of strong field light-matter interaction with

Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},

Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{In this work we present an extensive experimental and theoretical
   investigation of different regimes of strong field light-matter
   interaction for cavity-driven quantum dot (QD) cavity systems. The
   electric field enhancement inside a high-Q micropillar cavity
   facilitates exceptionally strong interaction with few cavity photons,
   enabling the simultaneous investigation for a wide range of QD-laser
   detuning. In case of a resonant drive, the formation of dressed states
   and a Mollow triplet sideband splitting of up to 45 mu cV is measured
   for a mean cavity photon number < nc > <= 1. In the asymptotic limit of
   the linear AC Stark effect we systematically investigate the power and
   detuning dependence of more than 400 QDs. Some QD-cavity systems exhibit
   an unexpected anomalous Stark shift, which can be explained by an
   extended dressed 4-level QD model. We provide a detailed analysis of the
   QD-cavity systems properties enabling this novel effect. The
   experimental results are successfully reproduced using a polaron master
   equation approach for the QD-cavity system, which includes the driving
   laser field, exciton-cavity and exciton-phonon interactions.}},

Abstract = {{In wireless multimedia sensor systems (WMSSs), the devices are equipped
   with multiple energy-constrained camera sensors (CSs) distributed over
   bandwidth-constrained and lossy wireless channels, in catastrophe-prone
   areas. Meanwhile, multimedia applications, e.g. video streaming, require
   considerable energy and bandwidth resources to gain long lifetime and
   high streaming quality. This study proposes an energy, bandwidth, and
   quality (EBQ) optimisation framework for green two-tiered WMSSs. The
   first tier contains the CSs and the second tier includes cluster heads
   (CHs) selected from the CSs with higher available energy and processing
   capacity. In the EBQ optimisation framework, a rate allocation
   optimisation problem is formulated under given constraints of available
   backhaul bandwidth of the CHs and quality of received videos at base
   stations (BSs). This problem is solved for optimal encoding rates to
   packetise each video captured from different environments into multiple
   descriptions for transmission. Consequently, the average energy
   consumption per CS is minimised for long lifetime while conserving the
   bandwidth of the CHs and guaranteeing high quality of received videos
   for the purpose of monitoring at the BSs. Simulations demonstrate that
   the proposed EBQ optimisation framework can efficiently enhance the
   performance of green two-tiered WMSSs in terms of minimum energy
   consumption, bandwidth efficiency, and high quality.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the effect of of the primary network on
   the secondary network when harvesting energy in cognitive radio in the
   presence of multiple power beacons and multiple secondary transmitters.
   In particular, the influence of the primary transmitter's transmit power
   on the energy harvesting secondary network is examined by studying two
   scenarios of primary transmitter's location, i.e., the primary
   transmitter's location is near to the secondary network and the primary
   transmitter's location is far from the secondary network. In the
   scenario where the primary transmitter locates near to the secondary
   network, although secondary transmitter can be benefit from the
   harvested energy from the primary transmitter, the interference caused
   by the primary transmitter suppresses the secondary network performance.
   Meanwhile, in both scenarios, despite the fact that the transmit power
   of the secondary transmitter can be improved by the support of powerful
   power beacons, the peak interference constraint at the primary receiver
   limits this advantage. In addition, the deployment of multiple power
   beacons and multiple secondary transmitters can improve the performance
   of the secondary network. The analytical expressions of the outage
   probability of the secondary network in the two scenarios are also
   provided and verified by numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the application of a solid-liquid two-phase
   partitioning bioreactor (TPPB) for the removal of colour from a real
   textile wastewater containing reactive azo-dyes. Four polymers were
   tested over the pH range of 4-9 to select the most effective absorbant
   to be used as the partitioning phase in the TPPB. The best results were
   obtained with Hytrel 8206 at pH 4 achieving similar to 70\% colour
   removal, based on the dominant wavelength, in the first 5 h of contact
   time, and 84\% after 24 h. Wastewater treatment was undertaken in a
   solid-liquid TPPB operated with Hytrel 8206 in sequential
   anaerobic-aerobic configuration. The reaction time of 23 h was equally
   distributed between the anaerobic and aerobic phases and, to favour
   colour uptake, the pH was controlled at 4.5 in the first 4 h of the
   anaerobic phase, and then-increased to 7.5. Colour removal (for the
   dominant wavelength, 536 nm) increased from 70 to 85\% by modifying the
   bioreactor operation from single-phase to TPPB mode. Based on COD
   measurements nearly complete{''} biodegradation of the intermediates
   produced in the anaerobic phase was obtained, both in the single-phase
   and two-phase mode, with better performance of the TPPB system reaching
   75\% CODoye removal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several problems arise when measuring the mode II interlaminar fracture
   toughness using a Transverse Crack Tension specimen; in particular, the
   fracture toughness depends on the geometry of the specimen and cannot be
   considered a material parameter. A preliminary experimental campaign was
   conducted on TCTs of different sizes but no fracture toughness was
   measured because the TCTs failed in an unacceptable way, invalidating
   the tests. A comprehensive numerical and experimental investigation is
   conducted to identify the main causes of this behaviour and a
   modification of the geometry of the specimen is proposed. It is believed
   that the obtained results represent a significant contribution in the
   understanding of the TCT test as a mode II characterization procedure
   and, at the same time, provide new guidelines to characterize the mode
   II crack propagation under tensile loads. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An RVE-based stochastic numerical model is used to calculate the
   permeability of randomly generated porous media at different values of
   the fiber volume fraction for the case of transverse flow in a
   unidirectional ply. Analysis of the numerical results shows that the
   permeability is not normally distributed. With the aim of proposing a
   new understanding on this particular topic, permeability data are fitted
   using both a mixture model and a unimodal distribution. Our findings
   suggest that permeability can be fitted well using a mixture model based
   on the lognormal and power law distributions. In case of a unimodal
   distribution, it is found, using the maximum-likelihood estimation
   method (MLE), that the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution
   represents the best fit. Finally, an expression of the permeability as a
   function of the fiber volume fraction based on the GEV distribution is
   discussed in light of the previous results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The effect of periodic changes in particle velocity on mass transfer to
   the reacting surface of a magnetic particle with a diameter 225 mu m in
   laminar flow has been investigated in a microfluidic reactor. The
   periodic particle motion in a fluid was investigated under a sinusoidal
   magnetic field generated by a quadrupole arrangement of electromagnets
   around the reactor. The effect of operating frequency of the rotating
   magnetic field, intensity of the magnetic field, and phase shift between
   the two sets of magnets on particle dynamics has been studied. Three
   particle motion modes have been observed depending on the frequency of
   the applied field. The mass transfer rate was estimated under steady
   velocity and variable velocity of the particle using a mass transfer
   correlation by Feng and Michaelides (2001). The validity of this
   correlation for the case of variable particle velocity has been
   confirmed with a 2D numerical model, describing actual hydrodynamics and
   mass transfer towards the particle surface. The mass transfer
   coefficient depends both on the mean particle velocity and the deviation
   of velocity from the mean value. The periodic movement with variable
   particle velocity reduces the mass transfer coefficient by 7.6\% as
   compared to steady state motion with the same mean velocity. Crown

Abstract = {{Icosahedral boranes, carboranes, and metallacarboranes are
   extraordinarily robust compounds with desirable properties such as
   thermal and redox stability, chemical inertness, low nucleophilicity,
   and high hydrophobicity, making them attractive for several applications
   such as medicine, nanomaterials, molecular electronics, energy,
   catalysis, environmental chemistry, and other areas. The hydrogen atoms
   in these clusters can be replaced by convenient groups that open the way
   to a chemical alternative to conventional ``organic{''} or
   ``organometsllic{''} realms. Icosahedral boron cluster derivatives have
   been reviewed from different perspectives; however, there is a need for
   a review dedicated to the redox and photophysical characteristics of
   easily accessible borane and carborane derivatives, which are excellent
   materials for a wide range of applications. This review deals with the
   redox properties and photoluminescence behavior of this collection of
   compounds, as well as their influence on the properties of materials and
   devices whose working principles are related to electron-transfer or
   electron-promotion phenomena. We hope that this review will be of great
   value to boron cluster scientists and researchers working in the
   photoluminescence and electrochemistry fields who are interested in
   exploring the possibilities of these unique and promising systems.}},

Abstract = {{For the first time, micro-scale digital image correlation (mu DIC) is
   investigated for measurement of strain fields in hierarchical
   fiber-reinforced composites. The methodology is developed on an
   exemplary alumina fiber/epoxy composite laminate with aligned carbon
   nanotubes (A-CNTs) grown on fibers. Utilizing environmental scanning
   electron microscopy and nano-scale random speckle patterns, sufficient
   precision is achieved to detect the influence of the A-CNTs on the
   deformation field around the fibers. Debonded regions at the
   fiber/matrix interface with openings as small as 35 nm could be
   detected. mu DIC could identify the propagation of the debonded region
   based on the non-linear increase of the opening. The image correlation
   uncertainty in the displacement analysis is estimated to be below 5 nm.
   The experimental results are validated by computational analysis
   performed on the region of interest. For this, an advanced model with
   two scales of reinforcement (microscopic fibers and nanotubes) and
   boundary conditions taken from the experiment is used. As verified by
   the model, A-CNTs are found to constrain matrix deformation in their
   longitudinal direction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cancellation of clutter and multipath is an important problem in passive
   bistatic radars. Some important recent algorithms such as the ECA, the
   SCA and the ECA-B project the received signals onto a subspace
   orthogonal to both clutter and pre-detected target subspaces. In this
   paper, we generalize the SCA algorithm and propose a novel sequential
   algorithm for clutter and multipath cancellation in the passive radars.
   This proposed sequential cancellation batch (SCB) algorithm has lower
   complexity and requires less memory than the mentioned methods. The SCB
   algorithm can be employed for static and non-static clutter
   cancellation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by computer simulation
   under practical FM radio signals. Simulation results reveal that the SCB
   provides an admissible performance with lower computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{An elastically-suspended backpack offers biomechanical benefits by
   reducing peak interaction force, joint loads and chances of potential
   injuries as shown in previous studies. But whether it will reduce
   metabolic cost of the carrier (compared with the stiffly-attached pack)
   depends on the relation between the natural frequency of the suspension
   and walking frequency. Yet, no quantitative method can precisely
   evaluate to what extent the elasticity of suspension affects human
   walking energetics. We employ a single degree of freedom (DOF) model to
   quantitatively evaluate the effect of stiffness and damping of pack on
   human energetics. A surrogate of metabolic cost is proposed and utilized
   to estimate the energetics difference between carrying backpacks of
   different stiffness. The predicted difference is consistent with former
   backpack studies. The analysis reveals that the energy cost increases
   around the resonant frequency and the difference gets more significant
   at higher walking speeds or with heavier loads. This method gives closer
   energetic estimation compared with previous studies. Yet there is
   potentially an underestimation of the energy difference indicating later
   models should contain horizontal motion to obtain more precise
   prediction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and application of a novel
   computational fluid dynamics model which allows the investigation of
   large solid oxide fuel cell stacks in practical computation times.
   Comparisons with a previously verified model match quantitatively to
   within 3\% difference for all parameters of a benchmark case and solve
   within 1.5\% the computation time for parallel flows of air and fuel in
   a cell, verifying the present model as a practical option in stack
   design. The model is used to demonstrate that the distribution of flow
   rates to each cell in a 100 cell stack significantly affects the
   temperature distribution and overall electrochemical performance. In a
   further analysis, it is quantitatively demonstrated that it would be
   misleading to attempt to predict performance or optimise manifold
   designs based on a model with uncoupled transport and electrochemistry.

Abstract = {{We have prepared CO2-switchable poly(methyl methacrylate) and
   polystyrene latexes where the stabilizing CO2-switchable moiety
   originated from either the monomer 2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate
   (DMAEMA) (copolymerized in situ) or previously synthesized
   poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)block-poly(methyl methacrylate)
   (PDMAEMA-b-PMMA). The latexes can be aggregated by N-2 and heat, and
   redispersed through CO2 bubbling and sonication. These two methods of
   incorporating the CO2-responsive groups yield quite different switching
   behavior. Using PDMAEMA-b-PMMA as the only switchable compound produced
   latexes that are easily aggregated, however the redispersion step
   required relatively high energy input. In contrast when the stabilizing
   moieties originated from DMAEMA monomer copolymerized in situ, the
   latexes exhibit the opposite behavior; aggregation is difficult but
   redispersion is easier. By combining the use of both in situ polymerized
   DMAEMA monomer and PDMAEMA-b-PMMA, we were able to produce latexes with
   tunable aggregation and redispersion behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   polymerization}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{313-319}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{In this study we achieved an efficient metal-catalyzed radical
   ``miniemulsion{''} polymerization with ferrocene (FeCp2) as a cocatalyst
   in conjunction with a thermoresponsive PEG containing ruthenium catalyst
   for the polymerization of methacrylate monomers. The iron-cocatalysis
   worked well even in the miniemulsion similar to homogeneous solution
   system. The secondary catalytic cycle by ferrocene allows regeneration
   of Ru(II) activator species through reduction of accumulated Ru(III)
   deactivator as well as promotion of halogen-capping or deactivation for
   the active radical species. The effectiveness of this iron cocatalyst in
   miniemulsion was investigated with both higher polymerization rate and
   reaching conversion (>90\%) than without FeCp2. In this system, the
   halogen counterion on the cationic surfactant was a major factor in
   determining the polymerization rate and the end group fidelity.
   Interestingly, when a non-ionic surfactant was used for the
   FeCp2-cocatalyzed miniemulsion, a simple addition of salt carrying
   common halogen ion (e.g., NaCl) in aqueous phase was very effective in
   terms of polymerization control. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{High-strain deformation and fluid infiltration diachronism of the middle
   crust: New Devonian-Permian Alice Springs ages (365-290 Ma) of shear
   zones in the Strangways Metamorphic Complex, Central Australia}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{443}},
Pages = {{39-53}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{The Proterozoic granulite-facies Strangways Metamorphic Complex (SMC) in
   the Arunta Region of Central Australia was partially hydrated during the
   Devonian-Carboniferous (380-320 Ma) Alice Springs Orogeny by
   amphibolite-greenschist-facies high-strain deformation. Stable and
   radiogenic isotope analyses on coeval muscovite and biotite from
   shear-zone samples of the SMC were performed to analyse the composition
   and date the timing of fluid circulation and cooling.
   Stable isotope data (delta O-18 and delta D) indicate that in the south
   of the SMC, the source of fluids appear to be the thick successions of
   Neoproterozoic Heavitree Quartzite, while another source in the north
   and central part of the SMC may be related to meteoric fluids. The
   heterogeneous delta O-18(Fluid) and homogenous delta D-Fluid values for
   muscovite reflect changes in water/rock ratios with initial high values
   in the south and lower in the north, possibly suggesting a migration of
   fluids from south to north (as indicated by the evolving delta
   O-18(Fluid) and homogenous delta D-Fluid values). Rb/Sr muscovite ages
   of 365-340 Ma approximate the time of crystallization and fluid
   infiltration. They also indicate that the shear zones were active at
   different times during the Alice Springs Orogeny and that some were
   active prior to the peak Carboniferous amphibolite-facies metamorphism.
   Ar-40/Ar-39 muscovite ages of 350-325 Ma are mostly interpreted as
   cooling ages. Rb/Sr biotite ages of 335-290 Ma are interpreted as
   cooling ages at similar to 300 degrees C (Sr closure temperature for
   biotite) and extend the activity of the Alice Springs Orogeny until the
   Permian.
   Cooling histories of the Wallaby Knob and Harry Creek shear zones, which
   serve as the tectonic boundaries of the SMC to the north and south
   respectively, indicate slow cooling (<3.5 degrees C Ma(-1)) for c. 30 Ma
   (360-330 Ma) at both boundaries continuing until 290 Ma in the western
   portion of the Harry Creek shear zone. This slow cooling is associated
   with passive exhumation (i.e. erosion). Rapid cooling (20-10 degrees C
   Ma(-1)) then occurred over c. 10 Ma (330-320 Ma) in the Wallaby Knob
   shear zone and in the east portion of the Harry Creek shear zone. This
   change in cooling rate is associated with the combined initiation in the
   Carboniferous of dextral and thrusting deformation by the Pinnacles Bore
   and Erontonga shear zones. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a multiuser downlink wiretap network
   consisting of one base station (BS) equipped with AA antennas, NB
   single-antenna legitimate users, and NE single-antenna eavesdroppers
   over Nakagami-m fading channels. In particular, we introduce a joint
   secure transmission scheme that adopts transmit antenna selection at the
   BS and explores threshold-based selection diversity scheduling over
   legitimate users to achieve a good secrecy performance while maintaining
   low implementation complexity. More specifically, in an effort to
   quantify the secrecy performance of the considered system, two practical
   scenarios are investigated, i.e.: in Scenario I, the eavesdropper's
   channel state information (CSI) is unavailable at the BS, and in
   Scenario II, the eavesdropper's CSI is available at the BS. For Scenario
   I, novel exact closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage
   probability are derived, which are valid for general networks with an
   arbitrary number of legitimate users, antenna configurations, number of
   eavesdroppers, and the switched threshold. For Scenario II, we take into
   account the ergodic secrecy rate as the principle performance metric,
   and derive novel exact closed-form expressions for the ergodic secrecy
   rate. In addition, we also provide simple and asymptotic expressions for
   secrecy outage probability and ergodic secrecy rate under two distinct
   cases, i.e.: in Case I, the legitimate user is located close to the BS,
   and in Case II, both the legitimate user and eavesdropper are located
   close to the BS. Our important findings reveal that the secrecy
   diversity order is AAmA and the slope of secrecy rate is one under Case
   I, while the secrecy diversity order and the slope of secrecy rate
   collapse to zero under Case II, where the secrecy performance floor
   occurs. Finally, when the switched threshold is carefully selected, the
   considered scheduling scheme outperforms other well-known existing
   schemes in terms of the secrecy performance and complexity tradeoff.}},

Abstract = {{We have prepared a variety of polymer nanoparticles with surface
   properties that can be switched from charged to uncharged using only
   carbon dioxide and air as triggers. Our initial approach to designing
   these materials relied on using pre-made ``switchable surfactants{''}
   via emulsion polymerization. This approach is similar to that employed
   to make the majority of polymer latexes used in commercial applications.
   We then refined the process further to address a shortcoming of many
   emulsion polymers, that of surfactant migration due to the stabilizing
   species not being covalently bound, by developing variants of surfactant
   free processes for making carbon dioxide switchable polymer colloids:
   (1) using only a carbon dioxide switchable initiator; (2) using a carbon

Abstract = {{Biomechanical energy harvesters (BMEHs) have shown that useable amounts
   of electricity can be generated from daily movement. Where access to an
   electrical power grid is limited, BMEHs are a viable alternative to
   accommodate energy requirements for portable electronics. In this paper,
   we present the detailed design and dynamic model of a lower limb-driven
   energy harvester that predicts the device output and the load on the
   user. Comparing with existing harvester models, the novelty of the
   proposed model is that it incorporates the energy required for useful
   electricity generation, stored inertial energy, and both mechanical and
   electrical losses within the device. The model is validated with the
   lower limb-driven energy harvester in 12 unique configurations with a
   combination of four different motor and three different electrical
   resistance combinations (3.5 Omega, 7 Omega, and 12 Omega). A case study
   shows that the device can generate between 3.6 and 15.5 W with an
   efficiency between 39.8\% and 72.5\%. The model was able to predict the
   harvester output peak voltage within 5.6 +/- 3.2\% error and the peak
   force it exerts on the user within 9.9 +/- 3.4\% error over a range of
   parameter values. The model will help to identify configurations to
   achieve a high harvester efficiency and provide a better understanding
   of how parameters affect both the timing and magnitude of the load felt
   by the user.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in promoting autism-friendly environments,
   especially in a school setting. Findings to date have generally
   advocated an accepted reductionist or generalist approach when providing
   an autism-friendly built environment. However, previous studies, while
   very well intentioned, have rarely involved those with autism spectrum
   condition (ASC) to comment on and then instruct designers on what, for
   them, constitutes an autism-friendly learning environment. If going to
   be truly inclusive, the authors contend that those who are most
   knowledgeable about ASC, those with ASC, should, whenever possible, be
   given the opportunity to comment on the design of our shared built
   environment. Hence this article first introduces some of the challenges
   faced by those with ASC in trying to cope with their surroundings,
   before proceeding to outline the development of a simple school design
   `jigsaw' kit that helped pupils with ASC to communicate ideas for their
   perfect school. Used in four design workshops, secondary school aged
   pupils (aged 13 to 18) with ASC imparted their likes, dislikes and what
   was most important to them within the school environment. This
   facilitated comparison with current autism-friendly guidelines and
   provides a valuable insight into the mind of the secondary pupil with
   ASC. It is hoped that by increasing awareness and then including those
   with ASC in describing what might constitute an autism-friendly learning
   environment, it will help facilitate greater inclusion of the child with
   ASC into mainstream education and society at large.}},

Abstract = {{Despite considerable investment in recent years, approximately half of
   all Irish water bodies still do not meet Water Framework Directive (WFD;
   European Parliament and Council, 2000) objectives. Identifying
   appropriate measures to address eutrophication linked to agriculture
   remains a major challenge. Field and modelling studies were integrated
   in two hydro(geo)logically contrasting Irish catchments at less than
   Good status, to identify the main pathways delivering flow and nutrients
   to streams. The transport of phosphorus (P) via overland flow and
   interflow, and from small point sources, proved the key issues in the
   catchment underlain by poorly draining soils. Measures in such
   catchments need to focus on intercepting pathways and mitigating the
   discharges. In the freely draining karstified catchment, transport of
   nitrogen (N) and P via subsurface pathways were the key issues. Measures
   for N in these scenarios need to focus on best management practices of
   source loads, as interrupting the pathway is much more challenging,
   whereas measures for P must target managing inputs to groundwater, for
   example via sinking streams from poorly draining areas. Achieving
   successful WFD outcomes depends on having a site-specific,
   three-dimensional understanding of contaminant transfer pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Re-eutrophication in Lake Erie has led to new programs to reduce
   external phosphorus loads, and it is important to understand the
   interrelated dynamics of external and internal phosphorus loads. In
   addition to developing phosphorus load response curves for algal biomass
   in the western basin and hypoxia in the central basin, we used a
   two-dimensional (vertical-longitudinal) hydrodynamic and ecological
   model to show that both external and internal phosphorus loads were
   distributed homogeneously in the water column in Lake Erie's western
   basin. In the stratified central and eastern basins phosphorus released
   by organic matter decay and crustacean zooplankton excretion was
   concentrated in the upper water column, contributing 100-119\% of the
   phytoplankton phosphorus demand, while phosphorus released by
   dreissenids and from anoxic sediments was distributed primarily in the
   hypolimnion during the growing season. Simulated reductions in external
   phosphorus loads decreased individual phytoplankton groups most at times
   when they were normally most abundant, e.g., Microcystis decreased the
   most during September. Phosphorus was limiting over the simulation
   periods, but water temperature and light conditions also played critical
   roles in phytoplanlcton succession. While water column phosphorus
   responded quickly to external phosphorus reduction, pulses of phosphorus
   (riverine input or sediment resuspension) occurring immediately before
   the Microcystis bloom period could allow it to bloom despite long-term
   external phosphorus load reduction. Studies are warranted to assess the
   contribution of seasonal dynamics in phosphorus loading (including
   sediment resuspension) to Microcystis bloom development. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper reports a versatile and irreversible bonding method for
   poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and SU-8. The method is based on epoxide
   opening and dehydration reactions between surface-modified PDMS and
   SU-8. A PDMS replica is first activated via the low-cost lab equipment,
   i.e., the oxygen plasma cleaner or the corona treater. Then both SU-8
   and plasma-treated PDMS samples are functionalized using hydrolyzed
   (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES). Ultimately, the samples are
   simply brought into contact and heated to enable covalent bonding. The
   molecular coupling and chemical reactions behind the bonding occurring
   at the surfaces were characterized by water contact angle measurement
   and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The reliability of
   bonded PDMS-SU-8 samples was examined by using tensile strength and
   leakage tests, which revealed a bonding strength of over 1.4 MPa. The
   presented bonding method was also applied to create a metal-SU-8-PDMS
   hybrid device, which integrated SU-8 microfluidic structures and
   microelectrodes. This hybrid system was used for the effective trapping
   of microparticles on-chip, and the selective releasing and
   identification of predefined trapped microparticles. The hybrid
   fabrication approach presented here, based on the PDMS-SU-8 bonding,
   enables multifunctional integration in complex microfluidic devices.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the secrecy performance of multiuser
   dual-hop relay networks where a base station (BS) communicates with
   multiple legitimate users through the assistance of a trustful
   regenerative relay in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. In
   particular, the maximal ratio transmission scheme is exploited at the BS
   and a threshold-based multiuser scheduling scheme is employed over the
   legitimate users, while concerning the imperfect decoding at the
   regenerative relay. To evaluate the secrecy performance of the
   considered system, two practical situations are addressed based on the
   availability of eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI), i.e.,
   Scenario I, where the eavesdropper's CSI is not available at the relay,
   and Scenario II, where the eavesdropper's CSI is available at the relay.
   For both the scenarios, we further consider two eaves-dropping modes,
   i.e., colluding eavesdropping and non-colluding eavesdropping. For
   Scenario I, new exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions for the
   secrecy outage probability (SOP) are derived. For Scenario II, we derive
   new exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions for the ergodic secrecy
   rate (ESR). The asymptotic SOPs demonstrate that the secrecy diversity
   order is independent of the number of legitimate users NB and
   eavesdroppers NE, the number of antennas equipped at eavesdroppers AE,
   as well as the fading factor of the wiretap channel mE. Furthermore, we
   also determine the secrecy multiplexing gain and the power cost to
   explicitly quantify the impact of the legitimate channel and wiretap
   channel on the ESR. Our findings demonstrate that increasing the
   switching threshold, the number of antennas at the BS, and the number of
   legitimate users has a positive impact on secrecy performance.}},

Abstract = {{Irradiation-induced defects, such as dislocation loops, significantly
   affect the mechanical properties of structural alloys, altering slip and
   influencing creep and growth. As a consequence, the quantitative
   characterization of irradiation-influenced defect structures as a
   function of dose, thermal treatments and/or cold work is essential for
   models which predict changes in mechanical properties due to the
   accumulation of irradiation defects. Whole pattern diffraction line
   profile analysis (DLPA) is a modern tool for microstructure
   characterization based on first-principles physical models, well
   established for dislocation density measurements in plastically deformed
   materials. However, the DLPA procedures that have been tailored for
   deformed materials account for the strain anisotropy of hexagonal
   crystals with theoretical contrast factors calculated specifically for
   dislocation types generated by plasticity which, if directly applied to
   irradiated materials, will inherently introduce inaccuracies. In an
   effort to specifically address dislocation structures consisting of
   irradiation defects, a method was developed to calculate theoretical
   contrast factors for any general elliptically shaped dislocation loop.
   The values of the contrast factors are calculated and compiled in tables
   for six common elliptical < a >-type and < c + a >-type loops for ten
   hexagonal crystals, in order to provide a database for future DLPA work
   on irradiated materials. The use of the dislocation loop specific
   contrast factors is demonstrated on neutron-irradiated Zr-2.5Nb.}},

Abstract = {{This work focuses on the development of methods to measure the
   intralaminar fracture toughness of 1M7/8552 CFRP at extreme
   temperatures. The size effect law of scaled double-edge-notched (DEN)
   specimens is used to obtain the crack resistance curves associated with
   longitudinal failure of polymer composites. The compressive and tensile
   crack resistance curves are determined and compared to those measured at
   room temperature. Scanning electron microscopy is used to analyse the
   fracture surface of tensile DEN specimens as a means to understand the
   damage mechanisms involved and their dependence on temperature
   variations. It is shown that the methods proposed enable the measurement
   of the crack resistance curve under different environment conditions.
   The results obtained can be used in analytical models to evaluate the
   integrity of composite structures at extreme temperatures. (C) 2016

   lithological classification of individual points within LiDAR point
   clouds based on intensity and geometry information. Two example data
   sets were collected by static and mobile platforms in an oil sands pit
   mine and the MLA was trained to distinguish sandstone and mud-stone

Abstract = {{Toluene dioxygenase-catalysed (TDO) oxidation converts substituted
   phenol substrates into catechols, hydroquinones, and chiral
   cyclohexenone cis-diol products. The ratio between the isolated products
   varied widely even between similar substrates, e.g. o-cresol, m-cresol
   and p-cresol. These differences are caused by different binding
   interactions within the active site of TDO. This study provides insight
   into the binding interactions by molecular docking using AutoDock tools.
   The nature of binding of phenolic substrates was of major interest, in
   order to explain the observed regio- and stereo-selectiviy of product
   formation. The ellipse-shaped binding pocket of TDO consists of a polar
   and a hydrophobic region, limiting the possible substrate orientations.
   The phenolic hydroxyl group was preferentially hydrogen bonded with
   Gln-215 and His-311 in the active site. In some cases, a hydrogen bond
   was formed with other amino acids, e.g. Asp-219 and Met-220, instead.
   The position and type of the substituent on the phenol ring influences
   the formation of transient intermediates, and thus the nature and
   stability of the major isolated product Crown Copyright (C) 2016

   bandwidth of the proposed mixer is 6 GHz, covering 0.5-6.5 GHz with an

Abstract = {{An intermolecular potential energy surface and rovibrational transition
   frequencies are computed for CO2-C2H2. An interpolating moving least
   squares method is used to fit ab initio points at the explicitly

   is solved with a symmetry adapted Lanczos algorithm. The computed
   disrotatory and torsion vibrational levels of both CO2-C2H2 and CO2-C2D2
   differ from those obtained by experimentalists by less than 0.5 cm(-1).
   CO2-C2H2 has two equivalent minima with the monomers perpendicular to
   the inter-monomer axis. In contrast to many other Van der Waals dimers
   there is no disrotatory path that connects the minima. The tunnelling
   path follows the torsional coordinate over a high barrier and the
   splitting is therefore tiny. Using vibrational parent analysis we are
   able to fit and thus obtain rotational constants and centrifugal
   distortion constants. Calculated rotational constants differ from their
   experimental counterparts by less than 0.001 cm(-1). (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The infrared spectrum of the cross-shaped van der Waals complex CO2-CS2

   corresponding to the intermolecular torsion and CO2 bend modes, and
   their positions and rotational structure agree extremely well (<0.1
   cm(-1)) with calculations based on a recent ab initio intermolecular
   potential. The b-type torsional band is well-behaved, but the a-type CO2
   bending band is highly unusual, with large shifts between the subband
   origins for K-a = 0, 2, and 4. The shifts may be rationalized as due to
   tunnelling effects and K-a-dependent perturbations from other
   intermolecular modes. But even though they are well predicted by our
   calculations, there is no simple qualitative explanation. The predicted
   low-lying planar slipped parallel isomer of CO2-CS2 is not observed. (C)

Abstract = {{Many studies of friction stir welding have shown that periodicity of
   metal flow around the tool pin may result in the formation of periodic
   differences in microstructure and texture in the weld nugget area
   correlated with the weld pitch. The current work investigates the
   periodicity of magnesium weld microtexture in the nugget region and its
   association with material flow using optical and electron microscopy.
   Two welds created in AZ80 at different processing conditions are
   presented in detail, one illustrating periodic longitudinal texture
   change, and one showing for the first time that periodic variations in
   texture, grain size, or composition are not defining features of
   periodic nugget flow. While nugget texture is dominated by shear
   deformation, it was found here to be affected to a lesser degree by
   compaction of material behind the welding tool, which led to reduction
   in intensity of the shear texture fiber. The decreased tendency for
   magnesium based alloys to form periodic patterns as compared to aluminum
   based alloys is explained with reference to the shear textures. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is currently a promising technology
   that makes solar energy efficient and cost-effective to harness. In
   DSSC, metal-free dyes such as indoline-containing D149 and D205 have
   been proven to be potential alternatives for traditional metal organic
   dyes. In this work, a DFT/TDDFT characterization for D149 and D205 was
   carried out using different functionals, including B3LYP, MPW1K,
   CAM-B3LYP, and PBE0. Three different conformers for D149 and four
   different conformers for D205 were identified and calculated in a
   vacuum. The performance of different functionals on calculating the
   maximum absorbance of the dyes in a vacuum and five common solvents
   (acetonitrile, chloroform, ethanol, methanol, and THF) were examined and
   compared to determine the suitable computational setting for predicting
   properties of these two dyes. Furthermore, deprotonated D149 and D205 in
   solvents were also considered, and the highest occupied molecular
   orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were
   calculated, which elucidates the substitution effect on the rhodanine
   ring of D149 and D205 dyes on their efficiency. Finally, D149 and D205
   molecules were confirmed to be firmly anchored on ZnO surface by
   periodic DFT calculations. These results shed light on the design of
   new, highly efficient metal-free dyes.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of acetate on TiO2
   surfaces were investigated in H2O and D2O by ATR-FTIR and EPR
   Spectroscopy respectively. These studies were carried out in the dark
   and under UV(A) illumination to gain additional insights into the
   adsorption behaviour with the identification of paramagnetic species
   formed during the oxidation of acetate. Isotopic exchange during the
   adsorption of D2O on the TiO2 surface led to different interactions
   between the adsorbate and OD groups. At different pH levels, several
   surface complexes of acetate can be formed such as monodentates or
   bidentates. Under UV(A) irradiation of TiO2 aqueous suspensions, the
   formation of hydroxyl and methoxy radicals evidenced as the
   corresponding spin-adducts, was found to dominate in alkaline and acidic
   suspensions respectively. Two possible pathways for the oxidation of
   acetate have been suggested at different pH levels in solution in terms
   of the source of the spin adduct formed. These proposed pathways were
   found to be in good agreement with ATR-FTIR and EPR results. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The local solvation environment of uracil dissolved in the ionic liquid
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate has been studied using neutron
   diffraction techniques. At solvent:solute (ionic liquid:uracil) ratios
   of 3:1 and 2:1, little perturbation of the ion-ion correlations compared
   to those of the neat ionic liquid are observed. We find that solvation
   of the uracil is driven predominantly by the acetate anion of the
   solvent. While short distance correlations exist between uracil and the
   imidazolium cation, the geometry of these contacts suggest that they
   cannot be considered as hydrogen bonds, in contrast to other studies by
   Araffljo et al. (J. M. Araffljo, A. B. Pereiro, J. N. Canongia- Lopes,
   L. P. Rebelo, I. M. Marrucho, J. Phys. Chem. B 2013, 117, 4109-4120).
   Nevertheless, this combination of interactions of the solute with both
   the cation and anion components of the solvents helps explain the high
   solubility of the nucleobase in this media. In addition, favourable
   uracil-uracil contacts are observed, of similar magnitude to those
   between cation and uracil, and are also likely to aid dissolution.}},

Title = {{Towards an Ediacaran Time Scale: Problems, Protocols, and Prospects}},
Journal = {{EPISODES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{540-555}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Ediacaran Period follows the Cryogenian Period in the wake of a
   snowball Earth glaciation and precedes the Cambrian Period with its
   rising tide of animal radiation. It is also the longest among all
   stratigraphically defined geological periods, lasting 94 million years
   (635-541 Ma). Hence, a good Ediacaran time scale is essential, not only
   to elucidate geological time, but also to provide a temporal context for
   extreme climatic events and transformative evolutionary transitions.
   Ediacaran fossils are known from many sections and boreholes around the
   world, permitting ready age recognition and stratigraphic correlation of
   Ediacaran strata. However, the Ediacaran fossil record is colored by
   taphonomic biases that variously affect the preservation of the
   soft-bodied organisms that dominated Ediacaran marine ecosystems, and
   the Phanerozoic approach of defining stratigraphic boundaries using the
   first appearance datum (FAD) of widely distributed, rapidly evolving,
   easily recognizable, and readily preservable species would have limited
   success in the Ediacaran System. The subdivision of the Ediacaran System
   must therefore be founded on a holistic approach integrating
   biostratigraphic, chemostratigraphic, and geochronometric data for
   correlation. Series-level subdivision of the Ediacaran System is a
   challenging task, and alternative models subdividing the Ediacaran
   System into two or three series can be recognized. Resolving these
   alternatives critically depends on obtaining further data to constrain
   the age, duration, and global extent of the Shuram negative delta C-13
   excursion, to calibrate and correlate Ediacaran acanthomorph biozones,
   and to determine the temporal relationship among the Shuram excursion,
   the Gaskiers glaciation, and Ediacaran acanthomorph biozones.
   Stage-level subdivisions at the bottom and top of the Ediacaran System,
   however, are realistic goals in the near future, and we propose that the
   subdivision of the Ediacaran System should initially aim at the second
   Ediacaran stage (SES) and the terminal Ediacaran stage (TES) where
   stratigraphic information is relatively rich and consensus for
   stratigraphic correlation is emerging. Potential stratigraphic markers
   for the definition of the SES include the post-glacial radiation of
   eukaryotes as represented by the first appearance of acanthomorph
   acritarchs, the termination of the cap carbonate series, or the end of
   the negative delta C-13 excursion (EN1 = Ediacaran negative excursion 1)
   associated with the cap carbonate. Terminal Ediacaran strata are well
   dated and host several taxa of skeletal and tubular fossils that
   postdate the Shuram negative delta C-13 excursion (or its probable
   equivalent, EN3 = Ediacaran negative excursion 3) where their
   stratigraphic relationship can be determined; these biostratigraphic
   markers may be used to define the TES in a Phanerozoic fashion.
   Additional Ediacaran stages between the SES and TES can be envisioned.
   Through collaborative efforts in the Ediacaran community, we hope that
   the first Precambrian stage will be established in the near future to
   facilitate a better understanding of the geological aftermath of
   snowball Earth, the redox history of global oceans, the early evolution
   of multicellular life, and the evolutionary fuse of the Cambrian
   explosion.}},

Abstract = {{MATLAB Simulink is one of the leading tools for model-based software
   development in the automotive industry. One extension to Simulink is
   Stateflow, which allows the user to embed Statecharts as components in a
   Simulink model. These state machines contain nested states, an action
   language that describes events, guards, conditions, actions, and complex
   transitions. As Stateflow has become increasingly important in Simulink
   models for the automotive sector, we extend previous work on clone
   detection of Simulink models to Stateflow components. While Stateflow
   models are stored in the same file as the Simulink models that host
   them, the representations differ. Our approach incorporates a
   pretransformation that converts the Stateflow models into a form that
   allows us to use the SIMONE model clone detector to identify candidates
   and cluster them into classes. In addition, we push the results of the
   Stateflow clone detection back into the Simulink models, improving the
   accuracy of the clones found in the host Simulink models. We validated
   our approach on the MATLAB Simulink/Stateflow demo set. Our approach
   showed promising results on the identification of Stateflow clones in
   isolation, as well as integrated components of the Simulink models that
   are hosting them.}},

Title = {{Measurement of the scintillation time spectra and pulse-shape
   discrimination of low-energy beta and nuclear recoils in liquid argon
   with DEAP-1}},

Abstract = {{The DEAP-1 low-background liquid argon detector was used to measure
   scintillation pulse shapes of electron and nuclear recoil events and to
   demonstrate the feasibility of pulse-shape discrimination down to an
   electron-equivalent energy of 20 keV(ee).
   In the surface dataset using a triple-coincidence tag we found the
   fraction of,6 events that are misidentified as nuclear recoils to be <
   1.4 x 10(-7) (90\% C.L.) for energies between 43-86 keV(ee) and for a
   nuclear recoil acceptance of at least 90\%, with 4\% systematic
   uncertainty on the absolute energy scale. The discrimination measurement
   on surface was limited by nuclear recoils induced by cosmic-ray
   generated neutrons. This was improved by moving the detector to the
   SNOLAB underground laboratory, where the reduced background rate allowed
   the same measurement to be done with only a double-coincidence tag.
   The combined data set contains 1.23 x 10(8) events. One of those, in the
   underground data set, is in the nuclear-recoil region of interest.
   Taking into account the expected background of 0.48 events coming from
   random pileup, the resulting upper limit on the level of electronic
   recoil contamination is < 2.7 x 10(-8) (90\% C.L.) between 44-89 keV(ee)
   and for a nuclear recoil acceptance of at least 90\%, with 6\%
   systematic uncertainty on the absolute energy scale.
   We developed a general mathematical framework to describe
   pulse-shape-discrimination parameter distributions and used it to build
   an analytical model of the distributions observed in DEAP-1. Using this
   model, we project a misidentification fraction of approximately 10(-10)
   for an electron-equivalent energy threshold of 15 keVee for a detector
   with 8 PE/keV(ee) light yield. This reduction enables a search for spin
   independent scattering of WIMPs from 1000 kg of liquid argon with a
   WIMP-nucleon cross-section sensitivity of 10(-46) cm(2), assuming
   negligible contribution from nuclear recoil backgrounds. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The development of high voltage electrolytes is one of the key aspects
   for increasing both energy and power density of electrochemical double
   layer capacitors (EDLCs). The usage of blends of ionic liquids and
   organic solvents has been considered as a feasible strategy since these
   electrolytes combine high usable voltages and good transport properties
   at the same time. In this work, the ionic liquid
   1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis\{(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl\}imide
   ({[}Pyrr(14)]{[}TFSI]) was mixed with two nitrile-based organic
   solvents, namely butyronitrile and adiponitrile, and the resulting
   blends were investigated regarding their usage in electrochemical double
   layer capacitors. Both blends have a high electrochemical stability,
   which was confirmed by prolonged float tests at 3.2 V, as well as, good
   transport properties. In fact, the butyronitrile blend reaches a
   conductivity of 17.14 mS center dot cm(-1) and a viscosity of 2.46 mPa
   center dot s at 20 degrees C, which is better than the state-of-the-art

Abstract = {{Planar polymer light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) with an
   interelectrode gap size of 670 mu m and 495 pm have been activated by
   applying a fixed voltage bias of 20V at a temperature of 340 K to enable
   them to reach different terminal currents before being discharged under
   short-circuit conditions. These discharging, or dedoping currents have
   been monitored for an extended period during which they have decreased
   by five orders of magnitude. The total dedoping charge has been
   determined by integrating the time-dependent dedoping current, which
   allows for the calculation of the cell's doping level. The data suggest
   that some additional doping has occurred after the formation of the LEC
   junction. The overall level of doping, however, is not strongly affected
   by the large amount charges injected after junction formation. In fact,
   the total dedoping charge can be approximated as the amount of injected
   charge, up to the moment of junction formation. The total dedoping
   charge, however, is sensitive to the interelectrode gap size of the
   planar cells. The results demonstrate the feasibility of detecting the
   minute discharging current of a large planar LEC down to pA level. The
   ability to determine the dedoping charge and its dependence on various
   operational and device-related parameters provides additional tools to
   facilitate understanding of the complex doping and dedoping processes in
   a polymer LEC. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new hybrid phaseshift modulation technique which
   is able to provide soft switching for the entire operating conditions of

   In addition, the proposed technique can be applied to the general
   category of power circuit topologies for dc/dc converters, which use a
   full-bridge inverter in their power circuit. The proposed hybrid
   phase-shift modulation technique includes two distinct modulation
   strategies based on the operating condition of the converter. Thus, it
   has a variable structure that can optimize the performance for various
   operating conditions. The main advantages of the proposed technique are
   the achievement of soft-switching independent of the load condition, and
   optimized performance. Theoretical analysis and simulation/experimental
   results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed hybrid

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel method for transmission loss allocation in
   restructured power systems. It is based on circuit laws and the
   orthogonal projection theory. In this method, the current flow in each
   branch is divided into two components. The first one is due to the power
   transfer from generators to loads. The second component is due to the
   voltage differences between generators' buses. The later currents are
   called no-load or circulating currents. These two current components are
   computed by using the superposition principle. The contribution of each
   load and generator to power losses in each branch of the network is
   derived analytically. Hence, the share of each load or generator in the
   overall transmission network losses is estimated. Furthermore, the
   impact of bilateral and multilateral contracts is incorporated in the
   power loss allocation algorithm. The contribution of each contract to
   the total transmission system power loss is estimated accurately. The
   method also takes into account the time variation of loads and wind
   generation. The proposed method is applied to two test systems and
   compared to the prorate, game theory, and Z-bus approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the hydraulic performance of geosynthetic clay
   liner (GCL) overlapped seams subjected to nonuniform stresses due to a
   wrinkle in an overlying geomembrane. The performance when the GCL seam
   was parallel to and directly below a wrinkle depended on the width of
   the GCL seam relative to the deformed wrinkle. When both ends of the
   seam were confined under vertical stress from the deformed wrinkle,
   there was no evidence of preferential flow along the seam, and the
   magnitude of flow was slightly smaller than the case with just a single
   intact GCL panel beneath the wrinkle. Flow through the GCL seam when
   perpendicular to a wrinkle was mostly affected by the presence and
   distribution of supplemental bentonite. With no supplemental bentonite,
   flow was 370 times greater than that through an intact GCL panel beneath
   the wrinkle. Application of 400g/m of supplemental bentonite piled along
   the center of the seam decreased the flow by more than two orders of
   magnitude compared with having no supplemental bentonite.}},

Abstract = {{This work establishes the in vivo performance of modified calcium
   phosphate bone cements for vertebroplasty of spinal fractures using a
   lapine model. A non-modified calcium phosphate bone cement and
   collagen-calcium phosphate bone cements composites with enhanced
   mechanical properties, utilising either bovine collagen or collagen from
   a marine sponge, were compared to a commercial poly(methyl methacrylate)
   cement. Conical cement samples (8 mm height x 4 mm base diameter) were
   press-fit into distal femoral condyle defects in New Zealand White
   rabbits and assessed after 5 and 10 weeks. Bone apposition and
   tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity around cements were
   assessed. All implants were well tolerated, but bone apposition was
   higher on calcium phosphate bone cements than on poly(methyl
   methacrylate) cement. Incorporation of collagen showed no evidence of
   inflammatory or immune reactions. Presence of positive
   tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining within cracks formed in
   calcium phosphate bone cements suggested active osteoclasts were present
   within the implants and were actively remodelling within the cements.
   Bone growth was also observed within these cracks. These findings
   confirm the biological advantages of calcium phosphate bone cements over
   poly(methyl methacrylate) and, coupled with previous work on enhancement
   of mechanical properties through collagen incorporation, suggest
   collagen-calcium phosphate bone cement composite may offer an
   alternative to calcium phosphate bone cements in applications where low
   setting times and higher mechanical stability are important.}},

Title = {{Nonlinear response of bilayer graphene at terahertz frequencies}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{A density-matrix formalism within the length gauge is developed for the
   purpose of calculating the nonlinear response of intrinsic bilayer
   graphene at terahertz frequencies. Employing a tight-binding model, we
   find that the interplay between the interband and intraband dynamics
   leads to strong harmonic generation at moderate field amplitudes.
   Specifically, we find that at low temperature (10 K), the reflected
   field of undoped suspended bilayer graphene exhibits a third harmonic
   amplitude that is 0.06\% of the fundamental of the incident field, which
   corresponds to 30\% of the fundamental in the reflected field for an
   incident 1-THz single-cycle pulse with a field amplitude of 1.5 kV/cm.
   More interestingly, we find that as the central frequency of the
   incident field is increased, the third harmonic amplitude also
   increases; reaching a maximum of 53\% of the fundamental in the
   reflected field (0.11\% of the fundamental in the incident field) for an
   incident frequency of 2 THz and amplitude of 2.5 kV/cm.}},

Abstract = {{Ketone bodies are the most energy-efficient fuel and yield more ATP per
   mole of substrate than pyruvate and increase the free energy released
   from ATP hydrolysis. Elevation of circulating ketones via high-fat, low
   carbohydrate diets has been used for the treatment of drug-refractory
   epilepsy and for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's
   disease. Ketones may also be beneficial for muscle and brain in times of
   stress, such as endurance exercise. The challenge has been to raise
   circulating ketone levels by using a palatable diet without altering
   lipid levels. We found that blood ketone levels can be increased and
   cholesterol and triglycerides decreased by feeding rats a novel ketone
   ester diet: chow that is supplemented with (R)-3-hydroxybutyl
   (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate as 30\% of calories. For 5 d, rats on the ketone
   diet ran 32\% further on a treadmill than did control rats that ate an
   isocaloric diet that was supplemented with either corn starch or palm
   oil (P < 0.05). Ketone-fed rats completed an 8-arm radial maze test 38\%
   faster than did those on the other diets, making more correct decisions
   before making a mistake (P < 0.05). Isolated, perfused hearts from rats
   that were fed the ketone diet had greater free energy available from ATP
   hydrolysis during increased work than did hearts from rats on the other
   diets as shown by using {[}P-31]-NMR spectroscopy. The novel ketone
   diet, therefore, improved physical performance and cognitive function in
   rats, and its energy-sparing properties suggest that it may help to
   treat a range of human conditions with metabolic abnormalities.-Murray,

Abstract = {{Experiments conducted to evaluate the partitioning coefficient from
   aqueous solution into and out of high-density polyethylene geomembrane,
   as well as the diffusion coefficient through the geomembrane are
   reported. The best estimate partitioning coefficient (S-gf) is about 150
   000 with an upper-bound estimate of 325 000. The best estimate diffusion
   coefficient (D-g) is 1.0 x 10(-14) m(2)/s, with lower and upper bounds
   of 0.5 x 10(-14) and 5 x 10(-14), respectively. Using the diffusive
   properties obtained from the above experiments, the potential impacts on
   an aquifer of the migration of polychlorinated biphenyls and chloride
   are compared for a composite liner in a hypothetical municipal solid
   waste landfill. It is shown that, with good construction quality
   assurance to limit the number of holes and length of covered wrinkles to
   acceptably low values, a modern composite liner limited the impact of
   polychlorinated biphenyls on the aquifer concentration to well below
   regulatory limits.}},

Abstract = {{Partitioning and diffusion experiments performed on bisphenol A (BPA)
   and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane are reported. The tests
   indicate no measurable partitioning to the geomembrane and an estimated
   upper bound permeation coefficient is 3 x 10(-15) m(2)/s. This low value
   of permeation coefficient suggests that an HDPE geomembrane will be a
   very effective diffusive barrier for BPA for the conditions examined.
   Partitioning tests on BPA in a mixture with 12 other phenolic compounds
   did not show any measurable change in partitioning of BPA to the
   geomembrane due to the presence of the other compounds. The partitioning
   coefficients for phenolic compounds examined range from 0.61 for
   2-methylphenol to 31 for 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol and the diffusion
   coefficients ranged from 9.3 x 10(-15) m(2)/s for

Abstract = {{We present a disc-halo N-body model of the low surface brightness galaxy
   UGC 628, one of the few systems that harbours a `slow' bar with a ratio
   of corotation radius to bar length of R  R-c/a(b) similar to 2. We
   select our initial conditions using SDSS DR10 photometry, a physically
   motivated radially variable mass-to-light ratio profile, and rotation
   curve data from the literature. A global bar instability grows in our
   submaximal disc model, and the disc morphology and dynamics agree
   broadly with the photometry and kinematics of UGC 628 at times between
   peak bar strength and the onset of buckling. Prior to bar formation, the
   disc and halo contribute roughly equally to the potential in the
   galaxy's inner region, giving the disc enough self-gravity for bar modes
   to grow. After bar formation, there is significant mass redistribution,
   creating a baryon-dominated inner and dark matter-dominated outer disc.
   This implies that, unlike most other low surface brightness galaxies,
   UGC 628 is not dark matter dominated everywhere. Our model nonetheless
   implies that UGC 628 falls on the same relationship between dark matter
   fraction and rotation velocity found for high surface brightness
   galaxies, and lends credence to the argument that the disc mass fraction
   measured at the location where its contribution to the potential peaks
   is not a reliable indicator of its dynamical importance at all radii.}},

Title = {{Different roles of ionic liquids in lithium batteries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{334}},
Pages = {{221-239}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Ionic liquids are often named solvents of the future because of
   flexibility in design. This statement has given credence that ionic
   liquids should simply replace the problematic electrolytes of lithium
   batteries. As a result, the promising potentials of ionic liquids in
   electrochemical systems are somehow obscured by inappropriate
   expectations. We summarize recent advancements in this field,
   especially, ionic liquids as standalone electrolytes, additives,
   plasticizers in gel polymer electrolytes, and binders; and attempt to
   shed light on the future pathway of this area of research. Ionic liquids
   are not dilute media to serve as pure solvents in electrochemical
   systems where mobility of ions is the priority; instead, they can
   contribute to the ionic conductivity of various components in a battery
   system. Owing to the enormous possibilities of ionic liquids, it is not
   merely a matter of choice. Ionic liquids can be used to design novel
   types of electrolytes for a new generation of lithium batteries. A
   promising possibility, which is still at a very early stage, is
   supercooled ionic liquid crystals for fast ion diffusion through the
   guided channels of a liquid-like medium. This, of course, will be a
   breakthrough in the realm of electrochemistry, far beyond lithium
   battery field, when materialized. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Biodegradation and detoxification of naphthenic acids in oil sands
   process affected waters}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{572}},
Pages = {{273-279}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{After oil sands process affected water (OSPW) was treated in a
   continuous flow biofilm reactor, about 40\% of the organic compounds in
   the acid extractable fraction (AEF) including naphthenic acids (NAs)
   were degraded resulting in a reduction of 73\% in the Microtox acute
   toxicity and of 22\% in the yeast estrogenic assay. Using effect
   directed analysis, treated and untreated OSPW were fractionated by solid
   phase extraction and the fractions with the largest decrease in toxicity
   and estrogenicity were selected for analysis by electrospray ionization
   combined with linear ion trap and a high-resolution Orbitrap mass
   spectrometer (negative ion mode). The aim of this study was to determine
   whether compositional changes between the untreated and treated
   fractions provide insight related to biodegradation and detoxification
   of NAs. The O2S, O3S and O4S compounds were either not major
   contributors of toxicity or estrogenicity or the more toxic or
   estrogenic ones were biodegraded. The O3- and O4-NAs seem to be more
   readily metabolized than O2NAs and their degradation would contribute to
   detoxification. The decrease in acute toxicity may be associated with
   the degradation of C12 and C13 bicyclic and C12-C14 tricyclic NAs while
   the decrease in estrogenicity may be linked to the degradation of C16
   O2-NAs with double bond equivalents (DBE) = 5 and 6, C16 and 17 O2-NAs
   with DBE = 7, and C19-O2-NAs with DBE = 8. The residual acute toxicity
   may be caused by recalcitrant components and/or degradation products
   such as the O2 bicyclic and tricyclic NAs, particularly the C14 and C15
   bicyclic and C14-C16 tricyclic NAs as well as the polycyclic aromatic
   NAs (DBE = 5 compounds). The decrease in estrogenicity may be linked to
   the degradation of the O3 and O4 oxidized NAs while much of the residual
   estrogenicity may be due to the recalcitrant polycyclic aromatic O2NAs.
   Hence, treatment to further detoxify OSPW should target these compounds.

Abstract = {{The accuracy of surface measurement determines the manufacturing quality
   of membrane mirrors. Thus, an efficient and accurate measuring method is
   critical in membrane mirror fabrication. This paper formulates this
   measurement issue as a surface reconstruction problem and employs
   two-stage trained Zernike polynomials as an inline measuring tool to
   solve the optical surface measurement problem in the membrane mirror
   manufacturing process. First, all terms of the Zernike polynomial are
   generated and projected to a non-circular region as the candidate model
   pool. The training data are calculated according to the measured values
   of distance sensors and the geometrical relationship between the ideal
   surface and the installed sensors. Then the terms are selected by
   minimizing the cost function each time successively. To avoid the
   problem of ill-conditioned matrix inversion by the least squares method,
   the coefficient of each model term is achieved by modified elitist
   teaching-learning-based optimization. Subsequently, the measurement
   precision is further improved by a second stage of model refinement.
   Finally, every point on the membrane surface can be measured according
   to this model, providing more the subtle feedback information needed for
   the precise control of membrane mirror fabrication. Experimental results
   confirm that the proposed method is effective in a membrane mirror
   manufacturing system driven by negative pressure, and the measurement
   accuracy can achieve 15 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of the density of a polyisocyanurate (PIR)
   foam core on the behavior of axially loaded sandwich panels with glass
   fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) skins are examined, for different panel
   heights. Thirty-six test specimens with a cross-sectional foam core area
   of 100 x 50 mm(2) and symmetrical 100 mm wide GFRP skins were fabricated
   with heights of 750, 1000, 1250, and 1500 mm to examine various
   slenderness ratios (kL(e)/r). Three PIR foam core materials with
   densities of 32, 64 and 96 kg/m(3) were used. An out-of-straightness
   assessment was first conducted to ensure that eccentricities were within
   acceptable limits. All samples were tested to failure in axial
   compression with pinned end conditions. It was shown that doubling and
   tripling the core density led to increases in peak load of 71 and 170\%,
   respectively, due to the enhanced composite action and reduced shear
   deformations. On the other hand, slenderness had insignificant impact on
   peak loads, contrary to what one would expect from Euler's theory. The
   reason being the variety of governing failure modes. Columns with low
   (kL(e)/r) of 22-25 failed largely due to localized single skin buckling,
   while those with high (kL(e)/r) of 51-61 failed primarily by global
   buckling followed by secondary core shear failure with skin debonding.
   Columns with intermediate (kL(e)/r) experienced a combination of
   localized and global failure modes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Bond durability of basalt-fiber-reinforced-polymer (BFRP) bars embedded
   in concrete in aggressive environments}},

Abstract = {{Recently, basalt-fiber-reinforced-polymer (BFRP) bars have emerged as a
   promising alternative to glass-fiber-reinforced-polymer (GFRP) bars. So
   far, however, BFRP bars have not been incorporated into design standards
   and specifications. This is due to limited studies and lack of knowledge
   on the performance of the bars in concrete, in particular, their bond
   durability when exposed to aggressive environments. This paper presents
   some results of an extensive research program investigating the bond
   durability behaviors of BFRP bars in concrete structures and the
   long-term bond-strength-retention predications of the BFRP bars on the
   basis of short-term tests results. This research included testing
   deformed BFRP bars measuring 12 mm in diameter. Pullout specimens were
   tested with direct tensile loading after being exposed to an alkaline
   solution (pH 12.9) for 1.5, 3, and 6 months at temperatures of 40
   degrees C, 50 degrees C, and 60 degrees C. This paper investigated the
   effects of alkaline environment, exposure periods, and elevated
   temperatures on bond strength as well as the degradation mechanism and
   mode of failure of the BFRP-reinforced specimens. In addition, optical
   microscopy and scanning electronic microscopy were used to investigate
   the degradation of BFRP bars tested. The test results indicate an
   initial increase in the bond strength of the conditioned specimens as
   the temperature increased compared to their unconditioned specimens.
   After 1.5 months of exposure, the specimens conditioned at 50 degrees C
   and 60 degrees C, respectively, had bond-strength increases of 25\% and
   26\%, while the specimens conditioned at 40 degrees C exhibited no
   noticeable changes (a minor decrease of 4.3\%). Nevertheless, the bond
   strength of the conditioned specimens deteriorated during immersion. The
   highest bond strength reductions occurred in the conditioned specimens
   after 6 months of exposure at 40 degrees C (a 16\% loss), followed by
   specimens conditioned at 50 degrees C (7\% loss) and 60 degrees C (5\%
   loss) compared to their counterparts at 1.5 months. Lastly, the
   long-term bond-strength-retention predications of the BFRP bars after 50
   years of service life in dry, moist, and moisture-saturated environments
   with mean annual temperatures between 5 degrees C and 35 degrees C
   ranged from 71\% to 92\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical resistance heating (ERH) experiments were performed in a
   two-dimensional water-saturated porous medium comprising an electrically
   conductive, low-permeability clay lens embedded within a less
   electrically conductive, higher permeability silica sand. These were
   compared to experiments performed in homogeneous silica sand. All
   experiments were performed in the absence of a non-aqueous phase liquid
   (NAPL) or dissolved volatile organic compound (VOC). Temperature
   monitoring showed preferential heating in the clay lens and higher
   overall heating rates throughout the test cell compared to the
   homogeneous case. Gas production was localized around the sand-clay
   interface due to high temperature and low capillary displacement
   pressure. Above the clay lens, unexpected temperature plateaus were
   observed, similar to those observed in previous experiments during
   NAPL-water co-boiling. A conceptual model based on the consumption of
   thermal energy as latent heat of vaporization in the highly localized
   heating and gas production region adjacent to the clay lens is proposed
   to explain the temperature plateaus. Supporting data is drawn from
   images of the gas phase and electric current measurements. These results
   show that the use of co-boiling plateaus as an indicator of NAPL-water
   co-boiling could be misleading during applications of ERH at sites
   containing electrically conductive, low-permeability clay lenses
   embedded within less electrically conductive, higher-permeability sands.}},

Abstract = {{A point-of-Care (POC) pCO(2) device is a small electrochemical sensor
   for determining the partial pressure of dissolved carbon dioxide in
   blood samples from patients. A mathematical model is developed to
   predict the voltage response in a pCO(2) sensor when it is subjected to
   different CO2 concentrations in a calibration fluid and in blood samples
   or control fluids. The model consists of partial differential equation
   (PDE) material balances for species in the membrane and electrolyte and
   an algebraic equation relating surface concentrations to voltage. The
   model considers diffusion of species due to concentration gradients in
   vertical and radial directions and also reactions in the electrolyte and
   at the Au electrode. Influential model parameters are identified using
   estimability analysis and two parameters are fitted using industrial
   data. The model provides reliable predictions of the dynamic sensor
   voltage response. Sensor design parameters are varied to study the
   influence of the electrolyte concentration and sensor geometry on the
   voltage response, revealing that the most influential parameters are the
   amount of water in the electrolyte during the sensor operation and the
   buffer concentration in the electrolyte formulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Present work examines numerically the asymmetric behavior of
   hydrogen/air flame in a micro-channel subjected to a non-uniform wall
   temperature distribution. A high resolution (with cell size of 25 mu m x
   25 mu m) of two-dimensional transient Navier Stokes simulation is
   conducted in the low-Mach number formulation using detailed chemistry
   evolving 9 chemical species and 21 elementary reactions. Firstly,
   effects of hydrodynamic and diffusive-thermal instabilities are studied
   by performing the computations for different Lewis numbers. Then, the
   effects of preferential diffusion of heat and mass transfer on the
   asymmetric behavior of the hydrogen flame are analyzed for different
   inlet velocities and equivalence ratios. Results show that for the
   flames in micro-channels, interactions between thermal diffusion and
   molecular diffusion play major role in evolution of a symmetric flame
   into an asymmetric one. Furthermore, the role of Darrieus Landau
   instability found to be minor. It is also found that in symmetric
   flames, the Lewis number decreases behind the flame front. This is
   related to the curvature of flame which leads to the inclination of
   thermal and mass fluxes. The mass diffusion vectors point toward the
   walls and the thermal diffusion vectors point toward the centerline.
   Asymmetric flame is observed when the length of flame front is about
   1.1-1.15 times of the channel width. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd

Title = {{A generalized fuzzy linguistic model for predicting component

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{158}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by environmental protection concerns, monitoring the flue gas
   of thermal power plant is now often mandatory due to the need to ensure
   that emission levels stay within safe limits. Optical based gas sensing
   systems are increasingly employed for this purpose, with regression
   techniques used to relate gas optical absorption spectra to the
   concentrations of specific gas components of interest (NO chi, SO2
   etc.). Accurately predicting gas concentrations from absorption spectra
   remains a challenging problem due to the presence of nonlinearities in
   the relationships and the high-dimensional and correlated nature of the
   spectral data. This article proposes a generalized fuzzy linguistic
   model (GFLM) to address this challenge. The GFLM is made up of a series
   of ``If-Then{''} fuzzy rules. The absorption spectra are input variables
   in the rule antecedent. The rule consequent is a general nonlinear
   polynomial function of the absorption spectra. Model parameters are
   estimated using least squares and gradient descent optimization
   algorithms. The performance of GFLM is compared with other traditional
   prediction models, such as partial least squares, support vector
   machines, multilayer perceptron neural networks and radial basis
   function networks, for two real flue gas spectral datasets: one from a
   coal-fired power plant and one from a gas fired power plant. The
   experimental results show that the generalized fuzzy linguistic model
   has good predictive ability, and is competitive with alternative
   approaches, while having the added advantage of providing an
   interpretable model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is projected that the electric vehicle will become a dominant method
   of transportation within future road infrastructure. Moreover, the
   electric vehicle is expected to form an additional role in power systems
   in terms of electrical storage and load balancing. This paper considers
   the latter role of the electric vehicle and its impact on the
   steady-state stability of power systems, particularly in the context of
   large-scale electric vehicle integration. The paper establishes a model
   framework which examines four major issues: electric vehicle capacity
   forecasting; optimization of an object function; electric vehicle
   station siting and sizing; and steady-state stability. A numerical study
   has been included which uses projected United Kingdom 2020 power system
   data with results which indicate that the electric vehicle capacity
   forecasting model proposed in this paper is effective to describe
   electric vehicle charging and discharging profiles. The proposed model
   is used to establish criteria for electric vehicle station siting and
   sizing and to determine steady-state stability using a real model of a
   small-scale city power system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A nonlinear pre-distorter (NLPD) at the transmitter, and a
   maximum-a-posteriori probability (MAP) detector, time-domain Volterra
   nonlinear equalizer (VNLE), or sparse-VNLE at the receiver are compared
   for compensation of the pattern-dependent distortion that can occur in
   high baud rate transmitters and receivers. Experimental results are
   presented for a 1.206-Tb/s dual-polarization 16-ary
   quadrature-amplitude-modulation (16-QAM) superchannel signal with three
   subcarriers. The NLPD with iterative calculation of the pre-distortion
   provides the best performance in back-to-back systems and transmission
   systems followed by the MAP detector, VNLE, and sparse-VNLE. At the FEC
   threshold of 1.9 x 10(-2), the NLPD provides an increase in the
   transmission distance of 300 km compared with the sparse-VNLE, VNLE, and
   MAP detector. For transmission over 1500 km of SMF, the VNLE and MAP
   detector exhibit additional optical signal-to-noise ratio margins of
   0.16 and 0.47 dB relative to the sparse-VNLE. Compared with the VNLE,
   the sparse-VNLE exhibits a 55\% reduction in number of kernel
   coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explored a new approach to prepare phase change microcapsules
   using carbon-based particles via Pickering emulsions for energy storage
   applications. Rice-husk-char, a by-product in biofuel production,
   containing 53.58 wt\% of carbon was used as a model carbon-based
   material to encapsulate hexadecane. As a model phase change material,
   hexadecane was emulsified in aqueous suspensions of rice-husk char
   nanoparticles. Water soluble polymers poly(diallyldimethyl-ammonium
   chloride) and poly(sodium styrene sulfonate) were used to fix the
   rice-husk-char nanoparticles on the emulsion droplets through
   layer-by-layer assembly to enhance the structural stability of the
   microcapsules. The microcapsules formed are composed of a thin shell
   encompassing a large core consisting of hexadecane. Thermal
   gravimetrical and differential scanning calorimeter analyses showed the
   phase change enthalpy of 80.9 kJ kg(-1) or 120.0 MJ m(-3). Design
   criteria of phase change microcapsules and preparation considerations
   were discussed in terms of desired applications. This work demonstrated
   possible utilisations of biomass originated carbon-based material for
   thermal energy recovery and storage applications, which can be a new
   route of carbon capture and utilisation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Worldwide, loess-paleosol sequences are archives of terrestrial
   Quaternary paleoenvironment data. The Rulo site is a newly described
   site in the Palouse loess of southeastern Washington State, USA. The
   site reveals a 19 m thick deposit of loess and flood sediment,
   preserving a total of 30 m of reconstructed stratigraphic section. Five
   unconformity-bound sequences of sediment are exposed at the site, the
   lowest two of which have yielded fossil remains, including the first
   reported occurrence of flat-headed peccary (Platygonus compressus) in
   northwestern North America. The unconformities, two diamicts bearing
   extrabasinal clasts, and a number of clastic dikes provide evidence for
   pre-Wisconsin glacial outburst floods in southeastern Washington. More
   than a dozen paleosols are preserved at the site. These soils are
   relatively unweathered and therefore primarily record periods of slow
   sedimentation accumulation in the Palouse, rather than changes in
   weathering rates. A paleosol near the base of the sequence is unusually
   weathered for Palouse paleosols, and records a period of increased
   weathering during the Middle Pleistocene. All units above the sand are
   normal paleomagnetic polarity; additional age control is provided by a
   tephra in the upper third of the sequence that matches a ca. 220 ka
   tephra from Newberry Volcano, and by stratigraphic correlation of later
   units to other sites in the Palouse. The Rulo site adds to the record of
   Irvingtonian fauna in North America, and supports accumulating evidence
   for pre-Late Wisconsin glacial outburst floods in the Pacific Northwest.

Abstract = {{A search for Pauli-exclusion-principle-violating K electron transitions
   was performed using 89.5 kg-d of data collected with a p-type point
   contact high-purity germanium detector operated at the Kimballton
   Underground Research Facility. A lower limit on the transition lifetime
   of s at 90\% C.L. was set by looking for a peak at 10.6 keV resulting
   from the X-ray and Auger electrons present following the transition. A
   similar analysis was done to look for the decay of atomic K-shell
   electrons into neutrinos, resulting in a lower limit of s at 90\% C.L.
   It is estimated that the Majorana Demonstrator, a 44 kg array of p-type
   point contact detectors that will search for the neutrinoless
   double-beta decay of Ge, could improve upon these exclusion limits by an
   order of magnitude after three years of operation.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, we explored the dynamics of a dilute suspension of rigid
   dumbbells as a model for polymeric liquids in large-amplitude
   oscillatory shear (LAOS) flow. We derived the expression for the polymer
   orientation distribution, and then we decomposed this function into its
   first five harmonics (the zeroth, first, second, third and fourth
   harmonics). In this work, we separate each harmonic into its components
   in-phase and out-of-phase with cos nut, and then use three-dimensional
   imaging to investigate complex polymer motion in LAOS. Our analysis
   focuses on the nonlinear viscoelastic regime, specifically, where both
   lambda omega and lambda gamma(0) are unity. We learn that harmonic
   components, in-phase and out-of-phase with cosnwt, contribute to
   orientation differently, and that out-of-phase components tend to give
   more probable orientation away from the flow direction. We also find
   that some orientation contributions are caused by interferences between
   complex components, some constructive and some destructive. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The removal of a xenobiotic (4-chlorophenol) from contaminated water was
   investigated in a simulated continuous two-phase partitioning bioreactor
   (C-TPPB), fitted with coiled tubing comprised of a specifically-selected
   extruded polymer, Hytrel 8206. Wastewater flowed inside the tubing, the
   pollutant diffused through the tubing wall, and was removed in the
   aqueous bioreactor phase at typical biological removal rates in the
   C-ITPB simulated by varying aqueous phase throughput to the reactor.
   Operating over a range of influent substrate concentrations,(500-1500 mg
   L-1) and hydraulic retention times in the tubing (4-8 h), overall mass
   transfer coefficients were 1.7-3.5 x 10(-7) m s(-1), with the highest
   value corresponding to the highest tubing flow rate. Corresponding mass
   transfer rates are of the same order as biological removal rates, and
   thus do not limit the removal process. The C-TPPB showed good
   performance over all organic and hydraulic loading ranges, with removal
   efficiencies of 4CP in the tubing wastewater stream always >= 96\%.
   Additionally, the presence of the Hytrel tubing was able to buffer
   increases in organic loading to the hybrid system, enhancing overall
   process stability. Biological testing of the C-TPPB confirmed the
   abiotic test results demonstrating even higher 4-chlorophenol removal
   efficiency (similar to 99\%) in the tubing stream. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, fibre optic sensors (FOS) were used to investigate the
   interfacial stress-strain behaviour of bonded-in basalt fibre reinforced
   polymer (BFRP) rods loaded into glulam members. Pull-out tests were
   conducted to examine the effect of bonded length and load-to-grain
   direction on the distribution of stress at the BFRP rod/adhesive zone.
   It was observed that the stress concentration at the loaded end of the
   BFRP rod of the samples was significantly the highest while the unloaded
   end showed the lowest. Increasing the bonded length at the same loading
   configuration resulted in a decrease in stress concentration at the
   loaded end. The stress concentration at the loaded end of the
   perpendicular to the grain samples was relatively higher than that of
   the corresponding parallel to the grain samples. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{This is the first study to examine the formulation (selection of ionic
   and nonionic surfactants and their concentrations) and processing
   conditions (ultrasonication time and amplitude, and selection of
   solvent) to make dense suspensions (10 and 30\% (w/v)) of
   medium-chain-length poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) (mcl-PHA) with particles
   less than 300 nm. A two-stage emulsification-solvent evaporation process
   was used. Previous studies made suspensions at much lower solids content
   (up to 0.4\% (w/v)). The dispersed phase was mcl-PHA initially dissolved
   in methylene chloride, while the continuous phase was water containing
   one or more surfactants. Water miscible solvents, such as acetone and
   tetrahydrofuran, could not make dense suspensions of PHA nanoparticles,
   while those with low water solubility were effective. Among the ionic
   surfactants, the anionic, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and the
   cationic, dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide, produced the smallest
   particle sizes (both similar to 100 nm). Nanoparticles were more stable
   when SDS was combined with any of the non-ionic surfactants tested. The
   zeta potential of nanoparticles stabilized with SDS and polyoxyethylene
   octyl phenyl ether (Triton X-100) or polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan
   monooleate (Tween 80) increased slightly over 30 days, indicating that
   they may be more effective than the other non-ionic surfactants
   stabilizers where a decrease was observed. Using the same surfactant
   formulation, similar size mcl-PHA stable nanoparticle suspensions were
   produced using either an ultrasonic probe or a more scalable high-shear
   microfluidic device. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   technique. The technique is a generalization of the standard
   perturbation based techniques which provides fast transient performance
   of the closed-loop system to the optimum equilibrium of a measured cost
   function. Under the assumption that the equations describing the
   dynamics of the nonlinear system and the cost function to be minimized
   are unknown, it is shown that, for a class of minimum-phase nonlinear
   system with a cost function of relative degree one, the closed-loop ESC
   can practically stabilize the unknown equilibrium optimum. The
   stabilization result provides an alternative approach to output feedback
   control of nonlinear systems. The effectiveness of the proposed approach

Abstract = {{Most research on natural fiber composites has been primarily conducted
   on randomly-oriented fibers. This study is focused on the short-and
   long-term performances of flax fiber-reinforced polymer (Flax-FRP) made
   from continuous unidirectional fiber mats, and compares it to Glass-FRP
   composite. The study looked into the effect of number of layers on
   properties, comparing wet layup (WL) to vacuum bag (VB) molding, and
   aging in a 3.5\% salt solution for up to 365 days at 23, 40, and 55
   degrees C. Results show that Flax-FRP has a tensile strength and modulus
   of one third the values of Glass-FRP. Using the VB process, Flax-FRP
   showed a strength and modulus 18 and 36\% higher, respectively, than WL
   specimens. As the number of layers increased from one to five, the
   strength and modulus also increased but stabilized at three layers.
   After 365 days of conditioning at 23, 40, and 55 degrees C, WL specimens
   showed a strength retention of 81, 73, and 69\%, respectively. Using the
   Arrhenius relationship, it was estimated that both WL and VB Flax-FRP
   would retain 60\% of their tensile strength after 100 years of saltwater
   exposure at an annual mean temperature of 10 degrees C. (C) 2015 Society

Abstract = {{The application of specialized pulsed-laser techniques has led to a
   vastly improved understanding of the kinetics of aqueous phase solution
   radical polymerization of water-soluble monomers. Propagation rate
   coefficients vary significantly with monomer concentration, an effect
   unique to the aqueous environment. In addition, the formation and
   reaction of mid-chain radicals affects polymerization rates, and thus
   polymer molar masses, in acrylamide and acrylic acid systems. This
   perspective provides an overview of these mechanistic peculiarities,
   which have been captured in kinetic models developed to represent the
   homopolymerizations of N-vinyl pyrrolidone, N-vinyl formamide,
   methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, and acrylamide over a wide range of
   conditions. The batch studies demonstrate the importance of these
   effects in aqueous polymerization and the validity of the rate
   coefficients taken from the independent kinetic studies.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate non-coherent detection of M-ary orthogonal signaling in a
   denoise-and-forward two-way relay scheme in fast fading, as well as
   block fading channels. We first design the maximum likelihood, as well
   as maximum a-posteriori detectors, and then propose a simple suboptimal
   version for this digital network coding system in Rayleigh fast fading
   environment. We find exact expression of bit error rate for this
   suboptimal detector. Interestingly, this suboptimal detector performs
   only less than 0.25 dB away from optimum, i.e., this expression is a
   tight upper bound for the performance of the optimal one. Moreover, we
   derive the optimal detector for the case where the channel amplitudes
   are known at the relay. To make this detector practical, we propose
   efficient estimators for the channel amplitudes at the relay for block
   fading environments. Finally, our simulations reveal the effectiveness
   of the proposed methods compared with the state-of-the-art method.}},

Abstract = {{Ernietta plateauensis Pflug, 1966 is the type species of the
   Erniettomorpha, an extinct clade of Ediacaran life. It was likely a
   gregarious, partially infaunal organism. Despite its ecological and
   taxonomic significance, there has not been an in-depth systematic
   description in the literature since the original description fell out of
   use. A newly discovered field site on Farm Aar in southern Namibia has
   yielded dozens of specimens buried in original life position. Mudstone
   and sandstone features associated with the fossils indicate that
   organisms were buried while still exposed to the water column rather
   than deposited in a flow event. Ernietta plateauensis was a sac-shaped
   erniettomorph with a body wall constructed from a double layer of tubes.
   It possessed an equatorial seam lying perpendicular to the tubes. The
   body is asymmetrical on either side of this seam. The tubes change
   direction along the body length and appear to be constricted together in
   the dorsal part of the organism.}},

Abstract = {{Amine transaminases offer an environmentally sustainable synthesis route
   for the production of pure chiral amines. However, their catalytic
   efficiency toward bulky ketone substrates is greatly limited by steric
   hindrance and therefore presents a great challenge for industrial
   synthetic applications. We hereby report an example of rational
   transaminase enzyme design to help alleviate these challenges. Starting
   from the Vibrio fluvialis amine transaminase that has no detectable
   catalytic activity toward the bulky aromatic ketone 2-acetylbiphenyl, we
   employed a rational design strategy combining in silico and in vitro
   studies to engineer the transaminase enzyme with a minimal number of
   mutations, achieving an high catalytic activity and high
   enantioselectivity. We found that, by introducing two mutations
   W57G/R415A, detectable enzyme activity was achieved. The rationally
   designed variant, W57F/R88H/V153S/K163F/1259M/R415A/V422A, showed an
   improvement in reaction rate by more than 1716-fold toward the bulky
   ketone under study, producing the corresponding enantiomeric pure
   (S)-amine (enantiomeric excess (ee) value of >99\%).}},

Abstract = {{Metal-exchanged CHA-type (SAPO-34 and SSZ-13) zeolites are promising
   catalysts for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx by NH3.
   However, an understanding of the process at the molecular level is still
   limited, which hinders the identification of its mechanism and the
   design of more efficient zeolite catalysts. In this work, modeling the
   reaction over Cu-SAPO-34, a periodic density functional theory (DFT)
   study of NH3-SCR was performed using the hybrid functional (HSE06) with
   the consideration of van der Waals (vdW) interactions. A mechanism with
   a low N-N coupling barrier is proposed to account for the activation of
   NO. The redox cycle of Cu2+ and Cu+, which is crucial for the SCR
   process, is identified with detailed analyses. In addition, the
   decomposition of NH2NO is shown to readily occur on the Bronsted acid
   site by a hydrogen push-pull mechanism, confirming the collective
   efforts of Bronsted acid and Lewis acid (Cu2+) sites. The special
   electronic and structural properties of Cu-SAPO-34 are demonstrated to
   play an essential role in the reaction, which may have general
   implications on the understanding of zeolite catalysis.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Evaluating the dynamic knee function of patients after
   anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a challenge. A variety of
   objective tests have been developed but for various reasons few are
   regularly used in the clinic. It may be practical to perform the
   step-up-and-over test with an accelerometer.
   Methods: A control group (N = 26) and an experimental group with a
   reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament (N = 25) completed
   questionnaires quantifying subjective knee function and fear of
   re-injury and then completed the step-up-and-over test.
   Findings: Results showed that the experimental group performed
   differently than the control group for the step-up -and-over test's Lift
   Symmetry and Impact Symmetry (P < 0.05) and performance on these
   measures was related to the participant's subjective knee function (p =
   -0.46, P < 0.01; p = -0.33, P < 0.05, respectively). Supplemental
   results for individual leg performance and the patient's fear of
   re-injury are also reported and discussed.
   Interpretation: Performance on the step-up-and-over test is different
   for participants with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction than for
   those with intact anterior cruciate ligaments, and that performance is
   related to one's opinion of their knee's function. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The knowledge of thermodynamic high-pressure speed of sound in ionic
   liquids (ILs) is a crucial way either to study the nature of the
   molecular interactions, structure and packing effects or to determine
   other key thermodynamic properties of ILs essential for their
   applications in any chemical and industrial processes. Herein, we report
   the speed of sound as a function temperature at pressures up to 101 MPa
   in four ultrapure ILs: 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis
   {[}(trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl] imide, 1-pentyl-3-methylimidazolium bis
   {[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide, and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide, taking into consideration their
   relaxation behavior. Additionally, to further improve the reliability of
   the speed of sound results, the density, isentropic compressibility, and
   isobaric heat capacity as a function of temperature and pressure are
   calculated using an acoustic method.}},

Abstract = {{The-viscosity of ionic liquids (ILs) has been modeled as a function of
   temperature and at atmospheric pressure using a new method based on the
   UNIFAC-VISCO method. This model extends the calculations previously
   reported by our group (see Zhao et al. J. Chem. Eng. Data 2016, 61,
   2160-2169) which used 154 experimental-viscosity data points of 25 ionic
   liquids for regression of a set of binary interaction parameters and ion
   Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) parameters. Discrepancies in the
   experimental data of the same IL affect the quality of the correlation
   and thus the development of the predictive method. In this work,
   mathematical gnostics was used to analyze the experimental data from
   different sources and recommend one set of reliable data for each IL.
   These recommended data (totally 819 data points) for 70 ILs were
   correlated using this model to obtain an extended set of binary
   interaction parameters and ion VFT parameters, with a regression
   accuracy of 1.4\%. In addition, 966 experimental viscosity data points
   for 11 binary mixtures of ILs were collected from literature to
   establish this model. All the binary data consist of 128 training data
   points used for the optimization of binary interaction parameters and
   838 test data points used for the comparison of the pure evaluated
   values. The relative average absolute deviation (RAAD) for training and
   test is 2.9\% and 3.9\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a valuable tool for determining the
   environmental impacts associated with different products and has been
   widely used to assess biofuel production. As a scientific methodology
   rather than a standardized test, every LCA may be thought of as unique
   in terms of the selection of functional units or determination of system
   boundaries. Researchers generally tailor the method to meet the specific
   goals of their own investigations. This review examines a number of LCAs
   used to evaluate microalgae-to-energy systems, and evaluates their
   contributions in terms of their ability to support commercialization
   efforts in this sector. To this end, a new scoring system for LCAs is
   proposed based on input/output flows, data origin, production
   technologies and system boundaries, selection of assumptions and
   variables, as well as the ability to track environmental, economic, and
   social impacts. The review suggests that, while a wide variety of new
   technological pathways for microalgae-to-energy systems are being
   assessed, the majority of studies reported employ relatively limited
   system boundaries that may not capture the full impacts of the
   processes. The number of environmental impact factors being tracked is
   limited, and many studies do not consider important impacts such as
   water or land use. Most studies do not incorporate critical information
   about economics related to new process configurations, which will be
   essential to support commercialization efforts in this area. (c) 2016

Title = {{Benchmarking analogue models of brittle thrust wedges}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{116-139}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We performed a quantitative comparison of brittle thrust wedge
   experiments to evaluate the variability among analogue models and to
   appraise the reproducibility and limits of model interpretation. Fifteen
   analogue modeling laboratories participated in this benchmark
   initiative. Each laboratory received a shipment of the same type of
   quartz and corundum sand and all laboratories adhered to a stringent
   model building protocol and used the same type of foil to cover base and
   sidewalls of the sandbox. Sieve structure, sifting height, filling rate,
   and details on off-scraping of excess sand followed prescribed
   procedures.
   Our analogue benchmark shows that even for simple plane-strain
   experiments with prescribed stringent model construction techniques,
   quantitative model results show variability, most notably for surface
   slope, thrust spacing and number of forward and backthrusts. One of the
   sources of the variability in model results is related to slight
   variations in how sand is deposited in the sandbox. Small changes in
   sifting height, sifting rate, and scraping will result in slightly
   heterogeneous material bulk densities, which will affect the mechanical
   properties of the sand, and will result in lateral and vertical
   differences in peak and boundary friction angles, as well as cohesion
   values once the model is constructed. Initial variations in basal
   friction are inferred to play the most important role in causing model
   variability.
   Our comparison shows that the human factor plays a decisive role, and
   even when one modeler repeats the same experiment, quantitative model
   results still show variability. Our observations highlight the limits of
   up-scaling quantitative analogue model results to nature or for making
   comparisons with numerical models. The frictional behavior of sand is
   highly sensitive to small variations in material state or experimental
   set-up, and hence, it will remain difficult to scale quantitative
   results such as number of thrusts, thrust spacing, and pop-up width from
   model to nature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study introduces an inexact, but ultra-low power, computing
   architecture devoted to the embedded analysis of bio-signals. The
   platform operates at extremely low voltage supply levels to minimise
   energy consumption. In this scenario, the reliability of static RAM
   (SRAM) memories cannot be guaranteed when using conventional
   6-transistor implementations. While error correction codes and dedicated
   SRAM implementations can ensure correct operations in this
   near-threshold regime, they incur in significant area and energy
   overheads, and should therefore be employed judiciously. Herein, the
   authors propose a novel scheme to design inexact computing architectures
   that selectively protects memory regions based on their significance,
   i.e. their impact on the end-to-end quality of service, as dictated by
   the bio-signal application characteristics. The authors illustrate their
   scheme on an industrial benchmark application performing the power
   spectrum analysis of electrocardiograms. Experimental evidence showcases
   that a significance-based memory protection approach leads to a small
   degradation in the output quality with respect to an exact
   implementation, while resulting in substantial energy gains, both in the
   memory and the processing subsystem.}},

Abstract = {{Date pits are considered one of the major agricultural wastes in Oman.
   The present work involves the synthesis of active catalysts from waste
   date pits carbon produced by carbonization and impregnation with Pt and
   Pd metals. Synthesized catalysts Pt/C and Pd/C were characterized by
   XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, BET and XPS. The activity of the catalysts'
   performance was evaluated by the hydrodeoxygenation of date pits oil for
   the production of second-generation biofuels, which includes jet fuel
   and green diesel fractions. Results indicate that the synthesized
   catalysts were highly active for the hydrodeoxygenation of date pits
   oil. Based on the elemental analysis, the degree of deoxygenation (DOD)
   of product oil was 97.5\% and 89.4\% for the Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts
   respectively. The high DOD was also confirmed by product analyses that
   mainly consist of paraffinic hydrocarbons. Results also showed that
   between the two catalysts, Pd/C showed a higher activity towards
   hydrodeoxygenation, a conclusion that was based on the high DOD of the
   product oil due to hydrocarbons formation. Based on the type of
   components in the product oil, the maximum fraction of hydrocarbons
   formed lay within the range of 72.03\% and 72.78\% green diesel, and
   30.39\% and 28.25\% jet fuel using Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts respectively.
   It can be concluded that waste date pits can be a promising platform for
   the production of catalysts and biofuels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the secure beamforming design for an underlay
   cognitive radio multiple-input single-output broadcast channel in the
   presence of multiple passive eavesdroppers. Our goal is to design a
   jamming noise (JN) transmit strategy to maximize the secrecy rate of the
   secondary system. By utilizing the zero-forcing method to eliminate the
   interference caused by JN to the secondary user, we study the joint
   optimization of the information and JN beamforming for secrecy rate
   maximization of the secondary system while satisfying all the
   interference power constraints at the primary users, as well as the
   per-antenna power constraint at the secondary transmitter. For an
   optimal beamforming design, the original problem is a nonconvex program,
   which can be reformulated as a convex program by applying the rank
   relaxation method. To this end, we prove that the rank relaxation is
   tight and propose a barrier interior-point method to solve the resulting
   saddle point problem based on a duality result. To find the global
   optimal solution, we transform the considered problem into an
   unconstrained optimization problem. We then employ
   Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method to solve the resulting
   unconstrained problem, which helps reduce the complexity significantly,
   compared with the conventional methods. Simulation results show the fast
   convergence of the proposed algorithm and substantial performance
   improvements over the existing approaches.}},

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{348-363}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The ability to directly simulate the formation of twin domains in
   crystalline materials is of interest to the mechanics of materials
   community. While extensive work has been published on homogenized
   crystal mechanics treatments of twinning, publications that directly
   capture twin domain formation are relatively rare. This is due both to
   the complexities of model development and to the computational costs
   involved. We present results from simulations of twinning in
   polycrystals with finite elements that spatially resolve twin formation.
   Effects of interest include the role of stress concentrations in twin
   initiation, the interactions among twin systems, and competition between
   deformation twinning and dislocation glide plasticity. We anticipate
   that results from models that spatially resolve twin formation will help
   to inform more homogenized multiscale schemes. We show basic features of
   the model via numerical simulations on a model polycrystal system in
   simple shear, and also examine the complete model through large scale
   simulation of a dynamically compressed polycrystal. Comparisons are made
   between experimental data from far-field high energy diffraction
   microscopy (HEDM) and numerical simulations for a magnesium alloy
   polycrystal in compression. We finish with some final remarks and
   directions for future work. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{A new variant of the Element-Free Galerkin (EFG) method, that combines
   the diffraction method, to characterize the crack tip solution, and the
   Heaviside enrichment function for representing discontinuity due to a
   crack, has been used to model crack propagation through non-homogenous
   materials. In the case of interface crack propagation, the kink angle is
   predicted by applying the maximum tangential principal stress (MTPS)
   criterion in conjunction with consideration of the energy release rate
   (ERR). The MTPS criterion is applied to the crack tip stress field
   described by both the stress intensity factor (SIF) and the T-stress,
   which are extracted using the interaction integral method. The proposed
   EFG method has been developed and applied for 2D case studies involving
   a crack in an orthotropic material, crack along an interface and a crack
   terminating at a bi-material interface, under mechanical or thermal
   loading; this is done to demonstrate the advantages and efficiency of
   the proposed methodology. The computed SIFs, T-stress and the predicted
   interface crack kink angles are compared with existing results in the
   literature and are found to be in good agreement. An example of crack
   growth through a particle-reinforced composite materials, which may
   involve crack meandering around the particle, is reported. (C) 2016

   infrastructure. Continuous surface wave methods were used to identify
   interfaces between fine-and coarse-grained fill in an end-tipped
   embankment along the Great Central Railway in Nottinghamshire, UK.
   Multichannel analysis of surface wave (MASW) methods were used to
   characterise subsurface voiding in a canal embankment along the
   Knottingley and Goole canal near Eggborough, Yorkshire. MASW methods are
   currently being used to study extreme weather impacts on the stability
   of a high-plasticity clay embankment along the

Title = {{Zirconium hydrides and Fe redistribution in Zr-2.5\%Nb alloy under ion
   irradiation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{480}},
Pages = {{332-343}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Zr-2.5\%Nb alloy is used to fabricate the pressure tubes of the CANDU
   reactor. The pressure tube is the primary pressure boundary for coolant
   in the CANDU design and is susceptible to delayed hydride cracking,
   reduction in fracture toughness upon hydride precipitation and
   potentially hydride blister formation. The morphology and nature of
   hydrides in Zr-2.5\%Nb with 100 wppm hydrogen has been investigated
   using transmission electron microscopy. The effect of hydrides on heavy
   ion irradiation induced decomposition of the 13 phase has been reported.
   STEM-EDX mapping was employed to investigate the distribution of
   alloying elements. The results show that hydrides are present in the
   form of stacks of different sizes, with length scales from nano- to
   micro-meters.
   Heavy ion irradiation experiments at 250 degrees C on as-received and
   hydrided Zr-2.5\%Nb alloy, show interesting effects of hydrogen on the
   irradiation induced redistribution of Fe. It was found that Fe is widely
   redistributed from the 13 phase into the a phase in the as-received
   material, however, the loss of Fe from the phase and subsequent
   precipitation is retarded in the hydrided material. This preliminary
   work will further the current understanding of microstructural evolution
   of Zr based alloys in the presence of hydrogen. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The spouted bed was widely used due to its good mixing of particles and
   effective phase transferability between the gas and solid phase. In this
   paper, the transportation process of particles in a 3D spouted bed was
   studied using the Computational Particle Fluid Dynamics (CPFD) numerical
   method. Experiments were conducted to verify the validity of the
   simulation results. Distributions of the pressure, velocities and
   particle concentration of transportation devices were investigated. The
   motion state and characteristics of multiphase flows in the
   transportation device were demonstrated under various operating
   conditions. The results showed that a good consistency was obtained
   between the simulated results and the experimental results. The motion
   characteristics of the gas-solid two-phase flow in the device was
   effectively predicted, which could assist the optimal operating
   condition estimation for the spouted transportation process. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating organisms (DNPAO) are viewed as one
   of the most effective means to solve the removal contradiction of

   isolated a DNPAO (C-17, accession number: KU745702) from activated
   sludge in a patented circular plug-flow reactor, physiologically to
   Pseudomonas sp. based on 16S rRNA sequence and phenotypic
   characteristics. The results of denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating
   experiment showed that Pseudomonas C-17 has high removal efficiencies
   for PO43 - P and NO3-N, 75\% and 87\%, respectively. The ratio of
   phosphorus release was 25.0 mg PO43 - P g SS-1 (with anabolism) and 26.8
   mg PO43 - P g SS-1 (without anabolism), respectively. Our results
   indicated that Pseudomonas C-17 had strong capacity of phosphorus
   release, and its uptake is often imprecisely evaluated by ignoring the
   part of metabolic consumption. Pseudomonas C-17 is capable of utilizing
   oxygen, nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptors under experimental

Abstract = {{The photocatalytic activity of self-cleaning glass is assessed using a

   both cases the kinetics are zero order. Additional work with a range of
   glass samples of different photocatalytic activity reveals R(Abs) is
   directly related to R(Fl), thereby showing that the latter, like the
   former, can be used to provide a measure of the photocatalytic activity
   of the sample under test. The measured value of R(Fl) is found to be the
   same for 5 pieces of, otherwise identical, self-cleaning glass with:

   Furthermore, a relatively high reversible capacity of 278 mAh g(-1)

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{569}},
Pages = {{1040-1052}},

Abstract = {{Characterising catchment scale biogeochemical processes controlling
   nitrate fate in groundwater constitutes a fundamental consideration when
   applying programmes of measures to reduce risks posed by diffuse
   agricultural pollutants to water quality. Combining hydrochemical
   analyses with nitrate isotopic data and physical hydrogeological
   measurements permitted characterisation of biogeochemical processes
   influencing nitrogen fate and transport in the groundwater in two
   fractured bedrock aquifers with contrasting hydrogeology but comparable
   nutrient loads. Hydrochemical and isotopic analyses of groundwater
   samples collected from moderately fractured, diffusely karstified
   limestone indicated nitrification controlled dissolved nitrogen fate and
   delivery to aquatic receptors. By contrast nitrate concentrations in
   groundwater were considerably lower in a low transmissivity highly
   lithified sandstone and pyrite -bearing shale unit with patchy subsoil
   cover. Geophysical and hydrochemical investigations showed shallower
   intervals contained hydraulically active fractures where denitrification
   was reflected through lower nitrogen levels and an isotopic enrichment
   ratio of 17 between delta N-15 and delta O-18. Study findings highlight
   the influence of bedrock hydrogeological conditions on aqueous nitrogen
   mobility. Investigation results demonstrate that bedrock conditions need
   to be considered when implementing catchment management plans to reduce
   the impact of agricultural practices on the quality of groundwater and
   baseflow in receiving rivers. Nitrate isotopic signatures in the
   groundwater of a freely draining catchment underlain by a karstifiecl
   aquifer and a poorly draining aquifer with a low transmissivity aquifer.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive time-domain analysis of series
   resonant converters operating with phase-shift-modulated full-bridge
   above resonance. Closed-form formulas for all quantities are derived
   using two methods: the commonly used fundamental harmonic approximation
   as well as a precise time-domain analysis considering the effect of all
   the harmonics. Detailed analytical method describes steady-state
   behavior of the converter in three mutually exclusive and collectively
   exhaustive modes of operation based on continuity of the resonant
   inductor current: a discontinuous mode and two continuous modes. The
   difference between two continuous modes is in the existence of natural
   zero-voltage switching in the leading leg of the full bridge.
   Quantitative predictions of the key quantities from two methods are
   compared and the accuracy of the first harmonic approximation is
   examined. The time-domain approach provides useful insights for design
   considerations with no need to know the load value. It precisely
   determines closed-form equations for the boundary conditions of the
   three operation modes. An adaptive passive auxiliary circuit is
   suggested to guarantee zero-voltage switching for the entire operating
   conditions. Experimental results from a 100 W prototype confirm the
   predicted time-domain behavior and achievement of soft switching using
   the proposed auxiliary circuit.}},

Title = {{The basic principles of uncertain information fusion. An organised
   review of merging rules in different representation frameworks}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION FUSION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{12-39}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We propose and advocate basic principles for the fusion of incomplete or
   uncertain information items, that should apply regardless of the
   formalism adopted for representing pieces of information coming from
   several sources. This formalism can be based on sets, logic, partial
   orders, possibility theory, belief functions or imprecise probabilities.
   We propose a general notion of information item representing incomplete
   or uncertain information about the values of an entity of interest. It
   is supposed to rank such values in terms of relative plausibility, and
   explicitly point out impossible values. Basic issues affecting the
   results of the fusion process, such as relative information content and
   consistency of information items, as well as their mutual consistency,
   are discussed. For each representation setting, we present fusion rules
   that obey our principles, and compare them to postulates specific to the
   representation proposed in the past. In the crudest (Boolean)
   representation setting (using a set of possible values), we show that
   the understanding of the set in terms of most plausible values, or in
   terms of non-impossible ones matters for choosing a relevant fusion
   rule. Especially, in the latter case our principles justify the method
   of maximal consistent subsets, while the former is related to the fusion
   of logical bases. Then we consider several formal settings for
   incomplete or uncertain information items, where our postulates are
   instantiated: plausibility orderings, qualitative and quantitative
   possibility distributions, belief functions and convex sets of
   probabilities. The aim of this paper is to provide a unified picture of
   fusion rules across various uncertainty representation settings. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper formulates a linear kernel support vector machine (SVM) as a
   regularized least-squares (RLS) problem. By defining a set of indicator
   variables of the errors, the solution to the RLS problem is represented
   as an equation that relates the error vector to the indicator variables.
   Through partitioning the training set, the SVM weights and bias are
   expressed analytically using the support vectors. It is also shown how
   this approach naturally extends to sums with nonlinear kernels whilst
   avoiding the need to make use of Lagrange multipliers and duality
   theory. A fast iterative solution algorithm based on Cholesky
   decomposition with permutation of the support vectors is suggested as a
   solution method. The properties of our SVM formulation are analyzed and
   compared with standard SVMs using a simple example that can be
   illustrated graphically. The correctness and behavior of our solution
   (merely derived in the primal context of RLS) is demonstrated using a
   set of public benchmarking problems for both linear and nonlinear SVMs.

Title = {{Short-lived reheating events in the Sommartuva shear zone hosted in cold
   crust: Ar-diffusion modelling constraints for the exhumation of
   eclogites in Flakstadoy, Lofoten Islands, Norway}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{134-152}},
Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{The exhumation of the Norwegian Lofoten eclogites, formed during the
   continental collision of Laurentia and Baltica, is mainly due to the
   reactivation of shear zones during the collapse of the Caledonian
   orogen. The current cooling history {[} temperature-time (T-t) paths]
   for the exhumation of these rocks as determined by Ar-40/Ar-39 dating
   and geothermometry involves a protracted period of slow cooling (c. -1.7
   degrees C Ma(-1)) from high T. The Sommartuva shear zone, hosted in a
   Palaeoproterozoic anorthosite, contains retrogressed eclogite and
   amphibolite-facies lenses and served as an open system for Ar with
   Ar-40-rich and Ar-40-poor hot fluid infiltration. Ca-rich amphiboles
   from amphibolites contain excess Ar and are mantled by phlogopites that
   yield Ar-diffusion loss profiles with plateau ages of 413-400 Ma
   associated with an extensional event in Lofoten. Locally, the zone was
   intruded in its late-stage history (c.333 Ma) by a granitoid rock
   crystallizing annite and muscovite, previously inferred to be injected
   synchronously with amphibolite-facies metamorphism. An alternative
   cooling path related to the exhumation of the eclogites was determined
   by a combination of i) Ar-40/Ar-39 ages in minerals that grew during
   different thermal events, ii) thermal modelling of the Ar systematics in
   these minerals and iii) exploration of the thermal effects caused by the
   superposition of each event on pre-existing mineral phases. The best-fit
   T-t path as constrained by the Ar data reveals that, in order to
   preserve Ar (radiogenic and excess) within the minerals, the ambient T
   must have been relatively low(<= 300 degrees C) over 80Ma (413-333Ma).
   Likewise, the associated intrusion of the granitoid and the hot fluid
   that percolated the shear zone and crystallized the phlogopites were
   likely to have been short-lived (c. 100-25 ka) and at relatively
   moderate T (500 degrees C). In contrast to previous thermal models where
   the thermal events are represented as simple inflexions in a T-t curve,
   our cold-crust model incorporates short-lived thermal disturbances
   (including estimates of the magnitude of their maximum temperature and
   duration) superimposed on protracted periods of slow cooling from high
   T. A new proposed T-t path obtained for the exhumation of this terrane
   indicates that the eclogites resided for 80 Ma (413-333 Ma) at
   relatively cool ambient temperatures (c. 300 degrees C), highlighting
   the enormous potential of coupling geochronological data from multiple
   isotopic systems with thermal modelling to identify and constrain the
   duration of short-lived events. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The mevalonate pathway is of important clinical, pharmaceutical, and
   biotechnological relevance. However, lack of the understanding of the
   phosphorylation mechanism of the kinases in this pathway has limited
   rationally engineering the kinases in industry. Here the phosphorylation
   reaction mechanism of a representative kinase in the mevalonate pathway,
   phosphomevalonate kinase, was studied by using molecular dynamics and
   hybrid QM/MM methods. We find that a conserved residue (Ser106) is
   reorientated to anchor ATP via a stable H-bond interaction. In addition,
   Ser213 located on the a-helix at the catalytic site is repositioned to
   further approach the substrate, facilitating the proton transfer during
   the phosphorylation. Furthermore, we elucidate that Lys101 functions to
   neutralize the negative charge developed at the beta-, gamma-bridging
   oxygen atom of ATP during phosphoryl transfer. We demonstrate that the
   dissociative catalytic reaction occurs via a direct phosphorylation
   pathway. This is the first study on the phosphorylation mechanism of a
   mevalonate pathway kinase. The elucidation of the catalytic mechanism
   not only sheds light on the common catalytic mechanism of the GHMP
   kinase superfamily but also provides the structural basis for
   engineering the mevalonate pathway kinases to further exploit their
   applications in the production of a wide range of fine chemicals such as
   biofuels or pharmaceuticals.}},

Abstract = {{In the 21st century, information has become the most valuable resource
   that is available to modern societies. Thus, great efforts have been
   made to develop new information processing and storage techniques.
   Chemistry can offer a wide variety of computing paradigms that are
   closely related to the natural processes found in living organisms
   (e.g., in the nervous systems of animals). Moreover, these phenomena
   cannot be reproduced easily by solely using silicon-based technology.
   Other great advantages of molecular scale systems include their
   simplicity and the diversity of interactions that occur among them.
   Thus, devices constructed using chemical entities may be programmed to
   deal with different information carriers (photons, electrons, ions, and
   molecules), possibly surpassing the capabilities of classic electronic
   circuits. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally polyvinylidene fluoride membranes have been used in
   applications such as membrane distillation, wastewater treatment,
   desalination and separator fabrication. Within this work we demonstrate
   that a novel carbon nanofiber/polyvinylidene fluoride (CNF/PVDF)
   composite membrane can be used as an interlayer for Lithium-Sulfur
   (Li-S) batteries yielding both high capacity and long cycling life. This
   PVDF membrane is shown to effectively separate dissolved lithium
   polysulfide with the high electronic conductivity CNF not only reducing
   the internal resistance in the sulfur cathode but also helping
   immobilize the polysulfide through its abundant nanospaces. The
   resulting Li-S battery assembled with the CNF/PVDF composite membrane
   effectively solves the polysulfide permeation problem and exhibits
   excellent electrochemical performance. It is further shown that the
   CNF/PVDF electrode has an excellent cycling stability and retains a
   capacity of 768.6 mAh g(-1) with a coulombic efficiency above 99\% over
   200 cycles at 0.5C, which is more than twice that of a cell without
   CNF/PVDF (374 mAh g(-1)). In addition, the low-cost raw materials and
   the simple preparation process of CNF/PVDF composite membrane is also
   amenable for industrial production. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{An optimal day-ahead scheduling method (ODSM) for the integrated urban
   energy system (IUES) is introduced, which considers the reconfigurable
   capability of an electric distribution network. The hourly topology of a
   distribution network, a natural gas network, the energy centers
   including the combined heat and power (CHP) units, different energy
   conversion devices and demand responsive loads (DRLs), are optimized to
   minimize the day-ahead operation cost of the IUES. The hourly
   reconfigurable capability of the electric distribution network utilizing
   remotely controlled switches (RCSs) is explored and discussed. The
   operational constraints from the unbalanced three-phase electric
   distribution network, the natural gas network, and the energy centers
   are considered. The interactions between the electric distribution
   network and the natural gas network take place through conversion of
   energy among different energy vectors in the energy centers. An energy
   conversion analysis model for the energy center was developed based on
   the energy hub model. A hybrid optimization method based on genetic
   algorithm (GA) and a nonlinear interior point method (IPM) is utilized
   to solve the ODSM model. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed
   ODSM is able to provide the IUES with an effective and economical day
   ahead scheduling scheme and reduce the operational cost of the IUES.

   management, in polymer electrolyte fuel cells}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},

Pages = {{757-778}},

Abstract = {{The PEFC has emerged as the most viable fuel cell type for automotive
   and some portable applications, and also has potential back-up power
   unit applications due to its low operating temperature, comparative
   simplicity of construction, high power density, and ease of operation.
   In spite of tremendous scientific advances, as well as engineering
   progress over the last few decades, the commercialization of PEFCs
   remains unrealized, owing primarily to economic viability associated
   with the high prices of materials and components and technical problems
   relating primarily to water management. The difficulty in addressing the
   water management issues lies mostly in the two-phase multi-component
   flow involving phase-change in porous media, coupled heat and mass
   transfer, interactions between the porous layers and gas channel (GC)
   and the complex relationship between water content and cell performance.
   Due to the low temperature of operation, water generated by the
   electrochemical reactions often condenses into liquid form, potentially
   flooding the gas diffusion layer (GDL), GC or other components. Insight
   into the fundamental processes of liquid water evolution and transport
   is still lacking, preventing further enhanced PEFC development.
   The aim of this paper is to give a comprehensive introduction to PEFC
   modeling inside GCs and GDLs, with a focus on two-phase flow and related
   phase-change and transport processes. Relevant momentum, mass and heat
   transport processes are introduced and the microstructural effects on
   the transport processes inside the porous GDL are extensively discussed.
   The selection of a computational approach, for the two-phase flow within
   a GDL or GC, for example, should be based on the computational resources
   available, concerns about time and scale (microscale, cell scale, stack
   scale or system scale), as well as accuracy requirements. One important
   feature, included in some computational approaches, is the possibility
   to track the front between the liquid and the gas phases. To build a
   PEFC model, one must make a large number of assumptions. Some
   assumptions have a negligible effect on the results and reliability of
   the model. However, other assumptions may significantly affect the
   result. It is strongly recommended in any modeling paper to clearly
   state the assumptions being implemented, for others to be able to judge
   the work.
   It is important to note that a large fraction of the expressions that
   presently are used to describe the transport processes inside PEFC GDLs
   were originally developed to describe significantly different systems,
   such as sand or rocks. Moreover, the flow pattern maps and pressure drop
   correlations of two phase flow in micro channels may not be applicable
   for GCs due to one side wall being porous, with the resulting
   interaction between the GDL and GC. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Large scale wind power generation complicated with restrictions on the

   are included in the economic dispatch analysis of regional systems.
   Based on the day-ahead dispatch results, a tie line power plan
   adjustment strategy is implemented in the event of wind power
   curtailment or deep cycling occurring in the economic dispatch model,
   with the objective of reducing such effects. The dispatch strategy is
   designed based on the distinctive operation characteristics of
   interconnected WCISs, and dispatch results for regional systems in China
   show that the proposed strategy is feasible and can improve the overall

Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{57-71}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Thermoplastic composites are likely to emerge as the preferred solution
   for meeting the high-volume production demands of passenger road
   vehicles. Substantial effort is currently being directed towards the
   development of new modelling techniques to reduce the extent of costly
   and time consuming physical testing. Developing a high-fidelity
   numerical model to predict the crush behaviour of composite laminates is
   dependent on the accurate measurement of material properties as well as
   a thorough understanding of damage mechanisms associated with crush
   events. This paper details the manufacture, testing and modelling of
   self-supporting corrugated-shaped thermoplastic composite specimens for
   crashworthiness assessment. These specimens demonstrated a 57.3\% higher
   specific energy absorption compared to identical specimen made from
   thermoset composites. The corresponding damage mechanisms were
   investigated in-situ using digital microscopy and post analysed using
   Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Splaying and fragmentation modes
   were the primary failure modes involving fibre breakage, matrix cracking
   and delamination. A mesoscale composite damage model, with new nonlinear
   shear constitutive laws, which combines a range of novel techniques to
   accurately capture the material response under crushing, is presented.
   The force-displacement curves, damage parameter maps and dissipated
   energy, obtained from the numerical analysis, are shown to be in a good
   qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimental results. The
   proposed approach could significantly reduce the extent of physical
   testing required in the development of crashworthy structures. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS) have been at the forefront of cancer
   research, designed to mimic tumor-like developmental patterns in vitro.
   Tumor growth in vivo is highly influenced by aberrant cell
   surface-specific sialoglycan structures on glycoproteins. Aberrant
   sialoglycan patterns that facilitate MTS formation are not well defined.
   Matrix-free spheroids from breast MCF-7 and pancreatic PANC1 cancer cell
   lines and their respective tamoxifen (TMX) and gemcitabine (Gem)
   resistant variants were generated using the RGD platform of cyclic
   Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys peptide modified with
   4-carboxybutyl-triphenylphosphonium bromide (cyclo-RGDfK (TPP)). MCF-7
   and MCF-7 TMX cells formed tight spheroids both in the classical agarose
   and RGD-based platforms while all PANC1 cells formed loose aggregates.
   Using lectin histochemistry staining, sialidase assay, neuraminidase
   (Vibrio cholerae) and oseltamivir phosphate (OP) neuraminidase inhibitor
   treatments, MCF-7 and PANC1 cells and their drug-resistant variants
   expressed different sialic acid (SA) content on their cell surfaces.
   alpha-2,3- and alpha-2,6-sialic acid surface residues facilitated
   spheroid formation under cyclo-RGDfK(TPP)-induced self-assembly.
   Pretreatment with alpha-2,3SA specific Maackia amurensis (MAL-II)
   lectin, alpha-2,6-SA specific Sambucus nigra (SNA) lectin, and exogenous
   alpha-2,6-SA specific neuraminidase (Vibrio cholerae) dose-dependently
   reduced spheroid volume. OP enhanced cell aggregation and compaction
   forming spheroids. PANC1 and MDA-MB231 xenograft tumors from untreated
   and OP-treated RAGxC gamma double mutant mice expressed significantly
   higher levels of alpha-2,3SA over alpha-2,6-SA. MCF-7 spheroids also
   expressed a high alpha-2,3-SA to alpha-2,6-SA ratio. These results
   suggest that the relative levels of specific sialoglycan structures on
   the cell surface correlate with the ability of cancer cells to form
   avascular multicellular tumor spheroids and in vivo xenograft tumors.}},

Title = {{Domain reduction for Benders decomposition based global optimization}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{248-265}},
Month = {{OCT 4}},
Abstract = {{While domain reduction has been successfully applied in branch-and-bound
   based global optimization over the last two decades, it has not been
   systematically studied for decomposition based global optimization,
   which is usually more efficient for problems with decomposable
   structures. This paper discusses integration of domain reduction in
   Benders decomposition based global optimization, specifically,
   generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) and nonconvex generalized
   Benders decomposition (NGBD). Revised GBD and NGBD frameworks are
   proposed to incorporate bound contraction operations or/and range
   reduction calculations, which can reduce the variable bounds and
   therefore improve the convergence rate and expedite the solution of
   nonconvex subproblems. Novel customized bound contraction problems are
   proposed for GBD and NGBD, and they are easier to solve than the
   classical bound contraction problems because they are defined on reduced
   variable spaces. The benefits of the proposed methods are demonstrated
   through a gas production operation problem and a power distribution
   system design problem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of using
   artificial neural network programming for the prediction of the fresh
   properties of self-compacting concrete. The input parameters of the
   neural network were the mix composition influencing the fresh properties
   of self-compacting concrete namely, the cement content, the dosages of
   limestone powder and water, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, and
   superplasticizer, and other parameter of time of testing (5, 30 and 60
   minutes after addition of water). The model is based on a multilayer
   feed forward neural network. The details of the proposed ANN with its
   architecture, training and validation are presented in this paper. Six
   outputs of the ANN models related to the fresh properties were the slump
   flow, T-50, T-60, V-funnel flow time, Orimet flow time, and blocking
   ratio (L-box). The effectiveness of the trained ANN is evaluated by
   comparing its responses with the experimental data that were used in the
   training process. The dosage of water was varied from 188 to 208 L/m(3),
   the dosage of SP from 3.8 to 5.8 kg/m(3), and the volume of coarse
   aggregates from 220 to 360 L/m(3) (587 to 961 kg/m(3)). In total twenty
   mixes were used to measure the fresh properties with different mix
   compositions. ANN performed well and provided very good correlation
   coefficients (R-2) above 0.957 for slump flow, T-50, V-funnel flow time,
   Orimet flow time, and L-box blocking ratio. The predicting results for
   T-60 was slightly lower (R-2= 0.823). With the calculated models these
   properties of new mixes within the practical range of the input
   variables used in the training can be predicted with an absolute error
   for slump flow, T-50, T-60, V-funnel flow time, Orimet flow time, and
   L-box ratio of 3.3\%, 13\%, 16\%, 14\%, 15\%, and 22\%, respectively.
   The results show that the ANN model can predict accurately the fresh
   properties of SCC.}},

Abstract = {{Kolmogorov related the mean energy transport to both turbulent advection
   and molecular diffusion (K41), which, for moderate Reynolds numbers
   encountered under laboratory conditions, is not balanced. The main
   reason for this imbalance is the inhomogeneous and anisotropic
   large-scales, which are not sufficiently separated from the smallest
   dissipation scale. Various types of inhomogeneities have been examined
   in different turbulent flows such as grid turbulence, fully developed
   channel flow and along the jet centreline. The inhomogeneities
   associated with large-scales are examined in the shear-layer of a round
   jet since several large-scale phenomena coexist in this region. A new
   generalized form of Kolmogorov's equation is proposed for the
   off-centerline (shear-layer) of round jet flows, where the main sources
   of the inhomogeneity are the streamwise decay of turbulent energy,
   normal stress production, shear stress production, and axial and lateral
   diffusion. The validity of this equation is investigated using hot-wire
   data obtained for a round turbulent jet at Re-D = 50, 000. The effect of
   radial distance is investigated on each term in this equation. It is
   found that the magnitude of the decay, normal stress production and
   axial diffusion terms deceases with increasing radial distance from the
   centreline for almost all scales while the shear stress production and
   lateral diffusion terms first increase in magnitude and then decreases
   with the radial distance. The similarity of the energy structure
   functions is also investigated in the shear portion of the jet using an
   equilibrium similarity analysis. On the basis of the current analysis,
   it is suggested that the turbulence kinetic energy, < q(2)>, follows a
   power-law decay along the streamwsie direction. In addition, the
   second-order structure functions of u, v, q and uv are found to collapse
   approximately downstream of the self-similar jet when they are
   normalized by < u(2)>, < v(2)>, < q(2)> and < uv >, respectively, and
   the Taylor microscale lambda. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   shear flow: Shear stress response}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Recent work has focused on deepening our understanding of the molecular
   origins of the higher harmonics that arise in the shear stress response
   of polymeric liquids in large-amplitude oscillatory shear flow. For
   instance, these higher harmonics have been explained by just considering
   the orientation distribution of rigid dumbbells suspended in a Newtonian
   solvent. These dumbbells, when in dilute suspension, form the simplest
   relevant molecular model of polymer viscoelasticity, and this model
   specifically neglects interactions between the polymer molecules {[}R.
   B. Bird et al., ``Dilute rigid dumbbell suspensions in large-amplitude
   oscillatory shear flow: Shear stress response,{''} J. Chem. Phys. 140,
   074904 (2014)]. In this paper, we explore these interactions by
   examining the Curtiss-Bird model, a kinetic molecular theory designed
   specifically to account for the restricted motions that arise when
   polymer chains are concentrated, thus interacting and specifically,
   entangled. We begin our comparison using a heretofore ignored explicit
   analytical solution {[}X.-J. Fan and R. B. Bird, ``A kinetic theory for
   polymer melts. VI. Calculation of additional material functions,{''} J.
   Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 15, 341 (1984)]. For concentrated systems, the
   chain motion transverse to the chain axis is more restricted than along
   the axis. This anisotropy is described by the link tension
   coefficient,., for which several special cases arise: epsilon = 0
   corresponds to reptation, epsilon > 1/8 to rod-climbing, 1/5 <= epsilon
   <= 3/4 to reasonable predictions for shear-thinning in steady simple
   shear flow, and epsilon = 1 to the dilute solution without hydrodynamic
   interaction. In this paper, we examine the shapes of the shear stress
   versus shear rate loops for the special cases epsilon = (0, 1/8, 3/8,
   1), and we compare these with those of rigid dumbbell and reptation
   model predictions. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

   Digital Simulation-Based Design}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Modern manufacturing systems should satisfy emerging needs related to
   sustainable development. The design of sustainable manufacturing systems
   can be valuably supported by simulation, traditionally employed mainly
   for time and cost reduction. In this paper, a multi-purpose digital
   simulation approach is proposed to deal with sustainable manufacturing
   systems design through Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and 3D digital
   human modelling. DES models integrated with data on power consumption of
   the manufacturing equipment are utilized to simulate different scenarios
   with the aim to improve productivity as well as energy efficiency,
   avoiding resource and energy waste. 3D simulation based on digital human
   modelling is employed to assess human factors issues related to
   ergonomics and safety of manufacturing systems. The approach is
   implemented for the sustainability enhancement of a real manufacturing
   cell of the aerospace industry, automated by robotic deburring.
   Alternative scenarios are proposed and simulated, obtaining a
   significant improvement in terms of energy efficiency (87\%) for the new
   deburring cell, and a reduction of energy consumption around 69\% for
   the coordinate measuring machine, with high potential annual energy cost
   savings and increased energy efficiency. Moreover, the simulation-based
   ergonomic assessment of human operator postures allows 25\% improvement
   of the workcell ergonomic index.}},

Abstract = {{Neutron diffraction line profile analysis (DLPA) and transmission
   electron microscopy were used to characterize the components of the
   bimodal microstructure of Zr-Excel (Zr-3.5Sn-0.8Mo-0.8Nb), a nuclear
   structural material. The dual microstructure, consisting of equiaxed
   primary grains and martensitic domains both having hexagonal
   close-packed (h.c.p.) alpha crystal structure, forms when the
   as-received Zr-Excel alloy is heat treated at a high temperature and
   subsequently quenched, i.e. is solution treated. Because both
   microstructure components have the same crystal structure the
   reflections from the two components overlap significantly. The article
   presents how the multi-phase analysis capability of modern DLPA methods
   can be used to model the measured neutron diffraction patterns as the
   sum of two sub-patterns corresponding to the components of such a
   bimodal microstructure, which can be found in many hexagonal alloys
   relevant for industrial applications. The results show that the large
   equiaxed primary h.c.p. alpha grains have a highly correlated
   low-density dislocation structure and large sub-grains (similar to 300
   nm), while the large martensitic domains have a randomly arranged very
   high density dislocation structure and sub-grains the size of similar to
   30 nm. The significantly different defect structures of the primary and
   martensitic phases manifest as large differences in the hardness and
   ductility of the individual components. As a result of this duality of
   the mechanical properties, solution-treated Zr-Excel materials can be
   considered as analogous to metal matrix composites where a softer
   ductile matrix contains a harder brittle reinforcing phase.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine if a high T-g polymer
   (Eudragit (R) S100) could be used to stabilize amorphous domains of
   polyethylene oxide (PEO) and hence improve the stability of binary
   polymer systems containing celecoxib (CX). We propose a novel method of
   stabilizing the amorphous PEO solid dispersion through inclusion of a
   miscible, high T-g polymer, namely, that can form strong interpolymer
   interactions. The effects of inter-polymer interactions and miscibility
   between PEO and Eudragit S100 are considered. Polymer blends were first
   manufactured via hot-melt extrusion at different PEO/S100 ratios (70/30,
   50/50, and 30/70 wt/wt). Differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic
   mechanical thermal analysis data suggested a good miscibility between
   PEO and S100 polymer blends, particularly at the 50/50 ratio. To further
   evaluate the system, CX/PEO/S100 ternary mixtures were extruded.
   Immediately after hot-melt extrusion, a single T-g that increased with
   increasing S100 content (anti-plasticization) was observed in all
   ternary systems. The absence of powder X-ray diffractometry crystalline
   Bragg's peaks also suggested amorphization of CX. Upon storage (40
   degrees C/75\% relative humidity), the formulation containing PEO/S100
   at a ratio of 50: 50 was shown to be most stable. Fourier transform
   infrared studies confirmed the presence of hydrogen bonding between
   Eudragit S100 and PEO suggesting this was the principle reason for
   stabilization of the amorphous CX/PEO solid dispersion system. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Solution-processed hybrid organic inorganic lead halide perovskites are
   emerging as one of the most promising candidates for low-cost
   light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, due to a small exciton binding
   energy, it is not yet possible to achieve an efficient
   electroluminescence within the blue wavelength region at room
   temperature, as is necessary for full-spectrum light sources. Here, we
   demonstrate efficient blue LEDs based on the colloidal, quantum confined
   2D perovskites, with precisely controlled stacking down to one-unit-cell
   thickness (n = 1). A variety of low-k organic host compounds are used to
   disperse the 2D perovskites, effectively creating a matrix of the
   dielectric quantum wells, which significantly boosts the exciton binding
   energy by the dielectric confinement effect. Through the Forster
   resonance energy transfer, the excitons down-convert and recombine
   radiatively in the 2D perovskites. We report room-temperature pure green
   (n = 7-10), sky blue (n = 5), pure blue (n = 3), and deep blue (n = 1)
   electroluminescence, with record-high external quantum efficiencies in
   the green-to-blue wavelength region.}},

Abstract = {{Free-end torsion deformation is used for processing copper rod in this
   work. Both microstructures and mechanical properties of the torsional
   rods are quantitatively analyzed. The results show that gradient
   lamellar dislocation substructures (LDS) along the radial direction as
   the main defects are formed after torsion. The increment of the LDS
   density, the shrinking of spacing size, and the change of length/spacing
   (L/S) ratio of the LDS are all non-monotonic function of torsion
   revolution. High-density LDS with fine spacing can retain strain
   hardening capability, which results in good combination of high tensile
   strength and good ductility in the torsional deformed sample with large
   number of revolutions. The influence of torsion strain on primary twin
   boundaries (TBs) in the hot-extruded rod is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the novel use of elemental sulfur as a fuel in a
   combined cycle power plant, wherein sulfur is oxidized in the combustion
   chamber to produce work from a gas turbine. Produced sulfur dioxide is
   then reacted with calcite to produce anhydrite (CaSO4) in a flue gas
   desulfurization unit. The desulfurization reaction is exothermic,
   producing heat that can be converted to electricity by passing the
   exhaust gas through a heat recovery steam generator. The cases studied
   in this work are a 410 MW natural gas combined cycle, used as a
   reference case, a sulfur combined cycle (SCC) consisting of a typical
   industrial gas turbine with heat recovery followed by desulfurization,
   and a third case of a SCC followed by desulfurization before the heat
   recovery, thereby producing power from the exothermic desulfurization
   reaction. Energy calculations of the last case show promising results
   for converting sulfur to anhydrite through a combined cycle that
   produces 615 MW of electrical power with CO2 emission of 0.584 kg/kWh, a
   value lower than the representative value of a new, supercritical coal
   power plant.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the secrecy performance of dualhop amplify-and-forward
   multi-antenna relaying systems over Rayleigh fading channels,
   considering the direct link between the source and the destination. In
   order to exploit the available direct link and the multiple antennas for
   secrecy improvement, different linear processing schemes at the relay
   and different diversity combining techniques at the destination are
   proposed, namely: 1) zero-forcing/maximal ratio combining (ZF/MRC); 2)
   ZF/selection combining (ZF/SC); 3) maximal ratio transmission/MRC
   (MRT/MRC); and 4) MRT/SC. For all these schemes, we present new
   closed-form approximations for the secrecy outage probability. Moreover,
   we investigate a benchmark scheme, i.e., cooperative jamming/ZF (CJ/ZF),
   where the secrecy outage probability is obtained in exact closed-form.
   In addition, we present asymptotic secrecy outage expressions for all
   the proposed schemes in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, in
   order to characterize key design parameters, such as secrecy diversity
   order and secrecy array gain. The outcomes of this paper can be
   summarized as follows: 1) MRT/MRC and MRT/SC achieve a full diversity
   order of M + 1, ZF/MRC and ZF/SC achieve a diversity order of M, while
   CJ/ZF only achieves unit diversity order, where M is the number of
   antennas at the relay; 2) ZF/MRC (ZF/SC) outperforms the corresponding
   MRT/MRC (MRT/SC) in the low SNR regime, while becomes inferior to the
   corresponding MRT/MRC (MRT/SC) in the high SNR; and 3) all the proposed
   schemes tend to outperform the CJ/ZF with moderate number of antennas,
   and linear processing schemes with MRC attain better performance than
   those with SC.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid recharge events manifested as significant increases in hydraulic
   head have been observed in many fractured bedrock aquifers around the
   world. Often the response in hydraulic head exceeds what would be
   observed in an equivalent porous media by more than an order of
   magnitude. As the mechanisms that cause these events are poorly
   understood particularly under highly-transient conditions, a detailed
   investigation was conducted at a well-characterized field site in
   eastern Canada. During the spring and summer of 2012, frequent
   measurements of hydraulic head were obtained in gneissic terrain covered
   by a thin veneer of drift materials using 21 multi-level monitoring
   wells installed in the bedrock. Each of the wells was hydraulically
   tested from the water table to total depth using a straddle-packer
   system and fractures intersecting the wells were identified using a
   borehole camera prior to the construction of the multi-level
   piezometers. Rainfall and weather data were also collected over the same
   time period. A piezometer located on a bedrock outcrop which responded
   rapidly to rainfall was identified and used as a focus for numerical
   simulations. To determine the properties of the drift materials in the
   vicinity of the outcrop, a ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey was
   conducted over a 40 x 40 m area to map depth to bedrock and five in-situ
   permeameter tests were performed to estimate the hydraulic conductivity.
   Three-dimensional numerical simulations were conducted to reproduce the
   response in the piezometer for both short (24 h) and long (one month)
   timescales. The numerical simulations were used to determine what
   parameters have the greatest impact on controlling rapid recharge. Based
   on this study it was concluded that the large magnitude head rises
   recorded in this piezometer are a result of recharge to steeply inclined
   fractures exposed on or immediately adjacent to the outcrop. The
   hydraulic head responds rapidly because of the low specific yield of the
   rock to which the transmissive features are connected. The modelling
   also showed that as little as 0.4 m of drift material can completely
   eliminate the response in the well especially during times when
   evapotranspiration is high. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by

   different isoprene contents show that H-atom abstraction from the
   allylic functionality provided by isoprene mers is responsible for the
   heightened H-atom transfer reactivity of IIR relative to
   poly(isobutylene). Differences in the reactivity of allylic and alkyl
   macroradical intermediates makes high isoprene IIR materials less prone
   to peroxide-initiated chain scission, but less responsive to VTEOS
   grafting formulations. Improved knowledge of H-atom transfer reactivity
   is extended to a new approach for IIR cross-linking involving

Abstract = {{Micellar radical polymerization of a short-chain polyester macromonomer,
   polycaprolactone choline iodide ester methacrylate (PCL n ChMA), is used
   to produce a new cationic flocculant that becomes more hydrophobic in
   response to hydrolytic degradation. The cationic tips of the comb-like
   poly(PCL 3 ChMA) accelerate the settling rate of oil sands tailings,
   while partial hydrolysis of the polyester grafts reveals the hydrophobic
   segments that reduce capillary suction time by 30\%. This technology
   combines the material properties of polyesters with the productivity of
   radical polymerization to make dual functional flocculants with
   characteristics that can be easily tuned to control flocculation
   performance, such as polymeric cation density, hydrophobic content, and

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{81-97}},

Abstract = {{Variations in arsenic (As) mineralogy and geochemical controls on its
   mobility were evaluated in subsurface tailings at the historical
   Montague and Goldenville mine sites in Nova Scotia, Canada. Tailings at
   these sites contain some of the highest As concentrations in Nova Scotia
   and are located in close proximity to local communities. Pore water in
   the subsurface tailings is characterized by circumneutral to alkaline pH
   (6.2 to 8.7) and mildly reducing to oxidizing redox conditions (+130 mV
   to +347 mV). Bulk chemistry, scanning electron microscopy, and
   synchrotron micro-X-ray diffraction analyses showed As mineral hosts
   differ with depth. The deepest tailings (max. 2 m) are in direct contact
   with partially decomposed vegetation, which supports reducing conditions
   and the precipitation of authigenic As and Fe sulfides. Under reducing
   conditions, dissolved As concentrations are also controlled by
   desorption of As from dissolution of Fe and Mn oxides and the sorption
   or co-precipitation of As with carbonates. These geochemical controls
   differ from those influencing dissolved As concentrations under
   oxidizing conditions. In the near surface, As mobility is controlled by
   oxidative dissolution of primary arsenopyrite, precipitation of
   secondary Fe arsenates, Fe oxyhydroxides and Mn oxides, secondary Ca-Fe
   arsenates, and sorption onto Fe oxyhydroxides and gangue minerals. Some
   of these mineral species are stable under different conditions yet occur
   in close association, indicating the importance of microenvironments.
   The results of this study show that the weathering characteristics of
   these tailings vary with depth, leading to the formation of new As hosts
   that are distinct from those observed in the near surface.
   Identification of these As hosts provides an understanding of current
   controls on As mobility and has implications for future reprocessing
   and/or remediation efforts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the causes of the low-biodiversity faunas in the Western
   Interior Seaway (WIS), overwhelmingly dominated by ammonite and bivalve
   molluscs, will help us to understand paleoenvironmental conditions in
   the WIS. In this study, we examined rare earth elements (REEs) in
   well-preserved molluscs from the Bearpaw Formation to reconstruct WIS
   redox conditions. Both nektonic and benthic molluscs share similar REE
   patterns with enrichment in light REEs. There is only a slight Ce
   depletion in both types of molluscs, indicating no significant
   fractionation of Ce from the other REEs. A lack of significant Ce
   anomalies in molluscs points to oxygen-deficient (probably dysoxic)
   conditions in the middle to bottom part of the water column where the
   molluscs lived. Given the general lack of significant Ce anomalies also
   in molluscs from older formations, oxygen deficiency was likely
   prevalent in the Late Cretaceous in the WIS. A warmer climate in the
   Cretaceous is probably a driver of such conditions, as predicted by
   ocean models. Long-term oxygen deficiency and stratification, inferred
   from the heterogeneity in delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of molluscs,
   may also imply weak circulation, reducing the exchange of surface water
   and subsurface water, and the transport of oxygen into the WIS. The
   oxygen deficiency and weak circulation of the seaway is also expressed
   in the general characteristics of faunas and possibly Bearpaw
   sedimentary rocks. Oxygen deficiency rather than the brackish water
   conditions may have been largely responsible, therefore, for the low
   diversity of the WIS fauna.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents results of experimental kinetics and modelling of the
   isotopic exchange between hydrogen and water in a reactive stripping
   column for water dedeuteriation. The missing physical properties of
   deuterium and tritium isotopologues in hydrogen gas and water forms were
   predicted and validated using existing literature data. The kinetic
   model relevant to a styrene-divinyl-benzene copolymer-supported platinum
   catalyst was used for modelling, by Aspen plus modular package, impact
   of design parameters including temperature, total pressure, gas to
   liquid flowrate ratio, pressure drop and flow mixing, on the separation
   of deuterium and further the separation of tritium. The modelling by the
   rate-based non-equilibrium, including design correlations of model of
   mass and heat transfers, chemical kinetic constants, mass transfer
   coefficients and overall exchange rate constants, allowed access to
   separation trends in a good agreement with published data. The synergy
   between the rates of chemical isotopic exchange and gas/liquid mass
   transfer, and by inference the performance of reactive stripping, was
   particularly sensitive to high temperatures, low hydrogen flow rates,
   pressure drops and internals properties. Extension to tritium confirmed
   a slightly slower mass transport compared with deuterium leading to
   potentially under-estimated design features for detritiation processing
   when deuterium is used instead. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Micropumps are finding more applications in biomedical fields. One
   application that holds great potential for micropumps is the treatment
   of glaucoma. Shunts are currently used in the treatment glaucoma. They
   lower intraocular pressure by passively increasing the outflow of
   aqueous humour from the anterior chamber in the eye. Nozzle/diffuser
   micropumps are an attractive alternative to shunts. They would provide
   both passive outflow and variable active outflow of aqueous humour as
   necessary. They would be able to overcome increases in flow resistance
   caused by biofouling and scar tissue growth. This study presents a proof
   of concept of a 1-mm-thick electromagnetic PDMS nozzle/diffuser
   micropump for biomedical applications. The pump is composed of a cast
   PDMS body, a spin coated PDMS membrane, and commercial silicone tubing,
   all bonded together with PDMS. Micromachining a pump cast enables
   multiple pumps to be produced quickly and reliably. An in-plane design
   is used to attach the inlet and outlet tubes. The pump produces a peak
   flow rate of 135 L/min and a maximum backpressure of 25 mm H2O at an
   actuation frequency of 12 Hz and a duty cycle of 25\%. The membrane
   thickness, actuator type, and duty cycle were shown to have a
   significant impact on the performance of the pump. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{6804-6813}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Graphene with heteroatom doping has found increasing applications in a
   broad range of catalytic reactions. However, the doping effects
   accounting for the enhanced catalytic activity still remain elusive. In
   this work, taking the triiodide electroreduction reaction as an example,
   we study systematically the intrinsic activity of graphene and explore
   the origin of doping-induced activity variation using first principles
   calculations, in which two typical N and S dopants are tested. The most
   common graphene structures, basal plane, armchair edge, and zigzag edge,
   are considered, and it is found that the former two structures show a
   weak adsorption ability for the iodine atom (the key intermediate in the
   triiodide electroreduction reaction), corresponding to a low catalytic
   activity. Doping either N or S can strengthen the adsorption and thus
   increase the activity, and the codoping of N and S (NS-G) exhibits a
   synergistic effect. A detailed investigation into the whole process of
   the triiodide electroreduction reaction at the CH3CN/NS-G interface is
   also carried out to verify these activity trends. It is found that the
   zigzag edges which contain spin electrons show a relatively stronger
   adsorption strength compared with the basal plane and armchair edge, and
   initial doping would result in the spin disappearance that evidently
   weakens the adsorption; with the disappearance of spin, however, further
   doping can increase the adsorption again, suggesting that the spin
   electrons may play a preliminary role in affecting the intrinsic
   activity of graphene. We also analyzed extensively the origin of
   doping-induced adsorption enhancement of graphene in the absence of
   spin; it can be rationalized from the electronic and geometric factors.
   Specifically, N doping can result in a more delocalized
   ``electron-donating area{''} to enhance I adsorption, while S doping
   provides a localized structural distortion, which activates the nearest
   sp(2)-C into coordinatively unsaturated sp(3)-C. These results explain
   well the improved activity of the doping and the synergistic effect of
   the codoping. The understandings are generalized to provide insight into
   the enhanced activity of the oxygen reduction reaction on heteroatom
   doped graphene. This work may be of importance toward the design of
   high-activity graphene based material.}},

Abstract = {{Solving microkinetics of catalytic systems, which bridges microscopic
   processes and macroscopic reaction rates, is currently vital for
   understanding catalysis in silica. However, traditional microkinetic
   solvers possess several drawbacks that make the process slow and
   unreliable for complicated catalytic systems. In this paper, a new
   approach, the so-called reversibility iteration method (RIM), is
   developed to solve microkinetics for catalytic systems. Using the
   chemical potential notation we previously proposed to simplify the
   kinetic framework, the catalytic systems can be analytically illustrated
   to be logically equivalent to the electric circuit, and the reaction
   rate and coverage can be calculated by updating the values of
   reversibilities. Compared to the traditional modified Newton iteration
   method (NIM), our method is not sensitive to the initial guess of the
   solution and typically requires fewer iteration steps. Moreover, the
   method does not require arbitrary-precision arithmetic and has a higher
   probability of successfully solving the system. These features make it
   similar to 1000 times faster than the modified Newton iteration method
   for the systems we tested. Moreover, the derived concept and the
   mathematical framework presented in this work may provide new insight
   into catalytic reaction networks.}},

   biomechanics of individuals with knee osteoarthritis during gait}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Leg length discrepancy greater than 1 cm increases odds of
   progressive knee osteoarthritis in the shorter limb.
   Methods: Biomechanical data of 15 knee osteoarthritis participants were
   collected while they walked under two conditions: (1) control - wearing
   thick sandals; (2) short limb - wearing a thin sandal on the
   osteoarthritic limb and a thick sandal on the contralateral limb. The
   thick and thin sandals had 1.45 cm of thickness difference. The knee
   osteoarthritis limb was analyzed for both conditions. Ankle, knee, hip,
   pelvis and trunk kinematics and moments were measured with a motion and
   force capture system. Principal component analysis and mean hypothesis'
   tests were used to compare the conditions.
   Findings: The short limb condition reduced rearfoot plantarflexioh in
   loading response and increased plantarflexion in late stance (p <
   0.001), increased ankle dorsiflexion moment (p = 0.003), increased knee
   flexion angle in loading response and delayed knee flexion in late
   stance (p = 0.001), increased knee extension moment in loading response
   and increased knee flexion moment in terminal stance (p = 0.023),
   reduced hip extension moment in early stance and reduced hip flexion
   moment in late stance (p < 0.001), reduced knee adduction moment (p =
   0.015), reduced hip adduction angle (p = 0.001) and moment (p = 0.012)
   and increased pelvic (p = 0.023) and trunk (p = 0.001) external
   rotation.
   Interpretation: Mild leg length discrepancy affects the entire kinetic
   chain of individuals with knee osteoarthritis during gait, increasing
   knee sagittal plane loading, which helps to explain why mild leg length
   discrepancy accelerates knee osteoarthritis progression. Mild leg length
   discrepancy should not be overlooked in knee osteoarthritis individuals.

   author(s) have a duty to report who has contributed to the work. This

   collection, analysis (including statistics), helping with the literature
   review and identifying suitable journals/conferences. In this opinion
   article we question whether these external services are required, given
   that institutions should provide this support and that experienced
   researchers should be qualified to carry out these activities. If these
   services are used, we argue that their use should at least be made
   transparent either by the consultant being an author on the paper, or by
   being acknowledged on the paper, dissertation or thesis. We also argue
   that publication consultants should provide an annual return that

Title = {{Determining the Presence of Scour around Bridge Foundations Using
   Vehicle-Induced Vibrations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Bridge scour is the number one cause of failure in bridges located over
   waterways. Scour leads to rapid losses in foundation stiffness and can
   cause sudden collapse. Previous research on bridge health monitoring has
   used changes in natural frequency to identify damage in bridge beams.
   The possibility of using a similar approach to identifying scour is
   investigated in this paper. To assess if this approach is feasible, it
   is necessary to establish how scour affects the natural frequency of a
   bridge, and if it is possible to measure changes in frequency using the
   bridge dynamic response to a passing vehicle. To address these
   questions, a novel vehicle-bridge-soil interaction (VBSI) model was
   developed. By carrying out a modal study in this model, it is shown that
   for a wide range of possible soil states, there is a clear reduction in
   the natural frequency of the first mode of the bridge with scour.
   Moreover, it is shown that the response signals on the bridge from
   vehicular loading are sufficient to allow these changes in frequency to
   be detected. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports an experimental investigation designed to assess the
   influence of near-surface moisture contents on permeation properties of
   alkali-activated slag concrete (AASC). Five different drying periods (5,
   10, 15, 20 and 25 days) and three AASC and normal concretes with
   compressive strength grades ranging from C30 to C60 were considered.
   Assessment of moisture distribution was achieved using 100 mm diameter
   cores with drilled cavities. Results indicate that air permeability of
   AASC is very sensitive to the moisture content and its spatial
   distribution, especially at relative humidity above 65\%. To control the
   influence of moisture on permeation testing, the recommendation of this
   paper is that AASC specimens should be dried in controlled conditions at
   40 degrees C for 10 days prior to testing. It was also concluded from
   this study that AASC tends to perform less well, in terms of air
   permeability and sorptivity, than normal concrete for a given strength
   grade. This conclusion reinforces the need to further examine AASC
   properties prior to its widespread practical use. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper a new control algorithm for position tracking of
   sinusoidal trajectories is introduced to improve the accuracy of a
   pneumatic actuator. A proportional valve is used to control the position
   of a rodded cylinder through a fuzzy logic (FL) approach with added
   velocity feedback (VF), f system lag compensator (LC) and friction
   compensator (FC). Parameters of the FL controller and the VF and FC
   compensators are tuned off-line manually. Parameters for the LC
   compensator are obtained by an on-line algorithm. Experimental results
   show that the proposed FL+VF+LC+FC controller is able to significantly
   improve tracking performance. The contribution of each component towards
   overall performance is carefully documented. The results compare
   favourably with the performance obtained with more advanced model-based
   algorithms as reported in the literature. The simpler non-model based
   nature of the controller together with the careful documentation of the
   algorithm and system performance, means that other researchers can
   readily evaluate the controller for their own applications.}},

   and low-waste alternative to conventional methods. Several studies have
   shown that the load capacity of this system is typically governed by
   punching shear strength, although no design-oriented equations have yet
   been developed to predict failure load or deflection at service. In this
   paper, two simple design equations are proposed for the ultimate load
   and stiffness of concrete deck slabs with SIP FRP forms, derived from
   the results of a comprehensive parametric study using a rigorous
   finite-difference computer model that is readily available. The
   equations were then validated by using experimental results from a
   database of 52 tests reported in the literature including FRP SIP forms
   of several shapes, sizes, surface treatments, spliced connections,
   boundary conditions, environmental exposures, and loading protocols. The
   equations showed an average predicted-to-experimental nominal strength
   of 87\% with a standard deviation of 19\%. When applying the design code
   member resistance factor of 0.75 consistent with shear failure of
   FRP-reinforced decks, a conservative strength was predicted for the
   entire database. Stiffness, on the other hand, was less accurately
   predicted; however, the model provided reliable and accurate indication
   of whether deflection limit is satisfied or not. (C) 2016 American

Abstract = {{Exceptionally preserved specimens of Ernietta in a shallow-marine gutter
   cast from southern Namibia reveal that all previously figured specimens
   of this iconic Ediacaran megafossil are incomplete, representing only
   the base of a larger and more complex organism. The complete organism is
   interpreted as comprising a buried, sand-filled anchor exhibiting the
   classical Ernietta morphology that passes distally into a trunk that is
   crowned by two facing fans that extended into the overlying water
   column. All parts of Ernietta, from the base of its buried anchor to the
   tip of its fans, appear to have been composed of a palisade of tubular
   elements that have been variably preserved. Similarity of tubule
   morphology despite the inherent difference in function between these
   constructions supports the view that these tubes were integral to all
   anatomical parts and functions of Ernietta. This style of architecture,
   construction and function is unique to the Erniettomorpha, supporting
   the view that it represents an extinct Ediacaran clade in the early
   evolution of multi-cellular life.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of track displacement during the passage of a train is
   an important parameter for the assessment of track condition. Digital
   image correlation (DIC) is a non-contact camera-based technology that
   can be used to measure these displacements. However, ground vibrations
   induced by the train can result in camera movement, adding error to the
   measured displacement. This paper presents a two-camera method that can
   account for the camera movement when measuring track displacements using
   DIC. The method is validated on a stationary track and then used to
   measure track displacement during the passage of two trains travelling
   at different velocities. The results of the two-camera method are then
   compared to the track displacements found using a low-pass filter. The
   two-camera method was found successfully to reduce error due to camera
   movement while removing the subjectivity of choosing a cut-off frequency
   for filtering.}},

Abstract = {{Yield locus measurements and their analytical descriptions has been the
   bases for modeling metal processing. These analytical descriptions play
   a role in models to predict limit strains observed during determination
   of forming limit diagrams of flat metal stock as means to evaluate their
   fabrication performance. Some of these analytical descriptions use the
   isotropic or anisotropic plastic potentials that take into account the
   crystallographic texture of the material. The applicability of such
   potentials is validated by comparing their predictions to that of
   unidirectional tensile data. In the current work, this approach is
   reversed to examine whether the constitutive relations, which replicate
   the measured stress strain diagrams, can generate a two-dimensional
   section of the yield locus. The strategy is to sum the computed plastic
   work (PW) from unidirectional mechanical tests in two principal
   directions which also accommodates the biaxial interaction strains. The
   resulting yield function includes f(theta) and f(phi), the prescribed
   stress ratios and the texture parameters R-phi and R-theta in their
   respective principal directions. The prescribed PW at an arbitrary
   strain during unidirectional tensile test is equated to the work sum
   from the biaxial stresses on the premise that the plastic flow -stress
   registers only the increasing density of obstacles it generates. The
   computed biaxial yield stresses showed good fits for AA5154 and AA5754
   with only small modification due to latent work hardening. (C) 2016 Acta

Title = {{Recycling combustion ash for sustainable cement production: A critical

Abstract = {{Combustion is a complex process that produces energy as the goal and
   ashes as by-products. The ash of coal, biomass. and solid waste
   combustion can be used as pozzolans in blended cement due to the
   similarity of their physiochemical properties to conventional pozzolans
   (e.g. silica fume). This strategy effectively recycles pozzolanic-active
   combustion ash and replaces a significant proportion of Portland cement,
   which potentially reduces the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cement
   production.. However, cement producers wishing to substitute
   pozzolanic-active ash for conventional pozzolans lack information on the
   pozzolanic activity (PA) of ash from diverse combustible materials. A
   data-mining model that can extract key information for predicting the PA
   of combustion ash is envisioned as a screening tool to assess the
   pozzolanic potential of candidate combustible materials prior to
   experimental work. Hence, the objectives of this chapter are, 1) to
   critically review the recent research progress in using various
   combustion ashes as pozzolans, including the mechanism of the pozzolanic
   reaction, sources of eligible materials, and methods of PA improvement,
   2) to create a data-mining artificial neural network (ANN) model for PA
   prediction built upon data reported in the scientific literature from
   1998 to 2015, and 3) to describe the effect of cement curing period on
   PA, based on a time series model. The ANN and time-series models
   developed in this study can accurately forecast the PA of combustion
   ashes during 3-90 d curing (R-2 = 0.8479-0.9914). We recommend these
   screening tools as rapid indicators of the pozzolanic potential of
   combustion ash prior to undertaking strength tests and other
   experimental testing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Melt viscosity is one of the main factors affecting product quality in
   extrusion processes particularly with regard to recycled polymers.
   However, due to wide variability in the physical properties of recycled
   feedstock, it is difficult to maintain the melt viscosity during
   extrusion of polymer blends and obtain good quality product without
   generating scrap. This research investigates the application of
   ultrasound and temperature control in an automatic extruder controller,
   which has ability to maintain constant melt viscosity from variable
   recycled polymer feedstock during extrusion processing. An ultrasonic
   modulation system has been developed and fitted to the extruder prior to
   the die to convey ultrasonic energy from a high power ultrasonic
   generator to the polymer melt. Two separate control loops have been
   developed to run simultaneously in one controller: the first loop
   controls the ultrasonic energy or temperature to maintain constant die
   pressure, the second loop is used to control extruder screw speed to
   maintain constant throughput at the extruder die. Time response and
   energy consumption of the control methods in real-time experiments are
   also investigated and reported this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Web openings could be used in cold-formed steel beam members, such as
   wall studs or floor joints, to facilitate ease of services in buildings.
   In this paper and its companion paper, a combination of tests and
   non-linear finite element analyses is used to investigate the effect of
   such holes on web crippling under end-one-flange (EOF) loading
   condition. The present paper includes a testing programme on web
   crippling of channel section and material tensile coupons, followed by a
   numerical study, where the models are firstly validated against the
   performed experiments. The results of 74 web crippling tests are
   presented, with 22 tests conducted on channel sections without web
   openings and 52 tests conducted on channel sections with web openings.
   In the case of the tests with web openings, the hole was either located
   centred above the bearing plates or having a horizontal clear distance
   to the near edge of the bearing plates. A non-linear finite element
   model is described, and the results compared against the laboratory test
   results; a good agreement between the tests and finite element analyses
   was obtained in term of both strength and failure modes. (C) 2016

   using validated finite element models from the companion paper, that
   investigates the effect of web hole and cross-section sizes. The holes
   are located either centred above the bearing plates or with a horizontal
   clear distance to the near edge of the bearing plates. It was
   demonstrated that the main factors influencing the web crippling
   strength are the ratio of the hole depth to the depth of the web, the
   ratio of the length of bearing plates to the flat depth of the web and
   the location of the holes as defined by the distance of the hole from
   the edge of the bearing plate divided by the flat depth of web. In this
   study, design recommendations in the form of web crippling strength
   reduction factor equations are proposed, which are conservative when
   compared with the experimental and finite element results. (C) 2016

Title = {{Towards building a universal defect prediction model with rank

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Software defects can lead to undesired results. Correcting defects costs
   50 \% to 75 \% of the total software development budgets. To predict
   defective files, a prediction model must be built with predictors (e.g.,
   software metrics) obtained from either a project itself (within-project)
   or from other projects (cross-project). A universal defect prediction
   model that is built from a large set of diverse projects would relieve
   the need to build and tailor prediction models for an individual
   project. A formidable obstacle to build a universal model is the
   variations in the distribution of predictors among projects of diverse
   contexts (e.g., size and programming language). Hence, we propose to
   cluster projects based on the similarity of the distribution of
   predictors, and derive the rank transformations using quantiles of
   predictors for a cluster. We fit the universal model on the transformed
   data of 1,385 open source projects hosted on SourceForge and GoogleCode.
   The universal model obtains prediction performance comparable to the
   within-project models, yields similar results when applied on five
   external projects (one Apache and four Eclipse projects), and performs
   similarly among projects with different context factors. At last, we
   investigate what predictors should be included in the universal model.
   We expect that this work could form a basis for future work on building
   a universal model and would lead to software support tools that
   incorporate it into a regular development workflow.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how events throughout the annual cycle interact to
   influence individual fitness and hence population dynamics is crucial to
   optimize conservation strategies for migratory birds. Despite major
   advancements in technology, direct tracking devices for passerine
   songbirds are still limited by the need for recapturing tagged
   individuals. Stable-isotope analysis of bird tissue has the opportunity
   to supply information on a larger number of individuals, although it is
   limited by the indirect knowledge of the geographical position of the
   birds. In this study, we provide a first attempt to combine annual
   spatio-temporal data achieved from direct tracking with information on
   local environmental conditions by using stable isotopes (delta C-13 and
   delta N-15). We use this approach to investigate if environmental
   conditions at the wintering area in southern Africa influence timing of
   spring migration and carry-over to affect breeding performance in a
   long-distance migratory passerine bird, the Red-backed Shrike (Lanius
   collurio). We found that individuals wintering in relatively moist
   conditions (depleted in delta C-13) and at lower latitudes (closer to
   the breeding grounds) departed later on spring migration than
   individuals in more xeric habitats. However, the effect of non-breeding
   area conditions and latitude were not found at subsequent migration
   stages and late departing individuals spent fewer days on migration
   towards the breeding grounds. Although conditions in the non-breeding
   range have previously been suggested to influence population
   fluctuations in Red-backed Shrikes, we found no evidence of a carry-over
   effect on breeding performance. This study highlights the potential of
   combining different approaches when investigating seasonal interactions
   in migratory animals.}},

Abstract = {{A non-hydrostatic wave model (SWASH) that phase-resolves the free
   surface and fluid motions in the water column is applied to investigate
   wave transformation and the spatial distribution of wave breaking over
   different morphological:features. The model is forced using observed
   directional energy spectra and results are compared to wave observations
   collected outside the surf zone using acoustic wave sensors, and over a
   100 m nearshore transect using high-frequency measurements of the sea
   surface from a LIDAR sensor mounted on the beach dune at the Field
   Research Facility in Duck, NC. The model is applied to four cases with
   different wave conditions and bathymetry, tested for sensitivity of
   model parameters to these different natural conditions, and used to
   predict the spatial variability in wave breaking and correlation between
   energy dissipation and morphologic features. Model results compare very
   well with observations of spectral evolution outside the surf zone, and
   generally well with the remotely sensed observations of wave
   transformation inside the surf zone with R = 0.85-0.93 for H-s along the
   cross-shore transect In particular the model is able to spatially
   resolve wave shoaling and dissipation at the shore break at the same
   location as observed in the LIDAR data. The results indicate that
   nearshore morphology has a significant effect on the spatial
   distribution of wave energy dissipation. Alongshore variability in
   bathymetry due to bars, rip channels, and larger morphological features
   such as the scour depression under the pier, causes large alongshore
   changes in cross-shore wave energy flux that influence the location and
   intensity of wave breaking. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Technical debt reduction using search based automated refactoring}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{183-194}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Software refactoring has been recognized as a valuable process during
   software development and is often aimed at repaying technical debt.
   Technical debt arises when a software product has been built or amended
   without full care for structure and extensibility. Refactoring is useful
   to keep technical debt low and if it can be automated there are obvious
   efficiency benefits. Using a combination of automated refactoring
   techniques, software metrics and metaheuristic searches, an automated
   refactoring tool can improve the structure of a software system without
   affecting its functionality. In this paper, four different refactoring
   approaches are compared using an automated software refactoring tool.
   Weighted sums of metrics are used to form different fitness functions
   that drive the search process towards certain aspects of software
   quality. Metrics are combined to measure coupling, abstraction and
   inheritance and a fourth fitness function is proposed to measure
   reduction in technical debt. The 4 functions are compared against each
   other using 3 different searches on 6 different open source programs.
   Four out of the 6 programs show a larger improvement in the technical
   debt function after the search based refactoring process. The results
   show that the technical debt function is useful for assessing
   improvement in quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Energy in today's short-range wireless communication is mostly spent on
   the analog-and digital hardware rather than on radiated power. Hence,
   purely information-theoretic considerations fail to achieve the lowest
   energy per information bit and the optimization process must carefully
   consider the overall transceiver. In this paper, we propose to perform
   cross-layer optimization, based on an energy-aware rate adaptation
   scheme combined with a physical layer that is able to properly adjust
   its processing effort to the data rate and the channel conditions to
   minimize the energy consumption per information bit. This energy
   proportional behavior is enabled by extending the classical system modes
   with additional configuration parameters at the various layers. Fine
   grained models of the power consumption of the hardware are developed to
   provide awareness of the physical layer capabilities to the medium
   access control layer. The joint application of the proposed energy-aware
   rate adaptation and modifications to the physical layer of an IEEE
   802.11n system, improves energy-efficiency ( averaged over many noise
   and channel realizations) in all considered scenarios by up to 44 \%.}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The predictive capability of high fidelity finite element modelling, to
   accurately capture damage and crush behaviour of composite structures,
   relies on the acquisition of accurate material properties, some of which
   have necessitated the development of novel approaches. This paper
   details the measurement of interlaminar and intralaminar fracture
   toughness, the non-linear shear behaviour of carbon fibre
   (AS4)/thermoplastic Polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) composite laminates and
   the utilisation of these properties for the accurate computational
   modelling of crush. Double-cantilever-beam (DCB), four-point end-notched
   flexure (4ENF) and Mixed-mode bending (MMB) test configurations were
   used to determine the initiation and propagation fracture toughness in
   mode I, mode II and mixed-mode loading, respectively. Compact Tension
   (CT) and Compact Compression (CC) test samples were employed to
   determine the intralaminar longitudinal tensile and compressive fracture
   toughness. V-notched rail shear tests were used to measure the highly
   non-linear shear behaviour, associated with thermoplastic composites,
   and fracture toughness. Corresponding numerical models of these tests
   were developed for verification and yielded good correlation with the
   experimental response. This also confirmed the accuracy of the measured
   values which were then employed as input material parameters for
   modelling the crush behaviour of a corrugated test specimen. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) provide a competitive
   technology for EV traction drives owing to their high power density and
   high efficiency. In this paper, three types of interior PMSMs with
   different PM arrangements are modeled by the finite element method
   (FEM). For a given amount of permanent magnet materials, the V-shape
   interior PMSM is found better than the U-shape and the conventional
   rotor topologies for EV traction drives. Then the V-shape interior PMSM
   is further analyzed with the effects of stator slot opening and the
   permanent magnet pole chamfering on cogging torque and output torque
   performance. A vector-controlled flux-weakening method is developed and
   simulated in Matlab to expand the motor speed range for EV drive system.
   The results show good dynamic and steady-state performance with a
   capability of expanding speed up to four times of the rated. A prototype
   of the V-shape interior PMSM is also manufactured and tested to validate
   the numerical models built by the FEM.}},

Abstract = {{GCL manufacturers recommend that composite liners (i.e., a geomembrane
   (GMB) over geosynthetic clay liner (GCL)) be covered in a timely
   fashion. This paper highlights the importance of following this
   recommendation by reporting on significant down-slope bentonite
   migration first noted at the Queen's University Environmental Liner Test
   Site (QUELTS) constructed in 2006 (QUELTS I). The down-slope erosion is
   attributed to thermal cycles that caused evaporation. of moisture from
   the GCL on sunny days (when the black geomembrane heated to 60-70
   degrees C) followed by condensation of moisture on the underside of the
   geomembrane at night when the geomembrane cooled. The condensed moisture
   would drip onto the GCL and run down-the slope. Repetition of this
   process over an extended period of time caused the erosion of bentonite
   at some locations in all four GCLs examined in the 3.7 years the liner
   was exposed before the full inspection of the GCL which detected the
   mechanism. A series of laboratory experiments confirmed that dripping of
   evaporative water could cause down-slope erosion in relatively few
   cycles. These tests also identified several GCL products with a high
   resistance to down-slope erosion prompting the desire to construct a
   second field study to examine the issue. Thus, in 2012, the liner system
   was removed and QUELTS II was constructed with a new series of 7
   composite liners. This paper highlights the key findings from these
   studies with particular emphasis on issues of importance to designers,
   regulators and installers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   from 3.3 to 5.0 mL/g for the geotextile component of the GCL and 10-16
   mL/g for the entire GCL. The diffusion of BPA through the GCL is also
   investigated and the diffusion coefficient is estimated to be 1.5 x
   10(-10) m(2)/s at a bulk void ratio of 4.4. The estimated parameters are
   used to study the potential mass transfer of BPA through a composite
   liner of a municipal solid waste landfill for a number of scenarios. The
   results show that HDPE geomembrane is an excellent diffusive barrier for
   BPA but the advective transfer of BPA through the composite liner needs
   to be limited by minimizing the number of holes and length of the
   wrinkles in the geomembrane. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of adding glycerol carbonate (GC) or propylene carbonate (PC)
   to sodium (Na)-bentonite on the hydraulic performance of geosynthetic
   clay liners (GCLs) under hypersaline conditions is examined. Fluid loss
   (FL), swell index (SI) and solution retention capacity (SRC)
   measurements were carried out to compare the potential hydraulic
   performance of these two cyclic organic carbonates (COCs) as bentonite
   modifiers. A modified FL test enabled quantitative measurement of both
   the water retention characteristics of untreated and COC modified
   bentonites as well as calculation of hydraulic conductivity values.
   Tests under aggressively saline conditions (ionic strength, I >= 1 M of
   NaCl and >= 3 M of CaCl2) showed that at a mass ratio of 1:1 (GC to
   bentonite), the FL of a GC-Na-bentonite was approximate to 40-104 mL in
   NaCl and approximate to 61-91 mL in CaCl2. This was about 10-20 mL and
   70-200 mL, respectively, lower than that of a comparable PC-Na-bentonite
   (1:1 PC to bentonite) and untreated Na-bentonite. Greater swelling (SI)
   and greater solution retention capacity (SRC) was observed for the GC
   treated Na-bentonite compared to untreated Na-bentonite in all salt
   solutions, and for PC-Na-bentonite at high ionic strength of both NaCl
   and CaCl2 solutions, demonstrating the superior hydraulic barrier
   performance of COC-bentonites under severely saline conditions.
   Experiments conducted in flexible-wall permeameters with I = 3 M CaCl2
   showed approximately one order of magnitude lower (similar to 10(-11)
   m/s vs similar to 1.9 x 10(-10) m/s) hydraulic conductivity of GC
   treated bentonite cake compared to the k value of the untreated
   Na-bentonite cake. Calculated hydraulic conductivity from fluid loss
   tests estimated the measured values in a conservative way

Abstract = {{Concrete construction and demolition leads to the generation of a
   significant amount of waste and CO2 emissions, which both have a
   negative impact on the environment. The use of recycled aggregate
   concrete (RAC) is one potential way to mitigate this impact but more
   research is required to understand its behaviour in shear for structural
   applications. The objective of this research was to compare the shear
   behaviour of reinforced RAC slabs to reinforced concrete slabs
   containing non-RAC, and to compare the crack development of each
   specimen through the use of digital image correlation and fibre optic
   sensing. One way-slab specimens constructed using 5 RAC mixes (3 coarse
   recycled concrete aggregate mixes with up to 30 \% replacement and 2
   granular recycled concrete aggregate mixes with up to 20 \% replacement)
   and a control concrete mix were tested to failure in 3 and 4 point
   bending. Load, displacement, distributed strain measurements, and
   digital images were collected throughout testing. The average peak shear
   forces of the RAC specimens were higher than that of the control
   specimens except for the specimens with the highest level of granular
   replacement (20 \%) which had a 14 \% reduction in shear capacity versus
   the control specimens. These specimens also exhibited shear cracking at
   lower loads compared to the control specimens as indicated by the
   digital image correlation and fibre optic measurements. Results from
   this research provide evidence that up to 30 \% coarse recycled concrete
   aggregate and 10 \% granular recycled aggregate may be incorporated into
   structural concrete mixtures without affecting the performance. However,
   concrete containing 20 \% volumetric replacement of the natural
   aggregate with granular recycled concrete aggregate may require special
   consideration. Digital image correlation and fibre optic sensing can be
   used to determine the cracking behaviour of reinforced concrete
   specimens.}},

Abstract = {{Spiropyran-containing polymer nanoparticles have found interesting

   latex nanoparticles have been prepared by using RAFT-mediated
   polymerization. Poly (dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA)-b-methyl

   surfactant (MRS) with molecular weight of 3390 g mol(-1). Afterwards, a
   series of photo-responsive latex nanoparticles of poly
   (MMA-co-spiropyranethylacrylate (SPEA))were prepared through emulsion
   polymerization in the presence of various amounts of MRS. Then the
   obtained nanoparticles were characterized. Nanoparticles of about 100 nm
   with narrow size distribution were obtained with photochromic response
   in the absorption wavelength of 500-650 nm. The prepared MRS could
   function as an actuator for repeatable dispersion/aggregation of the
   PMMA-based photo-responsive latex nanoparticles. The stimuli-responsive
   characteristics were investigated by multiple triggers including pH,
   CO2/N-2 and UV-Vis irradiation. The obtained latex responds to above
   triggers quickly by visual changes in color (acidochromism/basochromism)

Title = {{High resolution scanning optical imaging of a frozen polymer p-n
   junction}},

Abstract = {{Semiconductor homojunctions such as p-n or p-i-n junctions are the
   building blocks of many semiconductor devices such as diodes,
   photodetectors, transistors, or solar cells. The determination of
   junction depletion width is crucial for the design and realization of
   high-performance devices. The polymer analogue of a conventional p-n or
   p-i-n junction can be created by in situ electrochemical doping in a
   polymer light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC). As a result of doping
   and junction formation, the LECs possess some highly desirable device
   characteristics. The LEC junction, however, is still poorly understood
   due to the difficulties of characterizing a dynamic-junction device.
   Here, we report concerted optical-beam-induced-current (OBIC) and
   scanning photoluminescence (PL) imaging studies of planar LECs that have
   been frozen to preserve the doping profile. By optimizing the cell
   composition, the electrode work function, and the turn-on conditions, we
   realize a long, straight, and highly emissive p-n junction with an
   interelectrode spacing of 700 mu m. The extremely broad planar cell
   allows for time-lapse fluorescence imaging of the in situ
   electrochemical doping process and detailed scanning of the entire cell.
   A total of eighteen scans at seven locations along the junction have
   been performed using a versatile, custom cryogenic laser scanning
   apparatus. The Gaussian OBIC profiles yield an average 1/e(2) junction
   width of only 1.5 mu m, which is the smallest ever reported in a planar
   LEC. The controlled dedoping of the frozen device via warming cycles
   leads to an unexpectedly narrower OBIC profile, suggesting the presence
   and disappearance of fine structures at the edges of the frozen p-n
   junction. The results reported in this work provide new insight into the
   nature and structure of the LEC p-n junction. Since only about 0.2\% of
   the entire device area is photoactive in response to an incident optical
   beam, the effective junction width (or volume) must be dramatically
   increased to realize a more efficient device. Published by AIP
   Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a statistical approach for measuring the influence that a
   galaxy's closest companion has on the galaxy's properties out to
   arbitrarily wide separations. We begin by identifying the closest
   companion for every galaxy in a large spectroscopic sample of Sloan
   Digital Sky Survey galaxies. We then characterize the local environment
   of each galaxy by using the number of galaxies within 2 Mpc and by
   determining the isolation of the galaxy pair from other neighbouring
   galaxies. We introduce a sophisticated algorithm for creating a
   statistical control sample for each galaxy, matching on stellar mass,
   redshift, local density and isolation. Unlike traditional studies of
   close galaxy pairs, this approach is effective in a wide range of
   environments, regardless of how faraway the closest companion is
   (although a very distant closest companion is unlikely to have a
   measurable influence on the galaxy in question). We apply this
   methodology to measurements of galaxy asymmetry, and find that the
   presence of nearby companions drives a clear enhancement in galaxy
   asymmetries. The asymmetry excess peaks at the smallest projected
   separations (<10 kpc), where the mean asymmetry is enhanced by a factor
   of 2.0 +/- 0.2. Enhancements in mean asymmetry decline as pair
   separation increases, but remain statistically significant (1 sigma-2
   sigma) out to projected separations of at least 50 kpc.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the microscopic mechanisms of electronic excitation in
   organic photovoltaic cells is a challenging problem in the design of
   efficient devices capable of performing sunlight harvesting. Here we
   develop and apply an ab initio approach based on time-dependent density
   functional theory and Ehrenfest dynamics to investigate photoinduced
   charge transfer in small organic molecules. Our calculations include
   mixed quantum-classical dynamics with ions moving classically and
   electrons quantum mechanically, where no experimental external parameter
   other than the material geometry is required. We show that the behavior
   of photocarriers in zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and C-60 systems, an
   effective prototype system for organic solar cells, is sensitive to the
   atomic orientation of the donor and the acceptor units as well as the
   functionalization of covalent molecules at the interface. In particular,
   configurations with the ZnPc molecules facing on C-60 facilitate charge
   transfer between substrate and molecules that occurs within 200 fs. In
   contrast, configurations where ZnPc is tilted above C-60 present
   extremely low carrier injection efficiency even at longer times as an
   effect of the larger interfacial potential level offset and higher
   energetic barrier between the donor and acceptor molecules. An
   enhancement of charge injection into C-60 at shorter times is observed
   as binding groups connect ZnPc and C-60 in a dyad system. Our results
   demonstrate a promising way of designing and controlling photoinduced
   charge transfer on the atomic level in organic devices that would lead
   to efficient carrier separation and maximize device performance.}},

Abstract = {{This study considers amplify-and-forward two-way relay networks, where
   an energy constrained relay node harvests energy from the received
   radio-frequency signal. Based on time switching receiver, they separate
   the energy harvesting (EH) phase and the information processing (IP)
   phase in time. In the EH phase, three practical wireless power transfer
   policies are proposed: (i) dual-source (DS) power transfer, where both
   sources transfer power to the relay; (ii) single-fixed-source power
   transfer, where a fixed source transfers power to the relay; and (iii)
   single-best-source (SBS) power transfer, where a source with the
   strongest channel transfers power to the relay. In the IP phase, a new
   comparative framework of the proposed wireless power transfer policies
   is presented in two bi-directional relaying protocols, known as multiple
   access broadcast (MABC) and time division broadcast (TDBC). To
   characterise the performance of the proposed policies, new analytical
   expressions are derived for the outage probability, the throughput, and
   the system energy efficiency. Numerical results corroborate the authors'
   analysis and show: (i) the DS policy performs the best in terms of both
   outage probability and throughput among the proposed policies, (ii) the
   TDBC protocol achieves lower outage probability than the MABC protocol,
   and (iii) there exits an optimal value of EH time fraction to maximise
   the throughput.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of ordered and regularly shaped structures of colloidal
   particls with the aid of spatially nonuniform electric fields is a
   modern research area of great interest. This work illustrates how
   alternating current (AC) electrokinetic effects (dielectrophoresis,
   electroosmosis) can serve as contact-free templates, inside which
   colloidal micro spheres on assemble into a variety of shapes and sizes.
   We show how three-dimensional colloidal structures of square, circular,
   and diamond shape of many tens of micrometers in Size can be
   reproducibly formed with a single set of quadrupolar microelectrodes.
   Numerical simulations performed help to explain the role of AC
   electroosmosis and AC dielectrophoresis on the shaping of these
   structures as a function of applied voltage and frequency. We also
   demonstrate how the templating repertoire is further enhanced with the
   simultaneous application of a second, individually controlled AC
   electric field, which enables a variety of asymmetric colloidal
   structures to be produced using the same set of quadrupolar
   microelectrodes. As the preservation of shape and size of such
   electric-field templated structures after medium evaporation still
   remains a big challenge, here we also report,,On a novel method that

Abstract = {{A full understanding of the hydrodynamic processes within the jet
   produced by a manoeuvring ship's propeller is essential in the
   development and maintenance of ports, docks and harbours. In this
   investigation the predominant axial velocity component within a freely
   expanding wash was studied. The flow fields formed by four propellers,
   each operating at four power levels (speeds of rotation), were
   investigated under bollard pull conditions and in the absence of a
   rudder, within a large free surface tank using Laser Doppler Anemometry.
   The characteristics of these propellers extended the range over which
   high accuracy measurements have been previously attempted. Comparison
   were made to existing methodologies by which a prediction of the
   magnitudes of the axial velocity can be made, and where deficient
   modifications to the methodologies have been developed and presented.
   The jets were found to produce a maximum axial velocity along the
   initial efflux plane at a location near the blade mid-span. The position
   and magnitude of the axial velocity was seen to decrease as the jet
   entrained more flow and transitioned from the zone of flow establishment
   into the zone of established flow. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A novel cyclic sulfonium cation-based ionic liquid (IL) with an
   ether-group appendage and the bis \{(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl\}imide
   anion was synthesised and developed for electrochemical double layer
   capacitor (EDLC) testing. The synthesis and chemical-physical
   characterisation of the ether-group containing IL is reported in
   parallel with a similarly sized alkyl-functionalised sulfonium IL.
   Results of the chemical-physical measurements demonstrate how important
   transport properties, i.e. viscosity and conductivity, can be promoted
   through the introduction of the ether-functionality without impeding
   thermal, chemical or electrochemical stability of the IL. Although the
   apparent transport properties are improved relative to the
   alkyl-functionalised analogue, the ether-functionalised sulfonium
   cation-based IL exhibits moderately high viscosity, and poorer
   conductivity, when compared to traditional EDLC electrolytes based on
   organic solvents (propylene carbonate and acetonitrile). Electrochemical
   testing of the ether-functionalised sulfonium IL was conducted using
   activated carbon composite electrodes to inspect the performance of the
   IL as a solvent-free electrolyte for EDLC application. Good cycling
   stability was achieved over the studied range and the performance was
   comparable to other solvent-free, IL-based EDLC systems. Nevertheless,
   limitations of the attainable performance are primarily the result of
   sluggish transport properties and a restricted operative voltage of the
   IL, thus highlighting key aspects of this field which require further
   attention. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Delayed onset formulations for the peroxide-initiated crosslinking of a
   range of commodity polymers are described.
   4-Acryloyloxy-2,2,6,6,-tetramethylpiperidin-N-oxyl (AOTEMPO) is

   low density polyethylene (LLDPE), poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA),
   poly(ethylene-co-propylene) (EPR), and
   poly(ethylene-co-propylene-co-ethyl-idenenorbornadiene) (EPDM). However,
   the cure additive is inefficient for butadiene-based materials such as
   1,2-polybutadiene (vinyl-BR) and cis-1,4-poly(butadiene) (cis-BR), since
   macroradical trapping by AOTEMPO stunts diene-monomer oligomerization,
   thereby eliminating multiple crosslinks that cannot be restored by a
   single polymer-bound acrylate group. Additional crosslink yield losses
   arise from allylic alkoxyamine instability, the details of which are
   revealed by independent H-1 NMR and rheology studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Meierite, ideally Ba44Si66Al30O192Cl25(OH)(33), is a new mineral from
   the Gun claim, just south of the Itsi Range, Yukon, Canada. Meierite
   occurs as equant grains up to 200 mu m across, enclosed within large
   gillespite crystals. The mineral is transparent, has a vitreous luster,
   and is non-fluorescent. It has a white streak and Mohs hardness of
   approximately 51/2. It is brittle with no observed cleavage. The
   calculated density based upon the chemical formula and single-crystal
   unit-cell dimension is 3.50 g/cm(3). The mineral is optically isotropic
   (n = 1.598) Electron-microprobe composition (average of 11): SiO2 28.30,
   P2O5 1.61, Al2O3 11.75, TiO2 0.05, FeO 0.27, CaO 0.21, BaO 47.61, Na2O
   0.15, K2O 0.21, Cl 6.64, and a total of 95.29 wt.\%. The empirical
   formula (based on 192 framework O apfu) and charge balance
   considerations is: Ba41.1Ca0.5Fe0.5 Na0.7K0.6Si62.5Al30.5P3.0O192Cl24.8
   .33.4(OH). It is possible that additional H2O molecules are located
   within the cavities in the structure. Meierite is cubic, Im (3) over
   barm, a 18.5502(4) angstrom , V 6383.3(2) angstrom(3), and Z = 1. The 10
   most intense lines in the X-ray powder diffraction pattern are {[}d(obs)
   in angstrom(I)(hkl)]: 4.39(70)(411), 4.16(26)(420), 3.798(25)(422),

   2.629(31)(710), 2.323(46)(800), and 2.287(59)(741).
   The crystal structure (R = 4.1\% for 1393 F-o>4 sigma F) is a three
   dimensional framework of silicon-, aluminium-, and
   phosphorous-containing tetrahedra that create an open framework
   consisting of a large cubo-octahedral cavity connected by channels
   composed of double eight-membered rings and double six-membered rings.
   The aluminosilicate framework is isostructural with that observed for
   silicate framework type ZK-5 (KFI). The mineral is named in honor of
   Walter M. Meier (1926-2009), a pioneer in zeolite research.}},

Title = {{MINERALOGY AND METAL ZONING OF THE CAMBRIAN Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag-Au LEMARCHANT
   VOLCANOGENIC MASSIVE SULFIDE (VMS) DEPOSIT, NEWFOUNDLAND}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN MINERALOGIST}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{The Lemarchant deposit is a Cambrian bimodal felsic Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag-Au
   volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit located in the Central Mobile
   Belt, Newfoundland, Canada. Despite regional greenschist metamorphism
   and faulting, primary mineralogy and mineral textures are well
   preserved. The deposit is a type example of a precious metal-enriched
   VMS deposit in the Appalachians. Mineralization consists of a stratiform
   massive sulfide zone that lies at the contact between a rhyolitic
   footwall and a basaltic hanging wall. A stringer sulfide zone that is
   hosted in footwall rhyolite breccia underlies the massive sulfide lens.
   The stratiform sulfide zone contains massive baryte that is
   heterogeneously replaced by sphalerite and pyrite, lesser galena, and
   trace chalcopyrite. The stringer zone contains chalcopyrite, pyrite, and
   lesser sphalerite and galena. Sphalerite ranges in color from white
   (low-Fe) to red (high-Fe). The palest sphalerite (<1 mol.\% FeS) occurs
   in the baryte-rich stratiform zone and is associated with early stage
   exhalative mineralization, intermediate sulfidation epithermal suite
   minerals (tetrahedrite, bornite, colusite, Ag-bearing gold, covellite)
   and sulfide minerals enriched in the epithermal trace element suite (Au,
   Ag, As, Bi, Co, Cr, In, Mo, Ni, Sb, Sn, Te). Darker sphalerite (4.7-13.6
   mol.\% FeS) in the stratiform zone overprints early stage mineralization
   and occurs with chalcopyrite; high-Fe sphalerite is also present in the
   stringer zone.
   Early exhalative/epithermal-type VMS mineralization was deposited from
   low temperature (150-250 degrees C), oxidized, acidic to near-neutral
   hydrothermal fluids with high sulfur activity. Early mineralization was
   likely deposited in relatively shallow water (<1500 mbsl) that
   intermittently boiled and precipitated Au in the stratiform zone.
   Late-stage polymetallic, Cu-rich VMS mineralization was deposited from
   higher temperature (>300 degrees C), less oxidized, near-neutral
   hydrothermal fluids, likely in deeper water (>1500 mbsl). Abundant
   epithermal suite minerals and epithermal trace element suite-enriched
   sulfides at Lemarchant suggest a direct magmatic contribution to the
   hydrothermal fluid.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To clarify the most appropriate treatment regimen for
   congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO).
   Methods: A retrospective observational analysis was performed of
   patients undergoing probing with or without intubation to treat CNLDO in
   a single institution (Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast) from 2006 to
   2011.
   Results: Based on exclusion criteria, 246 eyes of 177 patients (aged 0
   to 9.8 years with a mean age of 2.1 years) were included in this study:
   187 (76\%) eyes had successful outcome at first intervention with
   primary probing, whereas 56 (23\%) eyes underwent secondary
   intervention. There were no significant differences by gender, age, or
   obstruction complexity between the successful and unsuccessful patients
   with first intervention. For those patients requiring secondary
   intervention, 16 of 24 (67\%) eyes had successful probing, whereas 22 of
   24 (92\%) had successful intubation. Patients with intubation as a
   secondary procedure were significantly more likely to have a successful
   outcome (P =.037). Statistical analysis was performed using the Fisher's
   exact test and Barnard's exact test.
   Conclusions: Primary probing for CNLDO has a high success rate that is
   not adversely affected by increasing age. This study also indicates that
   if initial probing is unsuccessful, nasolacrimal intubation rather than
   repeat probing yields a significantly higher success rate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method for the detection and classification of
   multiple events in an electrical power system in real-time, namely;
   islanding, high frequency events (loss of load), and low frequency
   events (loss of generation). This method is based on principal component
   analysis of frequency measurements and employs a moving window approach
   to combat the time-varying nature of power systems, thereby increasing
   overall situational awareness of the power system. Numerical case
   studies using both real data, collected from the U.K. power system, and
   simulated case studies, constructed using DigSilent PowerFactory, for
   islanding events, as well as both loss of load and generation dip
   events, are used to demonstrate the reliability of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Background To propose a human-operated in-room master-slave bevel-tip
   needle steering system under continuous MRI guidance for prostate
   biopsy, in which the patient is kept in the scanner at all times and the
   process of needle placement is under continuous control of the
   physician.
   Methods A 2-DOF MRI-compatible needle steering module is developed and
   integrated with an existing 4-DOF transperineal robot, creating a 6-DOF
   robotic platform for prostate interventions. An MRI-compatible 2-DOF
   master robot is also developed to enable remote needle steering. An
   MRI-compatible 2-DOF force/torque sensor was used on the master side.
   Bevel-tip needle steering is implemented in order to compensate for the
   targeting error due to needle-tissue interaction.
   Results MRI-compatibility results demonstrated maximum 20\% loss in
   signal to noise ratio (SNR). Robot functionality was not influenced by
   the magnetic field. Targeting error was reduced from 4.2 mm to 0.9 mm as
   a result of bevel-tip needle steering.
   Conclusions The feasibility of teleoperated bevel-tip needle steering
   using the proposed system was shown in a phantom experiment. Copyright

Title = {{Greener solvent systems for copper wire-mediated living radical
   polymerisation}},
Journal = {{GREEN MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Copper wire-mediated living radical polymerisation (LRP) is a powerful
   tool that provides numerous opportunities for the development of new
   materials. It requires very low catalyst loading and mild reaction
   conditions; however, it typically involves the use of organic solvents.
   The authors have investigated the use of greener solvent systems to
   replace traditional volatile organic solvents without detrimentally
   affecting polymerisation. The effects of these alternative solvents on
   the control over polymerisation and polymer characteristics were
   investigated for the polymerisation of methyl acrylate initiated by
   ethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate. Copper wire-mediated LRP was conducted in
   dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polypropylene
   glycol (PPG) and binary mixtures of PEG-DMSO, PEG-ethanol, PPG-DMSO and
   PPG-ethanol with total solvent volume fractions of 33 and 50\%.
   Secondary solvent fractions in the binary mixtures were examined at 10
   and 25\% of the total solvent volume. The two most effective greener
   solvent systems were 33\% v/v of 75\% PEG-25\% ethanol and 33\% v/v of
   75\% PPG-25\% ethanol. Both were shown to provide excellent control over
   polymerisation and a high degree of livingness. The poly(methyl
   acrylate) produced in these solvent systems retained high bromine
   chain-end functionality (>90\%) and low dispersity (similar to 1.1).}},

Title = {{The properties of the Malin 1 galaxy giant disk A panchromatic view from
   the NGVS and GUViCS surveys}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{593}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Context. Low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) represent a significant
   percentage of local galaxies but their formation and evolution remain
   elusive. They may hold crucial information for our understanding of many
   key issues (i.e., census of baryonic and dark matter, star formation in
   the low density regime, mass function). The most massive examples - the
   so called giant LSBGs - can be as massive as the Milky Way, but with
   this mass being distributed in a much larger disk.
   Aims. Malin 1 is an iconic giant LSBG - perhaps the largest disk galaxy
   known. We attempt to bring new insights on its structure and evolution
   on the basis of new images covering a wide range in wavelength.
   Methods. We have computed surface brightness profiles (and average
   surface brightnesses in 16 regions of interest), in six photometric
   bands (FUV, NUV, u, g, i, z). We compared these data to various models,
   testing a variety of assumptions concerning the formation and evolution
   of Malin 1.
   Results. We find that the surface brightness and color profiles can be
   reproduced by a long and quiet star-formation history due to the low
   surface density; no significant event, such as a collision, is
   necessary. Such quiet star formation across the giant disk is obtained
   in a disk model calibrated for the Milky Way, but with an angular
   momentum approximately 20 times larger. Signs of small variations of the
   star-formation history are indicated by the diversity of ages found when
   different regions within the galaxy are intercompared.
   Conclusions. For the first time, panchromatic images of Malin 1 are used
   to constrain the stellar populations and the history of this iconic
   example among giant LSBGs. Based on our model, the extreme disk of Malin
   1 is found to have a long history of relatively low star formation
   (about 2 M-circle dot yr(-1)). Our model allows us to make predictions
   on its stellar mass and metallicity.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving a high electrical conductivity with a low sintering
   temperature is an important goal in the development of solid oxide fuel
   cell electrolytes. Herein, nanoscale doped ceria materials
   Ce0.9Gd0.1-xBixO1.95 (x = 0 and 0.02-0.05) were prepared by the
   coprecipitation method for this purpose. Impedance spectroscopy analyses
   performed at 250 and 400 degrees C was employed to calculate sample's
   electrical conductivity, which were sintered at various temperatures.
   The electrical conductivity was observed to decrease with increasing
   sintering temperature. The optimal sintering temperature of
   Ce0.9Gd0.08Bi0.02O1.95 and Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 was 1300 and 1400 degrees C,
   respectively. The material Ce0.9Gd0.08Bi0.02O1.95 presented an
   electrical conductivity of 8.1 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 400 degrees C, i.e.,
   four times that of GDC (x = 0) sintered at 1400 degrees C (2.0 x 10(-4)
   S cm(-1) at 400 degrees C). It is believed that these effects results
   from the Schottky barrier height and oxygen vacancy concentration within
   the space charge layer changing with sintering temperature. This oxygen
   vacancy depletion in the space charge layer is also believed to account
   for the oversintering effect.}},

   energy industry development. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in advanced
   renewable energy technology spillover is promising to improve
   technological capability and promote China's energy industry performance
   growth. In this paper, the impacts of FDI renewable energy technology
   spillover on China's energy industry performance are analyzed based on
   theoretical and empirical studies. Firstly, three hypotheses are
   proposed to illustrate the relationships between FDI renewable energy
   technology spillover and three energy industry performances including
   economic, environmental, and innovative performances. To verify the
   hypotheses, techniques including factor analysis and data envelopment
   analysis (DEA) are employed to quantify the FDI renewable energy
   technology spillover and the energy industry performance of China,
   respectively. Furthermore, a panel data regression model is proposed to
   measure the impacts of FDI renewable energy technology spillover on
   China's energy industry performance. Finally, energy industries of 30
   different provinces in China based on the yearbook data from 2005 to
   2011 are comparatively analyzed for evaluating the impacts through the
   empirical research. The results demonstrate that FDI renewable energy
   technology spillover has positive impacts on China's energy industry
   performance. It can also be found that the technology spillover effects
   are more obvious in economic and technological developed regions.
   Finally, four suggestions are provided to enhance energy industry
   performance and promote renewable energy technology spillover in China.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the Holocene stratigraphic record and
   paleoenvironmental evolution of a large estuarine system, at high
   temporal and spatial resolution, in the context of changing climate, sea
   level, and hydrodynamics. New data are used to examine two time periods
   of increased marine influence within Pamlico Sound in northeastern North
   Carolina interpreted to be the result of extensive barrier island
   segmentation synchronous with periods of rapid climate change during the
   late Holocene. The study reveals the controls on the stratigraphic
   development and the highly dynamic character of the coastal system in
   response to climate, and sea-level change as it interacts with
   paleotopography. These findings can be used to inform projections of
   future environmental changes. Estuarine waters occupied paleovalleys in
   the Pamlico Sound region as early as ca. 7500 cal BP and Pleistocene
   interfluves separated the paleovalleys from the Atlantic Ocean until ca.
   5500 cal BP, when they were flooded by rising sealevel forming the
   broad, shallow Pamlico Sound. Initial barrier islands and shoals likely
   formed sometime between 5500 and 5000 cal BP, providing the geomorphic
   setting for continued estuarine conditions behind the barriers. At ca.
   4000 cal BP, an increase in marine influence and sand content is
   detected in multiple cores, and is correlated to seismic data within the
   Pamlico Sound basin. This change is interpreted to be the result of
   increased segmentation of barrier islands (thus a greater number of
   inlets, or wider inlets), which is consistent with a rapid transgression
   seen in other areas of the U.S. east coast. The segmentation may have
   been partially facilitated by a rapid increase in lagoonal area and
   tidal prism by overtopping of interfluves. Greater barrier island
   continuity is evident from 3500 to 1200 cal BP, as indicated by muddy
   deposits with low brackish estuarine foraminiferal assemblages. At ca.
   1200 cal BP, seismic, sedimentological and micropaleontological data
   suggest an increase in wave and current energy and marine influence
   throughout southeastern Pamlico Sound. These changes are interpreted to
   represent extensive segmentation of the barrier islands during the
   Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA). Since ca. 500 cal BP, the Pamlico Sound
   system has returned to a more restricted state, as inlets have closed.
   Currently only three major inlets segment the Outer Banks, the barrier
   island system fronting Pamlico Sound, but warming climate and increasing
   rates of sea-level rise suggest that another episode of barrier island
   segmentation began about a half century ago and appears that it may
   extend into the near future. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of organic films on gold employing N-heterocyclic carbenes
   (NHCs) has been previously shown to be a useful strategy for generating
   stable organic films. However, NHCs or NHC precursors typically require
   inert atmosphere and harsh conditions for their generation and use.
   Herein we describe the use of benzimidazolium hydrogen carbonates as
   bench stable solid precursors for the preparation of NHC films in
   solution or by vapour-phase deposition from the solid state. The ability
   to prepare these films by vapour-phase deposition permitted the analysis
   of the films by a variety of surface science techniques, resulting in
   the first measurement of NHC desorption energy (158 +/- 10 kJ mol(-1))
   and confirmation that the NHC sits upright on the surface. The use of
   these films in surface plasmon resonance-type biosensing is described,
   where they provide specific advantages versus traditional thiol-based
   films.}},

Abstract = {{Pplypropylene (PP)/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites are
   prepared by implementing noncovalent compatibilization. The
   compatibilization method involves PP matrix functionalization with
   pyridine (Py) aromatic moieties, which are capable of pi-pi interaction
   with MWCNT sidewalls. Imaging revealed that the addition of 25 wt\% of
   PP-g-Py to neat PP is capable of drastically reducing nanotube aggregate
   size and amount, compared to a matrix containing the equivalent amount
   of a maleated PP (PP-g-MA). Raman spectroscopy confirms improved
   polymer/nanotube interaction with the PP-g-Py matrix. The electrical
   percolation threshold appears at a MWCNT loading of approximately 1.2
   wt\%, and the maximum value of the electrical conductivity achieved is
   10(-2) S/m, irrespective of the functionalization procedure. The modulus
   of the composites is improved with the addition of MWCNTs. Furthermore,
   composites functionalized with Py display significant improvements in
   composite ductility compared with their maleated counterparts because of
   the improved filler dispersion. (C) 2015 Society of Plastics Engineers}},

   enhancement is consistent with a lack of young stars. This is the first
   result from the MADCASH survey, which is conducting a census of the
   stellar substructure and faint satellites in the halos of Local Volume

Abstract = {{A bit-error-rate (BER)-based physical layer security approach is
   proposed for the finite blocklengths. For secure communication in the

Abstract = {{In this work, a free space optical communication (FSO) link is proposed
   and utilized to explore and evaluate the FSO link performance under the
   joint occurrence of the atmospheric scattering and turbulence phenomena
   for 850 and 1550 nm operation. Diffraction and nondiffraction-limited
   systems are presented and evaluated for both wavelengths' operation,
   considering far-field conditions under different link distances. Bit
   error rate, pointing error angles, beam divergence angles, and link
   distance are the main performance indicators that are used to evaluate
   and compare the link performance under different system configurations
   and atmospheric phenomena combinations. A detailed study is performed to
   provide the merits of this work. For both far-field diffraction-limited
   and nondiffraction-limited systems, it is concluded that 1550 nm system
   operation is better than 850 nm for the whole presented joint
   occurrences of atmospheric scattering and turbulence. (C) 2016 Optical

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Although poly-3-hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and particularily
   medium-chain-length (mcl)-PHAs are likely to find industrial
   applications in a latex form, very few studies have examined their
   behavior in aqueous suspension and none have examined the dense
   suspensions required commercially. For this reason, the stability of
   mcl-PHA latexes containing saturated aliphatic (65 mol\%
   3-hydroxynonanoate, PHN), and for the first time, with vinyl (PHNU) or
   carboxylated side chains was examined. At 4 g L-1 with no stabilizing
   agent, PHNU nanoparticles (199.4 +/- A 3.6 nm) were significantly
   smaller than those of PHN (211.5 +/- A 6.4 nm) while carboxylated PHN
   nanoparticles (76.1 +/- A 6.4 nm) were substantially smaller than those
   of either PHN or PHNU with particles stable for more than 110 days.
   Increasing the PHN concentration to 10 g L-1 also resulted in stable
   latexes but with larger particles (410.8 +/- A 5.2 nm). Adjusting the pH
   of the suspending medium (water) before addition of the polymer
   (dissolved in acetone) resulted in much smaller PHN particles at pH =
   11.3 (134 +/- A 2 nm) than at pH = 4.3 (312 +/- A 8 nm) at a 4 g L-1
   final polymer concentration. Zeta potentials of PHN suspensions
   decreased with pH, likely due to the carboxyl end groups. Above a pH of
   4.0, adjusting the pH after particle formation had little effect. NaCl
   addition could be used to agglomerate and ultimately precipitate the
   particles. Stabilizers such as surfactants will likely be required to
   produce denser mcl-PHA latexes with suitable particle size for certain
   applications such as coatings and toner production.}},

Abstract = {{Elastomeric ionomers are prepared via halide displacement from
   brominated poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene) (BIIR) with various

   elastomer compounding approach is used to synthesize thermoset
   derivatives, in addition to a two-step process involving reaction of
   BIIR with 1-vinylimidazole (Vim), followed by peroxide-initiated cross
   linking. The physical properties of these ionomeric thermosets are the
   product of their covalent and ionic networks. Ion-pair aggregation
   contributes significantly to dynamic storage modulus and low-strain
   static tensile modulus, but extensive relaxation of this labile network
   minimizes its influence over timescales larger than 1 min. The adhesive

Abstract = {{Plastic pipes, tubes or catheters are extruded by pressure-driven flows
   through annular dies. Whereas die lands are straight, the section
   connecting the die land to the extruder either converges or diverges,
   converging when the product is smaller than the extruder barrel, and
   diverging when larger. In this paper, we carefully consider the
   converging or diverging connecting flows, in spherical coordinates, for
   the most common configuration: the Newtonian pressure-driven flow
   through the annulus between two coapical coaxial cones. We derive the
   exact analytical solution for the velocity profile, and then use this to
   arrive at the exact analytical solution for the temperature rise caused
   by viscous heating. We care about this rise because it often governs
   maximum throughput, since pipe makers must protect the melt from thermal
   degradation. We find that both the velocity profile, and the temperature
   profile, peak over the same conical surface and this surface is nearer
   the inner die wall. We also provide analytical expressions for the
   nonlinear pressure profile and the die cooling requirement. We find that
   this cooling requirement is always higher on the inner cone.}},

Abstract = {{Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) has been measured in MSW landfill
   leachate and its migration through a modern landfill liner has not been
   investigated previously. To assure environmental protection, it is
   important to evaluate the efficacy of landfill liners for controlling
   the release of PBDE to the environment to a negligible level. The
   partitioning and diffusion of a commercial mixture of PBDEs (DE-71:
   predominantly containing six congeners) with respect to a high-density
   polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane is examined. The results show that the
   partitioning coefficients of the six congeners in this mixture range
   from 700,000 to 7,500,000 and the diffusion coefficients range from 1.3
   to 6.0 x 10(-5) m(2)/s depending on the congener. This combination of
   very high partitioning coefficients and very low diffusion coefficients
   suggest that a well constructed HDPE geomembrane liner will be an
   extremely effective barrier for PBDEs with respect to diffusion from a
   municipal solid waste landfill, as illustrated by an example. The
   results for pure diffusion scenario showed that the congeners
   investigated meet the guidelines by at least a factor of three for an
   effective geomembrane liner where diffusion is the controlling transport
   mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The co-occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with heavy
   metals (HMs) is very common in contaminated soils, but the influence of
   HMs on fungal-bacterial synergism during PAH bioremediation has not been
   investigated. The bioremediation of fluoranthene-contaminated sand using
   co-cultures of Acremonium sp. P0997 and Bacillus subtilis showed
   increases of 109.4 and 9.8 \% in degradation compared to pure bacterial
   and fungal cultures, respectively, removing 64.1 +/- 1.4 \% fluoanthene
   in total. The presence of Cu2+ reduced fluoranthene removal to 53.7 +/-
   1.7 \%, while inhibiting bacterial growth, and reducing translocation of
   bacteria on fungal hyphae by 49.5 \%, in terms of the bacterial
   translocation ratio. Cu2+ reduced bacterial diffusion by 46.8 and 31.9
   \%, as reflected by D (a bulk random motility diffusional coefficient)
   and D (eff) (the effective one-dimensional diffusion coefficient)
   compared to the control without HM supplementation, respectively.
   However, Mn2+ resulted in a 78.2 +/- 1.9 \% fluoranthene degradation,
   representing an increase of 21.9 \%, while enhancing bacterial growth
   and bacterial translocation on fungal hyphae, showing a 12.0 \% increase
   in translocation ratio, with no observable impact on D and D (eff).
   Hence, the presence of HMs has been shown to affect fungal-bacterial
   synergism in PAH degradation, and this effect differs with HM species.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1510-1521}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The thermal conductivities of powdered and granular bentonite based
   needle punched geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) were investigated at
   different gravimetric water contents under 25, 50, 75, and 100 kPa
   vertical stresses. Both types of GCLs exhibited an increase in thermal
   conductivity with increasing vertical stress at all water contents. The
   effect of vertical stresses was more pronounced for the specimens
   hydrated at lower gravimetric water contents and this was attributed to
   their high initial volumetric air content. The variability of water
   distribution in partially hydrated GCLs has been identified as a factor
   that may affect their thermal conductivity. The forms of bentonites
   (i.e., powder or granular) affected their thermal conductivities;
   however, this effect was less apparent at higher gravimetric water
   contents due to the reduced air content and gel formation in the
   bentonites. Finally, the GCL thermal conductivity calculated from the
   measured thermal conductivities of its various constituents (i.e
   geotextile and bentonite) components differed from the measured values.
   This was attributed to the nonuniform water distribution across the GCL

Abstract = {{The injection stretch blow moulding process involves the inflation and
   stretching of a hot preform into a mould to form bottles. A critical
   process variable and an essential input for process simulations is the
   rate of pressure increase within the preform during forming, which is
   regulated by an air flow restrictor valve. The paper describes a set of
   experiments for measuring the air flow rate within an industrial ISBM
   machine and the subsequent modelling of it with the FEA package ABAQUS.
   Two rigid containers were inserted into a Sidel SBO1 blow moulding
   machine and subjected to different supply pressures and air flow
   restrictor settings. The pressure and air temperature were recorded for
   each experiment enabling the mass flow rate of air to be determined
   along with an important machine characteristic known as the `dead
   volume'. The experimental setup was simulated within the commercial FEA
   package ABAQUS/Explicit using a combination of structural, fluid and
   fluid link elements that idealize the air flowing through an orifice
   behaving as an ideal gas under isothermal conditions. Results between
   experiment and simulation are compared and show a good correlation.}},

Abstract = {{Intravitreal sustained delivery of corticosteroids such as dexamethasone
   is an effective means of treating a number of ocular diseases, including
   diabetic retinopathy, uveitis, and age-related or diabetic macular
   edema. There are currently marketed devices for this purpose, yet only
   one, Ozurdex, is degradable. In vitro release of dexamethasone from the
   Ozurdex device is limited to approximately 30 days, however. It was the
   objective of this study to examine the potential for prolonged and
   sustained release of a corticosteroid in vitro from a degradable polymer
   prepared from terminally acrylated star co- and ter-prepolymers composed
   of D,L-lactide, epsilon-caprolactone, and trimethylene carbonate
   co-photo-cross-linked with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate. Through
   manipulation of the network polymer glass transition temperature and
   degradation rate, a sustained release of triamcinolone was achieved,
   with an estimated release duration greater than twice that of the
   Ozurdex system. Moreover, a period of nearly constant release was
   obtained using a network prepared from 5000 Da star-poly(trimethylene
   carbonate-co-DwsxfertwgvdsaSET3,l-lactide) triacrylate (3:1 trimethylene
   carbonate:D,L-lactide) co-cross-linked with 700 Da poly(ethylene glycol

Abstract = {{Engineered cocrystals offer an alternative solid drug form with tailored
   physicochemical properties. Interestingly, although cocrystals provide
   many new possibilities, they also present new challenges, particularly
   in regard to their design and large-scale manufacture. Current
   literature has primarily focused on the preparation and characterization
   of novel cocrystals typically containing only the drug and coformer,
   leaving the subsequent formulation less explored. In this paper we
   propose, for the first time, the use of hot melt extrusion for the
   mechanochemical synthesis of pharmaceutical cocrystals in the presence
   of a meltable binder. In this approach, we examine excipients that are
   amenable to hot melt extrusion, forming a suspension of cocrystal
   particulates embedded in a pharmaceutical matrix. Using ibuprofen and
   isonicotinamide as a model cocrystal reagent pair, formulations extruded
   with a small molecular matrix carrier (xylitol) were examined to be
   intimate mixtures wherein the newly formed cocrystal particulates were
   physically suspended in a matrix. With respect to formulations extruded
   using polymeric carriers (Soluplus and Eudragit EPO, respectively),
   however, there was no evidence within PXRD patterns of either
   crystalline ibuprofen or the cocrystal. Importantly, it was established
   in this study that an appropriate carrier for a cocrystal reagent pair
   during HME processing should satisfy certain criteria including limited
   interaction with parent reagents and cocrystal product, processing
   temperature sufficiently lower than the onset of cocrystal T-m, low melt
   viscosity, and rapid solidification upon cooling.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical study of a linear compressor cascade to
   investigate the effective end wall profiling rules for highly loaded
   axial compressors. The first step in the research applies a correlation
   analysis for the different flow field parameters by a data mining over
   600 profiling samples to quantify how variations of loss, secondary flow
   and passage vortex interact with each other under the influence of a
   profiled end wall. The result identifies the dominant role of corner
   separation for control of total pressure loss, providing a principle
   that only in the flow field with serious corner separation does the does
   the profiled end wall change total pressure loss, secondary flow and
   passage vortex in the same direction. Then in the second step, a
   multiobjective optimization of a profiled end wall is performed to
   reduce loss at design point and near stall point. The development of
   effective end wall profiling rules is based on the manner of secondary
   flow control rather than the geometry features of the end wall. Using
   the optimum end wall cases from the Pareto front, a quantitative tool
   for analyzing secondary flow control is employed. The driving force
   induced by a profiled end wall on different regions of end wall flow are
   subjected to a detailed analysis and identified for their
   positive/negative influences in relieving corner separation, from which
   the effective profiling rules are further confirmed. It is found that
   the profiling rules on a cascade show distinct differences at design
   point and near-stall point, thus loss control of different operating
   points is generally independent.}},

Abstract = {{The penetration of the electric vehicle (EV) has increased rapidly in
   recent years mainly as a consequence of advances in transport technology
   and power electronics and in response to global pressure to reduce
   carbon emissions and limit fossil fuel consumption. It is widely
   acknowledged that inappropriate provision and dispatch of EV charging
   can lead to negative impacts on power system infrastructure. This paper
   considers EV requirements and proposes a module which uses owner
   participation, through mobile phone apps and on-board diagnostics II
   (OBD-II), for scheduled vehicle charging. A multi-EV reference and
   single-EV real-time response (MRS2R) online algorithm is proposed to
   calculate the maximum and minimum adjustable limits of necessary
   capacity, which forms part of decision-making support in power system
   dispatch. The proposed EV dispatch module is evaluated in a case study
   and the influence of the mobile app, EV dispatch trending and commercial
   impact is explored. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the highly competitive world of modern finance, new derivatives are
   continually required to take advantage of changes in financial markets,
   and to hedge businesses against new risks. The research described in
   this paper aims to accelerate the development and pricing of new
   derivatives in two different ways. First, new derivatives can be
   specified mathematically within a general framework, enabling new
   mathematical formulae to be specified rather than just new parameter
   settings. This Generic Pricing Engine (GPE) is expressively powerful
   enough to specify a wide range of standard pricing engines. Second, the
   associated price simulation using the Monte Carlo method is accelerated
   using GPU or multicore hardware. The parallel implementation (in OpenCL)
   is automatically derived from the mathematical description of the
   derivative. As a test, for a Basket Option Pricing Engine (BOPE)
   generated using the GPE, on the largest problem size, an NVidia GPU runs
   the generated pricing engine at 45 times the speed of a sequential,
   specific hand-coded implementation of the same BOPE. Thus, a user can
   more rapidly devise, simulate, and experiment with new derivatives
   without actual programming}},

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates topology optimization of energy absorbing
   structures in which material damage is accounted for in the optimization
   process. The optimization objective is to design the lightest structures
   that are able to absorb the required mechanical energy. A structural
   continuity constraint check is introduced that is able to detect when no
   feasible load path remains in the finite element model, usually as a
   result of large scale fracture. This assures that designs do not fail
   when loaded under the conditions prescribed in the design requirements.
   This continuity constraint check is automated and requires no
   intervention from the analyst once the optimization process is
   initiated. Consequently, the optimization algorithm proceeds towards
   evolving an energy absorbing structure with the minimum structural mass
   that is not susceptible to global structural failure. A method is also
   introduced to determine when the optimization process should halt. The
   method identifies when the optimization method has plateaued and is no
   longer likely to provide improved designs if continued for further
   iterations. This provides the designer with a rational method to
   determine the necessary time to run the optimization and avoid wasting
   computational resources on unnecessary iterations. A case study is
   presented to demonstrate the use of this method.}},

Title = {{Atomistic simulations of the formation of < c >-component dislocation
   loops in alpha-zirconium}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{478}},
Pages = {{125-134}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The formation of <c>-component dislocation loops in alpha-Zr is believed
   to be responsible for the breakaway irradiation growth experimentally
   observed under high irradiation fluences. However, while <c>-loop growth
   is well described by existing models, the atomic mechanisms responsible
   for the nucleation of <c>-component dislocation loops are still not
   clear. In the present work, both interstitial and vacancy <a>-type
   dislocation loops are initially equilibrated at different temperatures.
   Cascades simulations in the vicinity of the <a>-type loops are then
   performed by selecting an atom as the primary knock-on atoms (PKAs) with
   different kinetic energies, using molecular dynamics simulations. No
   <c>-component dislocation loop was formed in cascades simulations with a
   10 keV PKA, but <c>-component interstitial loops were observed after the
   interaction between discontinuous 50 keV PKAs and preexisting <a>-type
   interstitial loops. The comparisons of cascades simulations in volumes
   having preexisting <a>-type interstitial and vacancy loops suggest that
   the reaction between the PKAs and <a>-type interstitial loops is
   responsible for the formation of <c>-component interstitial loops. (C)

Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{133-145}},

Abstract = {{In establishing the reliability of performance-related design methods
   for concrete which are relevant for resistance against chloride-induced
   corrosion - long-term experience of local materials and practices and
   detailed knowledge of the ambient and local micro-climate are critical.
   Furthermore, in the development of analytical models for
   performance-based design, calibration against test data representative
   of actual conditions in practice is required. To this end, the current
   study presents results from full-scale, concrete pier-stems under
   long-term exposure to a marine environment with work focussing on XS2
   (below mid-tide level) in which the concrete is regarded as fully
   saturated and XS3 (tidal, splash and spray) in which the concrete is in
   an unsaturated condition. These exposures represent zones where concrete
   structures are most susceptible to ionic ingress and deterioration.
   Chloride profiles and chloride transport behaviour are studied using
   both an empirical model (erfc function) and a physical model (ClinConc).
   The time dependency of surface chloride concentration (C-s) and apparent
   diffusivity (D-a) were established for the empirical model whereas, in
   the ClinConc model (originally based on saturated concrete), two new
   environmental factors were introduced for the XS3 environmental exposure
   zone. Although the XS3 is considered as one environmental exposure zone
   according to BS EN 206-1:2013, the work has highlighted that even within
   this zone, significant changes in chloride ingress are evident. This
   study aims to update the parameters of both models for predicting the
   long term transport behaviour of concrete subjected to environmental
   exposure classes XS2 and XS3. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Radially aligned carbon nanotubes (A-CNTs) grown on micron-scale fibers
   promise structural composites with high mechanical performance and

   impregnation in a closed mold with and without clamping pressure. Two
   A-CNT lengths are investigated: 4-6 mu m and 17-19 mu m. A-CNTs were
   found to increase the distance between fibers, scaled by the A-CNT
   length. This ``swelling{''} resulted in an increased cross-sectional
   area, crimp and in-plane misalignment of the yarns. The laminate
   thickness doubled for laminates with long A-CNTs compared to shorter
   ones. The laminate with long A-CNTs produced under pressure showed a
   remarkable alteration of the internal structure. Fibers migrated within
   the fabric plane, filling almost completely the resin rich pockets.
   Further research is needed to understand the effect of these changes on
   the composite mechanical performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Strength and ductility of RC jacketed columns: A simplified analytical
   method}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{184-195}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Reinforced concrete (RC) jacketing is a common-method for retrofitting
   existing columns with poor structural performance. It can be applied in
   two different ways: if the continuity of the jacket is ensured, the
   axial load of the column can be transferred to the jacket, which will be
   directly loaded; conversely, if no continuity is provided, the jacket
   will induce only confinement action. In both cases the strength and
   ductility evaluation is rather complex, due to the different physical
   phenomena included, such as confinement, core-jacket composite action,
   preload and buckling of longitudinal bars.
   Although different theoretical studies have been carried out to
   calculate the confinement effects, a practical approach to evaluate the
   flexural capacity and ductility is still missing. The calculation of
   these quantities is often related to the use of commercial software,
   taking advantage of numerical methods such as fibre method or finite
   element method.
   This paper presents a simplified approach to calculate the flexural
   strength and ductility of square RC jacketed sections subjected to axial
   load and bending moment. In particular the proposed approach is based on
   the calibration of the stress-block parameters including the confinement
   effect. Equilibrium equations are determined and buckling of
   longitudinal bars is modelled with a suitable stress-strain law.
   Moment-curvature curves are derived with simple calculations. Finally,
   comparisons are made with numerical analyses carried out with the code
   OpenSees and with experimental data available in the literature, showing
   good agreement. (C) 2016 Elsevier. Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{122}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{An analytical model was developed to predict the flexural response, and
   determine the impact of various shear connector parameters on the
   behavior, of architectural partially-composite precast concrete
   insulated panels. The sandwich system incorporates two concrete wythes
   with expanded polystyrene foam and angled shear connectors in between.
   The model accounts for material nonlinearity and cracking and
   incorporates idealized load-slip relationships to determine the amount
   of shear force transferred between wythes, which controls the degree of
   composite action. The model agrees well with experimental results of a
   large database from literature, having an average difference in peak
   loads of 1.0\% with a standard-deviation of 13.4\%. A comprehensive
   parametric study investigated the effect of connector spacing, diameter,
   insertion angle, shear modulus of insulation, and connector material,
   namely steel and fiber-reinforced polymer, on the degree of composite
   action and hence on the load-deflection response. These parameters were
   also shown to critically affect failure mode, where a transition from a
   connector's material or pull-out failure to a flexural failure of the
   reinforced concrete wythe occurs. It was also shown that insulation bond
   alone contributes substantially, about 47\% composite action by
   strength. Finally, for design purposes, the model can estimate the size
   and spacing of shear connectors to give a desired degree of composite
   action. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The use of a passive treatment system for the mitigation of acid mine
   drainage at the Williams Brothers Mine (California): pilot-scale study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{116-125}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{A pilot-scale study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of using a
   passive treatment system to mitigate the acid mine drainage at the
   abandoned Williams Brothers Mine site, a remote site located in Sierra
   National Forest (California). The advantages of implementing passive
   treatment systems in remote or abandoned mine sites are their low energy
   and maintenance requirements compared to conventional systems. A
   pilot-scale system was designed and implemented at the site, which
   consisted of: (1) an aeration rock channel to facilitate oxidation of
   ferrous iron to ferric iron; (2) a sedimentation tank to collect iron
   oxyhydroxide precipitates that could lead to the clogging of the system;
   (3) a peat biofilter for the removal of dissolved iron and copper; (4) a
   sulphate-reducing bacteria reactor for the generation of alkalinity and
   consequent pH increase, and the removal of dissolved nickel, zinc, and
   residual dissolved iron and copper; and, (5) a re-aeration limestone
   channel to add alkalinity prior to effluent discharge into the natural
   receiving environment. The pilot-scale system was monitored over a
   17-month period (500 days from July 2007 to November 2008) and
   performance was determined by monitoring the pH, sulphate and dissolved
   metal concentrations of the influent acid mine drainage and the
   effluents from the peat biofilter and sulphate reducing bacteria
   reactor. A decrease in sulphate concentration was noted in the sulphate
   reducing bacteria reactor, suggesting sulphate reducing bacteria
   activity and alkalinity generation. The effluent pH from the system
   increased from as low as 4.5 to above 6.0, but remained below water
   quality objectives for the San Joaquin River Basin. Dissolved copper,
   nickel and zinc removal to below water quality objectives was noted in
   the peat biofilter to below water quality objectives. Dissolved iron and
   manganese removal was also observed in the sulphate reducing bacteria
   reactor. The feasibility of employing this system as a sustainable low
   cost and low maintenance treatment alternative at the Williams Brothers
   abandoned mine site to ensure that drainage effluent will meet water
   quality objectives showed promise. However, long-term monitoring would
   be required to demonstrate and ensure their long-term effectiveness. (C)

Abstract = {{As the relative performance of alkali activated slag (AAS) concretes in
   comparison to portland cement (PC) counterparts for chloride transport
   and resulting corrosion of steel bars is not clear, an investigation was
   carried out and the results are reported in this paper. The effect of
   alkali concentration and modulus of sodium silicate solution used in AAS
   was studied. Chloride transport and corrosion properties were assessed
   with the help of electrical resistivity, non-steady state chloride
   diffusivity, onset of corrosion, rate of corrosion and pore solution
   chemistry. It was found that: (i) although chloride content at surface
   was higher for the AAS concretes, they had lower chloride diffusivity
   than PC concrete; (ii) pore structure, ionic exchange and interaction
   effect of hydrates strongly influenced the chloride transport in the AAS
   concretes; (iii) steel corrosion resistance of the AAS concretes was
   comparable to that of PC concrete under intermittent chloride ponding
   regime, with the exception of 6 \% Na2O and Ms of 1.5; (iv) the
   corrosion behaviour of the AAS concretes was significantly influenced by
   ionic exchange, carbonation and sulphide concentration; (v) the increase
   of alkali concentration of the activator generally increased the
   resistance of AAS concretes to chloride transport and reduced its
   resulting corrosion, and a value of 1.5 was found to be an optimum
   modulus for the activator for improving the chloride transport and the
   corrosion resistance.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The sensitivity of magnetic Barkhausen noise to many factors has limited
   its potential application for basic material characterization and
   detection of residual stress in carbon steel, a common structural
   material. The present work investigates Barkhausen noise response in
   plain carbon steel under conditions of varying carbon content, applied
   elastic stress and different magnetization level. The surface Barkhausen
   noise measurement system uses a feedback for controlling the flux
   waveform, which facilitates reproducibility of measurements and also
   permits extraction of additional parameters from the B-H loop of
   magnetic circuit. Barkhausen noise parameters correlate with known
   material parameters, such as coercivity, which vary with carbon content
   and stress. These results demonstrate the potential for in-situ

Abstract = {{Damage accumulation in Mg AZ31-AZ80 alloy bi-crystals under fatigue
   loading at room temperature is studied using a modified version of the
   crystal plasticity finite element model of Abdolvand and Daymond. The
   model accounts for strain accommodation by both slip and tensile
   twinning, and is first shown to reasonably describe monotonic single
   crystal Mg experimental data from the literature. The high cycle fatigue
   behavior was then investigated in misoriented dissimilar alloy
   bi-crystals through stress-controlled simulations up to 1000 cycles.
   Nine different orientation combinations were simulated and the fatigue
   damage evolution, defined as the cumulative shear strain amplitude, were
   compared and analyzed. The bi-crystal geometry was used to simulate
   possible microstructure combinations occurring, for instance within an
   idealized friction stir weld. Findings suggest that when either of the
   alloy bi-crystal grains is oriented for basal slip, poor fatigue
   performance can occur by twinning or slip localization depending upon
   the neighboring orientation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A low cost flat plate solar collector was developed by using polymeric
   components as opposed to metal and glass components of traditional flat
   plate solar collectors. In order to improve the thermal and optical
   properties of the polymer absorber of the solar collector, Carbon
   Nanotubes (CNT) were added as a filler. The solar collector was designed
   as a multi-layer construction with an emphasis on low manufacturing
   costs. Through the mathematical heat transfer analysis, the thermal
   performance of the collector and the characteristics of the design
   parameters were analyzed. Furthermore, the prototypes of the proposed
   collector were built and tested at a state-of-the-art solar simulator
   facility to evaluate its actual performance. The inclusion of CNT
   improved significantly the properties of the polymer absorber. The key
   design parameters and their effects on the thermal performance were
   identified via the heat transfer analysis. Based on the experimental and
   analytical results, the cost-effective polymer-CNT solar collector,
   which achieved a high thermal efficiency similar to that of a
   conventional glazed flat plate solar panel, was successfully developed.

Abstract = {{Polymeric solids are effective absorbents in two-phase partitioning
   bioreactors (TPPBs) when they provide adequate absorptive capacity for
   the target solute, as well as the physical properties required by
   solid-liquid TPPB operations. This study demonstrates the influence of
   molecular weight distribution (MWD) on solute uptake, as measured by
   solute partition coefficient (PC), and mechanical strength, as measured
   by the polymer's complex modulus (G{*}). Experimental PC data for
   n-octanol absorption from aqueous solution by poly(dimethyl siloxane)
   (PDMS) demonstrate a decline in absorptive capacity with increasing
   number average molecular weight (M-n), in agreement with Flory-Huggins
   solution theory predictions. Importantly, MWD is shown to have no effect
   on solute uptake, with both unimodal and bimodal distributions
   generating the same PC at a given Mn. This is in contrast to G{*}, whose
   MWD sensitivity is exploited to formulate bimodal mixtures of
   poly(isobutylene) (PIB) that provide high n-octanol PC values as well as
   satisfactory material strength. This bimodal MWD strategy to TPPB
   absorbent design is extended to miscible solutions of high MW PIB and
   cyclohexylbenzene, which are shown to generate superior n-octanol PC at
   a given G{*}. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CARBON}},

Abstract = {{High-performance and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts play crucial
   roles in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Herein, a novel
   three-dimensional (3D) bifunctional electrocatalyst was prepared by
   embedding CoO nanoparticles into nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon
   nanofiber networks (denoted as CoO@N/S-CNF) through a facile approach.
   The carbon nanofiber networks were derived from a nano-structured
   biological material which provided abundant functional groups to
   nucleate and anchor nanoparticles while retaining its interconnected 3D
   porous structure. The composite possesses a high specific surface area
   and graphitization degree, which favors both mass transport and charge
   transfer for electrochemical reaction. The CoO@N/S-CNF not only exhibits
   highly efficient catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR) in alkaline media with an onset potential of about 0.84 V, but
   also shows better stability and stronger resistance to methanol than
   Pt/C. Furthermore, it only needs an overpotential of 1.55 V to achieve a
   current density of 10 mA cm(-2), suggesting that it is an efficient
   electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Delta E value
   (oxygen electrode activity parameter) of CoO@N/S-CNF is calculated to be
   0.828 V, which demonstrates that the composite could be a promising
   bifunctional electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The deposition of stiff and strong coatings onto porous templates offers
   a novel strategy for fabricating macroscale materials with controlled
   architectures at the micro- and nanoscale. Here, layer-by-layer assembly
   is utilized to fabricate nanocomposite-coated foams with highly
   customizable properties by depositing polymer-nanoclay coatings onto
   open-cell foam templates. The compressive mechanical behavior of these
   materials evolves in a predictable manner that is qualitatively captured
   by scaling laws for the mechanical properties of cellular materials. The
   observed and predicted properties span a remarkable range of
   density-stiffness space, extending from regions of very soft elastomer
   foams to very stiff lightweight honeycomb and lattice materials.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing the number of terminals in a cognitive radio network is known
   to improve the accuracy of cooperative spectrum sensing at the cost of
   reducing the useful communication time. This downside can be partially
   mitigated using decision-based fusion and/or sequential reporting. This
   paper proposes a novel selective decision-based cooperative spectrum
   sensing strategy that limits the reporting time to a single reporting
   slot with a possibility for retransmissions using automatic repeat
   request. The terminal with the highest energy estimate sends its local
   decision to the fusion center to make a final decision. Potential
   decoding errors are mitigated using threshold-based automatic repeat
   request. The performance of the proposed strategy is studied using
   rigorous mathematical analysis and intensive computer simulations.
   Results show observable performance enhancements compared with some
   benchmark strategies in terms of detection accuracy and agility.

Abstract = {{The MAJORANA collaboration is constructing the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR at
   the Sanford Underground Research Facility at the Homestake gold mine, in
   Lead, SD. The apparatus will use Ge detectors, enriched in isotope
   Ge-76, to demonstrate the feasibility of a large-scale Ge detector
   experiment to search for neutrinoless double beta decay. The long
   half-life of this postulated process requires that the apparatus be
   extremely low in radioactive isotopes whose decays may produce
   backgrounds to the search. The radioassay program conducted by the
   collaboration to ensure that the materials comprising the apparatus are
   sufficiently pure is described. The resulting measurements from
   gamma-ray counting, neutron activation and mass spectroscopy of the
   radioactive-isotope contamination for the materials studied for use in
   the detector are reported. We interpret these numbers in the context of
   the expected background for the experiment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A major weakness among loading models for pedestrians walking on
   flexible structures proposed in recent years is the various
   uncorroborated assumptions made in their development. This applies to
   spatio-temporal characteristics of pedestrian loading and the nature of
   multi-object interactions. To alleviate this problem, a framework for
   the determination of localised pedestrian forces on full-scale
   structures is presented using a wireless attitude and heading reference
   systems (AHRS). An AHRS comprises a triad of triaxial accelerometers,
   gyroscopes and magnetometers managed by a dedicated data processing
   unit, allowing motion in three-dimensional space to be reconstructed. A
   pedestrian loading model based on a single point inertial measurement
   from an AHRS is derived and shown to perform well against benchmark data
   collected on an instrumented treadmill. Unlike other models, the current
   model does not take any predefined form nor does it require any
   extrapolations as to the timing and amplitude of pedestrian loading. In
   order to assess correctly the influence of the moving pedestrian on
   behaviour of a structure, an algorithm for tracking the point of
   application of pedestrian force is developed based on data from a single
   AHRS attached to a foot. A set of controlled walking tests with a single
   pedestrian is conducted on a real footbridge for validation purposes. A
   remarkably good match between the measured and simulated bridge response
   is found, indeed confirming applicability of the proposed framework. (C)

   ligand (TMEDA), allows 2-alkynoates to be prepared in high yields by an

Abstract = {{We present high-resolution Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) H i
   observations and deep Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) optical
   imaging of two galaxy groups: NGC 4725/47 and NGC 3166/9. These data are
   part of a multi-wavelength unbiased survey of the gas-rich dwarf galaxy
   populations in three nearby interacting galaxy groups. The NGC 4725/47
   group hosts two tidal knots and one dwarf irregular galaxy (dIrr). Both
   tidal knots are located within a prominent H i tidal tail, appear to
   have sufficient mass (M-gas a parts per thousand 10(8) M-aS (TM)) to
   evolve into long-lived tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) and are fairly young
   in age. The NGC 3166/9 group contains a TDG candidate, AGC 208457, at
   least three dIrrs and four H i knots. Deep CFHT imaging confirms that
   the optical component of AGC 208457 is bluer - with a 0.28 mag g - r
   colour - and a few Gyr younger than its purported parent galaxies.
   Combining the results for these groups with those from the NGC 871/6/7
   group reported earlier, we find that the H i properties, estimated
   stellar ages and baryonic content of the gas-rich dwarfs clearly
   distinguish tidal features from their classical counterparts. We
   optimistically identify four potentially long-lived tidal objects
   associated with three separate pairs of interacting galaxies, implying
   that TDGs are not readily produced during interaction events as
   suggested by some recent simulations. The tidal objects examined in this
   survey also appear to have a wider variety of properties than TDGs of
   similar mass formed in current simulations of interacting galaxies,
   which could be the result of pre- or post-formation environmental
   influences.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{278-292}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Laser transmission joining (LTJ) is growing in importance, and has the
   potential to become a niche technique for the fabrication of hybrid
   plastic-metal joints for medical device applications. The possibility of
   directly joining plastics to metals by LTJ has been demonstrated by a
   number of recent studies. However, a reliable and quantitative method
   for defining the contact area between the plastic and metal,
   facilitating calculation of the mechanical shear stress of the hybrid
   joints, is still lacking. A new method, based on image analysis using
   ImageJ, is proposed here to quantify the contact area at the joint
   interface. The effect of discolouration on the mechanical performance of
   the hybrid joints is also reported for the first time. Biocompatible
   polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and commercially pure titanium (Ti)
   were selected as materials for laser joining using a 200 W CW fibre
   laser system. The effect of laser power, scanning speed and stand-off
   distance between the nozzle tip and top surface of the plastic were
   studied and analysed by Taguchi L9 orthogonal array and ANOVA
   respectively. The surface morphology, structure and elemental
   composition on the PET and Ti surfaces after shearing/peeling apart were
   characterized by SEM, EDX, XRD and XPS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Timing and carrier synchronization in wireless communication systems: a
   survey and classification of research in the last 5 years}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{Timing and carrier synchronization is a fundamental requirement for any
   wireless communication system to work properly. Timing synchronization
   is the process by which a receiver node determines the correct instants
   of time at which to sample the incoming signal. Carrier synchronization
   is the process by which a receiver adapts the frequency and phase of its
   local carrier oscillator with those of the received signal. In this
   paper, we survey the literature over the last 5 years (2010-2014) and
   present a comprehensive literature review and classification of the
   recent research progress in achieving timing and carrier synchronization
   in single-input single-output (SISO), multiple-input multiple-output
   (MIMO), cooperative relaying, and multiuser/multicell interference
   networks. Considering both single-carrier and multi-carrier
   communication systems, we survey and categorize the timing and carrier
   synchronization techniques proposed for the different communication
   systems focusing on the system model assumptions for synchronization,
   the synchronization challenges, and the state-of-the-art synchronization
   solutions and their limitations. Finally, we envision some future
   research directions.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The lengths of the telomere regions of chromosomes in a population of
   cells are modelled using a chemical master equation formalism, from
   which the evolution of the average number of cells of each telomere
   length is extracted. In particular, the role of the telomere-elongating
   enzyme telomerase on these dynamics is investigated. Weshow that for
   biologically relevant rates of cell birth and death, one finds a
   critical rate, R-crit, of telomerase activity such that the total number
   of cells diverges. Further, R-crit is similar in magnitude to the rates
   of mitosis and cell death. The possible relationship of this result to
   replicative immortality and its associated hallmark of cancer is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The goal of this study was to assess the experimental
   feasibility of circular multistatic holography, a novel breast microwave
   radar reconstruction approach, using experimental datasets recorded
   using a preclinical experimental setup. The performance of this approach
   was quantitatively evaluated by calculating the signal to clutter ratio
   (SCR), contrast to clutter ratio (CCR), tumor to fibroglandular response
   ratio (TFRR), spatial accuracy, and reconstruction time.
   Methods: Five datasets were recorded using synthetic phantoms with the
   dielectric properties of breast tissue in the 1-6 GHz range using a
   custom radar system developed by the authors. The datasets contained
   synthetic structures that mimic the dielectric properties of
   fibroglandular breast tissues. Four of these datasets the authors
   covered an 8 mm inclusion that emulated a tumor. A custom microwave
   radar system developed at the University of Manitoba was used to record
   the radar responses from the phantoms. The datasets were reconstructed
   using the proposed multistatic approach as well as with a monostatic
   holography approach that has been previously shown to yield the images
   with the highest contrast and focal quality.
   Results: For all reconstructions, the location of the synthetic tumors
   in the experimental setup was consistent with the position in the both
   the monostatic and multistatic reconstructed images The average spatial
   error was less than 4 mm, which is half the spatial resolution of the
   data acquisition system. The average SCR, CCR, and TFRR of the images
   reconstructed with the multistatic approach were 15.0, 9.4, and 10.0 dB,
   respectively. In comparison, monostatic images obtained using the
   datasets from the same experimental setups yielded average SCR, CCR, and
   TFRR values of 12.8, 4.9, and 5.9 dB. No artifacts, defined as responses
   generated by the reconstruction method of at least half the energy of
   the tumor signatures, were noted in the multistatic reconstructions. The
   average execution time of the images formed using the proposed approach
   was 4 s, which is one order of magnitude faster than the current
   state-of-the-art time-domain multistatic breast microwave radar
   reconstruction algorithms.
   Conclusions: The images generated by the proposed method show that
   multistatic holography is capable of forming spatially accurate images
   in real-time with signal to clutter levels and contrast values higher
   than other published monostatic and multistatic cylindrical radar
   reconstruction approaches. In comparison to the monostatic holographic
   approach, the images generated by the proposed multistatic approach had
   SCR values that were at least 50\% higher. The multistatic images had
   CCR and TFRR values at least 200\% greater than those formed using a
   monostatic approach. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists in

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{We present a modification of the integral length-scale approximation
   (ILSA) model originally proposed by Piomelli et al. {[}Piomelli et al.,
   J. Fluid Mech. 766, 499 (2015)] and apply it to plane channel flow and a
   backward-facing step. In the ILSA models the length scale is expressed
   in terms of the integral length scale of turbulence and is determined by
   the flow characteristics, decoupled from the simulation grid. In the
   original formulation the model coefficient was constant, determined by
   requiring a desired global contribution of the unresolved subfilter
   scales (SFSs) to the dissipation rate, known as SFS activity; its value
   was found by a set of coarse-grid calculations. Here we develop two
   modifications. We define a measure of SFS activity (based on turbulent
   stresses), which adds to the robustness of the model, particularly at
   high Reynolds numbers, and removes the need for the prior coarse-grid
   calculations: The model coefficient can be computed dynamically and
   adapt to large-scale unsteadiness. Furthermore, the desired level of SFS
   activity is now enforced locally (and not integrated over the entire
   volume, as in the original model), providing better control over model
   activity and also improving the near-wall behavior of the model.
   Application of the local ILSA to channel flow and a backward-facing step
   and comparison with the original ILSA and with the dynamic model of
   Germano et al. {[}Germano et al., Phys. Fluids A 3, 1760 (1991)] show
   better control over the model contribution in the local ILSA, while the
   positive properties of the original formulation (including its higher
   accuracy compared to the dynamic model on coarse grids) are maintained.
   The backward-facing step also highlights the advantage of the decoupling
   of the model length scale from the mesh.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the simplest relevant problem in the foaming of molten
   plastics: the growth of a single bubble in a highly viscous Newtonian
   fluid without interference from other bubbles. This problem has defied
   accurate solution from first principles. Classical approaches from first
   principles have neglected the temperature rise in the surrounding fluid,
   and we find that this oversimplification greatly accelerates growth
   prediction. We use transport phenomena to analyze the growth of a
   solitary bubble, expanding under its own pressure. We consider a bubble
   of ideal gas growing without the accelerating contribution from mass
   transfer into the bubble. We find that bubble growth depends upon
   nucleus radius and nucleus pressure. We begin with a detailed
   examination of the classical approaches. Our failure to fit data with
   these approaches sets up the second part of our paper, a novel
   exploration of the essential decelerating role of viscous heating. We
   explore both isothermal and adiabatic expansions, and also the
   decelerating role of surface tension. The adiabatic analysis accounts
   for the slight deceleration due to the cooling of the expanding gas,
   which depends on gas polyatomicity. We explore the pressure profile, and
   the components of the extra stress tensor, in the surrounding fluid.
   These stresses can be frozen into foamed plastics. We find that our new
   theory compares well with measured size, when the nucleus radius,
   nucleus pressure, and melt viscosity are fitted. We include a detailed
   dimensional worked example to help process engineers with foam design.}},

Title = {{Integrating Evidence From Systematic Reviews, Qualitative Research, and

   Intervention for People in the Retirement Transition}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Background: Integrating stakeholder involvement in complex health
   intervention design maximizes acceptability and potential effectiveness.
   However, there is little methodological guidance about how to integrate
   evidence systematically from various sources in this process. Scientific
   evidence derived from different approaches can be difficult to integrate
   and the problem is compounded when attempting to include diverse,
   subjective input from stakeholders.
   Objective: The intent of the study was to describe and appraise a
   systematic, sequential approach to integrate scientific evidence, expert
   knowledge and experience, and stakeholder involvement in the co-design
   and development of a complex health intervention. The development of a
   Web-based lifestyle intervention for people in retirement is used as an
   example.
   Methods: Evidence from three systematic reviews, qualitative research
   findings, and expert knowledge was compiled to produce evidence
   statements (stage 1). Face validity of these statements was assessed by
   key stakeholders in a co-design workshop resulting in a set of
   intervention principles (stage 2). These principles were assessed for
   face validity in a second workshop, resulting in core intervention
   concepts and hand-drawn prototypes (stage 3). The outputs from stages
   1-3 were translated into a design brief and specification (stage 4),
   which guided the building of a functioning prototype, Web-based
   intervention (stage 5). This prototype was de-risked resulting in an
   optimized functioning prototype (stage 6), which was subject to
   iterative testing and optimization (stage 7), prior to formal pilot
   evaluation.
   Results: The evidence statements (stage 1) highlighted the effectiveness
   of physical activity, dietary and social role interventions in
   retirement; the idiosyncratic nature of retirement and well-being; the
   value of using specific behavior change techniques including those
   derived from the Health Action Process Approach; and the need for
   signposting to local resources. The intervention principles (stage 2)
   included the need to facilitate self-reflection on available resources,
   personalization, and promotion of links between key lifestyle behaviors.
   The core concepts and hand-drawn prototypes (stage 3) had embedded in
   them the importance of time use and work exit planning, personalized
   goal setting, and acceptance of a Web-based intervention. The design
   brief detailed the features and modules required (stage 4), guiding the
   development of wireframes, module content and functionality, virtual
   mentors, and intervention branding (stage 5). Following an iterative
   process of intervention testing and optimization (stage 6), the final
   Web-based intervention prototype of LEAP (Living, Eating, Activity, and
   Planning in retirement) was produced (stage 7). The approach was
   resource intensive and required a multidisciplinary team. The design
   expert made an invaluable contribution throughout the process.
   Conclusions: Our sequential approach fills an important methodological
   gap in the literature, describing the stages and techniques useful in
   developing an evidence-based complex health intervention. The systematic
   and rigorous integration of scientific evidence, expert knowledge and
   experience, and stakeholder input has resulted in an intervention likely
   to be acceptable and feasible.}},

Abstract = {{Well-resolved numerical simulations of turbulent open channel flows are
   analyzed to evaluate the accuracy of the 2nd order structure function
   method (SFM) in estimating the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic
   energy within boundary layers. The objective is to assess the variation
   in the 2/3 Kolmogorov constants due to flow anisotropy with distance
   from the wall. Comparison of the dissipation calculated directly from
   the numerical data, with that from the SFM shows that usage of the
   canonical constants, based on the assumption of local isotropy, can
   result in considerable error (>50\%) in the prediction of dissipation
   when using the vertical or spanwise velocity components. From the
   numerically calculated dissipation, optimal Kolmogorov 2/3 constants
   were obtained and empirical relations, which account for near-wall
   effects, were proposed. Usage of the optimal constants will improve
   estimation of the dissipation rate when the SFM is applied to compute
   dissipation in geophysical boundary-layer flows.}},

Abstract = {{The development of the latest generation of wide-body carbon-fibre
   composite passenger aircraft has heralded a new era in the utilisation
   of these materials. The premise of superior specific strength and
   stiffness, corrosion and fatigue resistance, is tempered by high
   development costs, slow production rates and lengthy and expensive
   certification programmes. Substantial effort is currently being directed
   towards the development of new modelling and simulation tools, at all
   levels of the development cycle, to mitigate these shortcomings. One of
   the primary challenges is to reduce the extent of physical testing, in
   the certification process, by adopting a `certification by simulation'
   approach. In essence, this aspirational objective requires the ability
   to reliably predict the evolution and progression of damage in
   composites. The aerospace industry has been at the forefront of
   developing advanced composites modelling tools. As the automotive
   industry transitions towards the increased use of composites in
   mass-produced vehicles, similar challenges in the modelling of
   composites will need to be addressed, particularly in the reliable
   prediction of crashworthiness. While thermoset composites have dominated
   the aerospace industry, thermoplastics composites are likely to emerge
   as the preferred solution for meeting the high-volume production demands
   of passenger road vehicles. This keynote paper outlines recent progress
   and current challenges in the development of finite-element-based
   predictive modelling tools for capturing impact damage, residual
   strength and energy absorption capacity of thermoset and thermoplastic
   composites for crashworthiness assessments.}},

Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{The Livingstone Formation and the middle Opal Member of the Mount Head
   Formation of western Canada are Mississippian carbonate deposits, tens
   to hundreds of meters thick, that are interpreted to have accumulated in
   a mid-ramp, wave-dominated, sub-thermocline environment, at water depths
   up to 100 m or more. The rocks are predominantly pelmatozoan grainstones
   and packstones that contain abundant physical sedimentary structures.
   The most common sedimentary structures are planar lamination, swaly and
   hummocky cross-stratification, and normally graded event beds that are
   interpreted as having been formed by oscillatory (wave) currents or
   oscillatory-dominated combined flows. The abundant oscillatory currents
   are interpreted to have been generated by swell waves and to a lesser
   extent by local storms. High-angle, planar-tabular cross bedding is also
   present in rare, discrete beds produced by unidirectional
   offshore-directed currents. The unidirectional currents that produced
   the dunes are interpreted to have been generated by coastal set-up that
   produced downwelling storm currents during the rare storms that occurred
   along the Mississippian coastline. It is hypothesized that local storms
   were not common due to the west-coast location and the tropical latitude
   of the study area. Instead it is postulated that swell waves,
   approaching from the broad Panthalassa Ocean to the west, were
   responsible for most sediment remobilization and deposition across the
   mid and outer ramp. Swell waves are believed to have resuspended
   sediment to greater depths than short-period, less-organized storm
   waves. These Mississippian deposits suggest that in situ grain
   production on the ramp, without need for the offshore transport of
   sediment from the shoreface, resulted in two major differences from
   siliciclastic wave-dominated settings: 1) swaly cross-stratification was
   not restricted to environments shallower than hummocky
   cross-stratification on the upper shoreface, because sand-size sediment
   was generated across a large portion of the ramp; and 2) aggradation by
   means other than sediment supply from shallower water caused
   preservation of deep-water swell-dominated deposits.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of joint recovery of a bivariate Gaussian source
   and of interference over the two-user Gaussian degraded broadcast
   channel in the presence of common interference. The interference, that
   is available non-causally at the encoder, is assumed to be Gaussian and
   correlated to the sources. The tradeoff between the distortion of the
   sources and the interference estimation error is studied;
   information-theoretic outer and inner bounds based on ideas from
   rate-distortion theory and hybrid coding are derived, respectively. More
   precisely, the outer bound is found by assuming additional knowledge at
   each user; the inner bound, however, is obtained by analyzing the
   distortion of a layered hybrid scheme based on proper power splitting,
   Costa and Wyner-Ziv coding. Low delay and complexity coding schemes
   based on analog mapping are next proposed. More specifically, parametric
   mappings based on linear and sawtooth curves are studied and optimized
   by minimizing an upper bound on the system's distortion; nonparametric
   mappings based on joint optimization between the encoder and the decoder
   using an iterative algorithm are designed. Numerical results show that
   for the special cases that are previously considered by Abou Saleh et
   al. (with no fading), the derived outer bound is tighter and the
   proposed hybrid scheme has a lower complex structure with no loss in
   performance. In addition, the proposed low delay nonlinear schemes
   outperform the linear scheme and perform relatively close to the inner
   bound under certain system settings.}},

   Grid-Connected Inverters}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Inductive-capacitive-inductive (LCL)-type line filters are widely used
   in grid-connected voltage source inverters (VSIs), since they can
   provide substantially improved attenuation of switching harmonics in
   currents injected into the grid with lower cost, weight and power losses
   than their L-type counterparts. However, the inclusion of third order
   LCL network complicates the current control design regarding the system
   stability issues because of an inherent resonance peak which appears in
   the open-loop transfer function of the inverter control system near the
   control stability boundary. To avoid passive (resistive) resonance
   damping solutions, due to their additional power losses, active damping
   (AD) techniques are often applied with proper control algorithms in
   order to damp the LCL filter resonance and stabilize the system. Among
   these techniques, the capacitor current feedback (CCF) AD has attracted
   considerable attention due to its effective damping performance and
   simple implementation. This paper thus presents a state-of-the-art
   review of resonance and stability characteristics of CCF-based AD
   approaches for a digitally-controlled LCL filter-based grid-connected
   inverter taking into account the effect of computation and pulse width
   modulation (PWM) delays along with a detailed analysis on proper design
   and implementation.}},

Abstract = {{The Great Lakes Fishery Commission sponsored a 2-day workshop that
   sought to enhance the ability of Great Lakes agencies to understand,
   predict, and ideally manage fisheries production in the face of changes
   in natural and anthropogenic forcings (e.g., climate, invasive species,
   and nutrients). The workshop brought together 18 marine and freshwater
   researchers with collective expertise in aquatic ecology, physical
   oceanography, limnology, climate modeling, and ecosystem modeling, and
   two individuals with fisheries management expertise. We report on the
   outcome of a writing exercise undertaken as part of this workshop that
   challenged each participant to identify three needs, which if addressed,
   could most improve the ability of Great Lakes agencies to manage their
   fisheries in the face of ecosystem change. Participant responses fell
   into two categories. The first identified gaps in ecological
   understanding, including how physical and biological processes can
   regulate early life growth and survival, how life-history strategies
   vary across species and within populations, and how anthropogenic
   stressors (e.g., nutrient runoff, climate change) can interact to
   influence fish populations. The second category pointed to the need for
   improved approaches to research (e.g., meta-analytic, comparative,
   spatial translation) and management (e.g., mechanistic management
   models, consideration of multi-stock management), and also identified
   the need for improved predictive models of the physical environment and
   associated ecosystem monitoring programs. While some progress has been
   made toward addressing these needs, we believe that a continued focus
   will be necessary to enable optimal fisheries management responses to
   forthcoming ecosystem change. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V. on

   non-quasi-static and extrinsic parasitic effects) small-signal model for
   the optimized device has been presented. The comparison of Y-parameters
   of 2D ATLAS with overall modeled value (up to 20 GHz) has shown an
   excellent matching (with an average error of <= 5\%), whereas results
   from quasi-static (QS) predictive technology model (PTM) differ
   significantly (>20\%). Optimized underlap device shows transit time
   frequency f(T) and maximum frequency of oscillation f(MAX), similar to
   108 and similar to 130 GHz respectively, with noise figure (NF) similar
   to 2.8 dB and exhibits unilateral power gain (ULG) similar to 38 dB
   (V-OD = 90 mV, drain-to-source current I-DS similar to 0.64 mA and
   drain-to-source voltage V-DS = 1 V) at 20 GHz. Comparison with limited
   measured data suggest that simulated results are in well conformity,
   which suggest the possibility of use of underlap device technology in
   the design of key blocks such as low noise amplifier LNA and mixer for
   GHz applications.}},

Abstract = {{The stratigraphic organization of early synrift clastic successions is
   controlled by the rates of tectonic subsidence and the growth of the
   master faults, which, coupled with eustatic base level change, control
   the generation of accommodation. The 100- to 300-m (328- to
   984.2-ft)-thick, highly heterolithic Lower Jurassic upper Are and Tilje
   succession (Halten terrace, offshore Norway) represents an example of
   ancient synrift deposits that accumulated within a north northeast-south
   southwest-oriented structurally controlled embayment where sedimentation
   was strongly influenced by tidal currents but with significant river
   influence and minor wave action, except in exposed distal locations. The
   shallowing-upward, deltaic Tilje succession was deposited near the
   lowstand shoreline. The Tilje Formation consists of two tabular
   second-order sequences, each of which overlies structurally influenced
   sequence boundaries (SB2 and SB3 in local terminology) associated with
   rift-related tectonic pulses. The first pulse led to formation of SB2
   (shallow incision into the Are Formation) and caused a regional
   geomorphological change of the basin from an open, wave-dominated
   setting (upper Are Formation) to a funnel shaped, tide-dominated setting
   (Tilje Formation), in which the lower sequence 2 accumulated. Sequence 3
   rests erosively on sequence 2 and is characterized by proximal tidal
   deposits showing at least two main oblique to axial fluvial input points
   (north northwest and northeast), with an increase in wave influence and
   deepening toward the south. Local rapid subsidence of elongated, narrow
   hanging wall basins exerted a subtle control on the succession thickness
   and distribution of tidal fluvial distributary channels. The overall
   tabular geometry and internal architecture of the Tilje Formation is
   less complex than that of other tidal successions worldwide, showing
   lateral and vertical compartmentalization of the best tidal fluvial
   sandstone reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{In this work the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of several atom
   transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) techniques has been derived and

   (RSQSSA) methodology. The Quasi Steady State Approximation has been
   validated on the living radicals for normal, Simultaneous Reversible and
   Normal Initiation and Activators Regenerated by Electron Transfer
   (ARGET), and it is shown that the information lost due to its
   application is negligible. According to these results, RSQSSA shows the
   best performance in terms of wall-clock time and required memory in
   comparison to implicit techniques and Predici. In the case of the ARGET
   technique, the model predictions show good agreement with experimental
   data. Finally, an analysis on the impact of the slow and fast activation
   of the initiator on the MWD using ARGET has been carried out, indicating
   that the optimal initiator to control the MWD should exhibit
   activation-deactivation rates very similar to those of the polymeric

Abstract = {{Reinforced concrete infrastructure assets built during the last century
   are required to stay in-service beyond their intended design lives,
   which requires techniques that allow the effects of deterioration and
   overloading to be monitored to ensure these assets are still fit for
   purpose. One such indicator of distress in a reinforced concrete
   structure is crack movement; models have been proposed that allow the
   internal stresses within a structure to be estimated if crack width and
   slip can be measured. This paper introduces a technique that uses
   digital image correlation (DIC) to measure not only crack width but also
   crack slip. The effect of curvature on this measurement technique is
   discussed and a method for minimizing the errors due to curvature is
   presented. The technique is used to measure crack width and slip in
   reinforced concrete beams with both small crack slip and significant
   crack slip. The results suggest that the technique can be used to
   measure crack movement in beams once the effects of curvature are
   accounted for. Future research in this area will focus on development of
   this technique for use in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving low-temperature C=C bond activation has been of interest in

   Herein, taking the CH2CH2 combustion on spinel Co3O4(110) as an example,
   we report a systematic investigation on the C-C bond breaking processes
   using first principles calculations. An unexpected pathway for C-C
   cracking, called the valency-saturation-driven mechanism, is determined,
   and the high activity of Co3O4 in catalyzing CH2CH2 combustion at low
   temperature is rationalized. More importantly, some basic C-C bond
   activation rules on metal oxides with isolated single-atom sites, which
   differ from the traditional metal catalysis with multiatom active sites,
   are revealed. The understandings derived from this work may underpin the
   structure activity relationship in oxide catalysis.}},

Abstract = {{A complete catalytic cycle for methane combustion on the Co3O4(110)
   surface was investigated and compared with that on the Co3O4(100)
   surface on the basis of first-principles calculations. It is found that
   the 2-fold coordinated lattice oxygen (O-2c) would be of vital
   importance for methane combustion over Co3O4 surfaces, especially for
   the first two C-H bond activations and the C-O bond coupling. It could
   explain the reason the Co3O4(110) surface significantly outperforms the
   Co3O4(100) surface without exposed O-2c for methane combustion. More
   importantly, it is found that the cooperation of homogeneous multiple
   sites for multiple elementary steps would be indispensable. It not only
   facilitates the hydrogen transfer between different sites for the swift
   formation of H2O to effectively avoid the passivation of the active
   low-coordinated O-2c site but also stabilizes surface intermediates
   during the methane oxidation, optimizing the reaction channel. An
   understanding of this cooperation of multiple active sites not only
   might be beneficial in developing improved catalysts for methane
   combustion but also might shed light on one advantage of heterogeneous
   catalysts with multiple sites in comparison to single-site catalysts for
   catalytic activity.}},

Abstract = {{Hulun Lake, China's fifth-largest inland lake, experienced severe
   declines in water level in the period of 2000-2010. This has prompted
   concerns whether the lake is drying up gradually. A multi-million US
   dollar engineering project to construct a water channel to transfer part
   of the river flow from a nearby river to maintain the water level was
   completed in August 2010. This study aimed to advance the understanding
   of the key processes controlling the lake water level variation over the
   last five decades, as well as investigate the impact of the river
   transfer engineering project on the water level. A water balance model
   was developed to investigate the lake water level variations over the
   last five decades, using hydrological and climatic data as well as
   satellite-based measurements and results from land surface modelling.
   The investigation reveals that the severe reduction of river discharge
   (-364 +/- 64 mm/yr, similar to 70\% of the five decade average) into the
   lake was the key factor behind the decline of the lake water level
   between 2000 and 2010. The decline of river discharge was due to the
   reduction of total runoff from the lake watershed. This was a result of
   the reduction of soil moisture due to the decrease of precipitation (-49
   +/- 45 mm/yr) over this period. The water budget calculation suggests
   that the groundwater component from the surrounding lake area as well as
   surface run off from the un-gauged area surrounding the lake contributed
   similar to net 210 Mm(3)/yr (equivalent to similar to 100 mm/yr) water
   inflows into the lake. The results also show that the water diversion
   project did prevent a further water level decline of over 0.5 m by the
   end of 2012. Overall, the monthly water balance model gave an excellent
   prediction of the lake water level fluctuation over the last five
   decades and can be a useful tool to manage lake water resources in the
   future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of geomembrane colour and cover soil on solar-driven down-slope
   bentonite erosion from a GCL}},
Journal = {{GEOSYNTHETICS INTERNATIONAL}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{The surface temperature of an exposed composite liner consisting of a
   geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) covered by a black geomembrane (GMB) can
   routinely exceed 60 degrees C during summer solar exposure before
   falling to ambient air temperature at night. Observations at the Queen's
   University Environmental Liner Test Site (QUELTS) have recently shown
   that the evaporation and cooling of the air space at the GMB-GCL
   interface causes condensed water to form underneath the GMB. These water
   drops flow down-slope until they are released onto the top surface of
   the GCL at points of contact, seams, or changes in geomembrane
   curvature. An unforeseen consequence of this solar-driven generation and
   release of distilled water onto the GCL was discovered to be down-slope
   erosion of bentonite from the GCL. The objective of the current study
   was to repeat the QUELTS field exposure experiment to confirm whether
   the immediate covering of the GMB will supress the mechanism of
   down-slope bentonite erosion through the elimination of the air gap at
   the GMB-GCL interface and a reduction in thermal cycling. Further, this
   study examined whether the use of a white-coloured GMB can reduce the
   time to onset of erosion if immediate cover is not possible. Results
   confirm that no erosion occurred on the composite liner test section
   covered by 0.3 m of gravel after the 15 month duration of the study. In
   contrast, erosion was observed to occur on the exposed white GMB
   section, but at a slower rate than that observed on the exposed black
   GMB section. The timely placement of cover soil on the composite liner
   as per manufacturers' recommendations is therefore the most effective
   strategy to avoid the issue of down-slope bentonite erosion.}},

Abstract = {{Although visual surveillance has emerged as an effective technolody for
   public security, privacy has become an issue of great concern in the
   transmission and distribution of surveillance videos. For example,
   personal facial images should not be browsed without permission. To cope
   with this issue, face image scrambling has emerged as a simple solution
   for privacy-related applications. Consequently, online facial biometric
   verification needs to be carried out in the scrambled domain, thus
   bringing a new challenge to face classification. In this paper, we
   investigate face verification issues in the scrambled domain and propose
   a novel scheme to handle this challenge. In our proposed method, to make
   feature extraction from scrambled face images robust, a biased random
   subspace sampling scheme is applied to construct fuzzy decision trees
   from randomly selected features, and fuzzy forest decision using fuzzy
   memberships is then obtained from combining all fuzzy tree decisions. In
   our experiment, we first estimated the optimal parameters for the
   construction of the random forest and, then, applied the optimized model
   to the benchmark tests using three publically available face datasets.
   The experimental results validated that our proposed scheme can robustly
   cope with the challenging tests in the scrambled domain and achieved an
   improved accuracy over all tests, making our method a promising
   candidate for the emerging privacy-related facial biometric
   applications.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports the realisation of precision surface finish (Ra 30
   nm) on AISI 4340 steel using a conventional turret lathe by adapting and
   incorporating a surface defect machining (SDM) method {[}Wear, 302
   (2013) 1124-1135]. Conventional ways of machining materials are limited
   by the use of a critical feed rate (experimentally determined as 0.02
   mm/rev), beyond which no appreciable improvement in the machined quality
   of the surface is obtained. However, in this research, the novel
   application of an SDM method was used to overcome this minimum feed rate
   limitation ultimately reducing it to 0.005 mm/rev and attaining an
   average machined surface roughness of 30 nm. From an application point
   of view, such a smooth finish is well within the values recommended in
   the ASTM standards for total knee joint prosthesis. Further analysis was
   done using SEM imaging, white light interferometry and numerical
   simulations to verify that adapting SDM method provides improved surface
   integrity by reducing the extent of side flow, microchips and weidment
   during the hard turning process. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{In this paper, we envision future sensor networks to be operating as
   information-gathering networks in large-scale Internet-of-Things
   applications such as smart cities, which serve multiple users with
   diverse quality-of-information (QoI) requirements on the data delivered
   by the network. To learn data delivery paths that dynamically adapt to
   changing user requirements in this information-centric sensor network
   (ICSN) environment, we make use of cognitive nodes that implement both
   learning and reasoning in the network. In this paper, we focus on the
   learning strategies and propose two techniques, namely learning data
   delivery A{*} (LDDA{*}) and cumulative-heuristic accelerated learning
   (CHAL) that use heuristics to improve the success rate of data delivered
   to the sink in the cognitive ICSN. While LDDA{*} updates a single
   heuristic function to choose paths that can deliver data with good QoI
   to the sink, CHAL accumulates heuristic values from multiple
   observations from the environment to choose data delivery paths that are
   more resource aware and considerate toward the energy consumption of the
   network. Extensive simulations have shown improvement of about 40\% in
   the average rate of successful data delivery to the sink with the use of
   heuristic learning, when compared with a network that did not implement
   any learning.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, 38 push-through tests were performed on a precast
   concrete insulated sandwich panel design using combined angled and
   horizontal connectors. Basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP) and steel
   connectors were tested and compared. The key parameters were various
   inclination angles and diameters of connectors; orientation of the
   diagonal connector relative to loading (i.e.,tested in tension or
   compression); and panels with or without an active foam-to-concrete
   bond. Steel connectors failed by yielding in tension and inelastic
   buckling in compression. Larger-diameter BFRP connectors usually pulled
   out under tension and crushed in compression. Smaller-diameter BFRP
   connectors ruptured in tension and buckled in compression. Strength and
   stiffness increased with the connector angle and diameter. The
   insulation foam bond was found to contribute similarly regardless of
   connector material. An independent theoretical model accounting for
   material, bond, and stability failure modes, as well as geometric
   distortion attributable to relative slip, was developed. It provided an
   average test-to-predicted value of 1.15 with a standard deviation of
   0.25 for the strength of the shear connection system.}},

Title = {{Assessing Digital Elevation Model Uncertainty Using GPS Survey Data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SURVEYING ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The use of terrain and elevation data is critical for a number of
   applications in science and engineering. Typically, the quality of
   digital elevation models (DEMs) is assessed using external and
   independent point data sources to arrive at an overall RMS value for the
   errors. The utility of such a single-valued overall assessment depends
   on the spatial extent of the area under consideration and the terrain
   variability (both over time and space), as well as the application
   requirements. This paper aimed to understand the suite of parameters
   that are important to consider in deriving a DEM error budget.
   Specifically, terrain slope, land-cover type, information loss, and data
   measurement schemes were investigated. A region in western Canada
   spanning the Rocky Mountains was used to numerically quantify errors
   using two Global Positioning System (GPS) datasets: precise point
   positioning (PPP) profiles and GPS on benchmarks. Three digital
   elevation models {[}Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection
   Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model Version 2 (GDEM2),
   Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 1 Arc-Second Digital Elevation Model
   Version 3 (SRTM1v3), and Canadian Digital Elevation Model (CDEM)] were
   assessed. Results highlight the importance of selecting ground-control
   points based on the region's characteristics (e.g., slope, tree cover).
   This leads to more representative RMS values that improve DEM
   uncertainty estimations. Finally, a mathematical method {[}projection
   onto convex sets (POCS)] for filling data gaps in the GPS data profiles
   was implemented, and results demonstrate the utility of this approach
   over conventional interpolation schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospun nanofibers are a promising material for ligamentous tissue
   engineering, however weak mechanical properties of fibers to date have
   limited their clinical usage. The goal of this work was to modify
   electrospun nanofibers to create a robust structure that mimics the
   complex hierarchy of native tendons and ligaments. The scaffolds that
   were fabricated in this study consisted of either random or aligned
   nanofibers in flat sheets or rolled nanofiber bundles that mimic the
   size scale of fascicle units in primarily tensile load bearing soft
   musculoskeletal tissues. Altering nanofiber orientation and geometry
   significantly affected mechanical properties; most notably aligned
   nanofiber sheets had the greatest modulus; 125\% higher than that of
   random nanofiber sheets; and 45\% higher than aligned nanofiber bundles.
   Modifying aligned nanofiber sheets to form aligned nanofiber bundles
   also resulted in approximately 107\% higher yield stresses and 140\%
   higher yield strains. The mechanical properties of aligned nanofiber
   bundles were in the range of the mechanical properties of the native
   ACL: modulus=158 +/- 32 MPa, yield stress=57 +/- 23 MPa and yield
   strain= 0.38 +/- 0.08. Adipose derived stem cells cultured on all
   surfaces remained viable and proliferated extensively over a 7 day
   culture period and cells elongated on nanofiber bundles. The results of
   the study suggest that aligned nanofiber bundles may be useful for
   ligament and tendon tissue engineering based on their mechanical
   properties and ability to support cell adhesion, proliferation, and
   elongation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum coherent feedback control is a measurement-free control method
   fully preserving quantum coherence. In this paper we show how
   time-delayed quantum coherent feedback can be used to control the degree

   Pyragas-type feedback control where time-delayed signals are fed back
   directly into the quantum system. Our results show how time-delayed
   feedback can enhance or decrease the degree of squeezing as a function
   of time delay and feedback strength.}},

Abstract = {{The study assesses the impact of energy service provision in The Gambian
   settlement of Kartong through a qualitative study that employs immersion
   and mapping methods. In time for the 2013 Ramadan celebrations, the
   first 19 households are connected to a regional electricity grid.
   Shortly after a bus service is introduced that runs from Kartong to
   Banjul, the capital city of The Gambia. It provides a reliable
   alternative to so-called bush taxis that operate without a set schedule.
   While the provision of energy services including electricity and
   transport is recognized as important in supporting people's livelihoods,
   it poses questions about a shift from energy self-sufficiency to
   increased dependency on outside resources. Locally there is also an
   increased emphasis regarding inequality in accessing these services. For
   example, grid infrastructure is currently limited to the longer
   established parts of Kartong, putting households on the edge of the
   settlement in a disadvantaged position. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The integration of an ever-growing proportion of large-scale distributed
   renewable generation has increased the probability of maloperation of
   the traditional RoCoF and vector shift relays. With reduced inertia due
   to nonsynchronous penetration in a power grid, system-wide disturbances
   have forced the utility industry to design advanced protection schemes
   to prevent system degradation and avoid cascading outages leading to
   widespread blackouts. This paper explores a novel adaptive nonlinear
   approach applied to islanding detection, based on wide-area phase-angle
   measurements. This is challenging since the voltage phase angles from
   different locations exhibit not only strong nonlinear but also
   time-varying characteristics. The adaptive nonlinear technique, called
   moving window kernel principal component analysis, is proposed to model
   the time-varying and nonlinear trends in the voltage-phase angle data.
   The effectiveness of the technique is exemplified using DigSilent
   simulated cases and real test cases recorded from the Great Britain and
   Ireland power systems by the OpenPMU project.}},

Abstract = {{We present our analysis of HD 35502 based on high- and medium-resolution
   spectropolarimetric observations. Our results indicate that the magnetic
   B5IVsnp star is the primary component of a spectroscopic triple system
   and that it has an effective temperature of 18.4 +/- A 0.6 kK, a mass of
   5.7 +/- A 0.6 M-aS (TM), and a polar radius of
   \{+1.1\}\_\{-0.5\}\{\textbackslash{}rm R\}. The two secondary components
   are found to be essentially identical A-type stars for which we derive
   effective temperatures (8.9 +/- A 0.3 kK), masses (2.1 +/- A 0.2 M-aS
   (TM)), and radii (2.1 +/- A 0.4 R-aS (TM)). We infer a hierarchical
   orbital configuration for the system in which the secondary components
   form a tight binary with an orbital period of 5.668 66(6) d that orbits
   the primary component with a period of over 40 yr. Least-Squares
   Deconvolution profiles reveal Zeeman signatures in Stokes indicative of
   a longitudinal magnetic field produced by the B star ranging from
   approximately -4 to 0 kG with a median uncertainty of 0.4 kG. These
   measurements, along with the line variability produced by strong
   emission in H alpha, are used to derive a rotational period of 0.853
   807(3) d. We find that the measured i = 75 +/- A 5 km s(-1) of the B
   star then implies an inclination angle of the star's rotation axis to
   the line of sight of \{+6\}\_\{-10\}\{\}. Assuming the Oblique Rotator
   Model, we derive the magnetic field strength of the B star's dipolar
   component and its obliquity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
   calculated Alfv,n radius and Kepler radius place HD 35502's central B
   star well within the regime of centrifugal magnetosphere-hosting stars.}},

Abstract = {{Gate-tunable two-dimensional (2D) materials based quantum capacitors
   (QCs) and van der Waals heterostructures involve tuning transport or
   optoelectronic characteristics by the field effect. Recent studies have
   attributed the observed gate-tunable characteristics to the change of
   the Fermi level in the first 2D layer adjacent to the dielectrics,
   whereas the penetration of the field effect through the
   one-molecule-thick material is often ignored or oversimplified. Here, we
   present a multiscale theoretical approach that combines first-principles
   electronic structure calculations and the Poisson Boltzmann equation
   methods to model penetration of the field effect through graphene in a
   metal oxide graphene semiconductor (MOGS) QC, including quantifying the
   degree of ``transparency{''} for graphene two-dimensional electron gas
   (2DEG) to an electric displacement field. We find that the space charge
   density in the semiconductor layer can be modulated by gating in a
   nonlinear manner, forming an accumulation or inversion layer at the
   semiconductor/graphene interface. The degree of transparency is
   determined by the combined effect of graphene quantum capacitance and
   the semiconductor capacitance, which allows us to predict the ranking
   for a variety of monolayer 2D materials according to their transparency
   to an electric displacement field as follows: graphene > silicene >
   gerrnanene > WS2 > WTe2 > WSe2 > MoS2 > phosphorene > MoSe2 > MoTe2,
   when the majority carrier is electron. Our findings reveal a general
   picture of operation modes and design rules for the 2D-materials-based
   QCs.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional metal nanoparticle arrays are normally constructed at
   liquid oil interfaces by modifying the surfaces of the constituent
   nanoparticles so that they self assemble. Here we present a general and
   facile new approach for promoting such interfacial assembly without any
   surface modification. The method use salts that have hydrophobic ions of
   opposite charge to the nanoparticles, which sit in the oil layer and
   thus reduce the Coulombic repulsion between the particles in the organic
   phase, allowing the particles to sit in close proximity to each other at
   the interface. The advantage of this method is that because it does not
   require the surface of the particles to be modified it allows
   nonmetallic particles including TiO2 and SiO2 to be assembled into dense
   interfacial layers using the same procedure as is used for metallic
   particles. This opens up a route to a new family of nanostructured
   functional materials.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic (EM) tracking systems are highly susceptible to field
   distortion. The interference can cause measurement errors up to a few
   centimeters in clinical environments, which limits the reliability of
   these systems. Unless corrected for, this measurement error imperils the
   success of clinical procedures. It is therefore fundamental to
   dynamically calibrate EM tracking systems and compensate for measurement
   error caused by field distorting objects commonly present in clinical
   environments. We propose to combine a motion model with observations of
   redundant EM sensors and compensate for field distortions in real time.
   We employ a simultaneous localization and mapping technique to
   accurately estimate the pose of the tracked instrument while creating
   the field distortion map. We conducted experiments with six
   degrees-of-freedom motions in the presence of field distorting objects
   in research and clinical environments. We applied our approach to
   improve the EM tracking accuracy and compared our results to a
   conventional sensor fusion technique. Using our approach, the maximum
   tracking error was reduced by 67\% for position measurements and by 64\%
   for orientation measurements. Currently, clinical applications of EM
   trackers are hampered by the adverse distortion effects. Our approach
   introduces a novel method for dynamic field distortion compensation,
   independent from preoperative calibrations or external tracking devices,
   and enables reliable EM navigation for potential applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the electrochemical behavior of Fe(III) and Fe(II) couple
   on the pyrite surface was studied by application of the
   chronoamperometly technique in acidic solutions at room temperature and
   atmospheric pressure. The effect of the pyrite origin and the Fe(III)
   and Fe(II) ion concentration on the electron transfer kinetics of the
   Fe(III)/Fe(II) reaction was probed. Tafel behavior of the Fe(III)/Fe(II)
   couple redox reaction-under the test conditions was developed. The
   Fe(III)/Fe(II) reaction on the pyrite electrodes with different origins
   demonstrated a common mechanism, despite different kinetics. The
   exchange current densities of the redox reaction had the same magnitude
   of 10(-5) A cm(-2) for all samples. The value of cathodic transfer
   coefficients ranged between 0.4 and 0.5, while the lowest magnitude of
   anodic transfer coefficients was 0.23. It was shown that an increase of
   an order of magnitude of iron concentration did not have a significant
   effect on the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple redox reaction exchange current
   density nor on the value of cathodic transfer coefficients of the
   reaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Application and validation of a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model of
   a macrotidal salt marsh}},
Journal = {{COASTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{35-46}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model is used to study the relative
   influence of salt marsh vegetation on flows in a macrotidal estuary
   using a system of three connected grids that resolve currents in tidal
   drainage channels incised in a marsh platform. The model incorporates
   the effects of vegetation on flow drag, parameterized by the stem
   height, diameter and plant density. Model predictions are compared to
   novel field observations of macrotidal water levels and tidal currents
   using pressure and acoustic current sensors over 6 tidal cycles at
   spring tide, collected in areas of different roughness corresponding to
   high marsh grass (Spartina patens), low marsh grass (Spartina
   alterniflora), and a muddy tidal channel bed. High resolution airborne
   Lidar and multibeam bathymetry data are used to define the bathymetry
   and spatially-variable vegetation maps in the multi-domain model. A
   detailed comparison between field observations and model results is
   presented, necessary for model validation in this macrotidal environment
   with large water level gradients and high sensitivity to model input
   parameter values. The model results indicate that the vegetation plays a
   major role in controlling flow speed and drainage patterns, especially
   over the macrotidal marsh platform. Differences in flow resistance
   between vegetated and un-vegetated areas result in faster flows over
   un-vegetated areas, with vegetated areas having flow directions locally
   perpendicular to channels as water levels exceed creek bank elevations
   and the marsh platform is flooded. Including the marsh grasses in the
   model causes stronger near-surface currents, significantly weaker
   near-bed currents, and concentrated flows in the channels resulting in
   strong vertical variation in the horizontal flow. The results indicate
   that including the effects of vegetation in a numerical model is crucial
   in simulating the hydrodynamic conditions over macrotidal salt marsh
   platforms and in channels. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{VACUUM}},

Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{63-71}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Composites of Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) and Graphene
   Nanoplatelets (GNPs) were processed using a twin screw extruder under
   different extrusion conditions. The effects of screw speed, feeder speed
   and GNP content on the electrical, thermal and mechanical properties of
   composites were investigated. The inclusion of GNPs in the matrix
   improved the thermal stability and conductivity by 2.7\% and 43\%,
   respectively. The electrical conductivity improved from 10(-11) to
   10(-5) S/m at 150 rpm due to the high thermal stability of the GNPs and
   the formation of phonon and charge carrier networks in the polymer
   matrix. Higher extruder speeds result in a better distribution of the
   GNPs in the matrix and a significant increase in thermal stability and
   thermal conductivity. However, this effect is not significant for the
   electrical conductivity and tensile strength. The addition of GNPs
   increased the viscosity of the polymer, which will lead to higher
   processing power requirements. Increasing the extruder speed led to a
   reduction in viscosity, which is due to thermal degradation and/or chain
   scission. Thus, while high speeds result in better dispersions, the
   speed needs to be optimized to prevent detrimental impacts on the
   properties. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of Internet-of-Things (IoT), face scrambling
   has been proposed for privacy protection during IoT-targeted image/video
   distribution. Consequently, in these IoT applications, biometric
   verification needs to be carried out in the scrambled domain, presenting
   significant challenges in face recognition. Since face models become
   chaotic signals after scrambling/encryption, a typical solution is to
   utilize the traditional data-driven face recognition algorithms. While
   chaotic pattern recognition is still a challenging task, in this paper,
   we propose a new ensemble approach-many-kernel random discriminant
   analysis (MK-RDA)-to discover discriminative patterns from the chaotic
   signals. We also incorporate a salience-aware strategy into the proposed
   ensemble method to handle the chaotic facial patterns in the scrambled
   domain, where the random selections of features are made on semantic
   components via salience modeling. In our experiments, the proposed
   MK-RDA was tested rigorously on three human face data sets: the ORL face
   data set, the PIE face data set, and the PUBFIG wild face data set. The
   experimental results successfully demonstrate that the proposed scheme
   can effectively handle the chaotic signals and significantly improve the
   recognition accuracy, making our method a promising candidate for secure
   biometric verification in the emerging IoT applications.}},

Title = {{A nonlinear modeling approach using weighted piecewise series and its
   applications to predict unsteady flows}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{318}},
Pages = {{58-84}},

Abstract = {{To preserve nonlinearity of a full-order system over a range of
   parameters of interest, we propose an accurate and robust nonlinear
   modeling approach by assembling a set of piecewise linear local
   solutions expanded about some sampling states. The work by Rewienski and
   White {[}1] on micromachined devices inspired our use of piecewise
   linear local solutions to study nonlinear unsteady aerodynamics. These
   local approximations are assembled via nonlinear weights of radial basis
   functions. The efficacy of the proposed procedure is validated for a
   two-dimensional airfoil moving with different pitching motions,
   specifically AGARD's CT2 and CT5 problems {[}27], in which the flows
   exhibit different nonlinear behaviors. Furthermore, application of the
   developed aerodynamic model to a two-dimensional aero-elastic system
   proves the approach is capable of predicting limit cycle oscillations
   (LCOs) by using AGARD's CT6 {[}28] as a benchmark test. All results,
   based on inviscid solutions, confirm that our nonlinear model is stable
   and accurate, against the full model solutions and measurements, and for
   predicting not only aerodynamic forces but also detailed flowfields.
   Moreover, the model is robust for inputs that considerably depart from
   the base trajectory in form and magnitude. This modeling provides a very
   efficient way for predicting unsteady flowfields with varying parameters
   because it needs only a tiny fraction of the cost of a full-order
   modeling for each new condition-the more cases studied, the more savings
   rendered. Hence, the present approach is especially useful for
   parametric studies, such as in the case of design optimization and
   exploration of flow phenomena. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new approach to optimally design LLC converters.
   The core of the proposed approach is an accurate algorithm that can find
   all the possible designs satisfying the peak-gain requirement. Designers
   can conveniently evaluate several design results and find the optimal
   one for their respective applications. Part II of this paper discusses
   design considerations and procedure using the proposed algorithm. Case
   studies reveal different design tradeoffs in different application
   scenarios. A 384-V nominal 300-V minimum input voltage range 12-V/50-A
   output LLC converter prototype with 97.3\% peak efficiency is built to
   verify the proposed design algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The Ran GTPase protein is a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (GNBP)
   with an acknowledged profile in cancer onset, progression and
   metastases. The complex mechanism adopted by GNBPs in exchanging GDP for
   GTP is an intriguing process and crucial for Ran viability. The
   successful completion of the process is a fundamental aspect of
   propagating downstream signalling events. QM/MM molecular dynamics
   simulations were employed in this study to provide a deeper mechanistic
   understanding of the initiation of nucleotide exchange in Ran. Results
   indicate significant disruption of the metal-binding site upon
   interaction with RCC1 (the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor),
   overall culminating in the prominent shift of the divalent magnesium
   ion. The observed ion drifting is reasoned to occur as a consequence of
   the complex formation between Ran and RCC1 and is postulated to be a
   critical factor in the exchange process adopted by Ran. This is the
   first report to observe and detail such intricate dynamics for a protein
   in Ras superfamily.}},

Abstract = {{Two real-time nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithms for a
   transport reaction system are designed. The system is modeled by a
   hyperbolic partial differential equation and discretized by means of a
   two-time level semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian scheme. For the resulting
   lumped-parameter system, a constrained optimal. control problem is
   formulated and state constraints are implemented in the form of barrier
   functions. The NMPC algorithms perform a single step or several steps of
   an iterative solution routine of the optimal control problem at every
   sampling point. With this suboptimal solution strategy, a fixed maximum
   evaluation time and execution in real time are guaranteed. An analysis
   of the nominal stability is provided for one NMPC scheme. The robustness
   of the controllers is evaluated for an example problem, where a
   nonisothermal plug-flow reactor with irreversible exothermic reactions
   is considered. The control objectives are to limit the maximum reactor
   temperature (avoid hot spots) and to maximize the process output.}},

Abstract = {{Selective cell recognition and capture has recently attracted

   to the development of cell complementary surfaces using the cells
   themselves as templating agents, by means of molecular imprinting, and
   their combination with sensing platforms for rapid cell detection in

Pages = {{5705-5711}},

Abstract = {{Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is now widely used as a rapid
   and inexpensive tool for chemical/biochemical analysis. The method can
   give enormous increases in the intensities of the Raman signals of
   low-concentration molecular targets if they are adsorbed on suitable
   enhancing substrates, which are typically composed of nanostructured Ag
   or Au. However, the features of SERS that allow it to be used as a
   chemical sensor also mean that it can be used as a powerful probe of the
   surface chemistry of any nanostructured material that can provide SERS
   enhancement. This is important because it is the surface chemistry that
   controls how these materials interact with their local environment and,
   in real applications, this interaction can be more important than more
   commonly measured properties such as morphology or plasmonic absorption.
   Here, the opportunity that this approach to SERS provides is illustrated
   with examples where the surface chemistry is both characterized and
   controlled in order to create functional nanomaterials.}},

Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{In 2007 the idea was put forward that, through careful molecular design,
   it should be possible to synthesize liquids which contain permanent,
   well-defined molecule-sized cavities (pores). Such porous liquids could
   be a kind of liquid zeolite, or liquid MOF (metal-organic framework),
   exhibiting the size and shape-selective sorption (or dissolution)
   associated with microporous solids as well as the fluidity of liquids -
   a new and potentially useful combination of properties. However, these
   materials remained essentially hypothetical until recently. In 2014 and
   2015 three papers were published which describe convincing examples of
   porous liquids, and studies have shown that they do exhibit some
   remarkable properties, such as very fast gas diffusion and high gas
   solubilities. The examples reported so far are almost certainly only the
   tip of the iceberg. Now that porous liquids are real', a new area of
   materials science may open up, with clear potential for long-term
   applications in chemical processes.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanochemical synthesis, i.e., reactions conducted by grinding solid
   reactants together with no or minimal solvent, has been demonstrated as
   an excellent technique for the formation of both organic and inorganic
   compounds. Mechanochemistry is viewed as an alternative approach to
   chemical synthesis and is not always considered when developing
   manufacturing processes of fine chemicals. Here, recent advances are
   highlighted regarding mechanochemical synthesis, by utilizing a
   well-developed continuous technique - extrusion, and the advantages it
   offers to further support its use in the manufacturing of these
   chemicals. To put this work into context, it is shown how extrusion
   plays a vital role for manufacturing in the food, polymer, and
   pharmaceutical industries, and how the research carried out by these
   respective industrialists provides great insight and understanding of
   the technique, with the results being applicable in the chemical
   industry. The synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is
   highlighted herein as an excellent example showcasing the advantages
   that extrusion provides to the manufacture of these materials, one
   advantage being the exceptional space time yields (STYs) reported for
   these processes, at three orders of magnitude greater than conventional
   (solvothermal) synthesis.}},

   for harvesting microalgae. Compared to native CNC, the positively
   charged APIm-modified CNC, which dispersed well in carbonated water,
   showed appreciable electrostatic interaction with negatively charged
   Chlorella vulgaris upon CO2-treatment. The gelation between the modified
   CNC, triggered by subsequent air sparging, can also enmesh adjacent
   microalgae and/or microalgae-modified CNC aggregates, thereby further
   enhancing harvesting efficiencies. Moreover, the surface charges and
   dispersion/gelation of APIm-modified CNC could be reversibly adjusted by
   alternatively sparging CO2/air. This CO2-switchability would make the
   reusability of redispersed CNC for further harvesting possible. After
   harvesting, the supernatant following sedimentation can be reused for
   microalgal cultivation without detrimental effects on cell growth. The
   use of this approach for harvesting microalgae presents an advantage to
   other current methods available because all materials involved,
   including the cellulose, CO, and air, are natural and biocompatible
   without adverse effects on the downstream processing for biofuel
   production.}},

   dependence on the mass flow rate and temperature of the waste heat at

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a dynamic model simulating the performance of a fed
   batch system operated as solid-liquid two-phase partitioning bioreactor,
   with polymer beads as the sequestering phase, applied to the removal of
   xenobiotic compounds from concentrated aqueous streams, in which
   substrate inhibition is significant. The model takes into account
   substrate mass transfer into, and within, the solid particles. Outputs
   of the models are xenobiotic concentrations in the liquid and solid
   phases and the concentration profile within the solid polymer beads.
   Sensitivity analyses have been performed on the influent concentration
   and on the main operating parameters, which can be modified to control
   the process performance (i.e. polymer/feed ratio, reaction and loading
   times). With an inhibitory substrate, the selected duration of the
   reaction period exhibits a critical value which determines the
   transition from high to low efficiency of the bioreactor. Application
   examples are provided for a target compound, 4-nitrophenol, previously
   investigated in TPPBs with an immiscible organic solvent, while Hytrel
   8206 has been considered as the polymer partitioning phase. The proposed
   model has been shown to be a powerful tool to predict suitable operating
   conditions for TPPB systems treating inhibitory substrates. (C) 2016

   range of initial comonomer compositions, initial monomer concentrations

   ionization. The composition drift with conversion was found not only to
   be a strong function of AA ionization but also to vary systematically
   with monomer concentration, with the latter influence increasing at
   increased degrees of ionization. The coupled effect is captured by
   expressions developed to represent the monomer reactivity ratios as a
   function of these two major variables. The proposed correlation, easily
   implemented into any modeling framework, is based on experimentally
   measured composition over a much broader range of conditions than
   examined in previous studies and accurately captures the effect of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for estimating and tracking the
   pitch period of audio signals using Bayesian filters. For this purpose,
   we propose a general Bayesian model, which is robust to the
   nonstationary variations of the amplitude and frequency of the input
   signal. We also employ a state-space model, which uses the delayed
   versions of the input signal to model the periodicity of nonstationary
   audio signals. This simple model allows a significant reduction of the
   required number of particles for the estimation of the pitch period
   compared to the state-of-the-art particle filtering methods. Moreover,
   we propose to estimate the logarithm of the period instead of the period
   itself. We show that the resulting algorithm does not require prior
   knowledge about the initial state and is robust to the octave error
   phenomenon, which is a common problem in pitch period estimation
   methods. Most of the existing methods require that the processing window
   be longer than the largest existing period of the input signal. In
   contrast, the proposed method does not impose such a limit. Our method
   often results in a higher time-domain resolution with no perceptible
   compromise on the frequency-domain resolution, especially for
   high-pitched audio signals such as music. Simulation results reveal that
   the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art pitch period
   detection algorithms at low signal to noise ratios assuming no prior
   knowledge about the initial conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, flexural tests were performed on precast concrete
   sandwich wall panels with various end support conditions, loading
   orientations, and reinforcement and shear connector materials. Bolted
   angle connections were used to simulate practical support conditions
   while loads were applied in a manner to simulate windward pressure as
   well as suction. Panels with steel and basalt-fiber-reinforced polymer
   (BFRP) longitudinal reinforcement were tested and compared. Discrete
   steel and BFRP shear connectors were also used and evaluated. The bolted
   angle connections provided partial end fixity, thereby increasing the
   overall strength and stiffness relative to identical panels simply
   supported by rollers during testing. In all cases the bolted connections
   succeeded in developing the full strength of the sandwich wall panels.
   Panels with steel reinforcement failed due to rupturing of flexural
   reinforcement, while a panel with BFRP reinforcement failed due to
   rupturing of shear connectors and crushing of concrete in one wythe.
   Panels loaded in the direction of wind pressure achieved higher peak
   loads than identical panels loaded to simulate suction. An independent
   analytical model accounting for material nonlinearity, end support
   conditions, and partial composite action from the shear transfer system
   was developed. The model accurately predicted flexural stiffness, while
   the peak load was underestimated in most cases.}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing the hydraulic conductivity (K) of aquitards is difficult
   due to technical and logistical difficulties associated with field-based
   methods as well as the cost and challenge of collecting representative
   and competent core samples for laboratory analysis. The objective of
   this study was to produce a multiscale comparison of vertical and
   horizontal hydraulic conductivity (K-v and K-h, respectively) of a
   regionally extensive Cretaceous clay-rich aquitard in southern
   Saskatchewan. Ten vibrating wire pressure transducers were lowered into
   place at depths between 25 and 325 m, then the annular was space was
   filled with a cement-bentonite grout. The in situ K-h was estimated at
   the location of each transducer by simulating the early-time pore
   pressure measurements following setting of the grout using a 2-D
   axisymmetric, finite element, numerical model. Core samples were
   collected during drilling for conventional laboratory testing for K-v to
   compare with the transducer-determined in situ K-h. Results highlight
   the importance of scale and consideration of the presence of possible
   secondary features (e.g., fractures) in the aquitard. The proximity of
   the transducers to an active potash mine (similar to 1 km) where
   depressurization of an underlying aquifer resulted in drawdown through
   the aquitard provided a unique opportunity to model the current
   hydraulic head profile using both the K-h and K-v estimates. Results
   indicate that the transducer-determined K-h estimates would allow for
   the development of the current hydraulic head distribution, and that
   simulating the pore pressure recovery can be used to estimate moderately
   low in situ K-h (<10(-11) m s(-1)).}},

Abstract = {{A significant portion of the UK's transportation system relies on a
   network of geotechnical earthworks (cuttings and embankments) that were
   constructed more than 100 years ago, whose stability is affected by the
   change in precipitation patterns experienced over the past few decades.
   The vulnerability of these structures requires a reliable, cost-and
   time-effective monitoring of their geomechanical condition. We have
   assessed the potential application of P-wave refraction for tracking the
   seasonal variations of seismic properties within an aged clay-filled
   railway embankment, located in southwest England. Seismic data were
   acquired repeatedly along the crest of the earthwork at regular time
   intervals, for a total period of 16 months. P-wave first-break times
   were picked from all available recorded traces, to obtain a set of
   hodocrones referenced to the same spatial locations, for various dates
   along the surveyed period of time. Traveltimes extracted from each
   acquisition were then compared to track the pattern of their temporal
   variability. The relevance of such variations over time was compared
   with the data experimental uncertainty. The multiple set of hodocrones
   was subsequently inverted using a tomographic approach, to retrieve a
   time-lapse model of V-P for the embankment structure. To directly
   compare the reconstructed V-P sections, identical initial models and
   spatial regularization were used for the inversion of all available data
   sets. A consistent temporal trend for P-wave traveltimes, and
   consequently for the reconstructed V-P models, was identified. This
   pattern could be related to the seasonal distribution of precipitation
   and soil-water content measured on site.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the uplink of a single-cell multi-user
   single-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) system with in-phase and
   quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI). In particular, we investigate the
   effect of receive (RX) IQI on the performance of MU-SIMO systems with
   large antenna arrays employing maximum-ratio combining receivers. In
   order to study how IQI affects channel estimation, we derive a new
   channel estimator for the IQI-impaired model and show that the higher
   the value of signal-to-noise ratio, the higher the impact of IQI on the
   spectral efficiency (SE). Moreover, a novel pilot-based joint estimator
   of the augmented multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel matrix
   and IQI coefficients is described, and then, a low-complexity IQI
   compensation scheme is proposed, which is based on the IQI coefficients'
   estimation and it is independent of the channel gain. The performance of
   the proposed compensation scheme is analytically evaluated by deriving a
   tractable approximation of the ergodic SE assuming transmission over
   Rayleigh fading channels with large-scale fading. Furthermore, we
   investigate how many mobile stations should be scheduled in massive MIMO
   systems with IQI and show that the highest SE loss occurs at the optimal
   operating point. Finally, by deriving asymptotic power scaling laws and
   proving that the SE loss due to IQI is asymptotically independent of the
   number of BS antennas, we show that massive MIMO is resilient to the
   effect of RX IQI.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we report a method for sustainable hydrogen production using
   sunlight and biomass. It is shown that cellulose can be photoreformed to
   produce hydrogen, even in solid form, by use of metal-loaded titania
   photocatalysts. The experiments performed verified that the process is
   enabled by initial hydrolysis via glucose, which itself is shown to be
   efficiently converted to produce hydrogen by photocatalysis.
   Importantly, it is shown that not only precious metals such as Pt, Pd
   and Au can be used as the metal component, but also much more economic
   and less environmentally damaging Ni is effective. Even more
   importantly, we show for the first time, to the best our knowledge, that
   fescue grass as raw biomass can be effective for hydrogen production
   without significant pretreatment. This provides additional benefits for
   the efficiency of biomass hydrogen production, because fewer processing
   steps for the raw material are required than in the production of purer
   forms of cellulose, for example.}},

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting ( EH) provides a means of greatly enhancing the
   lifetime of wireless sensor nodes. However, the randomness inherent in
   the EH process may cause significant delay for performing sensing
   operations and transmitting sensed information to the sink. Unlike most
   existing studies on the delay performance of EH sensor networks, where
   only the energy consumption of transmission is considered, we consider
   the energy costs of both sensing and transmission. Specifically, we
   consider an EH sensor that monitors some status property and adopts a
   harvest-then-use protocol to perform sensing and transmission. To
   comprehensively study the delay performance, we consider two
   complementary metrics and analytically derive their statistics: 1)
   update age-measuring the time taken from when information is obtained by
   the sensor to when the sensed information is successfully transmitted to
   the sink, i.e., how timely the updated information at the sink is, and
   2) update cycle-measuring the time duration between two consecutive
   successful transmissions, i. e., how frequently the information at the
   sink is updated. Our results show that the consideration of sensing
   energy cost leads to an important tradeoff between the two metrics: more
   frequent updates result in less timely information available at the
   sink.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Daycare employees, specifically caregivers, are a distinct population
   that may experience increased risk of injury due to the high exposure to
   bent postures, lifting conditions and high stress associated with their
   work. The objectives of the study were to collect up to date data on
   daycare workers and to compare the data between groups working with
   children of different ages (Infant, Toddler and Preschool). The study
   consisted of two distinct phases: Phase 1 - Questionnaire distribution,
   Phase 2 - Observation and analysis involving three dimensional postural
   monitoring and video recording as well as an analysis of the low back
   forces and moments in lifting. Phase 1: Consisted of the distribution of
   questionnaires to all employees in each of the participating daycares (n
   = 73). Of the 73 questionnaires distributed 32 responses were obtained
   (44\%). Of the 32 employees who completed the questionnaires, 19
   caregivers volunteered to participate in Phase 2 of the study. An
   additional 5 caregivers participated in phase 2 of the study, but did
   not complete any questionnaires. The questionnaires indicated 81\% of
   the workers have experienced low back pain. Phase 2: Observational data
   were collected on site in five local,daycares, throughout the first half
   of each subject's shift (similar to 3.5 h). Caregivers from each of the
   three classroom age groups were recruited for participation in the
   direct observation (Infant: n = 7, Toddler: n = 7, Preschool: n = 8).
   Posture analysis revealed that on average, workers adopted trunk flexion
   angles greater than 55 degrees, for 10\% of the collection time, and
   greater than 70 degrees, for 5\% of the collection time. These postures
   correspond to both moderate and severe flexed postures respectively. The
   lifting analysis (completed using the data recorded in phase 2) revealed
   that workers lifted with frequencies of 0.25 lifts/minute, lifted a
   total weight of 501 kg (over 3.3 h) and experienced average compression
   and shear forces of 3323 N and 371 N, respectively. A between-group
   comparison showed that when compared to the Preschool group, the Infant
   (p = 0.008) and Toddler (p = 0.001) groups demonstrated higher relative
   flexed postures and lifting frequencies, and the Toddler group (p =
   0.023) demonstrated higher total weight lifted. Results suggested that
   these employees experience an elevated risk of low back injury caused by
   their occupational tasks and thus, further research is required to
   determine appropriate worker accommodations and safe work practices to
   help mediate these risks for all daycare caregivers.
   Relevance to industry: It is thought that the results from this study
   could lead to the development of safe working and job sharing guidelines
   for daycare workers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Small-Scale Seismic Monitoring of Varying Water Levels in Granular Media}},
Journal = {{VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Physical properties of soils in the vadose zone, and especially their
   water content, are characterized by strong spatial and temporal
   variations mostly driven by weather and anthropogenic activities. To
   understand this variability and help water resource management, seismic
   methods have been recently suggested as a complement to electrical and
   electromagnetic techniques. The simultaneous in situ estimation of
   pressure (P) and shear (S) wave velocities (VP and VS, respectively) and
   their ratio (VP/VS) offers novel perspectives for the monitoring of
   space and time variations of vadose zone mechanical properties. However,
   the seismic response in partially saturated and unconsolidated soils
   remains complex and deserves to be studied both theoretically and
   experimentally. In this study, we tested the sensitivity of seismic
   measurements (i.e., P-wave travel times and surface-wave phase
   velocities) to water saturation variations using controlled physical
   models at the laboratory scale. Ultrasonic techniques were used to
   reproduce a small-scale seismic acquisition setup at the surface of
   glass bead layers with varying water levels. Travel times and phase
   velocity measurements obtained at the dry state were validated with both
   theoretical models and numerical simulations and serve as reference
   datasets. The increasing water level clearly affected the recorded wave
   field in both its phase and amplitude. In these cases, the collected
   data cannot yet be inverted in the absence of a comprehensive
   theoretical model for such partially saturated granular media. The
   differences in travel time and phase velocity observed between the dry
   and wet models show patterns that interestingly match the observed water
   level and depth of the capillary fringe, thus offering attractive
   perspectives for studying soil water content variations.}},

Abstract = {{A CMOS vector-sum phase shifter covering the full 360 degrees range is
   presented in this paper. Broadband operational transconductance
   amplifiers with variable transconductance provide coarse scaling of the
   quadrature vector amplitudes. Fine scaling of the amplitudes is
   accomplished using a passive resistive network. Expressions are derived
   to predict the maximum bit resolution of the phase shifter from the
   scaling factor of the coarse and fine vector-scaling stages. The phase
   shifter was designed and fabricated using the standard 130-nm CMOS
   process and was tested on-wafer over the frequency range of 4.9-5.9 GHz.
   The phase shifter delivers root mean square (rms) phase and amplitude
   errors of 1.25 degrees and 0.7 dB, respectively, at the midband
   frequency of 5.4 GHz. The input and output return losses are both below
   17 dB over the band, and the insertion loss is better than 4 dB over the
   band. The circuit uses an area of 0.303 mm(2) excluding bonding pads and
   draws 28 mW from a 1.2 V supply.}},

Abstract = {{A low-cost (6 Euro per sensor), low-power (in the order of 200 mu W per
   sensor), with high communication range (on the order of 250 m), scatter
   radio sensor network is presented, for soil moisture monitoring at
   multiple locations. The proposed network utilizes analog frequency
   modulation in a bistatic network architecture (i.e., the emitter and
   reader are not colocated), while the sensors operate simultaneously,
   using frequency-division multiple access. In contrast to prior art, this
   paper utilizes an ultralow-cost software-defined radio reader and offers
   custom microstrip capacitive sensing with simple calibration, as well as
   modulation pulses for each scatter radio sensor with 50\% duty cycle;
   the latter is necessary for scalable network designs. The overall root
   mean squared error below 1\% is observed, even for the range of 250 m.
   This is another small (but concrete) step for the adoption of scatter
   radio technology as a key enabling technology for scalable, large-scale,
   low-power, and cost environmental sensor networking.}},

Abstract = {{Nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) is conducted in batch and in a

   C using a thermally stable nitroxide. A kinetic model was developed
   using the Predici (R) software package to further understand the

   estimated activation/deactivation rate coefficients from the batch
   polymerization, the model predicts that a significant amount of
   alkoxyamine is exiting the CSTR under steady state conditions,
   consistent with a low molecular weight peak found experimentally. The
   predicted outlet concentration of alkoxyamine at steady state is
   decreased by increasing the temperature and residence time in the
   reactor. Batch chain extension of the polymer produced in the CSTR
   supports the potential for continuous production of block copolymers.

Abstract = {{Surface relief gratings were spontaneously photoinduced from a

   measuring the diffraction intensity of a He-Ne laser probe beam at 633
   nm and by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The dependence of pattern
   formation on both irradiation time and intensity was studied. The
   gratings could be erased both optically and thermally. The orientation
   of the gratings is influenced by the polarization of the writing beam,
   and it is accompanied by strong diffraction of the incident light into
   the sample plane, thereby providing a way to couple and trap the light
   into the substrate. Interestingly, photobleaching upon prolonged
   irradiation yields transparent gratings, and the process is partially
   reversible upon thermal erasure. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The short-term thermal stability of PVC on addition of functional ionic
   liquids (ILs) based on phosphonium and pyridinium cations, and a
   docusate anion, was studied using FTIR, TGA-MS and TGA-FTIR. The thermal
   stability of PVC plasticized with these ILs is reduced and the
   activation energy for thermal degradation for the first step of PVC
   degradation lowered, relative to neat PVC. This feature is not dependent
   on the thermal stability of the IL itself, as their addition to neat PVC
   did not result in increased thermal stability of the resin. Analysis of
   the gases evolved during thermal degradation showed that there is no
   variation in the mechanism of PVC degradation in the presence of ILs,
   the only difference observed is that HCl is evolved at lower
   temperatures for PVC-ILs samples. The ILs had no effect on the second
   step of the thermal degradation of PVC. The decrease in the thermal
   stability of PVC-ILs is associated with two different effects: firstly,
   the anion weakens the C-H bond while the cation forms complexes and
   weakens the C-Cl bond; second, the IL interaction with the polymer
   chains partly substitutes the interaction between the polymer chain and
   heat stabilizers (e.g. stearates) added to the PVC compound. In this
   way, the latter tends to be expelled from the bulk polymer, thus not
   being available for PVC stabilization at high temperature. Heat
   stabilizer migration is related to the solvating power of the ILs: the
   higher the solvating power, the higher the migration of heat stabilizer,
   the lower the thermal stability of the polymer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Novel imidazoline-functionalized diblock copolymers based on polystyrene
   (PS) and poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA) were synthesized as precursors to
   corresponding functional PS-based porous materials through a three-step
   sequential methodology starting from an asymmetric heterobifunctional
   initiator. alpha-Hydroxyl poly(4-cyanostyrene-co-styrene) random
   copolymers were first obtained via an atom transfer free-radical
   polymerization (ATRP) procedure by varying the amount of 4-cyanostyrene
   in the comonomer feed. Cyano groups were then transformed into
   corresponding imidazoline rings. Subsequently, the microwave-assisted
   ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of D,L-lactide from the
   imidazoline-functionalized PS-based macroinitiators allowed for the
   generation of semi-degradable diblock copolymets with different PIA
   volume fractions so as to develop microphase-separated morphologies. The
   precursors and resulting copolymers were analyzed by H-1, C-13 NMR, and
   FT-IR spectroscopy. Upon induced shear-flow via channel-die processing,
   oriented materials constituted of PLA nanodomains in a polystyrene-based
   continuous matrix were formed. Hydrolysis in alkaline conditions of the
   PIA sacrificial block yielded imidazoline-functionalized porous PS-based
   matrices. The resulting porous frameworks were analyzed by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen sorption porosimetry. (C) 2016

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Bridge weigh-in-motion (WIM) uses existing bridges to find the weights
   of vehicles that pass overhead. Contactless bridge weigh-in-motion
   (cBWIM) uses bridges to weigh vehicles without the need for any sensors
   to be attached to the bridge. A camera is mounted on the back of a
   telescope, which magnifies the image to the extent that submillimeter
   bridge deflections can be measured accurately. A second camera is used
   to monitor traffic and to determine axle spacings. The two cameras are
   synchronized using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) activated by an interval
   timer. The exact position of the test vehicle relative to the bridge
   influence line is determined by optimization at a postprocessing stage.
   The new WIM concept was tested on a bridge in the United Kingdom. In a
   modest test sample of eight statically weighed vehicles, cBWIM was shown
   to be a feasible alternative to other forms of WIM. Accuracy of gross
   weight is already reasonably good; accuracy of groups and individual
   axles will require greater magnification or additional cameras.}},

Title = {{Reynolds-number scaling of vortex pinch-off on low-aspect-ratio
   propulsors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{799}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Impulsively started, low-aspect-ratio elliptical flat plates have been
   investigated experimentally to understand the vortex pinch-off dynamics
   at transitional and fully turbulent Reynolds numbers. The range of
   Reynolds numbers investigated is representative of those observed in
   animals that employ rowing and paddling modes of drag-based propulsion
   and manoeuvring. Elliptical flat plates with five aspect ratios ranging
   from one to two have been considered, as abstractions of propulsor
   planforms found in nature. It has been shown that Reynolds-number
   scaling is primarily determined by plate aspect ratio in terms of both
   drag forces and vortex pinch-off. Due to vortex-ring growth time scales
   that are longer than those associated with the development of flow
   instabilities, the scaling of drag is Reynolds-number-dependent for the
   aspect-ratio-one flat plate. With increasing aspect ratio, the
   Reynolds-number dependency decreases as a result of the shorter growth
   time scales associated with high-aspect-ratio elliptical vortex rings.
   Large drag peaks are observed during early-stage vortex growth for the
   higher-aspect-ratio flat plates. The collapse of these peaks with
   Reynolds number provides insight into the evolutionary convergence
   process of propulsor planforms used in drag-based swimming modes over
   diverse scales towards aspect ratios greater than one.}},

Abstract = {{Compressed earth blocks, a form of earthen construction, is a growing
   field of natural building. It is a low-cost, locally available material
   that provides high thermal capacity with low environmental impact.
   Earthen blocks have been primarily used in warmer climates; however,
   there is increasing interest in using the blocks in cold climates.
   Limited research has been done on long-term durability in cold climates.
   In this study, combinations of cement and lime stabilizers were tested
   with metakaolin and Plasticure, a water repellant, to determine
   freeze-thaw durability. Blocks were exposed to up to twelve 48-hour
   freeze-thaw cycles. Prisms were tested in compression to failure in both
   the wet and dry condition as a measure of deterioration. Freeze-thaw
   damage occurred when water was readily available via capillary action.
   Blocks with 7.5\% cement content provided optimum strength retention;
   however, 10\% cement provided higher strengths. The addition of lime,
   metakaolin, and Plasticure to a 5\% cement-stabilized block increased
   dry strength retention by 75 to 146\%, but there was no significant
   difference when wet. Plasticure reduced variability in strength
   reduction from as high as 91 to 24\%, and increased strength retention
   by up to 75\%. Reductions in both strength and water strength
   coefficients were observed in different combinations.}},

   by the proposed deployment and the autonomous management of an ad hoc

Abstract = {{The environmental fate of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a
   group of flame retardants that are considered to be persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs), around the Zhuoshui River and Changhua County regions
   of Taiwan was assessed. An investigation into emissions, partitioning,
   and fate of selected PBDEs was conducted based on the equilibrium
   constant (EQC) fugacity model developed at Trent University, Canada.
   Emissions for congeners PBDE 47, PBDE 99, and PBDE 209 to air (4.9-92 x
   10(-3) kg/h), soil (0.91-17.4 x 10(-3) kg/h), and water (0.21-4.04 x
   10(-3) kg/h), were estimated by modifying previous models on PBDE
   emission rates by considering both industrial and domestic rates. It was
   found that fugacity modeling can give a reasonable estimation of the
   behavior, partitioning, and concentrations of PBDE congeners in and
   around Taiwan. Results indicate that PBDE congeners have a high affinity
   for partitioning into sediments then soils. As congener number
   decreases, the PBDEs then partition more readily into air. As the degree
   of bromination increases, congeners more readily partition to sediments.
   Sediments may then act as a long-term source of PBDEs which can be
   released back into the water column due to resuspension during storm
   events.}},

Abstract = {{The Delay Locked Loop (DLL) tracking algorithm is one of the most widely
   used in GPS receivers. It uses different correlators such as the
   Early-Late Slope (ELS) correlator and High-Resolution Correlator (HRC)
   to mitigate code phase multipath. These techniques are effective for
   weak multipath environments but they may not be suitable for challenging
   multipath environments. The Multipath Estimating Delay Lock Loop (MEDLL)
   shows better performance than the classical methods. However, MEDLL
   still has limited capabilities in severe multipath environments. This
   paper introduces a robust multipath mitigation technique based on fast
   orthogonal search to obtain better delay estimation for GPS receivers.
   This research utilised a SPIRENT Global Navigation Satellite Systems
   (GNSS) simulator to compare the performance of the proposed method with
   other multipath mitigation techniques. Experimental results demonstrated
   that the performance of the proposed algorithm was better than the
   classical and advanced techniques under the multipath scenarios tested.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the applications of a novel methodology to quantify
   saltwater intrusion parameters in laboratory-scale experiments. The
   methodology uses an automated image analysis procedure, minimising
   manual inputs and the subsequent systematic errors that can be
   introduced. This allowed the quantification of the width of the mixing
   zone which is difficult to measure in experimental methods that are
   based on visual observations. Glass beads of different grain sizes were
   tested for both steady-state and transient conditions. The transient
   results showed good correlation between experimental and numerical
   intrusion rates. The experimental intrusion rates revealed that the
   saltwater wedge reached a steady state condition sooner while receding
   than advancing. The hydrodynamics of the experimental mixing zone
   exhibited similar traits; a greater increase in the width of the mixing
   zone was observed in the receding saltwater wedge, which indicates
   faster fluid velocities and higher dispersion. The angle of intrusion
   analysis revealed the formation of a volume of diluted saltwater at the
   toe position when the saltwater wedge is prompted to recede. In
   addition, results of different physical repeats of the experiment
   produced an average coefficient of variation less than 0.18 of the
   measured toe length and width of the mixing zone. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Thermally induced changes in surface wettability, dewetting behavior,
   and proton transport of ``self-assembled{''} nanothin Nafion (R) films
   (4-300 nm) on SiO2 substrate is reported. Thermal annealing induces
   switching of the surface wettability of 55 nm and thinner films from
   hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic. Thickness dependence of this behavior
   is observed with higher annealing temperature required for lower
   thickness films, indicating highly restrictive mobility of Nafion (R)
   ionomer as film thickness decreases. Dewetting is only observed for 4-nm
   thin film. Significant suppression in proton conductivity upon thermal
   annealing was noted. Similarly, two other bulk properties, water uptake
   and swelling, were found to decrease upon annealing. This work reports a
   systematic examination of the thickness dependence of thermally induced
   changes in both surface and bulk properties of ultra-thin Nafion (R).

Title = {{An optimized process design for oxymethylene ether production from

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},

Abstract = {{The conversion of biomass for the production of liquid fuels can help
   reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are predominantly
   generated by the combustion of fossil fuels. Oxymethylene ethers (OMEs)
   are a series of liquid fuel additives that can be obtained from syngas,
   which is produced from the gasification of biomass. The blending of OMEs
   in conventional diesel fuel can reduce soot formation during combustion
   in a diesel engine. In this research, a process for the production of
   OMEs from woody biomass has been simulated. The process consists of
   several unit operations including biomass gasification, syngas cleanup,
   methanol production, and conversion of methanol to OMEs. The methodology
   involved the development of process models, the identification of the
   key process parameters affecting OME production based on the process
   model, and the development of an optimal process design for high OME
   yields. It was found that up to 9.02 tonnes day(-1) of OME3, OME4, and
   OME3 (which are suitable as diesel additives) can be produced from 277.3
   tonnes day(-1) of wet woody biomass. Furthermore, an optimal combination
   of the parameters, which was generated from the developed model, can
   greatly enhance OME production and thermodynamic efficiency. This model
   can further be used in a techno-economic assessment of the whole biomass
   conversion chain to produce OMEs. The results of this study can be
   helpful for petroleum-based fuel producers and policy makers in
   determining the most attractive pathways of converting bio-resources
   into liquid fuels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper experimental and analytical investigations of axially
   loaded sandwich panels are presented. Large scale slender panels with
   and without ribs were tested. A robust analytical model applicable to
   panels of various slenderness ratios was developed. It accounts for
   geometric non-linearity through a rigorous P-Delta analysis, including
   the initial out-of-straightness profile and end eccentricities. The
   excessive shear deformation of the soft core and its effect on the
   overall stiffness and global buckling is accounted for. Additionally,
   the model detects localized skin wrinkling or crushing. The model showed
   reasonable agreement, within 20\%, with test results for strength and
   stiffness and was used in a parametric study. It was shown that the
   addition of a longitudinal rib connecting the skins at mid-width
   resulted in 180\% increase in axial strength, by changing failure mode
   from skin wrinkling to global buckling. Adding longitudinal external
   ribs to the internal one changed failure mode to skin crushing and
   increased stiffness by 40\% but did not enhance strength. Axial
   stiffness and strength also increased as skins or ribs became thicker,
   or their Young's modulus increased, or as core shear modulus increased,
   however, failure mode varied depending on length. As the amplitude of
   out-of-straightness increased, failure load always reduced, weather
   governed by global buckling or skin wrinkling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{240-261}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{An overview of research on the development of the hybrid test method is
   presented. The maturity of the hybrid test method is mapped in order to
   provide context to individual research in the overall development of the
   test method. In the pseudo dynamic (PsD) test method, the equations of
   motion are solved using a time stepping numerical integration technique
   with the inertia and damping being numerically modelled whilst restoring
   force is physically measured over an extended timescale. Developments in
   continuous PsD testing led to the real-time hybrid test method and
   geographically distributed hybrid tests. A key aspect to the efficiency
   of hybrid testing is the substructuring technique where the critical
   structural subassemblies that are fundamental to the overall response of
   the structure are physically tested whilst the remainder of the
   structure whose response can be more easily predicted is numerically
   modelled. Much of the early research focused on developing the accuracy
   and efficiency of the test method, whereas more recently the method has
   matured to a level where the test method is applied purely as a dynamic
   testing technique. Developments in numerical integration methods,
   substructuring, experimental error reduction, delay compensation and
   speed of testing have led to a test method now in use as full-scale
   real-time dynamic testing method that is reliable, accurate, efficient
   and cost effective. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   derivatives were synthesized from

   substitution with a glass-forming mexylaminotriazine unit,
   characterized, and their performance as electron acceptors in bulk
   heterojunction photovoltaic cells with P3HT as donor were studied. Imide
   groups (octyl and 2,6-diisopropylphenyl) and bay substituents (bromo or
   pyrrolidinyl) were used to study the impact of sterics and electronics
   on device performance. The HOMO and LUMO levels of the materials were
   determined using cyclic voltammetry. The morphology and packing behavior
   of molecules in films of blends with P3HT were studied using Atomic
   Force Microscopy and X-ray diffraction, and in all four cases, the PDI
   derivatives remain in the amorphous phase, while the P3HT portion of the
   blends crystallizes. The devices gave photovoltaic performances ranging
   from 0.2 to 0.6\%, and while the bay substituents showed negligible
   impact on device performance, switching from bulky 2,6-diisopropylphenyl
   imide groups to linear octyl chains improved the efficiency of the
   devices by 36\%, current density by 66\% and fill factor by 16\%. The
   performances observed for devices incorporating these PDI glasses are
   comparable to that of devices with crystalline PDI acceptors. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The MAJORANA Collaboration is constructing the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, an
   ultra-low background, 44-kg modular high-purity Ge (HPGe) detector array
   to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay in Ge-76. The phenomenon of
   surface micro-discharge induced by high-voltage has been studied in the
   context of the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR. This effect can damage the
   front-end electronics or mimic detector signals. To ensure the correct
   performance, every high-voltage cable and feedthrough must be capable of
   supplying HPGe detector operating voltages as high as 5 kV without
   exhibiting discharge. R\&D measurements were carried out to understand
   the testing system and determine the optimum design configuration of the
   high-voltage path, including different improvements of the cable layout
   and feedthrough flange model selection. Every cable and feedthrough to
   be used at the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR was characterized and the
   micro-discharge effects during the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR commissioning
   phase were studied. A stable configuration has been achieved, and the
   cables and connectors can supply HPGe detector operating voltages
   without exhibiting discharge. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A 3D intralaminar continuum damage mechanics based material model,
   combining damage mode interaction and material nonlinearity, was
   developed to predict the damage response of composite structures
   undergoing crush loading. This model captures the structural response
   without the need for calibration of experimentally determined material
   parameters. When used in the design of energy absorbing composite
   structures, it can reduce the dependence on physical testing. This paper
   validates this model against experimental data obtained from the
   literature and in-house testing. Results show that the model can predict
   the force response of the crushed composite structures with good
   accuracy. The simulated energy absorption in each test case was within
   12\% of the experimental value. Post-crush deformation and the damage
   morphologies, such as ply splitting, splaying and breakage, were also
   accurately reproduced. This study establishes the capability of this
   damage model for predicting the responses of composite structures under
   crushing loads. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a compact and planar wearable ultra-wideband (UWB)
   antenna is designed and characterised for wireless body area network
   (WBAN) applications. The antenna is designed and fabricated on two
   different substrates: a thin and flexible high-end RT/Duroid 5880
   substrate (h = 0.381 mm) and a low-end FR4 substrate (h = 1.6 mm) having
   fabricated antenna dimensions of 86 mm x 72 mm and 75 mm x 61 mm,
   respectively. The dimensions of the proposed design for both the
   substrates are calculated using the well-known transmission-line model.
   The antennas are simulated using ADS momentum and CST microwave studio
   for evaluation of work using two different modelling techniques. The
   antenna structure consists of a rectangular radiating patch with a
   rectangular slot and a reduced ground plane to improve the impedance
   matching characteristics. An offset-feed method is employed to enhance
   the overall patch bandwidth. The measured -10 dB impedance bandwidth and
   gain with the RT/Duroid 5880 and FR4 substrates are 7.1 GHz (3.5-10.6
   GHz)/4.89 dBi and 7.2 GHz (3.8-11 GHz)/2.75 dBi, respectively. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Due to its high energy generation capability and minimal environmental
   impact, wind energy is an elegant solution to the growing global energy
   demand. However, frequent atmospheric changes make it difficult to
   effectively harness the energy in the wind because maximum power
   extraction occurs at a different operating point for each wind
   condition. This paper proposes a parameter-independent intelligent power
   management controller that consists of a slope-assisted maximum power
   point tracking (MPPT) algorithm and a power limit search (PLS) algorithm
   for small standalone wind energy systems with permanent synchronous
   generators. Unlike the parameter-independent perturb \& observe
   algorithms, the proposed slope-assisted MPPT algorithm preempts logical
   errors attributed to wind fluctuations by detecting and identifying
   atmospheric changes. The controller's PLS is able to minimize the
   production of surplus energy to minimize the heat dissipation
   requirements of the energy release mechanism by cooperating with the
   state observer and using the slope parameter to seek the operating
   points that result in the desired power rather than the maximum power.
   The functionality of the proposed energy management control scheme for
   wind energy systems is verified through simulation results and
   experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Several of the growth factors and their receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
   such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor
   (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and insulin are promising
   candidate targets for cancer therapy. Indeed, tyrosine kinase inhibitors
   (TKI) have been developed to target these growth factors and their
   receptors, and have demonstrated dramatic initial responses in cancer
   therapy. Yet, most patients ultimately develop TKI drug resistance and
   relapse. It is essential in the clinical setting that the targeted
   therapies are to circumvent multistage tumorigenesis, including genetic
   mutations at the different growth factor receptors, tumor
   neovascularization, chemoresistance of tumors, immune-mediated
   tumorigenesis and the development of tissue invasion and metastasis.
   Here, we identify a novel receptor signaling platform linked to EGF,
   NGF, insulin and TOLL-like receptor (TLR) activations, all of which are
   known to play major roles in tumorigenesis. The importance of these
   findings signify an innovative and promising entirely new targeted
   therapy for cancer. The role of mammalian neuraminidase-1 (Neu1) in
   complex with matrix metalloproteinase-9 and G protein-coupled receptor
   tethered to RTKs and TLRs is identified as a major target in multistage
   tumorigenesis. Evidence exposing the link connecting growth
   factor-binding and immune-mediated tumorigenesis to this novel
   receptor-signaling paradigm will be reviewed in its current relationship
   to cancer.}},

Title = {{Resonance fluorescence spectra from coherently driven quantum dots

Abstract = {{Using a polaron master equation approach, we investigate the resonance
   fluorescence spectra from coherently driven quantum dots (QDs) coupled
   to an acoustic phonon bath and photonic crystal waveguides with a rich
   local density of photon states (LDOS). Resonance fluorescence spectra
   from QDs in semiconductor crystals are known to show strong signatures
   of electron-phonon interactions, but when coupled to a structured
   photonic reservoir, theQDemission properties are also determined by the
   frequency dependence of the LDOS of the photon reservoir. Here, we
   investigate the simultaneous role of coupled photon and phonon baths on
   the characteristic Mollow triplet spectra from a strongly driven QD. As
   an example structured photonic reservoir, we first study a photonic
   crystal coupled cavity waveguide, and find that photons and phonons have
   counterinteracting effects near the upper mode edge of the
   coupled-cavity waveguide, thus establishing the importance of their
   separate roles in determining the emission spectra. The general theory
   is developed for arbitrary photonic reservoirs and is further applied to
   determine the resonance fluorescence spectra from a realistic,
   disordered W1 photonic crystal waveguide showing important photon-phonon
   interaction effects that are directly relevant to emerging experiments
   and theoretical proposals.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a rotating packed bed (RPB) contactor was applied to
   adsorb Direct Red 23 dye onto commercially available activated carbon. A
   RPB is a doughnut shaped contactor, which rotates on a vertical axis and
   centrifugal force acts as the driving force for fluid-particle contact
   in the contactor. This centrifugal force, which is several times higher
   than the gravitational force, aids the adsorption process with enhanced
   mass transfer coefficient. The commercially available activated carbon
   used in this work had moderate BET surface area of 583m(2)g(-1) and was
   mainly meso-porous with an average pore size of 22 angstrom. The
   adsorption characteristics of the activated carbon were studied in a
   shake flask and a RPB. The dye removal in RPB was 93\% compared to 55\%
   in a shake flask in 5h for the same amount of activated carbon and dye
   solution. Rotor speed and feed rate were important parameters for the
   removal of the dye in a RPB. It was found that rotor speed of 628rpm and
   feed rate of 40Lh(-1) yielded the best adsorption efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The viable mechanisms for O-3 generation via the electrocatalytic
   splitting of H2O over beta-PbO2 catalyst were identified through Density
   Functional Theory calculations. H2O adsorbed onto the surface was
   oxidized to form OH then O; the latter reacted with a surface bridging O
   to form O-2 which in turn reacted with another surface O to form O-3.
   The final step of the mechanisms occurs via an Eley-Rideal style
   interaction where surface O-2 desorbs and then attacks the surface
   bridging oxygen, forming O-3. A different reaction pathway via an O3H
   intermediate was found less favoured both thermodynamically and

Abstract = {{In this paper strontium-site-deficient Sr2Fe2.4Co0.2Mo0.5O6-delta-based
   perovskite oxides (SXFCM) were prepared and evaluated as the cathode
   materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells
   (IT-SOFCs). All samples exhibited a cubic phase structure and the
   lattice shrinked with increasing the Sr-deficiency as shown in XRD
   patterns. XPS results determined that the transition elements (Co/Fe/Mo)
   in SXFCM oxides were in a mixed valence state, demonstrating the small
   polaron hopping conductivity mechanism existed. Among the samples,
   S1.950FCM presented the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion of 15.62
   x 10(-6) K-1, the highest conductivity value of 28 Omega cm(-1) at 500
   degrees C, and the lowest interfacial polarization resistance of 0.093
   Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C, respectively. Furthermore, an
   anode-supported single cell with a S1.950FCM cathode was prepared,
   demonstrating a maximum power density of 1.16 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C
   by using wet H-2 (3\% H2O) as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant.
   These results indicate that the introduction of Sr-deficiency can
   dramatically improve the electrochemical performance of
   Sr2Fe1.4Co0.1Mo0.5O6-delta, showing great promise as a novel cathode
   candidate material for IT-SOFCs. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications

Abstract = {{Smectic liquid crystals that exhibit temperature independent layer
   thickness offer technological advantages for their use in displays and
   photonic devices. The dependence of the layer spacing in SmA and SmC
   phases of de Vries liquid crystals is found to exhibit distinct
   features. On entering the SmC phase, the layer thickness initially
   decreases below SmA to SmC (TA-C) transition temperature but increases
   anomalously with reducing temperature despite the molecular tilt
   increasing. This anomalous observation is being explained
   quantitatively. Results of IR spectroscopy show that layer shrinkage is
   caused by tilt of the mesogen's rigid core, whereas the expansion is
   caused by the chains getting more ordered with reducing temperature.
   This mutual compensation arising from molecular fragments contributing
   to the layer thickness differs from the previous models. The
   orientational order parameter of the rigid core of the mesogen provides
   direct evidence for de Vries cone model in the SmA phase for the two
   compounds investigated. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{824}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the effects of ram pressure on the ordered magnetic field
   of a galaxy hosting a radio halo and strong nuclear outflows. New radio
   images in total and polarized intensity of the edge-on Virgo galaxy NGC
   4388 were obtained within the CHANG-ES EVLA project. The unprecedented
   noise level reached allows us to detect striking new features of the
   ordered magnetic field. The nuclear outflow extends far into the halo to
   about 5 kpc from the center and is spatially correlated with the H alpha
   and X-ray emission. For the first time, the southern outflow is
   detected. Above and below both spiral arms we find extended blobs of
   polarized emission with an ordered field oriented perpendicular to the
   disk. The synchrotron lifetime of the cosmic-ray electrons (CREs) in
   these regions yields a mean outflow velocity of 270 +/- 70 km s(-1), in
   agreement with a galactic wind scenario. The observed symmetry of the
   polarized halo features in NGC 4388 excludes a compression of the halo
   gas by the ram pressure of the intracluster medium (ICM). The assumption
   of equilibrium between the halo pressure and the ICM ram pressure yields
   an estimate of the ICM density that is consistent with both the ICM
   density derived from X-ray observations and the recent Planck
   Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements. The detection of a faint radio halo
   around cluster galaxies could thus be used for an estimate of ICM ram
   pressure.}},

Title = {{THE NEXT GENERATION VIRGO CLUSTER SURVEY (NGVS). XIII. THE LUMINOSITY

Abstract = {{We present measurements of the galaxy luminosity and stellar mass
   function in a 3.71 deg(2) (0.3Mpc(2)) area in the core of the Virgo
   Cluster, based on u{*}griz data from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster
   Survey (NGVS). The galaxy sample-which consists of 352 objects brighter
   than M-g = -9.13 mag, the 50\% completeness limit of the survey-reaches
   2.2 mag deeper than the widely used Virgo Cluster Catalog and at least
   1.2 mag deeper than any sample previously used to measure the luminosity
   function in Virgo. Using a Bayesian analysis, we find a best-fit
   faint-end slope of alpha = -1.33 +/- 0.02 for the g-band luminosity
   function; consistent results are found for the stellar mass function and
   the luminosity function in the other four NGVS bandpasses. We discuss
   the implications for the faint-end slope of adding 92 ultracompact
   dwarfs (UCDs)-previously compiled by the NGVS in this region-to the
   galaxy sample, assuming that UCDs are the stripped remnants of nucleated
   dwarf galaxies. Under this assumption, the slope of the luminosity
   function (down to the UCD faint magnitude limit, M-g = -9.6mag)
   increases dramatically, up to alpha = -1.60 +/- 0.06 when correcting for
   the expected number of disrupted non-nucleated galaxies. We also
   calculate the total number of UCDs and globular clusters that may have
   been deposited in the core of Virgo owing to the disruption of
   satellites, both nucleated and non-nucleated. We estimate that similar
   to 150 objects with M-g less than or similar to -9.6 mag and that are
   currently classified as globular clusters might, in fact, be the nuclei
   of disrupted galaxies. We further estimate that as many as 40\% of the
   (mostly blue) globular clusters in the Virgo core might once have
   belonged to such satellites; these same disrupted satellites might have
   contributed similar to 40\% of the total luminosity in galaxies observed
   in the core region today. Finally, we use an updated Local Group galaxy
   catalog to provide a new measurement of the luminosity function of Local
   Group satellites, alpha = -1.21 +/- 0.05, which is only 1.7 sigma
   shallower than measured in the core of the Virgo Cluster.}},

Abstract = {{We report here a comprehensive understanding of the first C-C coupling
   during the induction period of the methanol-to-olefin process using
   density functional theory with the HSE06 hybrid functional. We
   illustrate the possible routes of formation for the active carbenium ion
   (CH3OCH2+), which has been identified to play an important part in
   triggering the formation of the first C-C bond and the hydrocarbon pool
   species. CH3OCH2+ can be generated not only from dimethyl ether and
   Z(O)-CH3, but also from the reaction of HCHO and Z(O)-CH3, which has a
   lower effective barrier. An understanding of the dominance of CH3OCH2+
   over other carbocations and direct C-C coupling pathways is presented
   and quantitatively analysed. The charge distribution in the formation of
   CH3OCH2+ is revealed and it is confirmed that the carbenium ion is
   thermodynamically more favoured than the radical. The subsequent
   reaction after the first C-C coupling was investigated, which uncovered
   some important active C2 species that possibly led to the formation of
   the active hydrocarbon pool intermediates and may finally realize the
   catalytic cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale surface patterns were observed in thin films of
   mexylaminotriazine-functionalized glasses containing polar groups upon
   the application of an electric field at temperatures over their glass
   transition temperatures (T-g). This phenomenon occurred due to the
   surface deformation process initiated by external electric field
   instabilities on the films. The minimal surface deformation temperature
   (T-dewet) relative to T-g was found to increase as a function of the
   polarity of the substituents and the surface pattern roughness was
   observed to increase linearly with temperature for a fixed electric
   field and exposure time. Reversal of the electrical field polarity and
   the use of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates did not
   significantly change the surface deformation behavior of the films,
   which is due to the deposition of charges at the free interface. The
   application of a mask between the electric field electrodes allowed to
   selectively pattern areas that are exposed. Furthermore, it was observed
   that this surface deformation behavior was reversible, since heating the
   films to a temperature above T-g in the absence of an electric field
   caused the erasure of all surface patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems represent one of the most
   promising techniques for heating and cooling in buildings. These systems
   use the ground as a heat source/sink, allowing a better efficiency
   thanks to the low variations of the ground temperature along the
   seasons. The ground-source heat exchanger (GSHE) then becomes a key
   component for optimizing the overall performance of the system.
   Moreover, the short-term response related to the dynamic behaviour of
   the GSHE is a crucial aspect, especially from a regulation criteria
   perspective in on/off controlled GSHP systems. In this context, a novel
   numerical GSHE model has been developed at the Institute de Ingenieria
   Energetica, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia. Based on the decoupling
   of the short-term and the long-term response of the GSHE, the novel
   model allows the use of faster and more precise models on both sides. In
   particular, the short-term model considered is the B2G model, developed
   and validated in previous research works conducted at the Institute de
   Ingenieria Energetica. For the long-term, the g-function model was
   selected, since it is a previously validated and widely used model, and
   presents some interesting features that are useful for its combination
   with the B2G model. The aim of the present paper is to describe the
   procedure of combining these two models in order to obtain a unique
   complete GSHE model far both short-and long-term simulation. The
   resulting model is then validated against experimental data from a real
   GSHP installation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Comparative Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The development of magnetic Barkhausen noise methods for rapid detection
   of residual stress concentrations has implications for integrity
   assessment of submarine pressure hulls. However, the stress-response of
   Barkhausen noise in submarine hull steel, HY-80, is complicated by the
   influence of the material's martensitic microstructure. The present work
   sheds light on the stress-dependent behavior of Barkhausen noise in
   HY-80 by comparing its signal characteristics with those of more common
   ferrite/pearlite steels. HY-80 and various ferrite/pearlite steel plates
   were uni-axially stressed up to and beyond the level for plastic
   deformation. Barkhausen noise measurements, performed using the same
   sensor under reproducible flux-controlled magnetization conditions,
   facilitated a direct comparison of material responses. Results showed
   that with the application of tensile stress, the Barkhausen noise signal
   of ferrite/pearlite steels linearly increased, reached a peak value and
   saturated in the elastic region. By contrast, HY-80 demonstrated a
   linear increase with tensile stress characterized by a transition from a
   lower to a seven times higher rate of change for stresses above 200 MPa
   up to its yield point. The different stress-response of HY-80 was
   attributed to its martensitic microstructure, which modifies the
   response of the domain structure under tensile stress conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We present a fully-distributed self-healing algorithm dex that maintains
   a constant degree expander network in a dynamic setting. To the best of
   our knowledge, our algorithm provides the first efficient distributed
   construction of expanders-whose expansion properties hold
   deterministically-that works even under an all-powerful adaptive
   adversary that controls the dynamic changes to the network ( the
   adversary has unlimited computational power and knowledge of the entire
   network state, can decide which nodes join and leave and at what time,
   and knows the past random choices made by the algorithm). Previous
   distributed expander constructions typically provide only probabilistic
   guarantees on the network expansion which rapidly degrade in a dynamic
   setting; in particular, the expansion properties can degrade even more
   rapidly under adversarial insertions and deletions. Our algorithm
   provides efficient maintenance and incurs a low overhead per
   insertion/deletion by an adaptive adversary: only O(log n) rounds and O(
   log n) messages are needed with high probability ( n is the number of
   nodes currently in the network). The algorithm requires only a constant
   number of topology changes. Moreover, our algorithm allows for an
   efficient implementation and maintenance of a distributed hash table on
   top of dex with only a constant additional overhead. Our results are a
   step towards implementing efficient self-healing networks that have
   guaranteed properties ( constant bounded degree and expansion) despite
   dynamic changes.}},

Abstract = {{Background In clinical environments, field distortion can cause
   significant electromagnetic tracking errors. Therefore, dynamic
   calibration of electromagnetic tracking systems is essential to
   compensate for measurement errors.
   Methods It is proposed to integrate the motion model of the tracked
   instrument with redundant EM sensor observations and to apply a
   simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm in order to accurately
   estimate the pose of the instrument and create a map of the field
   distortion in real-time. Experiments were conducted in the presence of
   ferromagnetic and electrically-conductive field distorting objects and
   results compared with those of a conventional sensor fusion approach.
   Results The proposed method reduced the tracking error from 3.94 +/-
   1.61 mm to 1.82 +/- 0.62mmin the presence of steel, and from 0.31 +/-
   0.22mmto 0.11 +/- 0.14mm in the presence of aluminum.
   Conclusions With reduced tracking error and independence from external
   tracking devices or pre-operative calibrations, the approach is
   promising for reliable EM navigation in various clinical procedures.

Abstract = {{Introduction: During total hip arthroplasty (THA), accurately predicting
   acetabular cup orientation remains a key challenge, in great part
   because of uncertainty about pelvic orientation. This pilot study aimed
   to develop and validate a technique to measure pelvic orientation;
   establish its accuracy in the location of anatomical landmarks and
   subsequently; investigate if limb movement during a simulated surgical
   procedure alters pelvic orientation.
   Methods: The developed technique measured 3-D orientation of an isolated
   Sawbone pelvis, it was then implemented to measure pelvic orientation in
   lateral decubitus with post-THA patients (n = 20) using a motion capture
   system.
   Results: Orientation of the isolated Sawbone pelvis was accurately
   measured, demonstrated by high correlations with angular data from a
   coordinate measurement machine; R-squared values close to 1 for all
   pelvic axes. When applied to volunteer subjects, largest movements
   occurred about the longitudinal pelvic axis; internal and external
   pelvic rotation. Rotations about the anteroposterior axis, which
   directly affect inclination angles, showed >75\% of participants had
   movement within +/- 5 degrees of neutral, 0 degrees.
   Conclusions: The technique accurately measured orientation of the
   isolated bony pelvis. This was not the case in a simulated theatre
   environment. Soft tissue landmarks were difficult to palpate repeatedly.
   These findings have direct clinical relevance, landmark registration in
   lateral decubitus is a potential source of error, contributing here to
   large ranges in measured movement. Surgeons must be aware that present
   techniques using bony landmarks to reference pelvic orientation for cup
   implantation, both computer-based and mechanical, may not be
   sufficiently accurate.}},

Abstract = {{Randomly distributed fiber reinforcement is used to provide an isotropic
   increase in the sand shear strength. The previous studies were not
   consistent regarding the fibers effect on the volumetric change behavior
   of fiber-reinforced sand. In this paper, direct shear tests are
   conducted on 108 specimens to investigate the effects of the fibers
   content, relative density, normal stress and moisture content on the
   shear strength and volumetric change behaviors of fiber-reinforced sand.
   The study investigates also the possibility of using dry
   fiber-reinforced sand as an alternative to heavily compacted
   unreinforced moist sand. The results indicate that the fibers inclusion
   increases the shear strength and dilation of sand. Moisture suppresses
   the fibers effect on the peak and postpeak shear strengths, and
   dilation. Dry loose fiber-reinforced sand achieves the same shear
   strength of heavily compacted unreinforced moist sand, yet at more than
   double the horizontal displacement. (C) 2015 Faculty of Engineering, Ain

Abstract = {{Wave and current measurements from a cross-shore array of nearshore
   sensors in Duck, NC, are used to elucidate the balance of alongshore
   momentum under energetic wave conditions with wide surf zones, generated
   by passing hurricanes that are close to and far from to the coast. The
   observations indicate that a distant storm (Hurricane Bill, 2009) with
   large waves has low variability in directional wave characteristics
   resulting in alongshore currents that are driven mainly by the changes
   in wave energy. A storm close to the coast (Hurricane Earl, 2010), with
   strong local wind stress and combined sea and swell components in wave
   energy spectra, has high variability in wave direction and wave period
   that influence wave breaking and nearshore circulation as the storm
   passes. During both large wave events, the horizontal current shear is
   strong and radiation stress gradients, bottom stress, wind stress,
   horizontal mixing, and cross-shore advection contribute to alongshore
   momentum at different spatial locations across the near-shore region.
   Horizontal mixing during Hurricane Earl, estimated from rotational
   velocities, was particularly strong suggesting that intense eddies were
   generated by the high horizontal shear from opposing wind-driven and
   wave-driven currents. The results provide insight into the cross-shore
   distribution of the alongshore current and the connection between flows
   inside and outside the surf zone during major storms, indicating that
   the current shear and mixing at the interface between the surf zone and
   shallow inner shelf is strongly dependent on the distance from the storm
   center to the coast.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the position of planning practices operated under
   precise guidelines for displaying modernity. Cultivating the spatial
   qualities of Cairo since the 1970s has unveiled centralised ideologies
   and systems of governance and economic incentives. I present a
   discussion of the wounds that result from the inadequate upgrading
   ventures in Cairo, which I argue, created scars as enduring evidence of
   unattainable planning methods and processes that undermined its locales.
   In this process, the paper focuses on the consequences of eviction
   rather than the planning methods in one of the city's traditional
   districts. Empirical work is based on interdisciplinary research, public
   media reports and archival maps that document actions and procedures put
   in place to alter the visual, urban, and demographic characteristics of
   Cairo's older neighbourhoods against a backdrop of decay to shift
   towards a global spectacular. The paper builds a conversation about the
   power and fate these spaces were subject to during hostile
   transformations that ended with their being disused. Their existence
   became associated with sores on the souls of its ex-inhabitants, as
   outward signs of inward scars showcasing a lack of equality and social
   justice in a context where it was much needed.}},

Abstract = {{Culture has always been important for the character of the cities, as
   have the civic and public institutions that sustain a lifestyle and
   provide an identity. Substantial evidence of the unique historical,
   urban civilisation remains within the traditional settlements in the
   Kathmandu Valley in Nepal, manifested in houses, palaces, temples, rest
   houses, open spaces, festivals, rituals, customs and cultural
   institutions. Indigenous knowledge and practices prescribed the
   arrangement of houses, roads, and urban spaces giving the city a
   distinctive physical form, character, and a unique oriental nativeness.
   In a technical sense, these societies did not have written rules for
   guiding development. In recent decades, the urban culture of the city
   has been changing with the forces of urbanisation and globalisation and
   the demand for new buildings and spaces. New residential design is
   increasingly dominated by distinctive patterns of Western suburban ideal
   comprising detached or semi-detached homes and high rise tower blocks.
   This architectural iconoclasm can be construed as a rather crude
   response to the indigenous culture and built form. The paper attempts to
   dismantle the current tension between traditional and contemporary
   `culture' (and hence society) and housing (or built form) in the
   Kathmandu Valley by engaging in a discussion that cuts across space,
   time, and meaning of architecture as we know it.}},

Abstract = {{We report the self-assembly of a new family of hydrophobic, bis(pyridyl)
   Pt-II complexes featuring an extended oligophenyleneethynylene-derived
   pi-surface appended with six long (dodecyloxy (2)) or short (methoxy
   (3)) side groups. Complex 2, containing dodecyloxy chains, forms fibrous
   assemblies with a slipped arrangement of the monomer units (d(Pt center
   dot center dot center dot Pt) approximate to 14 angstrom) in both
   nonpolar solvents and the solid state. Dispersion-corrected PM6
   calculations suggest that this organization is driven by cooperative
   pi-pi, C-H center dot center dot center dot Cl and pi-Pt interactions,
   which is supported by EXAFS and 2D NMR spectroscopic analysis. In
   contrast, nearly parallel pi-stacks (d(Pt center dot center dot center
   dot Pt) approximate to 4.4 angstrom) stabilized by multiple pi-pi and
   C-H center dot center dot center dot Cl contacts are obtained in the
   crystalline state for 3 lacking long side chains, as shown by X-ray
   analysis and PM6 calculations. Our results reveal not only the key role
   of alkyl chain length in controlling self-assembly modes but also show
   the relevance of Pt-bound chlorine ligands as new supramolecular
   synthons.}},

Abstract = {{The axial and flexure combined loading performance of a slender
   partially-composite concrete insulated wall design constructed using
   basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP) shear connectors and longitudinal
   BFRP reinforcement is investigated. The load-bearing wall panel
   sections, 600 mm wide and 2,700 mm long, were first subjected to axial
   loads ranging from 0 to 900 kN applied to the structural wythe only. The
   panels were then loaded to failure in four-point bending to develop the
   axial load-bending moment interaction diagram of the partially-composite
   system, which was compared to theoretical fully-composite and
   noncomposite curves. As axial load increased, failure under transverse
   loading changed from shear-compression of the structural wythe to
   diagonal splitting of insulation foam and rupture of BFRP connectors,
   then to crushing of the structural wythe. Composite action by the
   strength criterion reduced from 47 to 3\% as axial load increased from
   150 to 900 kN; while that by the stiffness criterion was much lower,
   8-2.5\%. Relative to a similar steel-reinforced wall panel with the same
   reinforcement ratio, the tested walls were 60-89\% the strength; and the
   percentage increased with axial load. A method is introduced to estimate
   the effective centroid of the partially-composite wall in order to
   calculate the moment from the eccentric axial load applied to this
   load-bearing system. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this study is on statistical analysis of hemp concrete
   properties. The main objective is to determine statistically the
   variability of the three main properties, which are: material density,
   compressive strength and Young's modulus. The analysis is done with
   respect to four main parameters, namely: the testing laboratory
   equipment and procedure, the hemp shiv type, the batch elaboration and
   finally the specimen size.
   Two types of hemp shiv have been used with two batches for each type.
   Two cylindrical specimen sizes have been considered: 11 x 22 cm and 16 x
   32 cm. All the specimens were manufactured and dried in the same
   laboratory in order to ensure the repeatability and homogeneity of
   studied material. After 90 days of drying under the same conditions, the
   specimens were transported to ten different laboratories for compressive
   testing. Before testing, a drying protocol during 48 h was applied by
   all laboratories for all specimens. Then, a unique protocol for
   compressive testing has been applied using the compressive testing
   machine in each laboratory. Finally, all data have been collected for
   statistical analysis. In this study, the results obtained by different
   laboratories show low variability for compressive strength and dry
   density; which is not the case for Young's modulus. Three probability
   distributions, namely: normal, log-normal and Weibull, have been
   proposed to fit the experimental results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to design granulated iron oxide for
   the adsorption of heavy metals from wastewater. Polyvinyl acetate (PVAc)
   was chosen as a suitable binder; as it is, water insoluble. Initial
   experiments on selection of suitable solvent of the polymer were carried
   out using three solvents namely; methanol, acetone and toluene. Based on
   the initial tests on product yield and mechanical strength, acetone was
   selected as the solvent for the polyvinyl acetate binder. Design of
   experiment was then used to investigate the influence of granulation
   process variables; impeller speed, binder concentration and liquid to
   solid ratio on the properties of the granular materials. The response
   variables in the study were granules mean size, stability in water and
   granule strength. The results showed that the combination of high
   impeller speed and high binder concentration favour the formation of
   strong and stable granules. Results also showed that leaching of the
   binder into the simulated was water was negligible. Trial adsorption
   experiments carried out using the strongest and most stable iron oxide
   granules produced in this work showed removal efficiency of around 70\%
   of synthetic arsenic solutions with initial concentration of 1000 ppb.

Abstract = {{Graphene (GR) and its derivatives are promising materials on the horizon
   of nanotechnology and material science and have attracted a tremendous
   amount of research interest in recent years. The unique atom-thick 2D
   structure with sp(2) hybridization and large specific surface area, high
   thermal conductivity, superior electron mobility, and chemical stability
   have made GR and its derivatives extremely attractive components for
   composite materials for solar energy conversion, energy storage,
   environmental purification, and biosensor applications. This review
   gives a brief introduction of GR's unique structure, band structure
   engineering, physical and chemical properties, and recent energy-related
   progress of GR-based materials in the fields of energy conversion (e.g.,
   photocatalysis, photoelectrochemical water splitting, CO2 reduction,
   dye-sensitized and organic solar cells, and photosensitizers in
   photovoltaic devices) and energy storage (batteries, fuel cells, and
   supercapacitors). The vast coverage of advancements in environmental
   applications of GR-based materials for photocatalytic degradation of
   organic pollutants, gas sensing, and removal of heavy-metal ions is
   presented. Additionally, the use of graphene composites in the
   biosensing field is discussed. We conclude the review with remarks on
   the challenges, prospects, and further development of GR-based materials
   in the exciting fields of energy, environment, and bioscience.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION}},

Abstract = {{Liquid noble based particle detectors often use the organic wavelength
   shifter 1,1,4,4-tetraphenyl- 1,3-butadiene (TPB) which shifts UV
   scintillation light to the visible regime, facilitating its detection,
   but which also can scintillate on its own. Dark matter searches based on
   this type of detector commonly rely on pulse-shape discrimination (PSD)
   for background mitigation. Alpha-induced scintillation therefore
   represents a possible background source in dark matter searches. The
   timing characteristics of this scintillation determine whether this
   background can be mitigated through PSD. We have therefore characterized
   the pulse shape and light yield of alpha induced TPB scintillation at
   temperatures ranging from 300 K down to 4 K, with special attention
   given to liquid noble gas temperatures. We find that the pulse shapes
   and light yield depend strongly on temperature. In addition, the
   significant contribution of long time constants above similar to 50 K
   provides an avenue for discrimination between alpha decay events in TPB
   and nuclear-recoil events in noble liquid detectors.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{As a follow-up to a previous proof-of-principle study, a novel
   Lagrangian pressure-extraction technique is analytically evaluated, and
   experimentally validated using dense 4D-PTV data. The technique is
   analytically evaluated using the semi-three-dimensional Taylor-Green
   vortex, and it is found that the Lagrangian technique out-performs the
   standard Eulerian technique when Dirichlet boundary conditions are
   enforced. However, the Lagrangian technique produces worse estimates of
   the pressure field when Neumann boundary conditions are enforced on
   boundaries with strong pressure gradients. The technique is
   experimentally validated using flow data obtained for the case of a
   free-falling, index-matched sphere at Re = 2100. The experimental data
   were collected using a four-camera particle tracking velocimetry
   measurement system, and processed using 4D-PTV. The pressure field is
   then extracted using both the Eulerian and Lagrangian techniques, and
   the resulting pressure fields are compared. Qualitatively, the pressure
   fields agree; however, quantitative differences are found with respect
   to the magnitude of the pressure minima on the side of the sphere.
   Finally, the pressuredrag coefficient is estimated using each technique,
   and the two techniques are found to be in very close agreement. A
   comparison to a reference value from literature confirms that the drag
   coefficient estimates are reasonable, demonstrating the validity of the
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{We present two physical layer secure transmission schemes for multiuser
   multirelay networks, where the communication from M users to the base
   station is assisted by direct links and by N decode-and-forward relays.
   In this network, we consider that a passive eavesdropper exists to
   overhear the transmitted information, which entails exploiting the
   advantages of both direct and relay links for physical layer security
   enhancement. To fulfill this requirement, we investigate two criteria
   for user and relay selection and examine the achievable secrecy
   performance. Criterion I performs a joint user and relay selection,
   while Criterion II performs separate user and relay selections, with a
   lower implementation complexity. We derive a tight lower bound on the
   secrecy outage probability for Criterion I and an accurate analytical
   expression for the secrecy outage probability for Criterion II. We
   further derive the asymptotic secrecy outage probabilities at high
   transmit signal-to-noise ratios and high main-to-eavesdropper ratios for
   both criteria. We demonstrate that the secrecy diversity order is min
   (MN, M + N) for Criterion I, and N for Criterion II. Finally, we present
   numerical and simulation results to validate the proposed analysis, and
   show the occurrence condition of the secrecy outage probability floor.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the fundamental rate-energy (R-E) tradeoffs are studied
   for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Unlike
   the existing results obtained using Gaussian input given an average

   discrete inputs considering a peak power constraint as well as an
   average power constraint. For these power constraints, the transmit
   power strategies are presented and the R-E regions are derived. The
   optimality of different SWIPT schemes is first studied in terms of the
   R-E tradeoff for the case of negligible circuit power consumption in the
   information decoder. The results are extended to the case of
   non-negligible circuit power consumption in the information decoder. The
   asymptotic R-E regions are also derived, which give us useful insights
   into the fundamental R-E tradeoffs. Finally, the R-E regions of Gaussian
   input and discrete inputs are compared under an average power

   uncertainty model and the second-order statistics scenario. To do so, we
   develop two design approaches. The first approach is based on the total
   transmit power minimization technique. We start with the norm-bounded
   uncertainty model and derive the optimal solution to the corresponding
   problem. To reduce the computational complexity, we also develop a
   low-complexity algorithm which offers performance that is very close to
   the optimal one. In the second approach, we apply a
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) balancing technique. We
   propose another low-complexity algorithm based on the SINR balancing
   criteria. Next, we consider the scenario where the second-order
   statistics of the CSIs are available. Again we start with the total
   power minimization method and derive both optimal and suboptimal
   algorithms. Finally, we apply the SINR balancing technique to this
   scenario and develop another low-complexity algorithm, which is suitable
   for practice.}},

Abstract = {{Recent renewed interest in computational writer identification has
   resulted in an increased number of publications. In relation to
   historical musicology its application has so far been limited. One of
   the obstacles seems to be that the clarity of the images from the scans
   available for computational analysis is often not sufficient. In this
   paper, the use of the Hinge feature is proposed to avoid segmentation
   and staff-line removal for effective feature extraction from low quality
   scans. The use of an auto encoder in Hinge feature space is suggested as
   an alternative to staff-line removal by image processing, and their
   performance is compared. The result of the experiment shows an accuracy
   of 87 \% for the dataset containing 84 writers' samples, and superiority
   of our segmentation and staff-line removal free approach. Practical
   analysis on Bach's autograph manuscript of the Well-Tempered Clavier II
   (Additional MS. 35021 in the British Library, London) is also presented
   and the extensive applicability of our approach is demonstrated.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of Phytodesalination Potential of Vegetated Bioreactors
   Treating Greenhouse Effluent}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The dissolved salt ions that are not absorbed during irrigation of
   greenhouse crops are gradually accumulated in the nutrient solution
   resulting in levels of salinity high enough to damage the crops. This
   water salinity presents operational and environmental challenges as the
   nutrient-rich greenhouse effluent should be discharged to the
   environment when deemed unsuited for irrigation. In this pilot-scale
   study, the potential of passive salt reduction (phytodesalination) in
   gravel and wood-chip flow-through reactors was evaluated using seven
   plant species including Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, Andropogon
   gerardii, Typha angustifolia, Elymus canadensis, Panicum virgatum,
   Spartina pectinata and Distichlis spicata along with an unplanted
   control reactor. While the unplanted system outperformed the planted
   units with gravel media, the wood-chip bioreactors with S.
   tabernaemontani and S. pectinata improved the greenhouse effluent
   reducing the solution conductivity (EC) by a maximum of 15\% (average =
   7\%). S. tabernaemontani and D. spicata showed higher accumulated
   contents of Na+ and Cl- in comparison with T. angustifolia and S.
   pectinata. Overall, S. tabernaemontani was selected as the most capable
   species in the wood-chip bioreactors for its better salt management via
   EC reduction and salt accumulation. It was however concluded that
   further treatment would be required for the greenhouse effluent to meet
   the stringent irrigation water quality guidelines in order not to pose
   any adverse effects on sensitive crops. Finally, the present hydraulic
   residence time (HRT = 3.7 days) and the solution salinity concentration
   were identified as the potential factors that may be limiting the
   efficiency of plant salt uptake, emphasizing the need for conducting
   more research on the optimization and enhancement of passive
   desalination systems for the greenhouse effluent.}},

Title = {{Techno-Economic Feasibility of Selective CO2 Capture Processes from

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Biogas from anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge is a renewable resource
   with high energy content, which is composed mainly of CH4 (40-75 vol \%)
   and CO2 (15-60 vol \%). Other components, such as water (H2O, 5-10 vol
   \%) and trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide and siloxanes, can also be
   present. A CH4-rich stream can be produced by removing the CO2 and other
   impurities so that the upgraded biomethane can be injected into the
   natural gas grid or used as a vehicle fuel. The main objective of this
   paper is to assess the technical and economic performance of biogas
   upgrading processes using ionic liquids that physically absorb CO2. The
   simulation methodology is based on the COSMO-SAC model as implemented in
   Aspen Plus. Three different ionic liquids, namely,
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis {[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide,
   1-hexyl-3-methylimidazoliumbis {[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide, and
   trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium The imide, are considered for CO2
   capture in a pressure-swing regenerative absorption process. The
   simulation software Aspen Plus and Aspen Process Economic Analyzer is
   used to account for mass and energy balances as well as equipment cost.
   In all cases, the biogas upgrading plant consists of a multistage
   compressor for biogas compression, a packed absorption column for CO2
   absorption, a flash evaporator for solvent regeneration, a centrifugal
   pump for solvent recirculation, a preabsorber solvent cooler, and a gas
   turbine for electricity recovery. The evaluated processes are compared
   in terms of energy efficiency, capital investment, and biomethane
   production costs. The overall plant efficiency ranges from 71 to 86\%,
   and the biomethane production cost ranges from \$9.18-11.32 per GJ
   (LHV). A sensitivity analysis is also performed to determine how several
   technical and economic parameters affect the biomethane production
   costs. The results of this study show that the simulation methodology
   developed can predict plant efficiencies and production costs of large
   scale CO, capture processes using ionic liquids without having to rely
   on gas solubility experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{A newly identified and dated segment of the South Tibetan detachment in
   the Karnali klippe, western Nepal Himalaya, constrains initiation of
   mid-crustal tectonically driven exhumation to the early Oligocene. The
   folded top-to-the-northeast high-temperature (similar to 600 degrees C)
   shear zone separates amphibolite-facies rocks with a ca. 36-30 Ma
   prograde metamorphic history in the footwall from weakly to
   non-metamorphosed upper crustal rocks in the hanging wall. In situ
   dating of syn-kinematic-post-metamorphic peak monazite indicates that
   the base of the shear zone was active from ca. 30-29 to <24 Ma, and a
   post-deformation muscovite cooling age implies that ductile shearing had
   ceased by ca. 19 Ma. Deformation along the South Tibetan detachment in
   western Nepal was thus synchronous with thrustsense shearing along the
   lower boundary of a zone of migmatitic rocks, compatible with tectonic
   models involving mid-crustal channelized flow during the Oligocene.
   Along with other published data from the Himalayan range, this suggests
   that the South Tibetan detachment actively exhumed the middle crust for
   almost 20 m.y.}},

   nanocomposites reaches 8.5 mm(2) s(-1) times greater than blank

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{A modified UNIFAC-VISCO group contribution method was developed for the
   correlation and prediction of viscosity of ionic liquids as a function
   of temperature at 0.1 MPa. In this original approach, cations and anions
   were regarded as peculiar molecular groups. The significance of this
   approach comes from the ability to calculate the viscosity of mixtures
   of ionic liquids as well as pure ionic liquids. Binary interaction
   parameters for selected cations and anions were determined by fitting
   the experimental viscosity data available in literature for selected
   ionic liquids. The temperature dependence on the viscosity of the
   cations and anions were fitted to a Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman behavior.
   Binary interaction parameters and VFT type fitting parameters were then
   used to determine the viscosity of pure and mixtures of ionic liquids
   with different combinations of cations and anions to ensure the validity
   of the prediction method. Consequently, the viscosities of binary ionic
   liquid mixtures were then calculated by using this prediction method. In
   this work, the viscosity data of pure ionic liquids and of binary
   mixtures of ionic liquids are successfully calculated from 293.15 K to
   363.15 K at 0.1 MPa. All calculated viscosity data showed excellent
   agreement with experimental data with a relative absolute average
   deviation lower than 1.7\%.}},

Abstract = {{Borosilicate glass is a potential dopant source for producing shallow
   boron junctions by the use of proximity rapid thermal diffusion.
   Interest in this technique has increased recently due to its application
   to the manufacture of solar cells. A borosilicate gel is spun onto a
   silicon wafer and the layer is rapidly thermally annealed to convert it
   to a borosilicate glass (BSG). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry and sheet-resistance
   measurements have been used to understand and subsequently optimise the
   conversion of the gel to a BSG nanolayer. Physical properties of the
   thin, spun-on layer, such as thickness, refractive index and porosity,
   were monitored. The optimum conversion step involved rapid thermal
   annealing for 45 s at 900 degrees C. This avoided any boron loss from
   the BSG layer during the thermal processing step. The position of the
   B-O stretching vibration around 1370 cm(-1) was found to be sensitive to
   boron outdiffusion and it is suggested that FTIR spectroscopy provides a
   simple method for monitoring the outdiffusion of boron from the spin-on
   dopant nanolayer. Further FTIR studies using p-polarised light at
   oblique incidence revealed, for the first time, the LO-TO phonon
   splitting of the B-O stretching vibration band in the glassy layer.
   Investigation of the stability of BSG layers over long periods showed
   that unstabilised (or undensified) BSG films demonstrate a dramatic loss
   of boron over 6 months.}},

   in co-melt granulation}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{294}},
Pages = {{411-420}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In co-melt granulation, collisions occur between the particles to be
   agglomerated and the binder material. Depending on the stage of
   granulation, the binder material can be in the solid or liquid phase.
   The outcome of these collisions controls the dynamics of the granulation
   process and the fundamental physics of the impacts are of interest. This
   paper examines the impact of glass beads (model particles) and solid
   Poly Ethylene Glycol (PEG) flakes on a substrate of PEG as the
   temperature of the PEG layer is increased from below its melting point
   to above it. While the layer is in the solid state, the result of the
   impact can be quantified by the coefficient of restitution. When the
   layer is in the liquid state, the impact can be quantified by the
   immersion behaviour. The results obtained show that the coefficient of
   restitution between either glass beads and PEG flakes and the PEG layer
   is strongly affected by temperatures. As the PEG layer approaches its
   melting point, the coefficient of restitution falls to zero. Once the
   temperature of the PEG layer exceeds the melting point, the impact is
   characterised by a transient maximum indentation and then rebound to an
   equilibrium position. These too are strongly dependent on temperature.

Abstract = {{A gas flow unified measurement system (UMS-G) for sequential measurement
   of gas diffusion and gas permeability of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs)
   under applied stress conditions (2 to 20 kPa) is described. Measurements
   made with the UMS-G are compared with measurements made with
   conventional experimental devices and are found to give similar results.
   The UMS-G removes the need to rely on two separate systems and increases
   further the reliability of the gas properties' measurements. This study
   also shows that the gas diffusion and gas permeability reduce greatly
   with the increase of both gravimetric water content and apparent degree
   of saturation. The effect of applied stress on gas diffusion and gas
   permeability is found to be more pronounced at gravimetric water content
   greater than 60\%. These findings suggest that at a nominal overburden
   stress of 20 kPa, the GCL used in the present investigation needs to be
   hydrated to 134\% gravimetric water content (65\% apparent degree of
   saturation) before gas diffusion and gas permeability drop to 5.5 x
   10(-11) m(2).s(-1) and 8.0 x 10(-13) m.s(-1), respectively, and to an
   even higher gravimetric water content (apparent degrees of saturation)

Abstract = {{Structured light scanning is an emerging technology that shows potential
   in the field of medical imaging and image-guided surgery. The purpose of
   this study was to investigate the feasibility of applying a hand-held
   structured light scanner in the operating theatre as an intraoperative
   image modality and registration tool.
   We performed an in vitro study with three fresh frozen knee specimens
   and a clinical pilot study with three patients (one total knee
   arthroplasty and two hip replacements). Before the procedure, a CT scan
   of the affected joint was obtained and isosurface models of the
   anatomies were created. A conventional surgical exposure was performed,
   and a hand-held structured light scanner (Artec Group, Palo Alto, USA)
   was used to scan the exposed anatomy. Using the texture information of
   the scanned model, bony anatomy was selected and registered to the CT
   models. Registration RMS errors were documented, and distance maps
   between the scanned model and the CT model were created.
   For the in vitro trial, the average RMS error was 1.00 mm for the femur
   and 1.17 mm for the tibia registration. We found comparable results
   during clinical trials, with an average RMS error of 1.3 mm.
   The results of this preliminary study indicate that structured light
   scanning could be applied accurately and safely in a surgical
   environment. This could result in a variety of applications for these
   scanners in image-guided interventions as intraoperative imaging and
   registration tools.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of prolonged
   high-intensity running on impact accelerations in trained runners.
   Thirteen male distance runners completed two 20-minute treadmill runs at
   speeds corresponding to 95\% of onset of blood lactate accumulation. Leg
   and head accelerations were collected for 20 s every fourth minute.
   Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scores were recorded during the third
   and last minute of each run. RPE responses increased (P < .001) from the
   start (11.8 +/- 0.9, moderate intensity) of the first run to the end
   (17.7 +/- 1.5, very hard) of the second run. Runners maintained their
   leg impact acceleration, impact attenuation, stride length, and stride
   frequency characteristics with prolonged run duration. However, a small
   (0.11-0.14g) but significant increase (P < .001) in head impact
   accelerations were observed at the end of both first and second runs. It
   was concluded that trained runners are able to control leg impact
   accelerations during sustained high intensity running. Alongside the
   substantial increases in perceived exertion levels, running mechanics
   and frequency domain impact attenuation levels remained constant. This
   suggests that the present trained runners are able to cope from a
   mechanical perspective despite an increased physiological demand.}},

Abstract = {{Precambrian supercontinents Nuna-Columbia (1.7 to 1.3 billion years ago)
   and Rodinia (1.1 to 0.7 billion years ago) have been proposed. However,
   the arrangements of crustal blocks within these supercontinents are
   poorly known. Huge, dominantly basaltic magmatic outpourings and
   intrusions, covering up to millions of square kilometres, termed Large
   Igneous Provinces, typically accompany (super) continent breakup, or
   attempted breakup and offer an important tool for reconstructing
   supercontinents. Here we focus on the Large Igneous Province record for
   Siberia and Laurentia, whose relative position in Nuna-Columbia and
   Rodinia reconstructions is highly controversial. We present precise
   geochronology-nine U-Pb and six Ar-Ar ages-on dolerite dykes and sills,
   along with existing dates from the literature, that constrain the timing
   of emplacement of Large Igneous Province magmatism in southern Siberia
   and northern Laurentia between 1,900 and 720 million years ago. We
   identify four robust age matches between the continents 1,870, 1,750,
   1,350 and 720 million years ago, as well as several additional
   approximate age correlations that indicate southern Siberia and northern
   Laurentia were probably near neighbours for this 1.2-billion-year
   interval. Our reconstructions provide a framework for evaluating the
   shared geological, tectonic and metallogenic histories of these
   continental blocks.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a survey of residents of Kingston, Ontario, Canada, (n =
   107) to understand their attitudes to and experiences of waste
   management and governance. Currently, the municipality is emphasising
   waste diversion and exploring new waste processing systems (WPS; e.g.,
   incineration) to reduce costs. Using Foucault's governmentality theory,
   our data suggest Kingston's reliance on an attitude-behaviour-context
   model of behaviour change successfully fosters an environmental
   citizenship identity based on waste diversion (e.g., recycling).
   However, we argue that the neoliberal governmentality upon which the
   attitude-behaviour-context model is predicated elides the need for, and
   inhibits consideration of, broader societal change concerning urgent
   environmental issues involving consumption and waste.}},

Abstract = {{Fire exposure of pressurized tanks may lead to their catastrophic
   rupture due to internal pressure buildup and reduction of allowable
   stress of the metallic shell due to temperature increase. Hence, the
   assessment of the thermal behavior of pressurized equipment exposed to
   fires is a critical issue to prevent the escalation of accident
   scenarios in the process industry. The present study was aimed at
   comparing two modeling approaches for the assessment of the heat
   transfer in pressurized vessels exposed to fire. In particular, two
   simplified lumped models based on thermal nodes were compared with a CFD
   (computational fluid dynamics) model implemented on ANSYS FLUENT. The
   models were aimed at reproducing the initial phase of the vessel
   heat-up, before the opening of the pressure relief valve (PRV). The
   models were applied to case studies of industrial interest in order to
   assess the expected internal pressure build-up in different fire
   scenarios. The comparison among model results confirmed the importance
   of the use of advanced simulation tools for a more precise assessment of
   failure conditions of vessels engulfed in fires. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Utilisation of submerged vanes in front of intake ports is an effective
   approach to address sedimentation in lateral intakes from rivers.
   Strategically installed, these flow-training structures could increase
   the mid-depth and near surface flows into the intake, and simultaneously
   prevent bed-load transport from entering the intake channels. The
   effectiveness of submerged vanes depends on their number, shape,
   dimensions and configuration. Determination of optimum values for
   dimensions or configuration of the vanes is very challenging as the
   effect of many parameters, which are effective in sedimentation in the
   intake zone, must be investigated. In this study, effort has been made
   to determine appropriate dimensions of submerged vanes that are
   installed in front of a 90 degrees intake from a straight channel. Fuzzy
   TOPSIS, a multi-objective optimisation method, has been utilised for the
   optimisation process by considering ten parameters. The simulations have
   been conducted for three discharge ratios of 0.11, 0.16 and 0.21. The
   results show that a height of 0.2 times the flow depth, and a length of
   four times the vane height are the appropriate dimensions for
   utilisation of submerged vanes in front of the lateral intakes from

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional ordered mesoporous (3DOM) CuCo2O4 materials have been
   synthesized via a hard template and used as bifunctional
   electrocatalysts for rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries. The characterization
   of the catalyst by X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron
   microscopy confirms the formation of a single-phase, 3-dimensional,
   ordered mesoporous CuCo2O4 structure. The as-prepared CuCo2O4
   nanoparticles possess a high specific surface area of 97.1 m(2) g(-1)
   and a spinel crystalline structure. Cyclic voltammetry demonstrates that
   mesoporous CuCo2O4 catalyst enhances the kinetics for either oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Li-O-2
   battery utilizing 3DOM CuCo2O4 shows a higher specific capacity of 7456
   mAh g, than that with pure Ketjen black (KB). Moreover, the
   CuCo2O4-based electrode enables much enhanced cyclability with a 610 mV
   smaller discharge recharge voltage gap than that of the carbon-only
   cathode at a current rate of 100 mA g(-1). Such excellent catalytic
   performance of CuCo2O4 could be associated with its larger surface area
   and 3D ordered mesoporous structure. The excellent electrochemical
   performances coupled with its facile and cost-effective way will render
   the 3D mesoporous CuCo2O4 nanostructures as attractive electrode
   materials for promising application in Li-O-2 batteries. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In gravity field modeling, fused models that utilize satellite, airborne
   and terrestrial gravity observations are often employed to deal with
   erroneous terrestrially derived gravity datasets. These terrestrial
   datasets may suffer from long-wavelength systematic errors and
   inhomogeneous data coverage, which are not prevalent in airborne and
   satellite datasets. Airborne gravity acquisition plays an essential role
   in gravity field modeling, providing valuable information of the Earth's
   gravity field at medium and short wavelengths. Thus, assessing the
   impact of airborne gravity data to fused gravity field models is
   important for identifying problematic regions. Six study regions that
   represent different gravity field variability and terrestrial data
   point-density characteristics are investigated to quantify the impact of
   airborne gravity data to fused gravity field models. The numerical
   assessments of these representative regions resulted in predictions of
   airborne gravity impact for individual states and provinces in the USA
   and Canada, respectively. Prediction results indicate that, depending on
   the terrestrial data point-density and gravity field variability, the
   expected impact of airborne gravity can reach up to 3mGal (in terms of
   standard deviation) in Canada and Alaska (over areas of 11. However, in
   the mainland US region, small changes are expected (0.2-0.4 mGal over
   areas of 11 due to the availability of high spatial resolution
   terrestrial data. These results can serve as a guideline for setting
   airborne gravity data acquisition priorities and for improving future
   planning of airborne gravity surveys.}},

Abstract = {{We present an analytic model of a magnetized galactic halo surrounding a
   Mestel gravitating disc. The magnetic field is taken to be in energy
   equipartition with the pressure dominant rotating halo gas (not with the
   cosmic rays), and the whole system is in a steady state. A more flexible
   `anisotropic equipartition' model is also explored. A definite pressure
   law is required to maintain the equilibrium, but the halo density is
   constant. The velocity/magnetic system is scale-free. The objective is
   to find the rotational velocity lag in such a halo. The magnetic field
   is not force-free so that angular momentum may be transported from the
   halo to the intergalactic medium. We find that the `X'-shaped structure
   observed for halo magnetic fields can be obtained together with a simple
   analytic formula for the rate of decline of the velocity with height z.
   The formula also predicts the change in lag with radius, r.}},

Abstract = {{The wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) at a wastewater treatment
   facility in eastern Ontario, Canada, have experienced excessive algae
   growth and high pH levels in the summer months. A full range of
   parameters were sampled from the system and the chemical dynamics in the
   three WSPs were assessed through multivariate statistical analysis. The
   study presents a novel approach for exploratory analysis of a
   comprehensive water chemistry dataset, incorporating principal
   components analysis (PCA) and principal components (PC) and partial
   least squares (PLS) regressions. The analyses showed strong correlations
   between chl-a and sunlight, temperature, organic matter, and nutrients,
   and weak and negative correlations between chl-a and pH and chl-a and
   DO. PCA reduced the data from 19 to 8 variables, with a good fit to the
   original data matrix (similarity measure of 0.73). Multivariate
   regressions to model system pH in terms of these key parameters were
   performed on the reduced variable set and the PCs generated, for which
   strong fits (R-2 > 0.79 with all data) were observed. The methodologies
   presented in this study are applicable to a wide range of natural and

Title = {{Insights into the mechanism of nitrobenzene reduction to aniline over Pt
   catalyst and the significance of the adsorption of phenyl group on
   kinetics}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{293}},
Pages = {{337-344}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Aniline (C6H5NH2) plays a significant role in both industry and daily
   life, and can be synthesized via catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene
   (C6H5NO2) over transition metals; however fundamental investigations on
   reaction mechanisms in the heterogeneous catalysis are still lacking. In
   this work, the nitrobenzene reduction reaction over the Pt(111) model
   catalyst was studied using density functional theory (DFF) with the
   inclusion of van der Waals interaction, for fundamentally understanding
   the mechanisms at atomic and molecular levels. It was found that the
   double H-induced dissociation of N-O bond was the preferential path for
   the activation of nitro group, having a much lower reaction barrier than
   that of the direct dissociation and single H-induced dissociation paths.
   The overall mechanisms have been identified as: C6H5NO2{*} ->
   C6H5NOOH{*} -> C6H5N(OH)(2){*} -> C6H5NOH{*} -> C6H5NH{*} -> C6H5NH2{*}
   C6H5NIS The overall barrier of the nitro group reduction was calculated
   to be 0.75 eV, which is much lower than that of the benzene reduction
   (1.08 eV). Our DFT data elucidates clearly the reason why the major
   product of nitrobenzene reduction reaction was aniline. Furthermore, the
   adsorption/desorption of phenyl group was found to have significant
   impacts on kinetic barriers. Generally, in the hydrogenation process
   (N-H or O-H bond association), the phenyl group preferred to adsorb on
   the surface; but in the dissociation process (N-O bond dissociation) it
   preferred to desorb transiently at the transition state and to adsorb
   again when the dissociation was completed. This study also provides a
   solid theoretical insight into the selective catalysis of the large
   aromatic compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The field performance of a low-flow internally cooled/heated liquid
   desiccant air conditioning (LDAC) system is investigated in this paper.
   The quasi-steady performance (sensible and latent heat transfer rates,
   coefficient of performance (COP), and uncertainties) of the LDAC system
   is quantified under different ambient air conditions. A major
   contribution of this work is a direct comparison of the transient and
   quasi-steady performance of the LDAC system. This paper is the first to
   quantify the importance of transients and shows that, for the
   environmental and operating conditions in this paper, transients can be
   neglected when estimating the energy consumption of the LDAC system.
   Another major contribution of this work is the development and
   verification of a new method that quantifies (with acceptable
   uncertainties) the quasi-steady performance of a LDAC system from
   transient field data using average data.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid political and economic changes after the collapse of communism led
   to dynamic processes of urban restructuring in cities, replacing old
   patterns and models of growth with ones in which capital and the market
   economy were central to growth and development. The transformation
   towards a market economy and the reintroduction of land ownership
   required the establishment of a new and decentralised decision-making
   system, with direct consequences for cities' structure and form. As part
   of these urban transformations, there were clear changes in location
   patterns of retail structures in cities, illustrating diverse patterns
   of post-communist cities' spatial organisation. This article explores
   and provides insight into some special features of this transformation,
   both before and after the collapse of communism, in Bucharest, Budapest,
   Prague and Sofia. Examining these cities offers an overview of
   post-communist spatial restructuring processes and explores their
   changing centralities, which ultimately led to fragmented cities and
   disintegrated urban fabric. This comparative study also outlines how
   different development patterns can arise in cities that shared a similar
   past.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{78}},

Abstract = {{The effect of thermal annealing on the optical, structural and the
   dielectric properties of P3HT:PC70BM blended films were investigated. By
   means of atomic force microscopy, we observed the morphology evolution
   of the annealed P3HT:PC70BM nanocomposites. Raman spectroscopy showed a
   substantial ordering in the polymer film after annealing. The absorption
   spectra of the annealed P3HT:PC70BM films were improved and red shifted
   than un-annealed samples. The results indicate that the P3HT in the
   nanocomposite becomes an ordered structure with annealing. The ordered
   P3HT facilitates the charge transport. From the photoluminescence
   measurements, the formation of polymer crystallites was observed upon
   annealing. Thus, the device efficiency reaches 2.2\% after annealing at
   150 degrees C. Impedance spectroscopy shows the classical complex plan
   curves; the low frequency is related to the effective lifetime of charge
   carriers and the high frequency corresponds to the diffusion time of
   these carriers. Global mobilities are in the range 3.8-4.6 x 10(-3)

   in a series of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) multiwall carbon
   nanotube (MWCNT) composite films during quasi solid-state uniaxial
   deformation at low strain rates. Uniaxially deformed PET-MWCNT films
   displayed improved mechanical properties compared with unfilled PET
   films. SAXS/WAXS data revealed a well oriented lamellar structure for
   unfilled PET films. In contrast, the PET-MWCNT composites revealed a
   nanohybrid shish-kebab (NHSK) morphology, with reduced orientation and
   crystallinity. Mechanistically, this morphology development is
   attributed to the MWCNTs acting as shish for the epitaxial growth of PET
   crystallites. Furthermore, nucleation and crystal growth occurs in the
   PET matrix, but MWCNTs ultimately inhibit crystallite development and
   hinder a final lamellar structure developing. The results show
   unequivocally the role MWCNTs play as nanofillers, in the morphology
   development, thermal and mechanical properties in composite polymer
   films. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the static behaviour of reinforced concrete
   beams at low temperatures compared to similar beams tested at room
   temperature. Four large-scale beams were fabricated and tested. The
   testing program for the beams consisted of four stages: incrementally
   loading the beams to a service load of 90 kN, sustaining the load at 90
   kN for 48 h, cycling the load between 50 kN and 90 kN for 10 cycles, and
   loading the beam to failure. All of the beams had temperature
   differentials over their depth to simulate solar radiation and
   in-service temperature of the bridges. The beams tested at low
   temperature (-25 degrees C) demonstrated an increase in strength and
   ductility up to 13\% and 34\% respectively compared to the beams tested
   at +15 degrees C. The results also show that the cracking load increased
   while the number and the depth of the cracks decreased at low
   temperature. In addition, the widths of the shear cracks were reduced at
   low temperature compared to their counterparts at room temperature. The
   load at which the stirrups contributed structurally also increased
   drastically at low temperature. In this research, DIC/PIV technique was
   used to measure the widths of the shear cracks, and the effect of low
   temperature on the camera system was investigated through calibration
   tests to ensure the accuracy of the measured crack widths. (c) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper is an overview of the current research on minimal sensor
   activation and minimal communication in discrete-event systems. In
   problems of sensor activation agents observing a discrete-event system
   can turn the sensors for their observable events on or off dynamically.
   In problems of communication agents observing a discrete-event system
   can communicate event observations to one another dynamically. In both
   cases, a result is that the observations made by an agent are dynamic.
   That is, whether or not an agent observes an event or receives a
   communication is dependent on other factors besides membership of
   certain events to certain predefined sets. We survey such problems and
   associated works where, additionally, the use of event sensors and
   communication of messages must be minimized with respect to certain
   criteria. The application areas considered are the diagnosis, state
   disambiguation and state estimation of discrete-event systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the description and analysis of a
   phase-shift-modulated full-bridge converter with a novel robust passive
   low-rms-current resonant auxiliary circuit for zero-voltage switching
   (ZVS) operation of both the leading and lagging switch legs. Detailed
   time-domain analysis describes the steady-state behavior of the
   auxiliary circuit in different operating conditions. An in-depth
   comparative study between a fully specified baseline converter and the
   equivalent converter using the proposed resonant auxiliary circuit is
   presented. For a similar peak auxiliary current to ensure ZVS operation,
   a minimum of 20\% reduction in rms current is obtained, which decreases
   the conduction losses. Key characteristics and design considerations are
   also fully discussed. Experimental results from a 750-W prototype
   confirm the predicted enhancements using the proposed resonant auxiliary
   circuit.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Switched reluctance motor (SRM) drives are one competitive technology
   for traction motor drives. This paper proposes a novel and flexible SRM
   fault-tolerant topology with fault diagnosis, fault tolerance, and
   advanced control functions. The converter is composed of a single-phase
   bridge and a relay network, based on the traditional asymmetrical
   half-bridge driving topology. When the SRM-driving system is subjected
   to fault conditions including open-circuit and short-circuit faults, the
   proposed converter starts its fault-diagnosis procedure to locate the
   fault. Based on the relay network, the faulty part can be bypassed by
   the single-phase bridge arm, while the single-phase bridge arm and the
   healthy part of the converter can form a fault-tolerant topology to
   sustain the driving operation. A fault-tolerant control strategy is
   developed to decrease the influence of the fault. Furthermore, the
   proposed fault-tolerant strategy can be applied to three-phase 12/8 SRM
   and four-phase 8/6 SRM. Simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink and
   experiments on a three-phase 12/8 SRM and a four-phase 8/6 SRM validate
   the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, which may have significant
   economic implications in traction drive systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this work Cu1.4Mn1.6O4 (CMO) spinel oxide is prepared and evaluated
   as a novel cobalt-free cathode for intermediate temperature solid oxide
   fuel cells (IT-SOFCs). Single phase CMO powder with cubic structure is
   identified using XRD. XPS results confirm that mixed Cu+/Cu2+ and
   Mn3+/Mn4+ couples exist in the CMO sample, and a maximum conductivity of
   78 S cm(-1) is achieved at 800 degrees C. Meanwhile, CMO oxide shows
   good thermal and chemical compatibility with a 10 mol\% Sc2O3 stabilized
   ZrO2 (ScSZ) electrolyte material. Impedance spectroscopy measurements
   reveals that CMO exhibits a low polarization resistance of 0.143 Omega
   cm(2) at 800 degrees C. Furthermore, a Ni-ScSZ/ScSZ/CMO single cell
   demonstrates a maximum power density of 1076 mW cm(-2) at 800 degrees C
   under H-2 (3\% H2O) as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant. These
   results indicate that Cu1.4Mn1.6O4 is a superior and promising cathode
   material for IT-SOFCs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) mostly use low molecular weight
   alcohols such as methanol and ethanol as fuels. However, short-chain
   alcohol molecules have a relative high membrane crossover rate in DAFCs
   and a low energy density. Long chain alcohols such as butanol have a
   higher BIO-MASS energy density, as well as a lower membrane crossover
   rate compared to methanol and ethanol. Although a significant number of
   studies have been dedicated to low molecular weight alcohols in DAFCs,
   very few studies are available for longer chain alcohols such as
   butanol. A significant development in the production of biobutanol and
   its proposed application as an alternative fuel to gasoline in the past
   decade makes butanol an interesting candidate fuel for fuel cells.
   Different butanol isomers were compared in this study on various Pt and
   PtSn bimetallic catalysts for their electro-oxidation activities in
   acidic media. Clear distinctive behaviors were observed for each of the
   different butanol isomers using cyclic voltammetry (CV), indicating a
   difference in activity and the mechanism of oxidation. The voltammograms
   of both n-butanol and iso-butanol showed similar characteristic
   features, indicating a similar reaction mechanism, whereas 2-butanol
   showed completely different features; for example, it did not show any
   indication of poisoning. Ter-butanol was found to be inactive for
   oxidation on Pt. In situ FTIR. and CV analysis showed that OHads was
   essential for the oxidation of primary butanol isomers which only forms
   at high potentials on Pt. In order to enhance the water oxidation and
   produce Had, at lower potentials, Pt was modified by the oxophilic metal
   Sn and the bimetallic PtSn was studied for the oxidation of butanol
   isomers. A significant enhancement in the oxidation of the 1 butanol
   isomers was observed on addition of Sn to the Pt, resulting in an
   oxidafion peak at a potential 520 mV lower than that found on pure Pt.
   The higher activity of PtSn was attributed to the bifunctional mechanism
   on PtSn catalyst. The positive influence of Sn was also confirmed in the
   PtSn nanoparticle catalyst prepared by the modification of commercial
   Pt/C nanoparticle and a higher activity was observed for PtSn (3:1)
   composition. The temperature -dependent data showed that the activation
   energy for butanol oxidation reaction over PtSn/C is lower than that
   over Pt/C.}},

Abstract = {{A complete review of the published data on the mixing enthalpies of
   mixtures containing ionic liquids, measured directly using calorimetric
   techniques, is presented in this paper. The field of ionic liquids is
   very active and a number of research groups in the world are dealing
   with different applications of these fluids in the fields of chemistry,
   chemical engineering, energy, gas storage and separation or materials
   science. In all these fields, the knowledge of the energetics of mixing
   is capital both to understand the interactions between these fluids and
   the different substrates and also to establish the energy and
   environmental cost of possible applications. Due to the relative novelty
   of the field, the published data is sometimes controversial and recent
   reviews are fragmentary and do not represent a set of reliable data.
   This fact can be attributed to different reasons: (0 difficulties in
   controlling the purity and stability of the ionic liquid samples; (ii)
   availability of accurate experimental techniques, appropriate for the
   measurement of viscous, charged, complex fluids; and (iii) choice of an
   appropriate clear thermodynamic formalism to be used by an
   interdisciplinary scientific community. In this paper, we address all
   these points and propose a critical review of the published data, advise
   on the most appropriate apparatus and experimental procedure to measure
   this type of physical-chemical data in ionic liquids as well as the way
   to treat the information obtained by an appropriate thermodynamic
   formalism.}},

Abstract = {{Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) targeting tegafur, an anti-cancer
   5-fluorouracil pro-drug, have been prepared by stoichiometric imprinting
   using 2,6-bis(acrylamido)pyridine (BAAPy) as the functional monomer.
   Solution association between tegafur and BAAPy was studied by H-1 NMR
   titration, which confirmed the formation of 1:1 complexes with an
   affinity constant of 574 +/- 15 M-1 in CDCl3. Evaluation of the
   synthesised materials by HPLC and equilibrium rebinding experiments
   revealed high selectivity of the imprinted polymer for the pro-drug vs.
   5-fluorouracil and other competing analytes, with maximum imprinting
   factors of 25.3 and a binding capacity of 45.1 mu mol g(-1). The
   synthesised imprinted polymer was employed in solid-phase extraction of
   the pro-drug using an optimised protocol that included a simple wash
   with the porogen used in the preparation of the material. Tegafur

   assess cracking, mass loss, porosity, and thermal and mechanical
   properties. The residual performances for the recycled concretes were
   generally similar to but slightly worse than those observed for the

   nanofibers were synthesized by a one-step electrospin technique for use
   in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC)
   applications. PSFO-CPO nanofibers were produced with a diameter of about
   100 nm and lengths exceeding tens of microns. The thermal expansion
   coefficient (TEC) matches with standard GDC electrolytes and the
   resulting conductivity also satisfies the needs of IT-SOFCs cathodes.
   EIS analysis of the nanofiber structured electrode gives a polarization
   resistance of 0.072 Omega cm(2) at 800 degrees C, smaller than that from
   the powdered cathode with the same composition. The excellent
   electrochemical performance can be attributed to the well-constructed
   microstructure of the nanofiber structured cathode, which promotes
   surface oxygen diffusion and charge transfer processes. All the results
   imply that the one-step electrospin method is a facile and practical way
   of improving the cathode properties and that PSFO-CPO is a promising
   cathode material for IT-SOFCs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group

Title = {{Biological mechanisms associated with triazophos (TAP) removal by
   horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSFCW)}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{553}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Triazophos (TAP) is a widely used pesticide that is easily accumulated
   in the environment due to its relatively high stability: this
   accumulation from agricultural runoff results in potential hazards to
   aquatic ecosystems. Constructed wetlands are generally considered to be
   an effective technology for treating TAP polluted surface water.
   However, knowledge about the biological mechanisms of TAP removal is
   still lacking. This study investigates the responses of a wetland plant
   (Canna indica), substrate enzymes and microbial communities in
   bench-scale horizontal subsurface-flow constructed wetlands (HSCWs)
   loaded with different TAP concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5 and 5 mg . L-1).
   The results indicate that TAP stimulated the activities of superoxide
   dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) in the roots of C. indica. The
   highest TAP concentrations significantly inhibited photosynthetic
   activities, as shown by a reduced effective quantum yield of PS II
   (Phi(PS) II) and lower electron transport rates (ETR). However,
   interestingly, the lower TAP loadings exhibited some favorable effects
   on these two variables, suggesting that C. indica is a suitable species
   for use in wetlands designed for treatment of low TAP concentrations.
   Urease and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the wetland substrate were
   activated by TAP. Two-way ANOVA demonstrated that urease activity was
   influenced by both the TAP concentrations and season, while acid
   phosphatase (ACP) only responded to seasonal variations. Analysis of
   high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed seasonal variations in
   the microbial community structure of the wetland substrate at the phylum
   and family levels. In addition, urease activity had a greater
   correlation with the relative abundance of some functional microbial
   groups,}},

Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},

Volume = {{189}},

Month = {{MAY 12}},
Abstract = {{Due to the variability and stochastic nature of wind power, accurate
   wind power forecasting plays an important role in developing reliable
   and economic power system operation and control strategies. As wind
   variability is stochastic, Gaussian Process regression has recently been
   introduced to capture the randomness of wind energy. However, the
   disadvantages of Gaussian Process regression include its computation
   complexity and incapability to adapt to time varying time-series
   systems. A variant Gaussian Process for time series forecasting is
   introduced in this study to address these issues. This new method is
   shown to be capable of reducing computational complexity and increasing
   prediction accuracy. The convergence of the forecasting results is also
   proved. Further, a teaching learning based optimization (TLBO) method is
   used to train the model and to accelerate the learning rate. The
   proposed modelling and optimization method is applied to forecast both
   the wind power generation in Ireland and that from a single wind farm to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Acrylamide (AAm) is an important water-soluble monomer. Pulsed-laser
   polymerization in conjunction with size-exclusion chromatography
   (PLP-SEC) has been employed to measure the propagation rate coefficient,
   k(p), in aqueous solution at monomer concentrations from 1 to 30 wt \%
   and temperatures between 5 and 70 degrees C. Laser pulse repetition rate
   has been extensively varied, from 25 up to 500 Hz, to check for
   consistency of the measured k(p) values, which increase toward larger
   water content, e.g., by 50\% upon lowering AAm concentration from 30 to
   5 wt \%. Variation of pH, up to pH 11, and addition of up to 1 mol L-1
   NaCl to the polymerizing system do not significantly affect k(p). The
   activation energy, E-A(k(p)), of about 18 kJ mol(-1) stays more or less
   constant within the monomer concentration range under investigation,
   which indicates that the changes of k(p) are primarily of entropic
   origin. The pre-exponential factor, A(k(p)), increases from 5.7 X 10(7)
   to 7.7 X 10(7) L mol(-1) s(-1) upon lowering the AAm concentration from
   30 to 10 wt \%. These high A(k(p)) numbers demonstrate the fluidizing
   action of water,on the transition state toward internal rotation with
   AAm being lower than with acrylates.}},

Title = {{Molecular characterization of Gleason patterns 3 and 4 prostate cancer
   using reverse Warburg effect-associated genes}},
Journal = {{CANCER \& METABOLISM}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAY 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Gleason scores (GS) 3 + 3 and 3 + 4 prostate cancers (PCa)
   differ greatly in their clinical courses, with Gleason pattern (GP) 4
   representing a major independent risk factor for cancer progression.
   However, Gleason grade is not reliably ascertained by diagnostic biopsy,
   largely due to sampling inadequacies, subjectivity in the Gleason
   grading procedure, and a lack of more objective biomarker assays to
   stratify prostate cancer aggressiveness. In most aggressive cancer
   types, the tumor microenvironment exhibits a reciprocal pro-tumorigenic
   metabolic phenotype consistent with the reverse Warburg effect (RWE).
   The RWE can be viewed as a physiologic response to the epithelial
   phenotype that is independent of both the epithelial genotype and of
   direct tumor sampling. We hypothesize that differential expression of
   RWE-associated genes can be used to classify Gleason pattern,
   distinguishing GP3 from GP4 PCa foci.
   Methods: Gene expression profiling was conducted on RNA extracted from
   laser-capture microdissected stromal tissue surrounding 20 GP3 and 21
   GP4 cancer foci from PCa patients with GS 3 + 3 and GS >= 4 + 3,
   respectively. Genes were probed using a 102-gene NanoString probe set
   targeted towards biological processes associated with the RWE.
   Differentially expressed genes were identified from normalized data by
   univariate analysis. A top-scoring pair (TSP) analysis was completed on
   raw gene expression values. Genes were analyzed for enriched Gene
   Ontology (GO) biological processes and protein-protein interactions
   using STRING and GeneMANIA.
   Results: Univariate analysis identified nine genes (FOXO1 (AUC:0.884),
   GPD2, SPARC, HK2, COL1A2, ALDOA, MCT4, NRF2, and ATG5) that were
   differentially expressed between GP3 and GP4 stroma (p < 0.05). However,
   following correction for false discovery, only FOXO1 retained
   statistical significance at q < 0.05. The TSP analysis identified a
   significant gene pair, namely ATG5/GLUT1. Greater expression of ATG5
   relative to GLUT1 correctly classified 77.4 \% of GP3/GP4 samples.
   Enrichment for GO-biological processes revealed that catabolic glucose
   processes and oxidative stress response pathways were strongly
   associated with GP3 foci but not GP4. FOXO1 was identified as being a
   primary nodal protein.
   Conclusions: We report that RWE-associated genes can be used to
   distinguish between GP3 and GP4 prostate cancers. Moreover, we find that
   the RWE response is downregulated in the stroma surrounding GP4,
   possibly via modulation of FOXO1.}},

Abstract = {{Performance data for a dye based, regenerable oxygen sensor (Mills and
   Lawrie {[}1], Mills et al. {[}2]) are analyzed to develop useful kinetic
   models for sensor photoactivation (dye reduction) and dark, oxygen
   detection (dye oxidation). The titania loaded, thin film sensor exhibits
   an apparent first order photoactivation of the dye, which we demonstrate
   (Section 3.2 and Fig. 4) is due to a kinetic disguise of a zero order
   photoreaction occurring through a non-uniformly illuminated sensor film.
   The observed zero order, slow recovery due to dye oxidation by dioxygen
   (O-2 detection) appears best rationalized by a model assuming a near
   O-2-impermeable skin developing on the sensor surface as solvent is
   evaporatively removed following sensor film casting and curing. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Tolerance allocation is an important step in the design process. It is
   necessary to produce high quality components cost-effectively. However,
   the process of allocating tolerances can be time consuming and
   difficult, especially for complex models. This work demonstrates a novel
   CAD based approach, where the sensitivities of product dimensions to
   changes in the values of the feature parameters in the CAD model are
   computed. These are used to automatically establish the assembly
   response function for the product. This information has been used to
   automatically allocate tolerances to individual part dimensions to
   achieve specified tolerances on the assembly dimensions, even for
   tolerance allocation in more than one direction simultaneously. It is
   also shown how pre-existing constraints on some of the part dimensions
   can be represented and how situations can be identified where the
   required tolerance allocation is not achievable. A methodology is also
   presented that uses the same information to model a component with
   different amounts of dimensional variation to simulate the effects of
   tolerance stack-up.}},

Title = {{Non-hydrothermal origin of apatite in SEDEX mineralization and host
   rocks of the Howard's Pass district, Yukon, Canada}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN MINERALOGIST}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{5-6}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{The Howard's Pass district (HPD) comprises 14 Zn-Pb sedimentary
   exhalative (SEDEX) deposits and is located within the Selwyn basin,
   Yukon, Canada. Although the HPD is renowned for its large accumulation
   of base-metal sulfides, in places the Late Ordovician to Early Silurian
   host rocks also contain abundant carbonate-bearing fluorapatite (CBFA).
   This mineral is present stratigraphically below, within, and above the
   SEDEX deposits and occurs as fine-grained layers that are interbedded
   with cherty carbonaceous mudstone. Electron probe microanalysis and
   laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometric analysis
   reveal that mineral compositions and rare earth element-yttrium (REE-Y)
   systematics, respectively, are remarkably similar throughout the
   stratigraphic succession. North American Shale Composite
   (NASC)-normalized La/Sm and La/Yb ratios indicate that the original REE
   compositions in CBFA have undergone only minor compositional
   modification subsequent to deposition. Uniformly negative Ce anomalies
   indicate that the mineral formed in analogous manner to modern and
   ancient sedimentary phosphorites under suboxic bottom-water conditions.
   Europium anomalies are mostly absent, indicating that reduced, slightly
   acidic high-temperature hydrothermal fluids were not a major source of
   REE-Y to CBFA. The chemical homogeneity of the mineral irrespective of
   its stratigraphic position indicates that a common process was
   responsible for its deposition within the sedimentary rocks of the HPD.
   On the basis of the similarity of the REE patterns to modern and ancient
   phosphorites, and the absence of positive Eu anomalies, we conclude that
   the CBFA is of hydrogenous origin, and not hydrothermal as suggested by
   previous workers. As such, phosphorite formation in the HPD is casually
   related to SEDEX Zn-Pb deposit formation.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives This article uses conventional and newly extended solubility
   parameter (d) methods to identify polymeric materials capable of forming
   amorphous dispersions with itraconazole (itz).
   Methods Combinations of itz and Soluplus, Eudragit E PO (EPO), Kollidon
   17PF (17PF) or Kollidon VA64 (VA64) were prepared as amorphous solid
   dispersions using quench cooling and hot melt extrusion. Storage
   stability was evaluated under a range of conditions using differential
   scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction.
   Key findings The rank order of itz miscibility with polymers using both
   conventional and novel delta-based approaches was 17PF > VA64 > Soluplus
   >> EPO, and the application of the Flory-Huggins lattice model to
   itz-excipient binary systems corroborated the findings. The solid-state
   characterisation analyses of the formulations manufactured by melt
   extrusion correlated well with preformulation screening. Long-term
   storage studies showed that the physical stability of 17PF/vitamin E
   TPGS-itz was poor compared with Soluplus and VA64 formulations, and for
   EPO/itz systems variation in stability may be observed depending on the
   preparation method.
   Conclusion Results have demonstrated that although d-based screening may
   be useful in predicting the initial state of amorphous solid
   dispersions, assessment of the physical behaviour of the formulations at
   relevant temperatures may be more appropriate for the successful
   development of commercially acceptable amorphous drug products.}},

Abstract = {{Predictive resource allocation (PRA) techniques that exploit knowledge
   of the future signal strength along roads have recently been recognized
   as promising approaches to save base station (BS) energy and improve
   user quality of service (QoS). Recent studies on human mobility patterns
   and wireless signal strength measurements along buses and trains have
   indeed supported the practical potential of PRA. An unresolved
   challenge, however, is modeling the uncertainty in the predictions, and
   developing real-time robust solutions that incorporate probabilistic QoS
   guarantees. This is of paramount importance in PRA due to the prediction
   time horizon that adds considerable complexity and increases the rate
   uncertainty in the problem. With these developments in mind, this paper
   addresses energy-efficient PRA applied to stored video streaming using
   chance constrained programming. The proposed solution incorporates: 1)
   uncertainty in predicted user rates; 2) a joint level of probabilistic
   constraint satisfaction over a time horizon; and 3) both optimal
   gradient-based and real-time guided heuristic solutions. Our framework
   fundamentally differs from previous PRA work in the literature where
   nonstochastic approaches with assumptions of perfect prediction were
   primarily used to demonstrate the potential energy savings and QoS
   gains. Numerical simulations based on a standard compliant long term
   evolution (LTE) system are provided to examine and compare the developed
   solution. Unlike existing energy-efficient PRA, the proposed framework
   achieves the desired QoS level under imperfect channel predictions. This
   robustness is attained without compromising the energy-efficiency
   compared to opportunistic schedulers, and thus supports PRA
   implementation in practice.}},

Abstract = {{The separation of enantiomers and confirmation of their absolute
   configurations is significant in the development of chiral drugs. The
   interactions between the enantiomers of chiral pyrazole derivative and
   polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phase cellulose
   tris(4-methylbenzoate) (Chiralcel OJ) in seven solvents and under
   different temperature were studied using molecular dynamics simulations.
   The results show that solvent effect has remarkable influence on the
   interactions. Structure analysis discloses that the different
   interactions between two isomers and chiral stationary phase are
   dependent on the nature of solvents, which may invert the elution order.
   The computational method in the present study can be used to predict the
   elution order and the absolute configurations of enantiomers in HPLC
   separations and therefore would be valuable in development of chiral

Abstract = {{This paper describes and benchmarks a new implementation of image-based
   deformation measurement for geotechnical applications. The updated
   approach combines a range of advances in image analysis algorithms and
   techniques best suited to geotechnical applications. Performance
   benchmarking of the new approach has used a series of artificial images
   subjected to prescribed spatially varying displacement fields. An
   improvement by at least a factor of 10 in measurement precision is
   achieved relative to the most commonly used particle image velocimetry
   (PIV) approach for all deformation modes, including rigid-body
   displacements, rotations, and strains (compressive and shear). Lastly,
   an example analysis of a centrifuge model test is used to demonstrate
   the capabilities of the new approach. The strain field generated by
   penetration of a flat footing and an entrapped sand plug into an
   underlying clay layer is computed and compared for both the current and
   updated algorithms. This analysis demonstrates that the enhanced
   measurement precision improves the clarity of the interpretation.}},

Title = {{Influence of cross correlation between soil parameters on probability of
   failure of simple cohesive and c-phi slopes}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{839-853}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the calculation of probability of failure of
   simple unreinforced slopes and the influence of the magnitude of cross
   correlation between soil parameters on numerical outcomes. A general
   closed-form solution for cohesive slopes with cross correlation between
   cohesion and unit weight was investigated and results compared with
   cases without cross correlation. Negative cross correlations between
   cohesion and friction angle and positive cross correlations between
   cohesion and unit weight, and friction angle and unit weight were
   considered in the current study. The factors of safety and probabilities
   of failure for the slopes with uncorrelated soil properties were
   obtained using probabilistic slope stability design charts previously
   reported by the writers. Results for cohesive soil slopes and positive
   cross correlation between cohesion and unit weight are shown to decrease
   probability of failure. Probability of failure also decreased for
   increasing negative cross correlation between cohesion and friction
   angle, and increasing positive correlation between cohesion and unit
   weight, and friction angle and unit weight. Probabilistic slope
   stability design charts presented by the writers in an earlier
   publication are extended to include cohesive-frictional (c-phi) soil
   slopes with and without cross correlation between soil input parameters.
   An important outcome of the work presented here is that cross
   correlation between random values of soil properties can reduce the
   probability of failure for simple slope cases. Hence, previous
   probabilistic design charts by the writers for simple soil slopes with
   uncorrelated soil properties are conservative (safe) for design. This
   study also provides one explanation why slope stability analyses using
   uncorrelated soil properties can predict unreasonably high probabilities
   of failure when conventional estimates of factor of safety suggest a
   stable slope.}},

Title = {{Ipsilateral and contralateral foot pronation affect lower limb and trunk
   biomechanics of individuals with knee osteoarthritis during gait}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{30-37}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background: Lateral wedges have been suggested for the treatment of
   individuals with knee osteoarthritis, but it may have undesirable
   effects on the biomechanics of gait through increased foot pronation.
   This study investigated the effects of increased unilateral foot
   pronation on the biomechanics of individuals with knee osteoarthritis
   during gait.
   Methods: Biomechanical data of twenty individuals with knee
   osteoarthritis were collected while they walked in three conditions: i)
   flat sandals; ii) wedged sandal on the knee osteoarthritis limb and flat
   sandal on the healthy limb; and iii) flat sandal on the osteoarthritis
   and wedged sandal on the healthy limb. Knee pain and comfort were
   evaluated. Principal Component Analysis followed by ANOVA was
   implemented to identify differences between conditions.
   Findings: The wedged sandal on the osteoarthritis limb increased
   rearfoot eversion (P < 0.001; ES = 0.79); increased shank rotation range
   of motion (P < 0.001; ES = 0.70); reduced knee internal rotation moment
   (P < 0.001; ES = 0.83); reduced hip internal rotation moment (P = 0.001;
   ES = 0.66); increased ipsilateral trunk lean (P = 0.031; ES = 0.47); and
   increased trunk rotation range of motion (P = 0.001; ES = 0.69). Walking
   with the wedged sandal on the healthy limb increased hip (P = 0.003; ES
   = 0.61) and knee (P = 0.002; ES = 0.63) adduction moments. Individuals
   reported greater comfort walking with the flat sandals (P = 0.004; ES =
   0.55).
   Interpretation: Increased unilateral foot pronation of the knee
   osteoarthritis and healthy limbs causes lower limb and trunk mechanical
   changes that may overload the knee and the lower back, such as increased
   knee adduction moment, shank rotation and trunk lateral lean. Foot
   motion of both lower limbs should be evaluated and care must be taken
   when suggesting lateral wedges for individuals with knee osteoarthritis.

Abstract = {{Understanding light-matter interactions using localized surface plasmons
   (LSPs) is of fundamental interest in classical and quantum plasmonics
   and has a wide range of applications. In order to understand the spatial
   properties of LSPs, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) is a common
   and powerful method of spatially resolving the extreme localized fields
   that can be obtained with metal resonators. However, modelling EELS for
   general shaped resonators presents a major challenge in computational
   electrodynamics, requiring the full photon Green function as a function
   of two space points and frequency. Here we present an intuitive and
   computationally simple method for computing EELS maps of plasmonic
   resonators using a quasinormal mode (QNM) expansion technique. By
   separating the contribution of the QNM and the bulk material, we give
   closed-form analytical formulas for the plasmonic QNM contribution to
   the EELS maps. We exemplify our technique for a split ring resonator, a
   gold nanorod, and a nanorod dimer structure. The method is accurate,
   intuitive, and gives orders of magnitude improvements over direct dipole
   simulations that numerically solve the full 3D Maxwell equations. We
   also show how the same QNM Green function can be used to obtain the
   Purcell factor (and projected local density of optical states) from
   quantum dipole emitters or two level atoms, and we demonstrate how the
   spectral features differ in general to the EELS spectrum.}},

Title = {{Biomechanical strategies implemented to compensate for mild leg length
   discrepancy during gait}},
Journal = {{GAIT \& POSTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{147-153}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Although mild leg length discrepancy is related to lower limb injuries,
   there is no consensus regarding its effects on the biomechanics of the
   lower limbs during gait. Biomechanical data of 19 healthy participants
   were collected while they walked under different conditions as
   described: (1) control condition-wearing flat thick sandals; (2) short
   limb condition-wearing a flat thick sandal on the left and a flat thin
   sandal on the right foot; (3) long limb condition: wearing flat thin
   sandal on the left and flat thick sandal on the right foot. The thick
   and thin sandals had 1.45 cm of mean thickness difference. The right
   lower limb data were analyzed for all conditions. Ankle, knee, hip and
   pelvis kinematics and internal moments were measured with a motion
   capture system and six force platforms. Principal component analysis was
   used to compare differences between conditions. The scores of the
   principal components were compared between conditions using one-way
   repeated measures ANOVA. Twelve gait variables were different between
   conditions: rearfoot dorsiflexion and inversion (p < 0.001); ankle
   dorsiflexion and inversion moments (p < 0.001); knee flexion angle
   andmoment (p < 0.001); knee adduction moment (p < 0.001); hip flexion
   angle and moment (p < 0.001); hip adduction angle (p = 0.001) and moment
   (p = 0.022); and pelvic ipsilateral drop (p < 0.001). Mild leg length
   discrepancy caused compensatory changes during gait, apparently to
   equalize the functional length of the lower limbs. However, these
   strategies did not fully succeed, since both short and long limb
   conditions affected pelvic motion in the frontal plane. These results
   suggest that mild leg length discrepancy should not be overlooked in
   clinical settings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the flexural performance of sandwich panels composed
   of a soft polyurethane foam core and glass-fiber-reinforced polymer
   (GFRP) skins. A robust numerical model is developed to predict the full
   load-deflection and strain responses of the panel. It is based on
   equilibrium and strain compatibility and accounts for the excessive
   shear deformation and material nonlinearity of the core. It also
   accounts for geometric nonlinearity in the form of localized deflection
   of the loaded skin using the principals of beam-on-elastic foundation
   and the change in core thickness due to its softness. The model
   incorporates various failure criteria, namely core shear failure, core
   flexural tension or compression failure, compression skin crushing or
   wrinkling, or tensile rupture of skin. The model has the advantage of
   being able to isolate quantitatively the individual contributions of
   flexure, shear, and localized skin deformations, to overall deflection.
   A parametric study is performed to examine the effects of core density
   and skin thickness on panel behavior. It is shown that as the core
   density increases from 32 to 192kg/m3, the contribution of shear to
   overall deflection reduces from about 90 to 10\%. It also appears that
   the optimal core density of the sandwich panels is within 96 to
   128kg/m3, which represents the lowest density necessary to achieve the
   highest ultimate strength and stiffness.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{181-199}},

Abstract = {{We characterize a set of analogue materials used for centrifuge analogue
   modelling simulating deformation at different levels in the crust
   simultaneously. Specifically, we improve the rheological
   characterization in the linear viscoelastic region of materials for the
   lower and middle crust, and cohesive synthetic sands without
   petroleum-binding agents for the upper crust. Viscoelastic materials
   used in centrifuge analogue modelling demonstrate complex dynamic
   behaviour, so viscosity alone is insufficient to determine if a material
   will be an effective analogue. Two series of experiments were conducted
   using an oscillating bi-conical plate rheometer to measure the storage
   and loss moduli and complex viscosities of several modelling clays and
   silicone putties. Tested materials exhibited viscoelastic and
   shear-thinning behaviour. The silicone putties and some modelling clays
   demonstrated viscous-dominant behaviour and reached Newtonian plateaus
   at strain rates < 0.5 x 10(-2) s(-1), while other modelling clays
   demonstrated elastic-dominant power-law relationships. Based on these
   results, the elastic-dominant modelling clay is recommended as an
   analogue for basement cratons. Inherently cohesive synthetic sands
   produce fine detailed fault and fracture patterns, and developed thrust,
   strike-slip, and extensional faults in simple centrifuge test models.
   These synthetic sands are recommended as analogues for the brittle upper
   crust. These new results increase the accuracy of scaling analogue
   models to prototype. Additionally, with the characterization of three
   new materials, we propose a complete lithospheric profile of analogue
   materials for centrifuge modelling, allowing future studies to replicate
   a broader range of crustal deformation behaviours. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A multiresolution wavelet analysis of gravity datasets obtained from
   satellite, airborne, and terrestrial platforms was conducted to estimate
   their spectral differences and develop a fused free-air gravity model.
   In this study, fifth-generation Gravity field and steady-state Ocean
   Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite model (DIRR5 and TIMR5), airborne,
   and terrestrial gravity data were compared to estimate their differences
   within various spectral bands using wavelet decomposition. The datasets
   were combined in a two-dimensional approximation while taking into
   account their strongest spectral content to derive a fused gravity model
   that shows improved long and medium wavelengths over those of the
   original terrestrial gravity dataset. The studies were focused on two
   distinct areas, namely, the relatively smooth gravity field along the
   coast of the southeastern United States and the northern Gulf of Mexico
   and the highly variable gravity field of eastern Alaska. Results show
   that changes brought by satellite and airborne data in areas where the
   gravity field is smooth (southern United States) were negligible
   (0.1-0.2 mGal). However, in areas where the gravity field is more
   variable and the terrestrial data density is lower, the contribution of
   the airborne gravity and satellite data was increasingly significant on
   the order of several milligals. Results indicate future possibilities in
   predicting the necessity and contribution of airborne data based on the
   presented regional analysis scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Geologic mapping combined with microstructural and geochronologic
   analyses from the lower Himalayan metamorphic core in west-central Nepal
   record along-strike similarity in flow style despite variability in the
   timing of metamorphism and deformation. The Main Central thrust zone at
   the base of the Himalayan metamorphic core varies in thickness,
   tectonostratigraphy, and metamorphic gradient along the 250 km of strike
   length studied. In situ U-Th/Pb geochronology of monazite sampled from
   an along-strike transect at the top of the high-strain zone records
   Eocene-Oligocene prograde metamorphism followed by Miocene retrograde
   metamorphism. The timing of prograde and retrograde metamorphism and the
   muscovite Ar-40/Ar-39 dates gradually decrease along strike from
   northwest to southeast. This age trend is punctuated by an abrupt
   similar to 3-8 m.y. decrease in the age of prograde and retrograde
   metamorphism and muscovite Ar-40/Ar-39 dates near the Marsyandi River in
   central Nepal. Quartz crystallographic preferred orientation fabrics
   from a parallel transect along the base of the high-strain zone document
   similar flow style at similar to 440 degrees C in central Nepal.
   Muscovite Ar-40/Ar-39 ages, interpreted to approximate the age of
   deformation at this structural level, decrease from ca. 7 to 4 Ma along
   strike from northwest to southeast. Diachronous deformation and
   metamorphism along strike in west-central Nepal demonstrate the
   necessity of incorporating more than a single transect into tectonic
   models. Along-strike tectonometamorphic variability in west-central
   Nepal spatially corresponds to faults in the Indian basement bounding
   the subsurface Faizabad ridge, highlighting the possible influence of
   inherited basement faults on the geometry of the basal Himalayan
   detachment, the Main Himalayan thrust, as well as the tectonic evolution
   of the structurally overlying Himalayan metamorphic core. This study
   highlights the potential influence of inherited structures on the
   overlying orogenic wedge and the probability of along-strike
   diachroneity of deformation in the Himalaya.}},

Abstract = {{The shallow water kelp Laminaria digitata, abundant in coastal zones of
   the North Atlantic, is exposed to a range of hydrodynamic environments
   that makes it ideal for assessing the role of water motion on their
   growth rate. Here we quantify the growth of L. digitata, as a factor of
   blade and stipe elongation, at sites adjacent to Strangford Lough,
   Northern Ireland under different hydrodynamic conditions over a one year
   period. A modelling approach was used to numerically determine both the
   temporal and spatial variability of the hydrodynamic environment.
   Ambient seawater nutrient concentrations, temperature and irradiance
   were measured as well as the internal nutrient status of the L digitata
   populations. Kelp populations growing in the greatest and lowest water
   motion showed the lowest growth rates. Differences observed in growth
   rate could not be attributed to seawater nutrient availability,
   temperature or light. The internal nutrient status also suggested no
   influence on the observed differences in growth rate. Therefore if there
   are minimal differences in light, temperature and nutrients between
   sites, then populations of L digitata exposed to different water motions
   are likely to exhibit different growth rates. It is suggested that the
   growth rate differences observed were a function of water motion with
   the possibility that, in response to the hydrodynamic forces experienced
   by the algal cells, L digitata kelps in the high energy environments
   were putting more energy into strengthening cell walls rather than blade
   elongation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   by the industry. The major problem of this process involves surface
   melting which results in higher surface roughness after the laser
   surface treatment. This paper will report the results achieved by a 100
   W continuous wave (CW) fiber laser for laser surface treatment without
   the surface being melted. Laser processing parameters were carefully
   selected so that the surface could be treated without surface melting
   and thus the surface finish of the component could be maintained. The
   surface and microstructural characteristics of the treated samples were
   examined using x-ray diffractometry, optical microscopy,
   three-dimensional surface profile and contact angle measurements, and
   nanoindentation test. (C) 2016 Laser Institute of America.}},

Abstract = {{The investigation is focused on the wear behaviour at elevated test
   temperature of composite Ni-P/SiC deposit, with varying concentration of
   the reinforcing SiC particles. The phase evolution measured by X-ray
   diffraction suggests slight crystallisation during wear testing at 200
   degrees C. In coating without reinforcing particles, adhesive wear is
   accompanied by microcracks. The thermal heat generated and the cyclic
   loading could have induced sub-surface microcracks. Owing to the
   effective matrix-ceramics system in composite coatings, fine grooves,
   abrasive polishing and uniform wearing are observed. Reinforcing
   particles in the matrix hinder microcrack formation and significantly
   reduce the wear rate. Triboxidation is confirmed from energy dispersive
   X-ray spectrometry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several factors affecting the reactivity of fly ash (FA) as a precursor
   for geopolymer concrete have been investigated. These include physical
   and chemical properties of various FA sources, inclusion of ground
   granulated blast furnace slag (ggbs), chemical activator dosages and
   curing temperature. Alkali activated FA was found to require elevated
   curing temperatures and high alkali concentrations. A mixture of sodium
   hydroxide and sodium silicate was used and this was shown to result in
   high strengths, as high as 70 MPa at 28 days. The presence of silicates
   in solution was found to be an important parameter affecting strength.
   Detailed physical and chemical characterisation was carried out on
   thirteen FA sources from the UK. The most important factor affecting the
   reactivity was found to be the particle size of FA. The loss on ignition
   (LOI) and the amorphous content are also important parameters that need
   to be considered for the selection of FA for use in geopolymer concrete.
   The partial replacement of FA with ggbs was found to be beneficial in
   not only avoiding the need for elevated curing temperatures but also in
   improving compressive strengths. Microstructural characterisation with
   scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy (EDS) was performed on FAiggbs pastes. The reaction product
   of FA and ggbs in these binary systems was calcium aluminium silicate
   hydrate gel (C-A-S-H) with inclusion of Na in the structure. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The photocatalytic reactor described in the NOx removal ISO 22197-1:2007
   is used to study the kinetics of the process, using a film of P25 TiO2
   which has either been conventionally pre-irradiated in a stream of air,
   or unconventionally in a stream of NO (1 ppmv). In the former case it is
   shown that the system does not achieve steady state exit levels of NO,
   probably due to the gradual accumulation of HNO3 on the surface of the
   photocatalyst. The NO-preconditioned TiO2 film demonstrated excellent
   steady-state levels when monitored as a function of NO concentration,
   {[}NO] and UV irradiance, rho. However, in this case the photocatalytic
   reaction under study is NOT NOx removal, but the conversion of NO to
   NO2. It is shown that the kinetics of this steady state process fit very
   well to a kinetic expression based on a disrupted adsorption reaction
   mechanism, which has also been used by others to fit their observed
   (non-steady state) kinetics for NOx removal on conventionally-(air)
   preconditioned films of P25. The appropriateness of this model for
   either system is questioned, since in both systems the kinetics appear
   to have a significant mass transport element. These findings suggest
   that mass transport and non-steady-state kinetics are likely to be
   significant features for most active photocatalytic samples, where the
   \%NO conversion is >7\%, and so limits the usefulness of the NOx removal

Abstract = {{This study aims to evaluate the surface characteristics and chemistry of
   optimal activated carbons (ACs) synthesised from water-soluble
   grass-derived sulfonated lignin (SL) using three dehydrating salts
   (ZnCl2, KCl and Fe-2(SO4)(3)center dot xH(2)O). The optimal AC
   synthesised by each dehydrating salt was chosen as the carbon that
   achieved the highest removal efficiency of Cd2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions from
   aqueous solutions. These optimal sulfonated lignin-based activated
   carbons (SLACs) showed the highest surface areas, total pore and
   micropore volumes among all the synthesised ACs. These SLACs were named
   SLAC-ZC (optimal grass-derived SLAC activated by zinc chloride); SLAC-PC
   (optimal grass-derived SLAC activated by potassium chloride) and SLAC-FS
   (optimal grass-derived SLAC activated by ferric sulphate). The surface
   characteristics of two commercial activated carbons (CAC1 and CAC2) were
   also appraised for comparison purposes. The optimal SLACs showed
   similar, or even better, properties to the two CACs. The N-2
   adsorption/desorption isotherms showed that the micropore fraction of
   SLAC-ZC was greater and its mesopores were narrower than SLAG-PC. For
   SLAC-FS, the amount of adsorbed N-2 was markedly lower than all other
   ACs and hence its values of BET surface area (A(BET)) and total pore
   volume (V-total) were the lowest. The iodine volume capacities of
   SLAC-ZC and SLAC-PC were higher than CAC1, suggesting that they could
   operate better in continuous adsorption processes. FTIR and SEM analysis
   illustrated that chemical activation had changed the surface chemistry
   of SL. Overall; synthesis of ACs from this novel precursor will add
   value to sulfonated lignin, which is considered as an industrial waste.

Abstract = {{Perineural ganglion impar injections are used in the management of
   pelvic pain syndromes; however, there is no consensus regarding the
   optimal image guidance. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides high
   soft tissue contrast and the potential to directly visualize and target
   the ganglion. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of
   MR-guided percutaneous perineural ganglion impar injections.
   Six MR-guided ganglion impar injections were performed in six human
   cadavers. Procedures were performed with a clinical 1.5-Tesla MRI system
   through a far lateral transgluteus approach. Ganglion impar visibility,
   distance from the sacrococcygeal joint, number of intermittent MRI
   control steps required to place the needle, target error between the
   intended and final needle tip location, inadvertent punctures of
   non-targeted vulnerable structures, injectant distribution, and
   procedure time were determined.
   The ganglion impar was seen on MRI in 4/6 (66 \%) of cases and located
   0.8 mm cephalad to 16.3 mm caudad (average 1.2 mm caudad) to the
   midpoint of the sacrococcygeal joint. Needle placement required an
   average of three MRI control steps (range, 2-6). The average target
   error was 2.2 +/- 2.1 mm. In 6/6 cases (100 \%), there was appropriate
   periganglionic distribution and filling of the presacrococcygeal space.
   No punctures of non-targeted structures occurred. The median procedure
   time was 20 min (range, 12-29 min).
   Interventional MRI can visualize and directly target the ganglion impar
   for accurate needle placement and successful periganglionic injection
   with the additional benefit of no ionizing radiation exposure to patient
   and staff. Our results support clinical evaluation.}},

   which can reveal simplified trends in data. Multifrequency eddy current
   testing contains correlations across different test frequencies. In this
   paper, PCA is used to extract unique information from multifrequency
   eddy current data sets, used to measure the pressure tube to calandria
   tube gap, in CANada Deuterium Uranium fuel channels. Advantages include
   compressed data acquisition, allowing for increased inspection speed,
   and monitoring for variation in physical parameters using a reduced
   number of variables. PCA employing analytical input model data is
   validated against PCA employing data from physical experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing techniques such as selective laser melting offer
   unique capabilities in the manufacture of geometrically-complex metal
   components, but online quality assurance and process control still
   remain major challenges. In this paper, a low-coherence interferometric
   imaging technique, termed inline coherent imaging (ICI), is coaxially
   integrated into the selective laser melting process to monitor melt pool
   morphology changes and stability at 200 kHz. Single track processing and
   online monitoring of 316 L stainless steel powder were carried out under
   a range of process parameters: 40-320W laser powers; 50-600 mm/s scan
   speeds; 50-500 mu m layer thicknesses; and in supported and unsupported
   local build environments. Galvanometer-based scanning of the imaging
   spot relative to the melt pool allowed capture of the geometrical
   profile of the melt pool and environment undetectable by existing
   thermal-based imaging systems. Exploiting the high-speed imaging rate,
   time-resolved ICI measurements demonstrate that melt pool fluctuations
   strongly influence final track quality. Process defects resulting from
   poor parameter regimes are detected and characteristic fault signatures
   are identified. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{58-71}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the motion recovery methodologies are proposed to recover
   as many components of the manipulator twist as possible while minimizing
   the 2-norm of the joint velocity vector. If any component of the joint
   velocity vector after the recovery violates the corresponding limits,
   the joints with velocities exceeding the limits are treated as failed
   and their velocities are set to their limits. When the Jacobian matrix
   of the failed manipulator is full row-rank and the joint velocities
   remain within their limits, the full recovery is achieved using the
   inverse or generalized inverse of the reduced Jacobian matrix. If the
   Jacobian matrix of the failed manipulator is full row-rank, but the
   minimum 2-norm of the joint velocities violate their limits so as the
   full recovery is not achieved, an optimization method followed by
   partitioning the reduced Jacobian matrix is proposed. Also, when the
   Jacobian matrix is full column-rank and the joint velocities remain
   within their limits, the partial recovery is obtained using partitioning
   the reduced Jacobian matrix. As examples, planar serial and parallel
   manipulators are investigated to show the effectiveness of the

   in a series of ionic liquids (ILs) based on the

   voltammetry has been used to observe the reduction of oxygen in ILs at a

   ILs and the calculated molar volume and free volume are also reported.
   It is found that, within this class of ILs, the oxygen diffusivity
   generally increases with decreasing viscosity of the neat IL. An inverse
   relationship between oxygen solubility and IL free volume is reported
   for the two IL families implying that oxygen is not simply occupying the
   available empty space. In addition, it is reported that the introduction
   of an ether-group into the IL cation structure promotes the diffusivity
   of dissolved oxygen but reduces the solubility of the gas.}},

Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{As a promising charge carrier transfer scheme, optical coupling could
   potentially improve the performance of an optoelectronic device for
   energy harvesting based on well developed nanotechnology. By extracting
   carriers optically, the functional features of the nano-structured
   material could be better used by minimizing the concerns about its
   electrical properties. In this paper, we present a rigorous
   electromagnetic model to analyze the optical carrier transfer problem.
   The flow of the energy is analyzed carefully by the photon transfer
   spectrum, and the photon emitters (electron-hole pairs) are assumed in a
   thermal equilibrium described by Bose-Einstein distribution. The result
   shows that an energy selective carrier transfer can be optically
   achieved at the device level by integrating the emitter and receiver
   into a nano-optical resonator, where both the photon emission and
   absorption are significantly amplified by a near-field coupling around
   the resonant frequency. General design and optimization schemes in
   practice are addressed by examining the influence of the photonic design
   and an energy dependent emissivity of the emitter, which can be used to
   develop the optical contacting concept further. Published by AIP

Abstract = {{The controlled coupling of photon emitters with tailored nanophotonic
   structures offers an exciting platform for studying fundamental quantum
   electrodynamics (QED) and developing on-chip quantum information
   processing at telecom-compatible wavelengths. Here we introduce a
   three-dimensional polariton waveguide structure, capable of achieving
   strong coupling with a single quantum emitter. This polariton waveguide
   consists of a nanowire-based photonic crystal (PC) waveguide with a
   quantum dot (QD) embedded in each unit cell. Using realistic designs and
   parameters, we derive and calculate the fundamental electromagnetic
   properties of these polariton waveguides, with an emphasis on the local
   optical density of states (LDOS) and the photon Green function. We
   demonstrate dramatic increases, and rich fundamental control, of the
   LDOS due to strong light-matter interactions in each unit cell through
   periodic QD interactions and further show that these results are quite
   robust to structural disorder. As an example application, we consider
   the coupling of an external target QD with a finite-sized polariton
   waveguide, and show that the single QD strong coupling regime is easily
   accessible, even for modest dipole strengths. Our polaronic structures
   are fundamentally interesting and allow for the exploration of new
   regimes of waveguide QED. While our calculations are exemplified for a
   PC nanowire system, the general results apply to a wide range of PC
   waveguides including planar PC slabs and ``alligator{''} PCs, as well as
   circuit-QED systems. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Carbons are the main electrode materials used in electrochemical
   capacitors, which are electrochemical energy storage devices with high
   power densities and long cycling lifetimes. However, increasing their
   energy density will improve their potential for commercial
   implementation. In this regard, the use of high surface area carbons and
   high voltage electrolytes are well-known strategies to increase the
   attainable energy density, and lately ionic liquids (ILs) have been
   explored as promising alternatives to current stateof- the-art
   acetonitrile-based electrolytes. Also, in terms of safety and
   sustainability, ILs are attractive electrolyte materials for
   electrochemical capacitors. In addition, it has been shown that the
   matching of the carbon pore size with the electrolyte ion size further
   increases the attainable electric double layer (EDL) capacitance and
   energy density. The use of pseudocapacitive reactions can significantly
   increase the attainable energy density, and quinonic-based materials
   offer a potentially sustainable and cost-effective research avenue for
   both the electrode and the electrolyte. This perspective will provide an
   overview of the current state-of-the-art research on electrochemical
   capacitors based on combinations of carbons, ILs, and quinonic
   compounds, highlighting performances and challenges and discussing
   possible future research avenues. In this regard, current interest is
   mainly focused on strategies, which may ultimately lead to commercially
   competitive, sustainable high-performance electrochemical capacitors for
   different applications including those requiring mechanical flexibility

Abstract = {{Raman analysis of dilute aqueous solutions is normally prevented by
   their low signal levels. A very general method to increase the
   concentration to detectable levels is to evaporate droplets of the
   sample to dryness, creating solid deposits which are then Raman probed.
   Here, super hydrophobic (SHP) wires with hydrophilic tips have been used
   as supports for drying droplets, which have the advantage that the
   residue is automatically deposited at the tip. The SHP wires were
   readily prepared in minutes using electroless galvanic deposition of Ag
   onto copper wires followed by modification with a polyfluorothiol
   (3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10)10,10-heptadecafluoro-l-decanethiol,
   HDFT). Cutting the coated wires with a scalpel revealed hydrophilic tips
   which could support droplets whose maximum size was determined by the
   wire diameter. Typically, 230 mu m wires were used to support 0.6 mu L
   droplets. Evaporation of dilute melamine droplets gave solid deposits
   whiCh could be observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) arid Raman
   spectroscopy. The limit of detection for melamine using a two stage
   evaporation procedure was 1 X 10(-6) mol dm(-3). The physical appearance
   of dried droplets of sucrose and glucose showed that the samples
   retained significant amounts Of water, even under high vacuum.
   Nonetheless, the Raman detection limits of sucrose and glucose were 5 X
   10(-4) and 2.5 x 10(-3) mol dm-3, respectively, which is similar to the
   sensitivity reported for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)
   detection of glucose. It was also possible to quantify the two sugars in
   mixtures at concentrations which were similar to those found in human
   blood through multivariate analysis.}},

Title = {{Polaron master equation theory of pulse-driven phonon-assisted
   population inversion and single-photon emission from quantum-dot
   excitons}},

Abstract = {{We introduce an intuitive and semianalytical polaron master equation
   approach to model pulse-driven population inversion and emitted single
   photons from a quantum dot exciton. The master equation theory allows
   one to identify important phonon-induced scattering rates analytically
   and fully includes the role of the time-dependent pump field. As an
   application of the theory, we first study a quantum dot driven by a
   time-varying laser pulse on and off resonance, showing the population
   inversion caused by acoustic phonon emission in direct agreement with
   recent experiments of Quilter et al. {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 137401
   (2015)]. We then model quantum dots in weakly coupled cavities and show
   the difference in population response between exciton-driven and
   cavity-driven systems. Finally, we assess the nonresonant
   phonon-assisted loading scheme with a quantum dot resonantly coupled to
   a cavity as a deterministic single-photon source. We also compare and
   contrast the important single photon figures of merit with direct Rabi
   oscillation of the population using a resonant pi pulse, and show that
   the resonant scheme is much more efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Toward reduced-complexity digital implementation, frequency domain
   Volterra-based nonlinear equalization (VNLE) structures for multistep
   fiber nonlinearity compensation are proposed. In the cascade structures,
   nonlinear equalization is performed before (cascade-1) or after
   (cascade-2) the dispersion compensation in each step. Superior
   performance with the shorter discrete Fourier transform (DFT) lengths
   and fewer equalization steps compared to the conventional VNLE with
   parallel structure is demonstrated in a transmission experiment. The
   experimental results are obtained for 256 Gb/s single-carrier
   dual-polarization 16-ary quadrature-amplitude-modulation with
   root-raised-cosine pulse shaping and a roll-off factor of 0.1. The new
   cascade structures demonstrate superior robustness to insufficient DFT
   lengths and/or a limited complexity budget. Compared to the conventional
   parallel arrangement of linear and nonlinear compensation filters, the
   cascade-1 structure provides more than 90\% complexity reduction without
   any notable performance penalty. The structure enables the extension of
   the transmission reach by 1570 km, a 48\% increase compared to the
   linear solution that uses only electronic dispersion compensation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{144}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{APR 14}},
Abstract = {{BaH (and its isotopomers) is an attractive molecular candidate for laser
   cooling to ultracold temperatures and a potential precursor for the
   production of ultracold gases of hydrogen and deuterium. The theoretical
   challenge is to simulate the laser cooling cycle as reliably as possible
   and this paper addresses the generation of a highly accurate ab initio
   (2)Sigma(+) potential for such studies. The performance of various basis
   sets within the multi-reference configuration-interaction (MRCI)
   approximation with the Davidson correction is tested and taken to the
   Complete Basis Set (CBS) limit. It is shown that the calculated
   molecular constants using a 46 electron effective core-potential and
   even-tempered augmented polarized core-valence basis sets (aug-pCVnZ-PP,
   n = 4 and 5) but only including three active electrons in the MRCI
   calculation are in excellent agreement with the available experimental
   values. The predicted dissociation energy De for the X-2 Sigma(+) state
   (extrapolated to the CBS limit) is 16 895.12 cm(-1) (2.094 eV), which
   agrees within 0.1\% of a revised experimental value of <16 910.6 cm(-1),
   while the calculated re is within 0.03 pm of the experimental result.

Abstract = {{The DEAP-3600 experiment is located 2 km underground at SNOLAB, in
   Sudbury, Ontario. It is a single-phase detector that searches for dark
   matter particle interactions within a 1000-kg fiducial mass target of
   liquid argon. A first generation prototype detector (DEAP-1) with a 7-kg
   liquid argon target mass demonstrated a high level of pulse-shape
   discrimination (PSD) for reducing beta/gamma backgrounds and helped to
   develop low radioactivity techniques to mitigate surface-related alpha
   backgrounds. Construction of the DEAP-3600 detector is nearly complete
   and commissioning is starting in 2014. The target sensitivity to
   spin-independent scattering of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles
   (WIMPs) on nucleons of 10(-46) cm(2) will allow one order of magnitude
   improvement in sensitivity over current searches at 100 GeV WIMP mass.
   This paper presents an overview and status of the DEAP-3600 project and
   discusses plans for a future multi-tonne experiment, DEAP-50T.}},

Volume = {{169}},

Abstract = {{There have been considerable developments in Merseyside over the last
   fifteen years with regards to the commercialisation of recycled
   demolition aggregate. Liverpool is an urban region that at the time was
   undergoing regeneration. This required the demolition of old
   infrastructure. Subsequent reconstruction required new construction
   materials. A project started in 2001 to investigate the economics,
   practicalities and technicalities of using recycled demolition
   aggregates in concrete precast products. It was estimated that if all
   six demolition contractors around Liverpool worked round the clock (i.
   e. assuming there was enough feed material) they would still have found
   it difficult to maintain the required supplies for a single precast
   factory. Investment in equipment was therefore required to guarantee
   supply and improve the quality of the recycled demolition aggregate. The
   market forces and the incentives/ drivers for construction companies to
   adopt sustainable practises have encouraged investment of several
   million pounds to be made in new recycling plants and has resulted in `
   urban quarries'. This paper describes the developments in recycling of
   construction and demolition waste over the last decade in Merseyside and
   shows that recycling is not only sustainable but also profitable.}},

Abstract = {{Suction is an important stress variable that is required for reliable
   predictions of the likely performance of unsaturated soils. The axis
   translation technique is the best established method of measuring or
   controlling suction; however, the success of this application is heavily
   dependent on the rating of the high air entry filter (HAF) and how it is
   incorporated into the testing system. This paper reports some basic
   experiments in which samples of unsaturated kaolin were brought to
   saturation in stages using 5 bar and 15 bar HAFs. The results have shown
   that the water equilibrium in unsaturated soils is greatly affected by
   the rating of filters. The findings also suggest that the flow through
   unsaturated soils is not necessarily governed by the one-dimensional
   consolidation theory that was developed for saturated soils, and this
   may be attributed to the bimodal pore size distribution of unsaturated
   soils.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we deal with the problem of polarimetric diversity
   detection for point-like targets in the presence of Gaussian clutter
   with unknown covariance matrix. To this end, we jointly exploit the
   polarization diversity and the spillover of target energy to consecutive
   range samples to improve the performances of detection and range
   localization. For estimation purposes, we assume that a set of secondary
   data (free of signal components) is available with the same covariance
   matrix as the clutter in the cells under test. Because the uniformly
   most powerful test does not exist for this problem, we derive two
   adaptive detectors: the generalized likelihood ratio test and the Wald
   test. Interestingly, these new receivers ensure the constant false alarm
   rate property with respect to covariance matrix of the clutter. The
   performance assessments conducted on both simulated data and real
   recorded dataset reveal that the proposed detectors outperform, in both
   detection and localization, the traditional state-of-the-art
   counterparts that ignore either the polarimetry or the spillover.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a novel method for characterizing the exact solution
   for interval linear systems is presented. In the proposed method, the
   entries of the interval coefficient matrix and interval right-hand side
   vector are formulated as linear functions of two or three parameters.
   The parameter groups for two- and three-parameter cases are identified.
   The exact solution is characterized using the solution sets
   corresponding to the parameter groups. The parametric method is then
   employed in the motion analysis of manipulators considering the
   uncertainty in kinematic parameters. Example manipulators are used to
   show the implementation of the method and the effect of uncertainty in
   the motion performance.}},

   Chain-length-dependent termination was taken into account in a model
   developed to describe the system, as high amounts of CTA have an impact
   on polymerization kinetics due to reduced chain length. The model also
   considers the 1,5-hydrogen shift (backbiting) reaction that transforms
   the secondary propagating radical into a tertiary midchain radical, with
   the backbiting reaction quantified via C-13 NMR. The model developed is
   the most comprehensive treatment to date of this complex polymerization

   molar mass distributions over a wide range of conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This review covers direct searches for dark matter, and the role
   inorganic scintillators have to play in them. Particle dark matter may
   make up most of the matter in the universe. Direct searches for dark
   matter are progressing thanks to improvements in detector technology.
   The phase space predicted by various theories is vast. Noble-element
   based detectors, soon weighing one ton, seem best-placed to search for
   relatively heavy (greater than or similar to 20 GeV) particles, and have
   already probed dark matter-nucleon cross sections as small as 7 x
   10(-46) cm(2). A variety of other technologies, including cryogenic
   detectors, gaseous ones and CCDs, will cover lower masses (down to 1 GeV
   or less), where recent hints for a discovery have been seriously
   undermined. Background rejection is essential in this field. Inorganic
   scintillators have roles to play at cryogenic temperatures, where the
   scintillation signal can be coupled to a measurement of phonons,
   providing particle identification. Future experiments with highly
   radiopure and high light yield NaI(Tl) can contribute to direct
   investigation of the longstanding detection claim from DAMA/LIBRA.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the optimal physical-layer secure transmission with
   artificial noise in the wiretap channel with N antennas at the
   transmitter, a single antenna at the receiver, and M antennas at the
   eavesdropper. We analyze the performance and determine the optimal
   transmission parameters for two distinct schemes: 1) an on-off
   transmission scheme and 2) an adaptive transmission scheme. For the
   on-off transmission scheme, where a channel-realization-independent
   secrecy rate is used for all transmission periods, we derive closed-form
   expressions for the secure transmission probability, the hybrid outage
   probability, and the effective secrecy throughput. For the adaptive
   transmission scheme, where a channel-realization-dependent secrecy rate
   is used for each transmission period, we derive closed-form expressions
   for the secure transmission probability, the secrecy outage probability,
   and the effective secrecy throughput. Using these closed-form
   expressions, we determine the optimal power allocation between
   information signals and artificial noise signals for both schemes to
   maximize the secure transmission probability. We also determine the
   optimal secrecy rate for both schemes to maximize the effective secrecy
   throughput. We explicitly examine the impact of N and M on the optimal
   power allocation and the optimal secrecy rate. Finally, we demonstrate
   the performance gain of the adaptive transmission scheme over the on-off
   transmission scheme.}},

   Application on Stick-Slip Interaction Detection}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Real-time detection of contact states, such as stick-slip interaction
   between a robot and an object on its end effector, is crucial for the
   robot to grasp and manipulate the object steadily. This paper presents a
   novel tactile sensor based on electromagnetic induction and its
   application on stick-slip interaction. An equivalent cantilever-beam
   model of the tactile sensor was built and capable of constructing the
   relationship between the sensor output and the friction applied on the
   sensor. With the tactile sensor, a new method to detect stick-slip
   interaction on the contact surface between the object and the sensor is
   proposed based on the characteristics of friction change. Furthermore, a
   prototype was developed for a typical application, stable wafer
   transferring on a wafer transfer robot, by considering the spatial
   magnetic field distribution and the sensor size according to the
   requirements of wafer transfer. The experimental results validate the
   sensing mechanism of the tactile sensor and verify its feasibility of
   detecting stick-slip on the contact surface between the wafer and the
   sensor. The sensing mechanism also provides a new approach to detect the
   contact state on the soft-rigid surface in other robot-environment
   interaction systems.}},

Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{Recent physical model studies of landslide behaviour in loose, granular
   slopes have illustrated that the soil at the base of a slope may be of
   heightened risk of liquefaction as this area is located directly in the
   path of monotonic shearing events (i.e. localised toe failures) and is
   often saturated by groundwater. The objective of this paper is to
   further investigate the factors that influence the possible transition
   of a small toe slide to a larger and higher mobility liquefaction flow
   failure. Specifically, this paper investigated the influence of
   stress-level and soil-layer thickness between two different laboratory
   testing methods in controlling whether a slide transitions to a flow in
   physical model flume tests. Observations from two flume experiments were
   contrasted: one in which suction stresses were designed to dominate (a
   0.33 m soil layer in a large-scale 1 g test) and a second enhanced
   gravity test performed in a geotechnical centrifuge where the body
   stresses are more representative of field scale landslides (i.e.
   behaviour representative of a 1.5 m thick soil layer). While the
   centrifuge test was brought to widespread liquefaction failure under
   increasing seepage flow, the 1 g flume test experienced liquefaction,
   but only displaced 25 mm. The results from this study highlight the
   dominant effect matric suction can have on the mobility of landslides,
   and provides a clear demonstration of the danger of misinterpreting the
   behaviour observed in small scale 1 g models as being fully accurate
   representations of larger field-scale landslide behaviour. (C) 2016 The

Title = {{Importance of surface carbide formation on the activity and selectivity

Journal = {{SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{646}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{45-49}},

Abstract = {{A recent experimental investigation (Kim et al. J. Catal. 306 (2013)
   146-154) on the selective hydrogenation of acetylene over Pd
   nanoparticles with different shapes concluded that Pd(100) showed higher
   activity and selectivity than Pd(111) for acetylene hydrogenation.
   However, our recent density functional calculations (Yang et al. J.
   Catal. 305 (2013)264-276) observed that the clean Pd(111) surface should
   result in higher activity and ethylene selectivity compared with the
   clean Pd(100) surface for acetylene hydrogenation. In the current work,
   using density functional theory calculations, we find that Pd(100) in
   the carbide form gives rise to higher activity and selectivity than
   Pd(111) carbide. These results indicate that the catalyst surface is
   most likely in the carbide form under the experimental reaction
   conditions. Furthermore, the adsorption energies of hydrogen atoms as a
   function of the hydrogen coverage at the surface and subsurface sites
   over Pd(100) are compared with those over Pd(111), and it is found that
   the adsorption of hydrogen atoms is always less favoured on Pd(100) over
   the whole coverage range. This suggests that the Pd(100) hydride surface
   will be less stable than the Pd(111) hydride surface, which is also in
   accordance with the experimental results reported. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sustainable building rooftop technologies, such as white roofs, green
   roofs, and photovoltaic(s) (PV) panels, are becoming increasingly
   implemented as a result of their associated environmental benefits.
   Studies of these rooftop technologies are often located in hot climates
   and do not assess their full environmental consequences. Further,
   current studies tend to focus on one technology and often do not
   evaluate the full range of technology options using a systematic
   framework with common assumptions and boundaries. This article evaluates
   the environmental performance on a life cycle basis of white roofs,
   green roofs, and roof-mounted PV in the cold Canadian climate. Solar PV
   demonstrates the highest environmental performance in all impact
   categories considered (see complete list in Results section) and is the
   preferred option from an environmental perspective. Green roofs result
   in beneficial environmental impacts, although much less significant than
   those obtained with PV, and are the only rooftop technology that reduces
   both heating and cooling energy use. The environmental performance of
   white roofs in cold climates is strongly affected by the heating penalty
   (i.e., the increase in heating energy use resulting from the high solar
   reflectance). Although white roofs have been proven an outstanding
   option in warmer climates, in cold climates, net negative environmental
   impacts lead to white roof technology not being recommended for general
   applications in cold climates. A sensitivity analysis shows that the
   conclusions in this study provide robust insights across Canada and cold
   climates in general.}},

Abstract = {{Safer pharmaceutical and medical device excipients are being sought as
   alternatives to polyvinyl polymers that are commonly plasticised by
   carcinogenic phthalates. This paper demonstrates a biodegradable and
   non-toxic bioactive polymer matrix that can be easily modified through
   plasticiser addition in the presence of low dosage active pharmaceutical
   ingredient (API). Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) was selected as an
   alternative polymer to polyvinyls as it is biodegradable and has high
   amorphous content, which improves drug solubility. Bulk PCL and various
   blends with 5 and 25\% polyethylene glycol (PEG, a plasticiser and pore
   former) and 5\% nalidixic acid (NA, the API) were processed using
   extrusion and pressed into plaques. The resultant material properties
   were investigated in terms of microscopic, morphological and
   topographical modification. No evidence of miscibility was found by IR.
   The rheology and contact angle of the matrix could be easily manipulated
   through the addition of PEG. Increased loading of PEG to 25\% (w/w)
   caused a 10-fold increase in the melt flow index, a similar increase in
   the elongational viscosity, and a contact angle decrease of 10,
   indicating that the resultant fluid was becoming more Newtonian. It was
   concluded that the structural and rheological properties of the blend,
   while easily modified through the addition of PEG, were unaffected by
   the monodispersion of the API, nalidixic acid. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This work presents an efficient and high-sensitivity radio frequency
   (RF) energy harvesting supply. The harvester consists of a single-series
   circuit with one double diode on a low-cost, lossy FR-4 substrate,
   despite the fact that losses decrease RF harvesting efficiency. The
   design targeted minimum reflection coefficient and maximum rectification
   efficiency, taking into account not only the impedance matching network,
   but also the rectifier microstrip trace dimensions and the load. The
   simulated and measured rectenna efficiency was 28.4\% for - 20-dBm power
   input. In order to increase sensitivity, i.e., ability to harvest energy
   and operate at low power density, rectennas were connected in series
   configuration (voltage summing), forming rectenna arrays. The proposed
   RF harvesting system ability was tested at various input power levels,
   various sizes of rectenna arrays, with or without a commercial boost
   converter, allowing operation at RF power density as low as 0.0139 W/cm.
   It is emphasized that the boost converter, whenever used, was
   self-started, without any additional external energy. The system was
   tested in supplying a scatter radio sensor, showing experimentally the
   effect of input power density on the operational cold start duration and
   duty cycle of the sensor.}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Gas fired generation currently plays an integral support role ensuring
   security of supply in power systems with high wind power penetrations
   due to its technical and economic attributes. However, the increase in
   variable wind power has affected the gas generation output profile and
   is pushing the boundaries of the design and operating envelope of gas
   infrastructure. This paper investigates the mutual dependence and
   interaction between electricity generation and gas systems through the
   first comprehensive joined-up, multi-vector energy system analysis for
   Ireland. Key findings reveal the high vulnerability of the Irish power
   system to outages on the Irish gas system. It has been shown that the
   economic operation of the power system can be severely impacted by gas
   infrastructure outages, resulting in an average system marginal price of
   up to (sic)167/MW h from (sic)67/MW h in the base case. It has also been
   shown that gas infrastructure outages pose problems for the location of
   power system reserve provision, with a 150\% increase in provision
   across a power system transmission bottleneck. Wind forecast error was
   shown to be a significant cause for concern, resulting in large swings
   in gas demand requiring key gas infrastructure to operate at close to
   100\% capacity. These findings are thought to increase in prominence as
   the installation of wind capacity increases towards 2020, placing
   further stress on both power and gas systems to maintain security of
   supply. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Study was undertaken to determine the effects of location and solar
   thermal collector design on the performance of a liquid desiccant air
   conditioner (LDAC). A 95 m(2) evacuated-tube collector (ETC) solar
   thermal array, coupled to a LDAC located in Kingston, Canada, was
   monitored to obtain data to verify a simulation of the system. A TRNSYS
   model was modified to account for variations in LDAC effectiveness with
   different conditions. The model was used to investigate options for the
   collector array design including the use of flat-plate collectors (FPC),
   ETCs and hybrid arrays consisting of both FPC and ETCs. Simulations were
   conducted for three cities including: Toronto, Canada; Tunis, Tunisia;
   and Calcutta, India. To achieve comparable solar fractions to ETC arrays
   it was found that FPC arrays required approximately 15 m2 more area than
   the ETC arrays in Toronto and Tunis, and 30 m2 more in Calcutta. Tunis
   showed the best results for a hybrid system. A ratio of 30\% FPCs and
   70\% ETCs achieved the same solar fraction (i.e., 0.56) as the array
   consisting of only ETCs. The reduction in the use of ETCs could lead to
   significant cost savings and flexibility in the design of LDAC systems.

Journal = {{EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{337-367}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, many software organizations rely on automatic problem
   reporting tools to collect crash reports directly from users'
   environments. These crash reports are later grouped together into crash
   types. Usually, developers prioritize crash types based on the number of
   crash reports and file bug reports for the top crash types. Because a
   bug can trigger a crash in different usage scenarios, different crash
   types are sometimes related to the same bug. Two bugs are correlated
   when the occurrence of one bug causes the other bug to occur. We refer
   to a group of crash types related to identical or correlated bug
   reports, as a crash correlation group. In this paper, we propose five
   rules to identify correlated crash types automatically. We propose an
   algorithm to locate and rank buggy files using crash correlation groups.
   We also propose a method to identify duplicate and related bug reports.
   Through an empirical study on Firefox and Eclipse, we show that the
   first three rules can identify crash correlation groups using stack
   trace information, with a precision of 91 \% and a recall of 87 \% for
   Firefox and a precision of 76 \% and a recall of 61 \% for Eclipse. On
   the top three buggy file candidates, the proposed bug localization
   algorithm achieves a recall of 62 \% and a precision of 42 \% for
   Firefox, and a recall of 52 \% and a precision of 50 \% for Eclipse. On
   the top 10 buggy file candidates, the recall increases to 92 \% for
   Firefox and 90 \% for Eclipse. The proposed duplicate bug report
   identification method achieves a recall of 50 \% and a precision of 55
   \% on Firefox, and a recall of 47 \% and a precision of 35 \% on
   Eclipse. Developers can combine the proposed crash correlation rules
   with the new bug localization algorithm to identify and fix correlated
   crash types all together. Triagers can use the duplicate bug report
   identification method to reduce their workload by filtering duplicate
   bug reports automatically.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main issues in the design, modeling, and control of
   innovative automotive engines is to reduce energy consumption and
   emission of pollutants and, at the same time, to guarantee a high level
   of performance indices. In particular, enhanced model-based control of
   the injection process has been a hot research topic in recent years to
   increase the combustion efficiency in common rail (CR) diesel engines
   and to meet strict legislations. This paper focuses on the development
   of a more accurate model for the electro-injector in CR diesel engines.
   The model takes into account the mechanical deformation of relevant
   parts of the electro-injector and the nonlinear fuel flow. Model
   parameters are then optimized by an evolutionary strategy. Simulation
   results confirm that the optimized model can be helpful for predicting
   the real trend of the injected fuel flow rate, evidenced by experimental
   data, thus can be helpful for injection control of CR diesel engines.}},

Abstract = {{Despite fractured hard rock aquifers underlying over 65\% of Ireland,
   knowledge of key processes controlling groundwater recharge in these

   19 groundwater-level hydrographs from two Irish hillslope sites

   groundwater-level response to rainfall, as well as its seasonal
   variations. The results reveal that the direct groundwater recharge to
   the shallow and deep bedrocks on hillslope is very limited. Water-level
   variations within these geological units are likely dominated by slow
   flow rock matrix storage. The rapid responses to rainfall (<= 2 h) with
   little seasonal variations were observed to the monitoring wells
   installed at the subsoil and soil/bedrock interface, as well as those in
   the shallow or deep bedrocks at the base of the hillslope. This suggests
   that the direct recharge takes place within these units. An automated
   time-series procedure using the water-table fluctuation method was
   developed to estimate groundwater recharge from the water-level and
   rainfall data. Results show the annual recharge rates of 42-197 mm/yr in
   the subsoil and soil/bedrock interface, which represent 4-19\% of the
   annual rainfall. Statistical analysis of the relationship between the
   rainfall intensity and water-table rise reveal that the low rainfall
   intensity group (<= 1 mm/h) has greater impact on the groundwater
   recharge rate than other groups (>1 mm/h). This study shows that the
   combination of the time-series analysis and the water-table fluctuation
   method could be an useful approach to investigate groundwater recharge
   in fractured hard rock aquifers in Ireland. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Two approaches are developed to rank and select model parameters for
   estimation in complex models when data are limited, the Fisher
   information matrix (FIM) is noninvertible, and accurate predictions are

   using synthetic data sets in a linear regression example to examine the
   influence of several factors including: the quality of initial parameter
   guesses, uncertainty ranges for initial parameter values, noise
   variances, and the operating region of interest. It is shown that using
   a reduced FIM with full rank leads to more reliable model predictions
   for a variety of cases than the alternative approach using the
   pseudoinverse of the FIM. The proposed reduced-FIM methodology also
   provides better predictions than related techniques that do not consider
   the operating region where reliable predictions are required. The
   methodology is illustrated using a nonlinear differential equation model

Abstract = {{La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-delta (LSGM), a promising electrolyte material
   for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells, can be sintered to
   a fully dense state by a flash-sintering technique. In this work, LSGM
   is sintered by the current-limiting flash-sintering process at 690
   degrees C under an electric field of 100 V cm (1), in comparison with up
   to 1400 degrees C or even higher temperature in conventional furnace
   sintering. The resultant LSGM samples are investigated by scanning
   electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy. The SEM images exhibit well-densified microstructures
   while XRD results show that the perovskite structure after
   flash-sintering does not changed. EIS results show that the conductivity
   of LSGM sintered by the current-limiting flash-sintering process
   increases with sintering current density value. The conductivity of
   samples sintered at 120 mA mm(-2) reaches 0.049 s cm(-1) at 800 degrees
   C, which is approximate to the value of conventional sintered LSGM
   samples at 1400 degrees C. Additionally, the flash-sintering process is
   interpreted by Joule heating theory. Therefore, the current-limiting
   flash-sintering technique is proved to be an energy-efficient and
   eligible approach for the densification of LSGM and other materials
   requiring high sintering temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   to exploit the obtained representation for stability analysis and state
   feedback controller design. These problems have been studied in recent
   years for particular classes of potential-driven systems. To recover the
   advantages of those representations for the stabilization of general
   nonlinear systems, the present note proposes a geometric decomposition
   technique, based on the Hodge decomposition theorem, to re-express a
   given vector field into a potential-driven form. Using the proposed
   decomposition technique, stability conditions are developed based on the
   convexity of a computed potential. Finally, stabilization is studied in
   the context of the proposed decomposition by reshaping the Hessian
   matrix of the obtained potential using damping feedback.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{522-531}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Four-leg dc-ac power converters are widely used for the power grids to
   manage grid voltage unbalance caused by the interconnection of
   single-phase or three-phase unbalanced loads. These converters can
   further be connected in parallel to increase the overall power rating.
   The control of these converters poses a particular challenge if they are
   placed far apart with no links between them (e.g., in islanded
   microgrids). This challenge is studied in this paper with each four-leg
   converter designed to have improved common current sharing and selective
   voltage-quality enhancement. The common current sharing, including zero
   sequence component, is necessary since loads are spread over the
   microgrid and they are hence the common responsibility of all
   converters. The voltage-quality enhancement consideration should however
   be more selective since different loads have different sensitivity
   levels towards voltage disturbances. Converters connected to the more
   sensitive load buses should therefore be selectively triggered for
   compensation when voltage unbalances at their protected buses exceed the
   predefined thresholds. The proposed scheme is therefore different from
   conventional centralized schemes protecting only a common bus.
   Simulation and experimental results obtained have verified the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme when applied to a four-wire
   islanded microgrid.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an existing beam-on-springs modeling methodology is
   examined for suitability in estimating vertical displacements and joint
   movement in jointed pipe culvert systems. Methods of determining the
   modulus of subgrade reaction, ks, are used in beam-on-springs modeling
   and compared with results from laboratory tests on three buried culvert
   pipes. Pipes were buried in soil conforming to AASHTO specifications for
   buried structures and then loaded at the ground surface. Two of the
   methods provided reasonable estimates of ks for use with both rigid and
   flexible test pipes (with an average error of 25\%). The first method
   relies on empirical parameters, whereas the second method relies on
   actual soil properties to estimate ks. This makes the second model more
   appealing. However, the second model is somewhat less accurate than the
   first (10\% average error compared with 25\% average error). Movement at
   the culvert joint was estimated by beam-on-springs modeling with a
   moderate degree of accuracy (within 52\% error when calculating the
   maximum movements) because of the complexities of the jointed culvert
   system being modeled. Accordingly, results from a beam-on-springs model
   should be used conservatively.}},

Title = {{Modelling the nonlinear behaviour and fracture process of AS4/PEKK
   thermoplastic composite under shear loading}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{60-77}},

Abstract = {{The accurate determination of non-linear shear behaviour and fracture
   toughness of continuous carbon-fibre/polymer composites remains a
   considerable challenge. These measurements are often necessary to
   generate material parameters for advanced computational damage models.
   In particular, there is a dearth of detailed shear fracture toughness
   characterisation for thermoplastic composites which are increasingly
   generating renewed interest within the aerospace and automotive sectors.
   In this work, carbon fibre (AS4)/thermoplastic Polyetherketoneketone
   (PEKK) composite V-notched cross-ply specimens were manufactured to
   investigate their non-linear response under pure shear loading. Both
   monotonic and cyclic loading were applied to study the shear modulus
   degradation and progressive failure. For the first time in the reported
   literature, we use the essential work of fracture approach to measure
   the shear fracture toughness of continuous fibre reinforced composite
   laminates. Excellent geometric similarity in the load-displacement
   curves was observed for ligament-scaled specimens. The laminate fracture
   toughness was determined by linear regression, of the specific work of
   fracture values, to zero ligament thickness, and verified with
   computational models. The matrix intralaminar fracture toughness (ply
   level fracture toughness), associated with shear loading was determined
   by the area method. This paper also details the numerical implementation
   of a new three-dimensional phenomenological model for carbon fibre
   thermoplastic composites using the measured values, which is able to
   accurately represent the full non-linear mechanical response and
   fracture process. The constitutive model includes a new non-linear shear
   profile, shear modulus degradation and load reversal. It is combined
   with a smeared crack model for representing ply-level damage initiation
   and propagation. The model is shown to accurately predict the
   constitutive response in terms of permanent plastic strain, degraded
   modulus as well as load reversal. Predictions are also shown to compare
   favourably with the evolution of damage leading to final fracture. (C)

   steps were taken: (1) prepare composites made from furan and epoxy
   resins, (2) characterize the mechanical and physico-chemical properties
   of the composites, (3) study the moisture absorption, and finally, (4)
   evaluate the degradation of both composites when subjected to alkaline
   solutions which was simulated to leached concrete pore solution. The
   experimental results show that the use of furan resin as polymer matrix
   in glass fiber reinforced polymer leads to an increase in the moisture
   absorption and a significant decrease in the degradation in alkaline
   solution.}},

Abstract = {{The basic formulation of an acrylic bone cement has been modified by the
   addition of a block copolymer, Nanostrength (R) (NS), in order to
   augment the mechanical properties and particularly the fracture
   toughness of the bone cement. Two grades of NS at different levels of
   loading, between 1 and 10 wt.\%, have been used. Mechanical tests were
   conducted to study the behaviour of the modified cements; specific tests
   measured the bend, compression and fracture toughness properties. The
   failure mode of the fracture test specimens was analysed using scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). The effect of NS addition on the thermal
   properties was also determined, and the polymerisation reaction using
   differential scanning calorimetry. It was observed that the addition of
   NS produced an improvement in the fracture toughness and ductility of
   the cement, which could have a positive contribution by reducing the
   premature fracture of the cement mantle. The residual monomer content
   was reduced when the NS was added. However this also produced an
   increase in the maximum temperature and the heat delivered during the
   polymerisation of the cement.}},

Title = {{Recognition of strong seasonality and climatic cyclicity in an ancient,

Abstract = {{Inclined heterolithic stratification in the Lower Cretaceous McMurray
   Formation, exposed along the Steepbank River in north-eastern Alberta,
   Canada, accumulated on point bars of a 30 to 40 m deep continental-scale
   river in the fluvial-marine transition. This inclined heterolithic
   stratification consists of two alternating lithologies, sand and
   fine-grained beds. Sand beds were deposited rapidly by unidirectional
   currents and contain little or no bioturbation. Fine-grained beds
   contain rare tidal structures, and are intensely bioturbated by
   low-diversity ichnofossil assemblages. The alternations between the sand
   and fine-grained beds are probably caused by strong variations in
   fluvial discharge; that are believed to be seasonal (probably annual) in
   duration. The sand beds accumulated during river floods, under fluvially
   dominated conditions when the water was fresh, whereas the fine-grained
   beds accumulated during the late stages of the river flood and
   deposition continued under tidally influenced brackish-water conditions
   during times of low-river flow (i.e. the interflood periods). These
   changes reflect the annual migration in the positions of the tidal and
   salinity limits within the fluvial-marine transition that result from
   changes in river discharge. Sand and fine-grained beds are cyclically
   organized in the studied outcrops forming metre-scale cycles. A single
   metre-scale cycle is defined by a sharp base, an upward decrease in
   sand-bed thickness and upward increases in the preservation of
   fine-grained beds and the intensity of bioturbation. Metre-scale cycles
   are interpreted to be the product of a longer term (decadal) cyclicity
   in fluvial discharge, probably caused by fluctuations in ocean or solar
   dynamics. The volumetric dominance of river-flood deposits within the
   succession suggests that accumulation occurred in a relatively landward
   position within the fluvial-marine transition. This study shows that
   careful observation can reveal much about the interplay of processes
   within the fluvial-marine transition, which in turn provides a powerful
   tool for determining the palaeo-environmental location of a deposit
   within the fluvial-marine transition.}},

Journal = {{GEOTECHNIQUE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{275-286}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Relative ground movement represents a severe seismic hazard to pipelines
   crossing faults, and the maximum expected pipeline strains are the
   primary design concern. Past research has documented how stiff steel
   pipelines respond to permanent ground deformation and has produced
   calibrated empirical models of pipeline response to strike-slip and
   normal faulting. However, what little data exist on flexible pipelines
   illustrate how `stiff pipeline' soil reaction models significantly
   overestimate peak strains for flexible pipelines. Results for four
   centrifuge tests conducted on model pipelines are presented to quantify
   the flexural response of pipelines to normal faulting over a wide range
   of pipeline stiffness. Continuous functions of pipeline and soil
   displacement calculated using digital image correlation are used to
   assess pipeline curvature, soil reaction and relative displacement.
   Comparisons of peak measured curvatures to current design analysis
   methods confirm that empirical stiff pipeline soil reactions
   progressively overestimate maximum curvature as the pipeline's stiffness
   decreases. Two strategies to modify current empirical soil reactions to
   account for flexible pipelines were then investigated, with the strategy
   of reducing the stiffness of the empirical soil reaction (while
   maintaining the advantage of a simplified, abrupt, step-like fault)
   providing better outcomes than modification to account for more
   realistic ground displacement profiles.}},

   resistance of concrete}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{56-66}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Chloride-induced corrosion of steel in reinforced concrete structures is
   one of the main problems affecting their durability, but most previous
   research projects and case studies have focused on concretes without
   cracks or not subjected to any structural load. Although it has been
   recognised that structural cracks do influence the chloride transport
   and chloride induced corrosion in reinforced concrete structures, there
   is little published work on the influence of micro-cracks due to service
   loads on these properties. Therefore the effect of micro-cracks caused
   by loading on chloride transport into concrete was studied. Four
   different stress levels (0\%, 25\%, 50\% and 75\% of the stress at
   ultimate load- f(u)) were applied to 100 mm diameter concrete discs and
   chloride migration was measured using a bespoke test setup based on the
   NT BUILD 492 test. The effects of replacing Portland cement CEMI by
   ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), pulverised fuel ash (PFA)
   and silica fume (SF) on chloride transport in concrete under sustained
   loading were studied. The results have indicated that chloride migration
   coefficients changed little when the stress level was below 50\% of the
   f(u).; however, it is desirable to keep concrete stress less than
   25\%f(u). if this is practical. The effect of removing the load on the
   change of chloride migration coefficient was also studied. A recovery of
   around 50\% of the increased chloride migration coefficient was found in
   the case of concretes subjected to 75\% of the f(u). when the load was
   removed. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Journal = {{FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{144}},
Pages = {{341-347}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Samples of locally sourced UK Diesel fuel spiked with the two organic
   compounds 2-(butan-2-yl)-1-(decyloxy)-4-(triphenylmethyl)benzene (TPMB)
   and 1,3-dibromotetrafluorobenzene (BFB) were subjected to laboratory
   scale distillations to assess the suitability of TPMB and BFB as
   effective markers of Diesel fuel. Industrial-scale distillations of
   these spiked Diesel samples were performed to establish whether TPMB and
   BFB could be successfully and cost-effectively separated from Diesel on
   a significantly larger scale. Diesel distillate does not contain any
   TPMB; newly formulated performance criteria of an ideal, distillation
   resistant fuel marker clearly reject TPMB as a marker suitable for the
   tagging of Diesel. In contrast, BFB is retained in all fractions of
   distilled Diesel and largely satisfies the performance criteria of a
   distillation resistant fuel marker. BFB consequently functions as a
   significantly better fuel marker than TPMB for the tagging of Diesel. It
   is demonstrated that distillation is also a highly effective means of
   removing current overt dye markers. Conservative estimates suggest that
   an appropriately equipped laundering facility for the distillative
   removal of fuel markers or vice versa fuel from marked Diesel offers the
   potential of generating a vastly lucrative, multi-million pound annual
   profit. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The relatively high elastic modulus coupled with the presence of toxic
   vanadium (V) in Ti6Al4V alloy has long been a concern in orthopaedic
   applications. To solve the problem, a variety of non-toxic and low
   modulus beta-titanium (beta-Ti) alloys have been developed. Among the
   beta-Ti alloy family, the quaternary Ti-Nb-Zr-Ta (TNZT) alloys have
   received the highest attention as a promising replacement for Ti6Al4V
   due to their lower elastic modulus and outstanding long term stability
   against corrosion in biological environments. However, the inferior wear
   resistance of TNZT is still a problem that must be resolved before
   commercialising in the orthopaedic market. In this work, a newly
   developed laser surface treatment technique was employed to improve the
   surface properties of Ti-35.3Nb-7.3Zr-5.7Ta alloy. The surface structure
   and composition of the laser-treated TNZT surface were examined by
   grazing incidence X-ray diffraction ( GI-XRD) and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS). The wear and corrosion resistance were evaluated by
   pin-on-plate sliding test and anodic polarisation test in Hanks'
   solution. The experimental results were compared with the untreated (or
   base) TNZT material. The research findings showed that the laser surface
   treatment technique reported in this work can effectively improve the
   wear and corrosion resistance of TNZT. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We investigate the intrinsic shapes of low-luminosity galaxies in the
   central 300 kpc of the Virgo Cluster using deep imaging obtained as part
   of the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). We build a sample of
   nearly 300 red-sequence cluster members in the yet-unexplored -14 < M-g
   < -8 mag range, and we measure their apparent axis ratios, q, through
   Sersic fits to their two-dimensional light distribution,. which is well
   described by a constant ellipticity parameter. The resulting
   distribution of apparent axis ratios is then fit by families of triaxial
   models with normally distributed intrinsic ellipticities, E = 1 - C/A,
   and triaxialities, T = (A(2) - B-2)/(A(2) - C-2). We develop a Bayesian
   framework to explore the posterior distribution of the model parameters,
   which allows us to work directly on discrete data, and to account for
   individual, surface-brightness-dependent axis ratio uncertainties. For
   this population we infer a mean intrinsic ellipticity (E) over bar =
   0.43(-0.02)(+0.02) and a mean triaxiality (T) over bar =
   0.16(-0.06)(+0.07) . This implies that faint Virgo galaxies are best
   described as a family of thick, nearly oblate spheroids with mean
   intrinsic axis ratios 1:0.94:0.57. The core of Virgo lacks highly
   elongated low-luminosity galaxies, with 95\% of the population having q
   > 0.45. We additionally attempt a study of the intrinsic shapes of Local
   Group (LG) satellites of similar luminosities. For the LG population we
   infer a slightly larger mean intrinsic ellipticity (E) over bar =
   0.51(-0.06)(+0.07) and the paucity of objects with round apparent shapes
   translates into more triaxial mean shapes, 1:0.76:0.49. Numerical
   studies that follow the tidal evolution of satellites within LG-sized
   halos are in good agreement with the inferred shape distributions, but
   the mismatch for faint galaxies in Virgo highlights the need for more
   adequate simulations of this population in the cluster environment. We
   finally compare the intrinsic shapes of NGVS low-mass galaxies with
   samples of more massive quiescent systems, and with field, star-forming
   galaxies of similar luminosities. We find that the intrinsic flattening
   in this low-luminosity regime is almost independent of the environment
   in which the galaxy resides, but there is a hint that objects may be
   slightly rounder in denser environments. The comparable flattening
   distributions of low-luminosity galaxies that have experienced very
   different degrees of environmental effects suggest. that internal
   processes are the main drivers of galaxy structure at low masses, with
   external mechanisms playing a secondary role.}},

Title = {{Swellable polymer films containing Au nanoparticles for point-of-care

Volume = {{912}},

Abstract = {{Large (10 x 10 cm) sheets of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)
   active polymer have been prepared by stabilising metal nanoparticle
   aggregates within dry hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) films. In these films
   the aggregates are protected by the polymer matrix during storage but in
   use they are released when aqueous analyte droplets cause the films to
   swell to their gel form. The fact that these ``Poly-SERS{''} films can
   be prepared in bulk but then cut to size and stored in air before use
   means that they provide a cost effective and convenient method for
   routine SERS analysis. Here we have tested both Ag and Au Poly-SERS
   films for use in point-of-care monitoring of therapeutic drugs, using
   phenytoin as the test compound. Phenytoin in water could readily be
   detected using Ag Poly-SERS films but dissolving the compound in
   phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to mimic body fluid samples caused loss
   of the drug signal due to competition for metal surface sites from Cl-
   ions in the buffer solution. However, with Au Poly-SERS films there was
   no detectable interference from Cl- and these materials allowed
   phenytoin to be detected at 1.8 mg L-1, even in PBS. The target range of
   detection of phenytoin in therapeutic drug monitoring is 10-20 mg L-1.
   With the Au Poly-SERS films, the absolute signal generated by a given
   concentration of phenytoin was lower for the films than for the parent
   colloid but the SERS signals were still high enough to be used for
   therapeutic monitoring, so the cost in sensitivity for moving from
   simple aqueous colloids to films is not so large that it outweighs the
   advantages which the films bring for practical applications, in
   particular their ease of use and long shelf life. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Designer biopolymers (DBPs) represent state of the art genetically
   engineered biomacromolecules designed to condense plasmid DNA, and
   overcome intra-and extra-cellular barriers to gene delivery. Three DBPs
   were synthesized, each with the tumor molecular targeting peptide-1
   (TMTP-1) motif to specifically target metastases. Each DBP was complexed
   with a pEGFP-N1 reporter plasmid to permit physiochemical and biological
   assay analysis. Results indicated that two of the biopolymers (RMHT and
   RM(3)GT) effectively condensed pEGFP-N1 into cationic nanoparticles <100
   nm and were capable of transfecting PC-3 metastatic prostate cancer
   cells. Conversely the anionic RMGT DBP nanoparticles could not transfect
   PC-3 cells. RMHT and RM(3)GT nanoparticles were stable in the presence
   of serum and protected the cargo from degradation. Additionally it was
   concluded that cell viability could recover post-transfection with these
   DBPs, which were less toxic than the commercially available transfection
   reagent Lipofectamine (R) 2000. With both DBPs, a higher transfection
   efficacy was observed in PC-3 cells than in the moderately metastatic,
   DU145, and normal, PNT2-C2, cell lines. Blocking of the TMTP-1 receptors
   inhibited gene transfer indicating internalization via this receptor. In
   conclusion RMHT and RM(3)GT are fully functional DBPs that address major
   obstacles to gene delivery and target metastatic cells expressing the
   TMTP-1 receptor. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG), on the
   mechanical and thermal properties of nalidixic acid/poly
   epsilon-caprolactone (NA)/PCL blends prepared by hot melt extrusion. The
   blends were characterized by tensile and flexural analysis, dynamic
   mechanical analysis, differential scanning calorimetry,
   thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction. Results show that
   loading PEG in the PCL had a detrimental effect on the tensile strength
   and toughness of the blends, reducing them by 20-40\%. The partial
   miscibility of the PCL-PEG system, causes an increase in T-g. While
   increases in the crystallinity is attributed to the plasticisation
   effect of PEG and the nucleation effect of NA. The average crystal size
   increased by 8\% upon PEG addition. Experimental data indicated that the
   addition of NA caused loss of the tensile strength and toughness of PCL.
   Thermal analysis of the PCL showed that on addition of the thermally
   unstable NA, thermal degradation occurred early and was autocatalytic.
   However, the NA did benefit from the heat shielding provided by the PCL
   matrix resulting in more thermally stable NA particles. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Controlled periodic illumination is a hypothesis postulated in the early
   1990s for enhancing the efficiency of semiconductor photocatalytic
   reactions. This technique has been proposed to improve photocatalytic
   efficiency by the nature of photon introduction alone. Before its
   application in semiconductor photocatalysis, controlled periodic
   illumination had been investigated in other fields including
   photosynthesis. This paper presents a detailed review of the state of
   the art research undertaken on the application of controlled periodic
   illumination in semiconductor photocatalysis. The review briefly
   introduces semiconductor photocatalysis, and then presents a detailed
   explanation of this technique, its importance to photocatalytic
   efficiency, an overview of previous results of its application in
   significant studies and present knowledge. Results from previous as well
   as some of the most recent studies indicate potential applications of
   controlled periodic illumination in areas other than just the
   improvement of the efficiency of the photocatalytic process. (C) 2015

Title = {{Linking Isotopes and Panmixia: High WithinColony Variation in Feather
   delta 2H, delta 13C, and delta 15N across the Range of the American
   White Pelican}},

Abstract = {{Complete panmixia across the entire range of a species is a relatively
   rare phenomenon; however, this pattern may be found in species that have
   limited philopatry and frequent dispersal. American white pelicans
   (Pelecanus erythrorhyncos) provide a unique opportunity to examine the
   role of long-distance dispersal in facilitating gene flow in a species
   recently reported as panmictic across its broad breeding range. This
   species is also undergoing a range expansion, with new colonies arising
   hundreds of kilometers outside previous range boundaries. In this study,
   we use a multiple stable isotope (delta H-2, delta C-13, delta N-15)
   approach to examine feather isotopic structuring at 19 pelican colonies
   across North America, with the goal of establishing an isotopic basemap
   that could be used for assigning individuals at newly established
   breeding sites to source colonies. Within-colony isotopic variation was
   extremely high, exceeding 100\% in delta H-2 within some colonies (with
   relatively high variation also observed for delta C-13 and delta N-15).
   The high degree of within-site variation greatly limited the utility of
   assignment-based approaches (42\% cross-validation success rate; range:
   0-90\% success). Furthermore, clustering algorithms identified four
   likely isotopic clusters; however, those clusters were generally
   unrelated to geographic location. Taken together, the high degree of
   within-site isotopic variation and lack of geographically-defined
   isotopic clusters preclude the establishment of an isotopic basemap for
   American white pelicans, but may indicate that a high incidence of
   long-distance dispersal is facilitating gene flow, leading to genetic
   panmixia.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the simultaneous dressing of both vacuum-to-exciton and
   exciton-to-biexciton transitions of a single semiconductor quantum dot
   in a high-Q micropillar cavity, using photoluminescence spectroscopy.
   Resonant two-photon excitation of the biexciton is achieved by
   spectrally tuning the quantum dot emission with respect to the cavity
   mode. The cavity couples to both transitions and amplifies the Rabi
   frequency of the likewise resonant continuous wave laser, driving the
   transitions. We observe strong-field splitting of the emission lines,
   which depend on the driving Rabi field amplitude and the cavity-laser
   detuning. A dressed state theory of a driven 4-level atom correctly
   predicts the distinct spectral transitions observed in the emission
   spectrum, and a detailed description of the emission spectra is further
   provided through a polaron master equation approach which accounts for
   cavity coupling and acoustic phonon interactions of the semiconductor
   medium.}},

Abstract = {{This study is centered on the thermophysical characterization of
   different families of alkylammonium nitrate ionic liquids and their
   binary mixtures, namely the determination at atmospheric pressure of
   densities, electric conductivities and viscosities in the 288.15 < T/K <
   353.15 range. First, measurements focusing on ethylammonium,
   propylammonium and butylammonium nitrate systems, and their binary
   mixtures, were determined. These were followed by studies involving
   binary mixtures composed of ethyl ammonium nitrate (with three hydrogen
   bond donor groups) and different homologous ionic liquids with differing
   numbers of hydrogen bond donor groups: diethylammonium nitrate (two
   hydrogen bond donors), triethylammonium nitrate (one hydrogen bond
   donor) and tetraethylammonium nitrate hydrogen bond donors). Finally,
   the behavior of mixtures with different numbers of equivalent carbon
   atoms in alkylammonium cations was analyzed. The results show a
   quasi-ideal behavior for all monoalkylammonium nitrate mixtures. In
   contrast, the other mixtures show deviations from ideality, namely when
   the difference in the number of carbon atoms present in the cations
   increases or the number of hydrogen bond donors present in the cation
   decreases. Overall, the results clearly show that, besides the length
   and distribution of alkyl chains present in a cation such as
   alkylammonium, there are other structural and interaction parameters
   that influence the thermophysical properties of both pure compounds and
   their mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{We present a rigorous methodology and new metrics for fair comparison of
   server and microserver platforms. Deploying our methodology and metrics,
   we compare a microserver with ARM cores against two servers with x86
   cores running the same real-time financial analytics workload. We define
   workload-specific but platform-independent performance metrics for
   platform comparison, targeting both datacenter operators and end users.
   Our methodology establishes that a server based on the Xeon Phi
   co-processor delivers the highest performance and energy efficiency.
   However, by scaling out energy-efficient microservers, we achieve
   competitive or better energy efficiency than a power-equivalent server
   with two Sandy Bridge sockets, despite the microserver's slower cores.
   Using a new iso-QoS metric, we find that the ARM microserver scales
   enough to meet market throughput demand, that is, a 100\% QoS in terms
   of timely option pricing, with as little as 55\% of the energy consumed
   by the Sandy Bridge server. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{An evidential fusion approach for gender profiling}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{333}},
Pages = {{10-20}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{CCTV (Closed-Circuit TeleVision) systems are broadly deployed in the
   present world. To ensure in-time reaction for intelligent surveillance,
   it is a fundamental task for real-world applications to determine the
   gender of people of interest. However, normal video algorithms for
   gender profiling (usually face profiling) have three drawbacks. First,
   the profiling result is always uncertain. Second, the profiling result
   is not stable. The degree of certainty usually varies over time,
   sometimes even to the extent that a male is classified as a female, and
   vice versa. Third, for a robust profiling result in cases that a
   person's face is not visible, other features, such as body shape, are
   required. These algorithms may provide different recognition results -
   at the very least, they will provide different degrees of certainties.
   To overcome these problems, in this paper, we introduce an
   Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidential approach that makes use of profiling
   results from multiple algorithms over a period of time, in particular,
   Denoeux's cautious rule is applied for fusing mass functions through
   time lines. Experiments show that this approach does provide better
   results than single profiling results and classic fusion results.
   Furthermore, it is found that if severe mis-classification has occurred
   at the beginning of the time line, the combination can yield undesirable
   results. To remedy this weakness, we further propose three extensions to
   the evidential approach proposed above incorporating notions of
   time-window, time-attenuation, and time-discounting, respectively. These
   extensions also applies Denoeux's rule along with time lines and take
   the DS approach as a special case. Experiments show that these three
   extensions do provide better results than their predecessor when
   mis-classifications occur. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used probabilistic models of
   sequential data. As with other probabilistic models, they require the
   specification of local conditional probability distributions, whose
   assessment can be too difficult and error-prone, especially when data
   are scarce or costly to acquire. The imprecise HMM (iHMM) generalizes
   HMMs by allowing the quantification to be done by sets of, instead of
   single, probability distributions. iHMMs have the ability to suspend
   judgment when there is not enough statistical evidence, and can serve as
   a sensitivity analysis tool for standard non-stationary HMMs. In this
   paper, we consider iHMMs under the strong independence interpretation,
   for which we develop efficient inference algorithms to address standard
   HMM usage such as the computation of likelihoods and most probable
   explanations, as well as performing filtering and predictive inference.
   Experiments with real data show that iHMMs produce more reliable
   inferences without compromising the computational efficiency. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The use of sustainable assessment methods in the UK is on the rise,
   anticipating the future regulatory trajectory towards zero carbon by
   2016. The indisputable influence of sustainable rating tools on UK
   building regulations conveys the importance of evaluating their
   effectiveness in achieving true sustainable design, without adversely
   effecting human health and well-being. This paper reviews indoor
   air-quality (IAQ) issues addressed by UK sustainable assessment tools,
   and the potential trade-offs between building energy conservation and
   IAQ. The barriers to effective adoption of IAQ strategies are
   investigated, including recommendations, suggestions, and future
   research needs. The review identified a fundamental lack of IAQ criteria
   in sustainable assessment tools aimed at the residential sector. The
   consideration of occupants' health and well-being should be paramount in
   any assessment scheme, and should not be overshadowed or obscured by the
   drive towards energy efficiency. A balance is essential.}},

Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{The authors study cooperative security in the physical layer of wireless
   systems based on the recently developed polar codes for multiple access
   channel (MAC). Specifically, the authors first consider the case of a
   m-user MAC with external eavesdropper. Using polar alignment, the
   authors formulate a discrete optimisation problem where security and
   reliability criteria can be handled separately over the bases of a set
   of deterministic binary matrices. A discrete algorithm with
   incrementally polynomial complexity is used to maximise the uniform sum
   secrecy rate of users. Moreover, the proposed coding scheme is shown to
   achieve strong security for any subset of users. The authors next
   examine the case of minimum number of cooperative helpers to fulfil a
   feasible secrecy rate requirement at the legitimate user. Here, a
   low-complexity suboptimal algorithm is presented with at most one helper
   more than the optimal solution. Using Tal-Sharov-Vardy implementation of
   MAC polar codes, secure polar coding is implemented for a 2-user
   Gaussian wiretap MAC channel. The upper and lower bound of block error
   probability are compared, respectively, at the legitimate receiver and
   the eavesdropper. The results demonstrate clearly that with sufficiently
   long block length, strong secrecy with respect to the eavesdropper is
   achieved, while block error probability approaches 0.5.}},

   Anaerobic Digestion of Wastewater}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{We report, for the first time, extensive biologically mediated phosphate
   removal from wastewater during high-rate anaerobic digestion (AD). A
   hybrid sludge bed/fixed-film (packed pumice stone) reactor was employed
   for low-temperature (12 degrees C) anaerobic treatment of synthetic
   sewage wastewater. Successful phosphate removal from the wastewater (up
   to 78\% of influent phosphate) was observed, mediated by biofilms in the
   reactor. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray
   analysis revealed the accumulation of elemental phosphorus (similar to
   2\%) within the sludge bed and fixed-film biofilms. 4',
   6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining indicated phosphorus
   accumulation was biological in nature and mediated through the formation
   of intracellular inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) granules within these
   biofilms. DAPI staining further indicated that polyP accumulation was
   rarely associated with free cells. Efficient and consistent chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) removal was recorded, throughout the 732-day trial,
   at applied organic loading rates between 0.4 and 1.5 kg COD m(-3) d(-1)
   and hydraulic retention times of 8-24 h, while phosphate removal
   efficiency ranged from 28 to 78\% on average per phase. Analysis of
   protein hydrolysis kinetics and the methanogenic activity profiles of
   the biomass revealed the development, at 12 degrees C, of active
   hydrolytic and methanogenic populations. Temporal microbial changes were
   monitored using Illumina MiSeq analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16S
   rRNA gene sequences. The dominant bacterial phyla present in the biomass
   at the conclusion of the trial were the Proteobacteria and Firmicutes
   and the dominant archaeal genus was Methanosaeta. Trichococcus and
   Flavobacterium populations, previously associated with low temperature
   protein degradation, developed in the reactor biomass. The presence of
   previously characterized polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs)
   such as Rhodocyclus, Chromatiales, Actinobacter, and Acinetobacter was
   recorded at low numbers. However, it is unknown as yet if these were
   responsible for the luxury polyP uptake observed in this system. The
   possibility of efficient phosphate removal and recovery from wastewater
   during AD would represent a major advance in the scope for widespread
   application of anaerobic wastewater treatment technologies.}},

   small size and consequent relatively poor preservation, they have not

   Plumeropriscum hofmanni new genus new species, and a flabellate, lobate

   n. gen., n. sp. has a three-dimensional petalodium structure with
   numerous primary branches attached at the base of the petalodium rather
   than at a central axis. Broccoliforma alta n. gen., n. sp. lacks visible
   branching, and instead has a lobate morphology with a petalodium that is
   at least superficially similar to the ivesheadiomorph Blackbrookia.
   Several other previously described taxa had also been included under the
   umbrella of `dusters.' Collectively, these taxa show that the low
   epibenthic tier that small fronds occupied was more diverse than
   previously realized, with multiple taxa converging on the stemmed,
   small-frond body plan.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of the construction industry worldwide poses a serious
   concern on the sustainability of the building material production chain,
   mainly due to the carbon emissions related to the production of Portland
   cement. On the other hand, valuable materials from waste streams,
   particularly from the metallurgical industry, are not used at their full
   potential. Alkali-activated concrete (AAC) has emerged in the last years
   as a promising alternative to traditional Portland cement-based concrete
   for some applications. However, despite showing remarkable strength and
   durability potential, its utilisation is not widespread, mainly due to
   the lack of broadly accepted standards for the selection of suitable mix
   recipes fulfilling design requirements, in particular workability,
   setting time and strength. In this paper, a contribution towards the
   design development of AAC synthesised from pulverised fuel ash (60 \%)
   and ground granulated blast furnace slag (ggbs) (40 \%) activated with a
   solution of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate is proposed. Results
   from a first batch of mixes indicated that water content influences the
   setting time and that paste content is a key parameter for controlling
   strength development and workability. The investigation indicated that,
   for the given raw materials and activator compositions, a minimum
   water-to-solid (w/s) ratio of 0.37 was needed for an initial setting
   time of about 1 h. Further work with paste content in the range of 30-33
   \% determined the relationship between workability and strength
   development and w/s ratio and paste content. Strengths in the range of
   50-60 MPa were achieved.}},

Abstract = {{A well-resolved DNS of a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer
   at moderately high Reynolds number is analyzed in order to visually
   assess, in three dimensions, the existence of instantaneous realizations
   of outer region hairpins and hairpin packets. For this purpose, fifty
   independent 2D streamwise-wall-normal slices of DNS data at R-e theta =
   4300 are employed to mimic lower-resolution PIV velocity fields using
   the mimicking procedure of Rahgozar et al. (2013). The two-dimensional
   structure identification scheme of Adrian et al. (2000) is then applied
   on this resolution-degraded DNS data in order to discover the signatures
   of hairpins and hairpin packets. Subsequently, the 2D motions that are
   identified as signatures of hairpins and hairpin packets are isolated
   and visualized in three dimensions using the fully resolved DNS data. In
   agreement with Adrian et al. (2000), the hairpin and hairpin packet
   signatures are frequently observed in the mimicked planes. However, the
   3D character of the 2D signatures is found to be significantly different
   from the inferred hairpins and hairpin packets. The 2D packet
   signatures, when viewed in 3D, generally correspond to a series of
   irregular and complex vortex tubes which are not necessarily different
   from other nearby vortex tubes in terms of their shape, size and
   intensity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The UK's transportation network is supported by critical geotechnical
   assets (cuttings/embankments/dams) that require sustainable,
   cost-effective management, while maintaining an appropriate service
   level to meet social, economic, and environmental needs. Recent effects
   of extreme weather on these geotechnical assets have highlighted their
   vulnerability to climate variations. We have assessed the potential of
   surface wave data to portray the climate-related variations in
   mechanical properties of a clay-filled railway embankment. Seismic data
   were acquired bimonthly from July 2013 to November 2014 along the crest
   of a heritage railway embankment in southwest England. For each
   acquisition, the collected data were first processed to obtain a set of
   Rayleigh-wave dispersion and attenuation curves, referenced to the same
   spatial locations. These data were then analyzed to identify a coherent
   trend in their spatial and temporal variability. The relevance of the
   observed temporal variations was also verified with respect to the
   experimental data uncertainties. Finally, the surface wave dispersion
   data sets were inverted to reconstruct a time-lapse model of S-wave
   velocity for the embankment structure, using a least-squares laterally
   constrained inversion scheme. A key point of the inversion process was
   constituted by the estimation of a suitable initial model and the
   selection of adequate levels of spatial regularization. The initial
   model and the strength of spatial smoothing were then kept constant
   throughout the processing of all available data sets to ensure
   homogeneity of the procedure and comparability among the obtained V-S
   sections. A continuous and coherent temporal pattern of surface wave
   data, and consequently of the reconstructed V-S models, was identified.
   This pattern is related to the seasonal distribution of precipitation
   and soil water content measured on site.}},

Abstract = {{Confluences are common features of natural and man-made channel systems
   where convergence of joining flows creates a complex flow and sediment
   transport pattern producing strong flow circulations and rapid changing
   in bed morphology. By the means of laboratory experiments on several
   mobile-bed channel confluences, this study (1) investigates and
   formulates the (not well-understood) flow and geometrical conditions
   leading to the incipient motion of sediments in channel confluences, and
   (2) characterizes the effect of flow and geometrical conditions on the
   main morphological features (e.g. scouring and deposition areas) in
   confluences. Of prime importance factors that are considered in this
   study are the flow Froude number, angle of confluence, discharge and
   width ratios and the bed martial properties. This experimental study
   provides an insight for better understanding mechanisms involved in
   sediment transport and bed morphology in channel confluences and also
   quantifies the influence of various flow and geometrical factors on
   sediment transport, which are great importance in river engineering
   designs and fluvial studies. (C) 2015 International Research and

Abstract = {{Globally, efforts are underway to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas
   emissions and to adapt to climate change impacts at the local level.
   However, there is a poor understanding of the relationship between city
   strategies on climate change mitigation and adaptation and the relevant
   policies at national and European level. This paper describes a
   comparative study and evaluation of cross-national policy. It reports
   the findings of studying the climate change strategies or plans from 200
   European cities from Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France,
   Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The
   study highlights the shared responsibility of global, European,
   national, regional and city policies. An interpretation and illustration
   of the influences from international and national networks and policy
   makers in stimulating the development of local strategies and actions is
   proposed. It was found that there is no archetypical way of planning for
   climate change, and multiple interests and motivations are inevitable.
   Our research warrants the need for a multi-scale approach to climate
   policy in the future, mainly ensuring sufficient capacity and resource
   to enable local authorities to plan and respond to their specific
   climate change agenda for maximising the management potentials for
   translating environmental challenges into opportunities. (C) 2015
