Abstract = {{The structure and properties of melt mixed high-density
   polyethylene/multi-walled carbon nanotube (HDPE/MWCNT) composites
   processed by compression molding and blown film extrusion were
   investigated to assess the influence of processing route on properties.
   The addition of MWCNTs leads to a more elastic response during
   deformations that result in a more uniform thickness distribution in the
   blown films. Blown film composites exhibit better mechanical properties
   due to the enhanced orientation and disentanglement of MWCNTs. At a blow
   up ratio (BUR) of 3 the breaking strength and elongation in the machine
   direction of the film with 4 wt \% MWCNTs are 239\% and 1054\% higher
   than those of compression molded (CM) samples. Resistivity of the
   composite films increases significantly with increasing BURs due to the
   destruction of conductive pathways. These pathways can be recovered
   partially using an appropriate annealing process. At 8 wt \% MWCNTs,
   there is a sufficient density of nanotubes to maintain a robust network
   even at high BURs. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Nonperturbative model of harmonic generation in undoped graphene in the
   terahertz regime}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{We present a formalism to calculate the nonlinear terahertz response of
   monolayer graphene using a two-band tight-binding model of graphene. We
   develop the dynamic equations for the electron density matrix in the
   length gauge to calculate the interband and intraband carrier dynamics
   at terahertz frequencies. Using the calculated nonlinear interband and
   intraband current densities, we obtain the nonlinear transmitted and
   reflected terahertz fields. We find that when the conditions are such
   that the interband and intraband current densities are comparable,
   strong generation of odd harmonics is observed. We examine the response
   of undoped graphene as a function of a wide variety of system
   parameters, including operating temperature, Fermi velocity, pulse
   duration, and terahertz central frequency. We find that the response is
   generally most sensitive to the operating temperature and the terahertz
   central frequency. In particular, changing the ambient temperature from
   10 to 100 K reduces the third harmonic field by a factor of 20, while
   increasing the terahertz central frequency from 0.5 to 5 THz results in
   an increase in the ratio of the generated third harmonic field to the
   fundamental of the reflected field from 19\% to 49\%. The very strong
   dependence on the temperature and central frequency is found to be due
   to the strong dependence of the nonlinear generation on the strength of
   the interplay between the intraband and interband dynamics. Our work
   demonstrates that, under the right conditions of low temperature and
   moderate THz field central frequency, third harmonic generation should
   be experimentally observable in undoped monolayer graphene at moderate
   THz field amplitudes of only 1 kV cm(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Recent trends in legislation across the world are aimed toward the
   reduction of the levels of sulfur in fuel oils to less than 10 ppm
   (ultra low sulfur diesel, ULSD) due to its toxic and environmental
   effects. Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is the current method used for
   desulfurization and faces technical challenges, due to the extreme
   conditions and energy consumption necessary to reach low sulfur levels.
   Recently, ionic liquid (IL) technology has been proposed as a possible
   solution toward achieving ULSD. ILs represent a new class of ``green{''}
   solvents that are gaining popularity due to their favorable properties
   and have recently been shown to be effective extractants for
   desulfurization on a laboratory scale. In this work, the feasibility of
   industrial scale IL-extractive processing of ULSD has been examined via
   the simulation and optimization of a conceptual process in ASPEN Plus.
   The widely used {[}C(n)mim] {[}NTF2] series of ionic liquids have been
   employed, due to their favorable properties and the availability of
   experimental data in literature. User-defined ionic liquid components
   have been created within ASPEN Plus, incorporating several thermodynamic
   and physical property parameters derived from literature, to allow the
   process to be simulated via the UNIFAC thermodynamic method. On the
   basis of the technical analysis, it is proposed that the most feasible
   process configuration consists of HDS as a preliminary treatment,
   followed by IL extraction as intermediate treatment to reduce the sulfur
   content to SO ppm, with adsorption as the final treatment to achieve
   ULSD levels.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Electron-phonon coupling in semiconductor quantum dots plays a
   significant role in determining the optical properties of excited
   excitons, especially the spectral nature of emitted photons. This paper
   presents a comprehensive theory and analysis of emission spectra from
   artificial atoms or quantum dots coupled to structured photon reservoirs
   and acoustic phonons, when excited with incoherent pump fields. As
   specific examples of structured reservoirs, we chose a Lorentzian cavity
   and a slow-light coupled-cavity waveguide, which have both been explored
   experimentally. For the case of optical cavities, we directly compare
   and contrast the spectra from three well-known and distinct theoretical
   approaches to treat electron-phonon coupling, including a Markovian
   polaron master equation, a non-Markovian phonon correlation expansion
   technique, and a semiclassical linear susceptibility approach, and we
   point out the limitations of these models. For the cavity-QED polaron
   master equation, which treats the cavity-mode operator at the level of a
   system operator, we give closed form analytical solutions to the
   phonon-assisted scattering rates in the weak excitation approximation,
   fully accounting for temperature, cavity-exciton detuning, and
   cavity-dot coupling. We also show explicitly why the semiclassical
   linear susceptibility approach fails to correctly account for
   phonon-mediated cavity feeding. For weakly coupled cavities, we
   calculate the optical spectra using a more general photon reservoir
   polaron master-equation approach, and explain its differences from the
   above approaches in the low-Q limit of a Lorentzian cavity. We
   subsequently use this general reservoir approach to calculate the
   emission spectra from quantum dots coupled to slow-light photonic
   crystal waveguides, which demonstrate a number of striking photon-phonon
   coupling effects.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Bioretention systems are designed to treat stormwater and provide
   attenuated drainage between storms. Bioretention has shown great
   potential at reducing the volume and improving the quality of
   stormwater. This study introduces the bioretention hydrologic model
   (BHM), a one-dimensional model that simulates the hydrologic response of
   a bioretention system over the duration of a storm event. BHM is based
   on the RECARGA model, but has been adapted for improved accuracy and
   integration of pollutant transport models. BHM contains four
   completely-mixed layers and accounts for evapotranspiration, overflow,
   exfiltration to native soils and underdrain discharge. Model results
   were evaluated against field data collected over 10 storm events.
   Simulated flows were particularly sensitive to antecedent water content
   and drainage parameters of bioretention soils, which were calibrated
   through an optimisation algorithm. Temporal disparity was observed
   between simulated and measured flows, which was attributed to
   preferential flow paths formed within the soil matrix of the field
   system. Modelling results suggest that soil water storage is the most
   important short-term hydrologic process in bioretention, with
   exfiltration having the potential to be significant in native soils with
   sufficient permeability.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{396-416}},

Abstract = {{Traditional internal combustion engine vehicles are a major contributor
   to global greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants, such as
   particulate matter and nitrogen oxides. If the tail pipe point emissions
   could be managed centrally without reducing the commercial and personal
   user functionalities, then one of the most attractive solutions for
   achieving a significant reduction of emissions in the transport sector
   would be the mass deployment of electric vehicles. Though electric
   vehicle sales are still hindered by battery performance, cost and a few
   other technological bottlenecks, focused commercialisation and support
   from government policies are encouraging large scale electric vehicle
   adoptions. The mass proliferation of plug-in electric vehicles is likely
   to bring a significant additional electric load onto the grid creating a
   highly complex operational problem for power system operators. Electric
   vehicle batteries also have the ability to act as energy storage points
   on the distribution system. This double charge and storage impact of
   many uncontrollable small kW loads, as consumers will want maximum
   flexibility, on a distribution system which was originally not designed
   for such operations has the potential to be detrimental to grid
   balancing. Intelligent scheduling methods if established correctly could
   smoothly integrate electric vehicles onto the grid. Intelligent
   scheduling methods will help to avoid cycling of large combustion
   plants, using expensive fossil fuel peaking plant, match renewable
   generation to electric vehicle charging and not overload the
   distribution system causing a reduction in power quality. In this paper,
   a state-of-the-art review of scheduling methods to integrate plug-in
   electric vehicles are reviewed, examined and categorised based on their
   computational techniques. Thus, in addition to various existing
   approaches covering analytical scheduling, conventional optimisation
   methods (e.g. linear, non-linear mixed integer programming and dynamic
   programming), and game theory, meta-heuristic algorithms including
   genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimisation, are all
   comprehensively surveyed, offering a systematic reference for grid
   scheduling considering intelligent electric vehicle integration. (C)

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{A single-story precast concrete insulated sandwich wall panel design was
   tested in flexure. Testing parameters included shear-connector and
   flexural-reinforcement material type, namely steel and
   basalt-fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP). BFRP connectors have the
   advantage of lower thermal bridging than conventional metallic
   connectors. Some walls were tested without facade wythes to quantify the
   additional capacity contributed by the facade through partial composite
   action. Steelreinforced walls showed a strength-based composite action
   exceeding 90\% with steel connectors and 75\% with BFRP connectors.
   Alternatively, BFRP-reinforced walls with BFRP connectors showed only
   51\% composite action. When evaluating composite action by deflection,
   rather than load, the walls had substantially lower values, ranging from
   3\% to 6.9\%. BFRP-reinforced panels had lower strength than the
   steel-reinforced panels because they were prone to shear-compression
   failure but had higher deflections at ultimate. Shear deformation
   between wythes increased deformability, with the highest value observed
   in a panel with BFRP connectors and steel flexural reinforcement.
   Digital image correlation was used to determine wythes' relative slip
   and rotations at the panel ends. The wall design performed adequately as
   a non-load-bearing wall based on building-code requirements for maximum
   wind pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotube (CNT) /carbon fiber (CF) incorporated carbon composite
   monolith adsorbents have been recently reported exhibiting superior CO2
   adsorption properties for post-combustion capture (PCC) of CO2. Here we
   conducted a detailed study on optimization of preparation of CNT/CF
   composites for high CO2 adsorption capacities. A well-developed narrow
   microporous (< 1 nm) structure is the key to achieving the high CO2
   uptake of composite adsorbents at 298K and under ambient and low CO2
   pressures. Using water as the solvent for composite mixing is more
   favorable for enhanced narrow microporosity and CO2 adsorption capacity.
   The addition of CF lowers the CO2 uptake of CNT composites and the CNT
   alone incorporation with a CNT/resin ratio of 1 wt\% was found
   preferable. The burn-off as an indicator of degree of CO2 activation was
   optimized to be 20-30 wt\% for the highest CO2 uptake at ambient
   pressure, whereas the lower burn-off at 10-20 wt\% resulted in the
   largest amount of CO2 adsorbed at 114mmHg (corresponding to 15\% of CO2)
   relevant to the flue gas condition for PCC. The CO2 adsorption capacity
   is significantly influenced by the narrow micropore size distribution
   and closely related to the pore volume of effective narrow micropores
   responsible for different adsorption pressures. The results obtained
   from this study are valuable to the development of other microporous
   carbons for CO2 capture. (C) 2015 Curtin University of Technology and

Abstract = {{Two-phase partitioning bioreactor technology involves the use of a
   secondary immiscible phase to lower the concentration of cytotoxic
   solutes in the fermentation broth to subinhibitory levels. Although
   polymeric absorbents have attracted recent interest due to their low
   cost and biocompatibility, material selection requires the consideration
   of properties beyond those of small molecule absorbents (i.e.,
   immiscible organic solvents). These include a polymer's (1)
   thermodynamic affinity for the target compound, (2) degree of
   crystallinity (w(c)), and (3) glass transition temperature (T-g). We
   have examined the capability of three thermodynamic models to predict
   the partition coefficient (PC) for n-butyric acid, a fermentation
   product, in 15 polymers. Whereas PC predictions for amorphous materials
   had an average absolute deviation (AAD) of >= 16\%, predictions for
   semicrystalline polymers were less accurate (AAD >= 30\%). Prediction
   errors were associated with uncertainties in determining the degree of
   crystallinity within a polymer and the effect of absorbed water on
   n-butyric acid partitioning. Further complications were found to arise
   for semicrystalline polymers, wherein strongly interacting solutes
   increased the polymer's absorptive capacity by actually dissolving the
   crystalline fraction. Finally, we determined that diffusion limitations
   may occur for polymers operating near their T-g, and that the T-g can be
   reduced by plasticization by water and/or solute. This study has
   demonstrated the impact of basic material properties that affects the
   performance of polymers as sequestering phases in TPPBs, and reflects
   the additional complexity of polymers that must be taken into account in
   material selection. (C) 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers}},

Abstract = {{Wave energy converters (WECs) extract energy from ocean waves and have
   the potential to produce a significant amount of electricity from a
   renewable resource. However, large ``WEC farms{''} or ``WEC arrays{''}
   (composed of a large number of individual WECs) are expected to exhibit
   ``WEC array effects{''}. These effects represent the impact of the WECs
   on the wave climate at an installation site, as well as on the overall
   power absorption of the WEC array. Tests have been performed in the
   Shallow Water Wave Basin of DHI (Denmark) to study such ``WEC array
   effects{''}. Large arrays of up to 25 heaving point absorber type WECs
   have been tested for a range of geometric layout configurations and wave
   conditions. Each WEC consists of a buoy with a diameter of 0.315 m.
   Power takeoff was modeled by realizing friction based energy dissipation
   through damping of the WECs' motion. The produced database is presented:
   WEC response, wave induced forces on the WECs, and wave field
   modifications have been measured. A first understanding of WEC array
   effects is obtained. This unique experimental setup of up to 25
   individual WEC units in an array layout, placed in a large wave tank, is
   at present the largest set-up of its kind studying the important WEC
   array effects. The data obtained from these experimental tests will be
   very useful for validation and extension of numerical models. This model
   validation will enable optimization of the geometrical layout of WEC
   arrays for realistic wave farm applications and reduction of the cost of
   energy from wave energy systems. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Comparison of Two-Dimensional and Three-Dimensional Macroscopic Invasion
   Percolation Simulations with Laboratory Experiments of Gas Bubble Flow
   in Homogeneous Sands}},
Journal = {{VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{The upward flow of gas plays a role in many subsurface systems,
   including those related to oil and gas recovery, carbon dioxide storage,
   and ground-water remediation. Macroscopic invasion percolation
   (macro-IP) is a modeling approach suitable for the simulation of upward
   gas flow, including bubble flow, in porous media, but few studies have
   compared simulations with experiments. Monte Carlo suites of macro-IP
   simulations in two- and three-dimensional domains were compared with
   small-scale (similar to 10 cm) thin-tank experiments of gas injection in
   homogeneous, initially water-saturated sand, where transient gas
   saturations were quantified at the local scale. Comparisons were based
   on gas saturations and the spatial moments of the gas distribution and
   were performed for resolutions between 1 by 1 mm and 5 by 5 mm.
   Simulations were conducted both with and without a stochastic selection
   modification of the macro-IP approach. Two-dimensional simulations
   without stochastic selection were able to reproduce the spatial moments
   of the experimental gas distributions using reasonable estimates of
   local gas saturations at resolutions coarser than or equal to 2 by 2 mm.
   Three-dimensional simulations were also able to reproduce the spatial
   moments at a resolution of 4 by 4 mm, but required higher-than-expected
   gas saturations to accurately represent the injected gas volume. Finer
   discretizations in two- and three-dimensional simulations were unable to
   reproduce injected gas volumes without considering stochastic selection
   or without the use of unreasonably high local gas saturations. This
   suggests a lower limit on the grid block size for macro-IP without
   stochastic selection of approximately three to four grain diameters. By
   including stochastic selection of the next invaded site in the macro-IP
   simulations, observed gas saturations could be reproduced using finer
   discretization.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Little is known about how mitotic cells round against epithelial
   confinement. Here, we engineer micropillar arrays that subject cells to
   lateral mechanical confinement similar to that experienced in epithelia.
   If generating sufficient force to deform the pillars, rounding
   epithelial (MDCK) cells can create space to divide. However, if mitotic
   cells cannot create sufficient space, their rounding force, which is
   generated by actomyosin contraction and hydrostatic pressure, pushes the
   cell out of confinement. After conducting mitosis in an unperturbed
   manner, both daughter cells return to the confinement of the pillars.
   Cells that cannot round against nor escape confinement cannot orient
   their mitotic spindles and more likely undergo apoptosis. The results
   highlight how spatially constrained epithelial cells prepare for
   mitosis: either they are strong enough to round up or they must escape.
   The ability to escape from confinement and reintegrate after mitosis
   appears to be a basic property of epithelial cells.}},

Title = {{A New Model for Designing Multiwindow Multipermeability Nonlinear LTCC

Abstract = {{Nonlinear inductors have wide applications in dc/dc converters. The
   multiwindow multipermeability nonlinear inductor based on
   low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology has been proven to
   have a gradually changing wide-range inductance value curve while
   requiring no extra dc bias, which makes them suitable in various
   high-efficiency dc/dc converters. This paper focuses on the design of
   such amultiwindowmultipermeability inductor based on an innovative
   module. Currently, the design of the LTCC inductors requires complicated
   simulation when coupling-matrices among all the windows are taken into
   consideration. A simplifiedmodel for calculating the inductance value is
   proposed in this paper to reduce complexity. In the proposed model, the
   complicated inductance simulation is simplified to calculating
   inductance of three basic units in a nine-window inductor. By simulating
   the nine-window inductor, inductance of a rectangle-shaped inductor with
   any number of evenly distributed windows on it can be calculated. Based
   on the proposed model, the design guideline of the nonlinear inductor is
   also summarized. A 16-window two-permeability prototype is presented to
   demonstrate the design process according to the new model. The complete
   simulation and the test results are also provided to verify the model.
   The proposed model correlates with the simulation results very well.}},

Title = {{The influence of mesh misalignment on the dynamic characteristics of
   helical gears including sliding friction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{4563-4573}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Due to either elastic deformations or errors in the manufacturing or
   assembling of gears, shafts, bearings and their housings, it is an
   inevitable consequence that mesh misalignment between teeth occurs. The
   change in length of the contact line or the change in load distribution
   along the length of the contact line induced by mesh misalignment causes
   changes in the dynamic characteristics of helical gears. There is
   currently no satisfactory solution for the modeling and calculation of
   the internal excitation in helical gears with mesh misalignment and
   sliding friction that would reveal the changes in the dynamic
   characteristics. In this study, an improved calculation method of
   friction excitation is proposed based on the time-varying length of the
   contact line and the time-varying friction coefficient model in helical
   gears. By considering the change in the mesh position and the change in
   the length of the contact line or the change of the displacement error
   along the contact line induced by mesh misalignment, the time-varying
   sliding friction force and the dynamic mesh force may be obtained. An
   eight degree-of-freedom analytical helical gear pair model is developed
   by incorporating the time-varying sliding friction force and dynamic
   mesh force and considering the mesh misalignment. By assuming a constant
   mesh stiffness density along the contact line, the rules governing the
   variation of the dynamic response are obtained using simulations of
   helical gear pair examples with different friction coefficient models
   and mesh misalignment. The developed analytical model provides a new
   method for the study of excitation characteristics in helical gears with
   mesh misalignment.}},

   intrusion in coastal aquifers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{530}},
Pages = {{350-360}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A novel methodology has been developed to quantify important salt water
   intrusion parameters in a sandbox experiment using image analysis.
   Existing methods found in the literature are based mainly on visual
   observations, which are subjective, labour intensive and limit the
   temporal and spatial resolutions that can be analysed. A robust error
   analysis was undertaken to determine the optimum methodology to convert
   image light intensity to concentration. Results showed that defining a
   relationship on a pixel-wise basis provided the most accurate image to
   concentration conversion and allowed quantification of the width of the
   mixing zone between salt water and freshwater. A high image sample rate
   was used to investigate the transient dynamics of salt water intrusion,
   which rendered analysis by visual observation unsuitable. This paper
   presents the methodologies developed to minimise human input, promote
   autonomy, provide high resolution image to concentration conversion, and
   allow the quantification of intrusion parameters under transient
   conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Branching and crosslinking of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is accomplished
   for the first time through reactive modification in the melt state,
   using dicumyl peroxide (DCP) as the free-radical initiator and a

   oscillatory rheological properties, as well as extensional viscosities
   provide strong evidence of branching and crosslinking, depending on the
   amounts of DCP and TAM. In addition to the significant increases in
   viscosity due to branching/crosslinking, coagent modified samples
   exhibit a significant increase in the crystallization temperature,
   indicative of a nucleating effect, accompanied by a decrease of crystal
   spherulite sizes. In addition, the solid-state storage modulus in DMTA
   experiments is 65\% higher in formulations that contain high gel
   contents, whereas the glass transition temperature of the cured
   formulations is slightly lower. Coagent modified PHB exhibit a
   substantial improvement in the thermal stability, both in isothermal
   dynamic oscillatory temperature sweeps, as well as non-isothermal TGA

Abstract = {{Phase equilibria of the Zr-Nb-Fe system at 700 degrees C were determined

Abstract = {{In plastics processing, the single most important rheological property
   is the steady shear viscosity curve: the logarithm of the steady shear
   viscosity versus the logarithm of the shear rate. This curve governs the
   volumetric flowrate through any straight channel flow, and thus governs
   the production rate of extruded plastics. If the shear rate is made
   dimensionless with a characteristic time for the fluid (called the
   Weissenberg number, Wi), then we can readily identify the end of the
   Newtonian plateau of a viscosity curve with the value Wia parts per
   thousand 1. Of far greater importance, however, is the slope at the
   point where the viscosity curve inflects, (n-1), where n is called the
   shear power-law index. This paper explores the physics of this point and
   related inflections, in the first and second normal stress coefficients.
   We also discuss the first and second inflection pairing times,
   lambda'(B) and lambda aEuro(B)(3). First, we examine the generalized
   Newtonian fluid (Carreau model). Then, we analyze the more versatile
   model, the corotational Oldroyd 8-constant model, which reduces to many
   simpler models, for instance, the corotational Maxwell and Jeffreys
   models. We also include worked examples to illustrate the procedure for
   calculating inflection points and power-law coefficients for all three
   viscometric functions, , and eta(gamma)over dot, Psi(1)(gamma)over dot

Title = {{The black rock coatings in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec: fingerprints of
   historical smelter emissions and the local ore}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{Smelting of base metal sulfide rich ore in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, has
   led to the formation of black rock coatings on exposed rocks to a
   maximum distance of 6 km from the smelter centre. This study has shown
   that these coatings are excellent mineralogical and chemical
   fingerprints of smelter emissions, ore types, and elemental partitioning
   into mineral phases. The black coatings are composed of a silica-rich
   matrix that formed due to the intense chemical weathering of exposed
   silicate rocks interacting with acidic meteoric waters. They contain
   metal sulfate rich layers along the atmosphere-coating interface (ACI)
   and rock-coating interface (RCI) formed by the in situ dissolution and
   precipitation of metal(loid)-bearing phases. Entombed within the silica
   matrix are spherical particulates and particles composed of Cu-and
   Zn-bearing Fe oxides (e.g., spinels), Fe oxides (e.g., hematite), Pb
   silicates (e.g., alamosite), sulfates (anglesite (PbSO4) and minerals of
   the jarosite group), amphiboles, pyroxenes, micas, Na feldspar, and
   clinochlore. Concentrations of elements are low in proximity to the
   smelter but drastically increase similar to 2 km from the stack, most
   likely the result of a shadow effect of the smelter. This shadow effect
   is more pronounced if an element is highly compatible with minerals of
   the jarosite and spinel groups; it is called the smelter-compatibility
   effect. Elements displaying a high smelter-compatibility effect are Ag,
   Cu, Se, and As, whereas elements such as Hg, which is incompatible with
   the jarosite and spinel groups, show a low smelter-compatibility effect.
   High delta S-34 (5.5\%) values in proximity to the smelter and their
   decrease with distance is the result of mixing processes between primary
   and secondary sulfates in the atmosphere. The relative enrichments of
   metal(loid)s in coatings at Rouyn-Noranda and Sudbury, Ontario, when
   normalised to the MUd standard from Queensland, Australia, (MUQ) reflect
   the composition of the smelter emissions, ore, and lithologies. Black
   rock coatings of the Rouyn-Noranda and Sudbury study areas are enriched,
   for example, in Pb and Fe, respectively, reflecting higher abundances of
   galena and Fe-bearing minerals in the respective ore, emissions, and
   rocks in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Photo-cross-linked hydrogels produced from solution blends of
   methacrylated glycol chitosan (MGC), hyaluronic acid (MHA) and
   chondroitin sulfate (MCS) were examined for their potential use as load
   bearing soft tissue (LBST) repair constructs. The effect of the degree
   of prepolymer methacrylation (X, Y or Z; based on a repeating dimer
   unit) on the final hydrogel properties was investigated using solutions
   of 6\% w/v for MGC (6\%MGC-X, where X = 12\%, 26\% or 58\%) and MHA
   (6\%MHA-Y, where Y = 14\%, 42\% or 96\%) and 20\% w/v for MCS
   (20\%MCS-Z, where Z = 16\%, 26\% or 45\%). The goal was to adjust the
   cross-link density to produce hydrogels with moduli greater than 100 kPa
   to be suitable for load bearing applications while also minimizing
   swelling after cross-linking (+/- 10\% change in volume), and
   maintaining high viability and high metabolic activity of the
   encapsulated chondrocytes. These objectives were achieved by
   cross-linking solution blends of either the 6\%MGC-12 or 6\%MHA-42 with
   the 20\%MCS-45 prepolymer at 50\% mass fraction (5050 MGC12MCS45 and
   5050 MHA42MCS45). Chondrocyte viability within blended hydrogels were
   greater than 70\% after 24 h of culture, but metabolic activity was
   highest in the MHA based hydrogels (single component and blended) over a
   35 day culture period. Overall, the high initial modulus, low swelling
   and enhanced metabolic activity of the encapsulated chondrocytes within
   the 5050 MHA42MCS45 hydrogels suggests they may be suitable for use in a
   reparative load bearing soft tissue construct. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We have used geophysics, microbiology, and geochemistry to link
   large-scale (30+ m) geophysical selfpotential (SP) responses at a
   groundwater contaminant plume with its chemistry and microbial ecology
   of groundwater and soil from in and around it. We have found that
   microbially mediated transformation of ammonia to nitrite, nitrate, and
   nitrogen gas was likely to have promoted a well-defined electrochemical
   gradient at the edge of the plume, which dominated the SP response.
   Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the plume fringe or anode of the
   geobattery was dominated by electrogens and biodegradative
   microorganisms including Proteobacteria alongside Geobacteraceae,
   Desulfobulbaceae, and Nitrosomonadaceae. The uncultivated candidate
   phylum OD1 dominated uncontaminated areas of the site. We defined the
   redox boundary at the plume edge using the calculated and observed
   electric SP geophysical measurements. Conductive soils and waste acted
   as an electronic conductor, which was dominated by abiotic iron cycling
   processes that sequester electrons generated at the plume fringe. We
   have suggested that such geoelectric phenomena can act as indicators of
   natural attenuation processes that control groundwater plumes. Further
   work is required to monitor electron transfer across the geoelectric
   dipole to fully define this phenomenon as a geobattery. This approach
   can be used as a novel way of monitoring microbial activity around the
   degradation of contaminated groundwater plumes or to monitor in situ
   bioelectric systems designed to manage groundwater plumes.}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of biogenic greenhouse gases (methane, carbon dioxide)
   in organic sediments is an important factor in the redevelopment and
   risk management of many brownfield sites. Good practice with brownfield
   site characterization requires the identification of free-gas phases and
   pathways that allow its migration and release at the ground surface. Gas
   pockets trapped in the subsurface have contrasting properties with the
   surrounding porous media that favor their detection using geophysical
   methods. We have developed a case study in which pockets of gas were
   intercepted with multilevel monitoring wells, and their lateral
   continuity was monitored over time using resistivity. We have developed
   a novel interpretation procedure based on Archie's law to evaluate
   changes in water and gas content with respect to a mean background
   medium. We have used induced polarization data to account for errors in
   applying Archie's law due to the contribution of surface conductivity
   effects. Mosaics defined by changes in water saturation allowed the
   recognition of gas migration and groundwater infiltration routes and the
   association of gas and groundwater fluxes. The inference on flux
   patterns was analyzed by taking into account pressure measurements in
   trapped gas reservoirs and by metagenomic analysis of the
   microbiological content, which was retrieved from suspended sediments in
   groundwater sampled in multilevel monitoring wells. A conceptual model
   combining physical and microbiological subsurface processes suggested
   that biogas trapped at depth may have the ability to quickly travel to
   the surface.}},

   development and application to a laboratory study}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{109-119}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) accumulation and recovery from
   wells cannot be accurately modeled through typical pressure or flux
   boundary conditions due to gravity segregation of water and DNAPL in the
   wellbore, the effects of wellbore storage, and variations of wellbore
   inflow and outflow rates with depth, particularly in heterogeneous
   formations. A discrete wellbore formulation is presented for numerical
   modeling of DNAPL accumulation in observation wells and DNAPL removal
   from recovery wells. The formulation includes fluid segregation,
   changing water and DNAPL levels in the well and the corresponding
   changes in fluid storage in the wellbore. The method was added to a
   three-dimensional finite difference model (Comp-Sim) for three phase
   (water, gas, DNAPL) flow. The model predictions are compared to
   three-dimensional pilot scale experiments of DNAPL (benzyl alcohol)
   infiltration, redistribution, recovery, and water flushing. Model
   predictions match experimental results well, indicating the
   appropriateness of the model formulation. Characterization of mixing in
   the extraction well is important for predicting removal of highly
   soluble organic compounds like benzyl alcohol. A sensitivity analysis
   shows that the incorporation of hysteresis is critical for accurate
   prediction. Among the multiphase flow and transport parameters required
   for modeling, results are most sensitive to soil intrinsic permeability.

Abstract = {{For the purpose of improving the fungal production of flavonoids, the
   influence of naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and coumarin on flavonoid
   production by fungus Phellinus sp. P0988 was investigated by developing
   the corresponding kinetics of flavonoid production in a 7-L bioreactor.
   Phellinus sp. was confirmed to form flavonoids in pellets and broth when
   cultivated in basic medium, and the optimum concentration of NAA and
   coumarin in medium for flavonoid production were determined to be 0.03
   and 0.02 g/L, respectively. The developed unstructured mathematical
   models were in good agreement with the experimental results with respect
   to flavonoid production kinetic profiles with NAA and coumarin
   supplementation at optimum levels and revealed significant accuracy in
   terms of statistical consistency and robustness. Analysis of these
   kinetic processes indicated that NAA and coumarin supplementations
   imposed a stronger positive influence on flavonoid production and
   substrate consumption compared to their effects on cell growth. The
   separate addition of NAA and coumarin resulted in enhancements in final
   product accumulation and productivity, achieving final flavonoid
   concentrations of 3.60 and 2.75 g/L, respectively, and glucose
   consumption showed a significant decrease compared to the
   non-supplemented control as well. Also, the separate presence of NAA and
   coumarin respectively decreased maintenance coefficients (M (s)) from
   2.48 in the control to 1.39 and 0.22, representing decreases of 43.9 and
   91.1 \%, respectively. The current study is the first known application
   of mathematical kinetic models to explore the influence of medium
   components adding on flavonoid production by fungi.}},

   NWT, Canada, which roasted arsenopyrite (FeAsS)-rich gold ore
   concentrates during 50 years of operations. A large portion of the As
   was collected and stored in underground vaults as As2O3 dust; however,
   some of the As was also released with tailings which contain
   concentrations between 1000 to 5000 ppm. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   and sequential extractions have been completed on samples of mill
   products and various ages of tailings at the Giant mine. These data
   along with petrographic and synchrotron mu XRD and mu X-ray absorption
   near-edge spectroscopy (mu XANES) indicate that the largely oxidized
   roaster products (calcine) and electrostatic precipitator (ESP) dust
   host most of the As in the tailings with a lesser component of sulphide
   arsenic. The fine-grained nature of these oxidized products has led to
   hydraulic sorting within the tailings impounds and dispersal to
   downstream creek and lake sediments.}},

Abstract = {{The Izok Lake Zn-Cu-Pb-Ag volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposit in
   the Arctic region of Canada is one of the largest undeveloped Zn-Cu VMS
   resources in North America. In 2009, the Geological Survey of Canada
   initiated a detailed glacial dispersal study of the deposit focused on
   documenting its associated indicator mineral and till geochemical
   signatures. Glacial dispersal from the deposit is fan-shaped and was
   formed by an older SW ice flow and younger NW ice flow phases. Till
   samples contain chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, and pyrite up to 1.3
   km down-ice and gahnite at least 40 km down-ice. Gahnite (ZnAl2O4) is an
   ideal indicator mineral in till because of its visually distinctive
   bluish green colour combined with its high specific gravity (4-4.6) for
   recovery using density-based separation methods, moderate hardness
   (physical durability during glacial transport), chemical stability in
   oxidizing surficial environments (resistance to post-glacial
   weathering), and its occurrence in highly metamorphosed VMS deposits
   such as Izok Lake. Most gahnite grains in till down-ice are 0.25-0.5 mm
   in size. Coarser gahnite (0.5-2.0 mm) occurs only in till proximal to
   the deposit (<3 km down-ice) and thus is an indicator of proximity to a
   gahnite-bearing bedrock source. Ore (Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag) and pathfinder
   element (As, Cd, Bi, Hg, In, Sb, Sb, Tl) contents in the <0.063 mm
   fraction of till reflect glacial dispersal up to a maximum of 6 km
   down-ice. A 15-20 km till indicator mineral sample spacing is sufficient
   to detect a gahnite glacial dispersal train such as that from the Izok
   Lake VMS deposit.}},

Abstract = {{Nontracking planar concentrators are a low-cost method of increasing the
   performance of traditional solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. This paper
   presents new methodologies for properly modeling this type of system
   using a bidirectional reflectance function for nonideal surfaces rather
   than traditional geometric optics. This methodology allows for the
   evaluation and optimization of specular and nonspecular reflectors in
   planar concentration systems. In addition, an outdoor system has been
   shown to improve energy yield by 45\% for a traditional flat glass
   module and by 40\% for a prismatic glass crystalline silicon module when
   compared with a control module at the same orientation. When compared
   with a control module set at the optimal tilt angle for this region, the
   energy improvement is 18\% for both systems. Simulations show that a
   maximum increase of 30\% is achievable for an optimized system located
   in Kingston, ON, Canada, using a reflector with specular reflection and
   an integrated hemispherical reflectance of 80\%. This validated model
   can be used to optimize reflector topology to identify the potential for
   increased energy harvest from both existing PV and new-build PV assets.}},

Abstract = {{Demand response (DR) algorithms manipulate the energy consumption
   schedules of controllable loads so as to satisfy grid objectives.
   Implementation of DR algorithms using a centralized agent can be
   problematic for scalability reasons, and there are issues related to the
   privacy of data and robustness to communication failures. Thus, it is
   desirable to use a scalable decentralized algorithm for the
   implementation of DR. In this paper, a hierarchical DR scheme is
   proposed for peak minimization based on Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition
   (DWD). In addition, a time weighted maximization option is included in
   the cost function, which improves the quality of service for devices
   seeking to receive their desired energy sooner rather than later. This
   paper also demonstrates how the DWD algorithm can be implemented more
   efficiently through the calculation of the upper and lower cost bounds
   after each DWD iteration.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, nanofluids of tungsten oxide (WO3) nanoparticles (0.5-4
   \% mass fractions) in ethylene glycol (EG) and glycerol (G) as base
   fluids were prepared and their rheological properties were measured as
   functions of mass fraction, temperature, and shear rate. G and WO3-G
   fluids show nearly Newtonian behavior while EG and WO3-EG fluids display
   shear-thinning behavior especially at higher temperatures. The
   experimental data were fitted to classical fluid models (power law,
   Bingham plastic, and Herschel-Bulkley models). The rheological behavior
   of both nanofluids and base fluids was fitted well with the
   Herschel-Bulkley model. A 9 and 14 \% increase in viscosity of ethylene
   glycol and glycerol was observed when 4 \% WO3 nanoparticles were loaded
   at 20 A degrees C and shear rates of 105 and 4 s(-1), respectively. The
   viscosity of the nanofluids decreases exponentially with increasing
   temperature. The viscosity data as a function of temperature were fitted
   with six empirical models. To the best of our knowledge, this research
   is the first report on the rheological properties of nanofluids of
   tungsten oxide nanoparticles in EG and G. The colloidal stability of
   both WO3-EG and WO3-G nanofluids was measured using UV-Vis method. It
   was found that the stability of WO3-G is more than that of WO3-EG
   nanofluids. The WO3 nanoparticles with an average particle size of 22 nm
   were prepared using hydrothermal method and subsequently characterized
   using seven techniques including X-ray diffraction, transmission
   electronic microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM, energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy, UV-Vis, FT-IR spectroscopy, and Doppler light
   scattering technique.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated levels of arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) in water and sediments
   are legacy residues found downstream from gold-mining activities at the
   Giant Mine in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. To track
   the transport and fate of As and Sb, samples of mine-waste from the
   mill, and surface water, sediment, pore-water, and vegetation downstream
   of the mine were collected. Mine waste, pore-water, and sediment samples
   were analyzed for bulk chemistry, and aqueous and solid-state
   speciation. Sediment and vegetation chemistry were evaluated using
   scanning electron microscope imaging, synchrotron-based element mapping
   and electron microprobe analysis. The distributions of As and Sb in
   sediments were similar, yet their distributions in the corresponding
   pore-waters were mostly dissimilar, and the mobility of As was greater
   than that of Sb. Competition for sorption sites is the most likely cause
   of elevated Sb concentrations in relatively oxidized pore-water and
   surface water. The aqueous and solid-state speciation of As and Sb also
   differed. In pore-water, As(V) dominated in oxidizing environments and
   As(III) in reducing environments. In contrast, the Sb(V) species
   dominated in all but one pore-water sample, even under reducing
   conditions. Antimony(III) appears to preferentially precipitate or
   adsorb onto sulfides as evidenced by the prevalence of an Sb(III)-S
   secondary solid-phase and the lack of Sb(III)(aq) in the deeper zones.
   The As(V)-O solid phase became depleted with depth below the
   sediment-water interface, and the Sb(V)-O phase persisted under
   relatively reducing conditions. In the surficial zone at a site
   populated by Equisetum fluviatile (common horsetail), As and Sb were
   associated with organic material and appeared mobile in the root zone.
   In the zone below active plant growth, As and Sb were associated
   primarily with inorganic phases suggesting a release and reprecipitation
   of these elements upon plant death. The co-existence of reduced and
   oxidized As and Sb species, instability of some phases under changing
   redox conditions, and plant uptake and release pose challenges for
   remediation efforts at the mine. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The short-term and long-term performance of reinforced, deep mixing
   method (DMM) floating-column supported embankments with and without
   prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) are investigated using a fully 3D
   coupled model. The concurrent use of PVDs with the other two forms of
   soft ground improvement significantly shortens time for subsoil
   consolidation and also substantially reduces post-consolidation lateral
   displacements and post-construction crest settlements. The combined use
   of PVDs and surcharge preloading to meet a requirement of 100 mm
   post-construction crest settlement for a bridge approach embankment is
   examined. Compared to a comparable case with surcharge preloading but
   without PVDs, the synergistic effects of PVDs and 0.5 m fill surcharge
   preloading diminish the calculated post-construction crest settlement
   from 0.228 m to 0.036 m and reduce the post-consolidation horizontal
   movement below the toe at the ground surface level from 0.115 m to 0.067
   m even though embankment is constructed 5 times faster in the case with
   PVDs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order for teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collaborate and
   cooperate to perform challenging group tasks, intelligent and flexible
   control strategies are required. One of the complex behaviors required
   of a team of UAVs is dynamic encirclement, which is a tactic that can be
   employed for persistent surveillance and/or to neutralize a target by
   restricting its movement. This tactic requires a high level of
   cooperation such that the UAVs maintain a desired and proper
   encirclement radius and angular velocity around the target. In this
   paper, model predictive control (MPC) is used to model and implement
   controllers for the problem of dynamic encirclement. The linear and
   nonlinear control policies proposed in this paper are applied as a
   high-level controller to control multiple UAVs to encircle a desired
   target in simulations and real-time experiments with quadrotors. The
   nonlinear solution provides a theoretical analysis of the problem, while
   the linear control policy is used for real-time operation via a
   combination of MPC and feedback linearization applied to the nonlinear
   UAV system. The contributions of this paper lie in the implementation of
   MPC to solve the problem of dynamic encirclement of a team of UAVs in
   real time and the application of theoretical stability analysis to the
   problem.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We present a novel approach to the problem of tracking objects moving
   along smooth trajectories using a network of simple inexpensive binary
   sensors. Specifically, we consider object trajectories that can be
   well-approximated by piecewise linear curves and sensors that can only
   detect whether an object is in their sensing range. We start by
   considering objects moving along straight-line trajectories with an
   unknown speed and show that such objects can be tracked using the
   measurements of just three generically placed binary sensors whose
   sensing ranges intersect the trajectory. Next, we present an asymptotic
   analysis that shows that a trajectory consisting of a finite number of
   straight line segments can be recovered with high probability using an
   arbitrarily low spatial density of sensors in the limit when the area to
   be covered gets larger and larger. We also present efficient algorithms
   that effectively recover piecewise linear trajectories. Finally we
   present analysis and simulations to demonstrate the high tracking
   accuracy of our approach and its robustness to sensing errors. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{As buried infrastructure in North America and around the world reaches
   the end of its service life, engineers and infrastructure managers will
   require an improved understanding of the performance of both
   deteriorated pipes and repair techniques. To develop this improved
   understanding, sensing technologies that enable the full pipe behavior
   to be measured, rather than a small number of localized discrete
   measurements, are required. A possible solution to this problem is to
   use distributed fiber optic strain sensors. To this end, a series of
   buried pipe tests were undertaken on steel, concrete, and high-density
   polyethylene (HDPE) pipes instrumented with distributed fiber optic
   strain sensors. The distributed measurements were in agreement with
   conventional strain gauges, but enabled the full strain distribution
   around the circumference of the pipe to be measured. This allowed
   localized behavior that would have been missed with conventional strain
   gauges to be detected and quantified. In addition, the choice of fiber
   optic cable proved to be an important consideration due to a trade-off
   between measurement accuracy and sensor robustness. (C) 2015 American

Title = {{Role of Grout Strength and Liners on the Performance of Slip-Lined Pipes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PIPELINE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{As infrastructure built during the 20th century reaches the end of its
   service life, engineers and managers are increasingly turning to
   rehabilitation rather than replacement to potentially reduce costs. For
   corrugated steel pipes and culverts, one such rehabilitation alternative
   is to use slip lining where a liner (new pipe) is placed inside the
   existing deteriorated pipe and the space between them is grouted. The
   current research seeks to better understand the performance of
   slip-lined systems by (1) characterizing the properties of a
   low-strength and a high-strength grout; (2) conducting a series of pipe
   tests to determine the load-carrying capacity and stiffness of a
   corrugated steel pipe and pipes that have been rehabilitated with slip
   liners; (3) understand the impact of grout strength and the liner on
   pipe stiffness and strength; and (4) determine the level of composite
   action in the pipe system by using a plasticity approach to estimate the
   load-carrying capacity of the system. The pipes rehabilitated with
   low-strength grout had increased strength (three times greater) and
   stiffness (eight times greater) versus an unrehabilitated pipe, whereas
   the specimens rehabilitated with high-strength grout showed higher
   increases in both load-carrying capacity (ten times greater) and
   stiffness (50 times greater) over the unrehabilitated pipe. The high
   density polyethylene (HDPE) liner had no impact on the load-carrying
   capacity of the specimens with high-strength grout and required large
   diameter changes to enhance the load-carrying capacity of low-strength
   grout specimens. A plasticity approach was used to estimate the
   load-carrying capacity of the specimens and indicated that for these
   tests, composite behavior between the grout and the corrugated steel
   pipe was developed. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{378-385}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Carbon films were energetically deposited onto copper and nickel foil
   using a filtered cathodic vacuum arc deposition system. Raman
   spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron
   microscopy and UV-visible spectroscopy showed that graphene films of
   uniform thickness with up to 10 layers can be deposited onto copper foil
   at moderate temperatures of 750 degrees C. The resulting films, which
   can be prepared at high deposition rates, were comparable to graphene
   films grown at 1050 degrees C using chemical vapour deposition (CVD).
   This difference in growth temperature is attributed to dynamic annealing
   which occurs as the film grows from the energetic carbon flux. In the
   case of nickel substrates, it was found that graphene films can also be
   prepared at moderate substrate temperatures. However much higher carbon
   doses were required, indicating that the growth mode differs between
   substrates as observed in CVD grown graphene. The films deposited onto
   nickel were also highly non uniform in thickness, indicating that the
   grain structure of the nickel substrate influenced the growth of
   graphene layers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical water splitting used for generating hydrogen has
   attracted increasingly attention due to energy and environmental issues.
   It is a major challenge to design an efficient, robust and inexpensive
   electrocatalyst to achieve preferable catalytic performance. Herein, a
   novel three-dimensional (3D) electrocatalyst was prepared by decorating
   nanostructured biological material-derived carbon nanofibers with in
   situ generated cobalt-based nanospheres (denoted as CNF@Co) through a
   facile approach. The interconnected porous 3D networks of the resulting
   CNF@Co catalyst provide abundant channels and interfaces, which
   remarkably favor both mass transfer and oxygen evolution. The
   as-prepared CNF@Co shows excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the
   oxygen evolution reactions with an onset potential of about 0.445 V vs.
   Ag/AgCl. It only needs a low overpotential of 314 mV to achieve a
   current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, the CNF@Co
   catalyst exhibits excellent stability towards water oxidation, even
   outperforming commercial IrO2 and RuO2 catalysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Despite the abundance of studies investigating the performance of
   composite structures under crush loading, disagreement remains in the
   literature regarding the effect of increased strain rate on the crush
   response. This study reports an experimental investigation of the
   behaviour of a carbon-epoxy composite energy absorber under static and
   dynamic loading with a strain rate of up to 100 s(-1). Consistent damage
   modes and measured force responses were obtained in samples tested under
   the same strain rate. The energy absorption was found to be independent
   of strain rate as the total energy absorption appeared to be largely
   associated with fibre-dominated fracture, which is independent of strain
   rate within the studied range. The results from this study are
   beneficial for the design of energy absorbing structures. (C) 2015

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{215-228}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper details the theory and implementation of a composite damage
   model, addressing damage within a ply (intralaminar) and delamination
   (interlaminar), for the simulation of crushing of laminated composite
   structures. It includes a more accurate determination of the
   characteristic length to achieve mesh objectivity in capturing
   intralaminar damage consisting of matrix cracking and fibre failure, a
   load-history dependent material response, an isotropic hardening
   nonlinear matrix response, as well as a more physically-based
   interactive matrix-dominated damage mechanism. The developed damage
   model requires a set of material parameters obtained from a combination
   of standard and non-standard material characterisation tests. The
   fidelity of the model mitigates the need to manipulate, or
   ``calibrate{''}, the input data to achieve good agreement with
   experimental results. The intralaminar damage model was implemented as a
   VUMAT subroutine, and used in conjunction with an existing interlaminar
   damage model, in Abaqus/Explicit. This approach was validated through
   the simulation of the crushing of a cross-ply composite tube with a
   tulip-shaped trigger, loaded in uniaxial compression. Despite the
   complexity of the chosen geometry, excellent correlation was achieved
   with experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobic co-digestions with fat, oil and grease (FOG) were investigated
   in two-stage thermophilic (55 degrees C) semi-continuous flow
   co-digestion systems. One two-stage co-digestion system (System I) was
   modified to incorporate a thermo-chemical pre-treatment of pH = 10 at 55
   degrees C, which was the best pre-treatment Condition for FOG
   co-digestion identified during laboratory-scale biochemical methane
   potential (BMP) testing. The other two-stage co-digestion system (System
   II) was operated without a pretreatment process. The anaerobic digester
   of each digestion system had a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24
   days. An organic loading rate (OLR) of 1.83 +/- 0.09 g TVS/L.d was
   applied to each digestion system. It was found that System I effectively
   enhanced biogas production as the thermo-chemical pre-treatment improved
   the substrate hydrolysis including increased COD solubilization and VFA
   concentrations. Overall, the modified System I yielded a 25.14 +/- 2.14
   L/d biogas production rate, which was substantially higher than the
   18.73 +/- 1.11 L/d obtained in the System II. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper describes large scale tests conducted on a novel unglazed
   solar air collector system. The proposed system, referred to as a
   back-pass solar collector (BPSC), has on-site installation and aesthetic
   advantages over conventional unglazed transpired solar collectors (UTSC)
   as it is fully integrated within a standard insulated wall panel. This
   paper presents the results obtained from monitoring a BPSC wall panel
   over one year. Measurements of temperature, wind velocity and solar
   irradiance were taken at multiple air mass flow rates. It is shown that
   the length of the collector cavities has a direct impact on the
   efficiency of the system. It is also shown that beyond a height-to-flow
   ratio of 0.023 m/m(3)/hr/m(2), no additional heat output is obtained by
   increasing the collector height for the experimental setup in this
   study, but these numbers would obviously be different if the
   experimental setup or test environment (e.g. location and climate)
   change. An equation for predicting the temperature rise of the BPSC is
   proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   the plasma treated TiO2/PEDOT: PSS nanocomposite. The improvement in
   nanocomposite properties is due to the enhanced dispersion and stability

Abstract = {{This study proposes a novel method to extract lipids from wet primary
   sludge for biodiesel production using ionic liquids.
   Tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride and widely used
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methyl sulfate were evaluated to extract
   lipids from raw and dried sludge (96\% and 2\%, wt. water content,
   respectively) and compared to the conventional Soxhlet method using
   organic solvents. Both these ionic liquids showed suitability for lipid
   extraction from raw sludge, giving even better results than expected
   from dried sludge. The {[}C(4)mim]{[}MeSO4] ionic liquid reached 18.5\%
   and 26.9\% of lipids, 14.1\% and 18.4\% of biodiesel from dried and raw
   sludge, respectively. The {[}P(CH2OH)(4)]Cl ionic liquid gained 23.4\%
   and 27.6\% of lipids, 17.0\% and 19.8\% of biodiesel from dried and raw
   sludge respectively, reaching comparable results to the conventional
   Soxhlet method (27.2\% of lipids, 19.4\% of biodiesel). Therefore, the
   proposed ionic liquid process is efficient in lipid extraction directly
   from wet primary sludge, eliminating the expensive step of sludge drying
   and the use of volatile organic solvents. Under the optimised extraction
   conditions using {[}P(CH2OH)(4)]Cl ionic liquid and raw sludge (1:5
   sludge (g/TS):IL (cm(3)) ratio, 100 degrees C and 3 h), the obtained
   yield of lipids and biodiesel amounted to 25.7\% and 21.1\%,
   respectively. Additionally, lipid extraction using {[}P(CH2OH)(4)]Cl
   ionic liquid also precipitates cellulosic material, which allows for
   direct and easy cellulose-based co-product recovery, giving high
   additional value to the process. Consequently, the economic and
   environmental aspects of biodiesel production from sewage sludge could
   be improved. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental problems, especially climate change, have become a serious
   global issue waiting for people to solve. In the construction industry,
   the concept of sustainable building is developing to reduce greenhouse
   gas emissions. In this study, a building information modeling (BIM)
   based building design optimization method is proposed to facilitate
   designers to optimize their designs and improve buildings'
   sustainability. A revised particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is
   applied to search for the trade-off between life cycle costs (LCC) and
   life cycle carbon emissions (LCCE) of building designs. In order to
   validate the effectiveness and efficiency of this method, a case study
   of an office building is conducted in Hong Kong. The result of the case
   study shows that this method can enlarge the searching space for optimal
   design solutions and shorten the processing time for optimal design
   results, which is really helpful for designers to deliver an economic
   and environmental-friendly design scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Taguchi method was applied to investigate the optimal operating
   conditions in the preparation of activated carbon using palm kernel
   shell with quadruple control factors: irradiation time, microwave power,
   concentration of phosphoric acid as impregnation substance and
   impregnation ratio between acid and palm kernel shell. The best
   combination of the control factors as obtained by applying Taguchi
   method was microwave power of 800 W, irradiation time of 17 min,
   impregnation ratio of 2, and acid concentration of 85\%. The noise
   factor (particle size of raw material) was considered in a separate
   outer array, which had no effect on the quality of the activated carbon
   as confirmed by t-test. Activated carbon prepared at optimum combination
   of control factors had high BET surface area of 1473.55 m(2) g(-1), and
   high porosity. The adsorption equilibrium and kinetic data can
   satisfactorily be described by the Langmuir isotherm and a
   pseudo-second-order kinetic model, respectively. The maximum methylene

   webs were used as test specimens. Mechanical peel tests were performed
   to investigate the effect of average orientation angles on interactions
   between nanotube bundles. Thus, in the absence of any binding agents,
   the effect of orientation directions on Van Der Waals forces between the
   nanotube bundles was revealed. The experimental results obtained from
   this study are consistent with theoretical calculations from published
   literature. It was found that the interaction force of the spinnable
   nanotube bundles is inversely related to their average orientation
   angle. It is shown that the force for parallel nanotube bundles at 0
   degrees angle is higher than the force for crossed nanotube bundles at
   90 degrees angle.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to directly utilize hydrocarbons and other renewable liquid
   fuels is one of the most important issues affecting the large scale
   deployment of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Herein we designed
   La0.2Sr0.7TiO3-Ni/YSZ functional gradient anode (FGA) supported SOFCs,
   prepared with a co-tape casting method and sintered using the field
   assisted sintering technique (FAST). Through SEM observations, it was
   confirmed that the FGA structure was achieved and well maintained after
   the FAST process. Distortion and delamination which usually results
   after conventional sintering was successfully avoided. The
   La0.2Sr0.7TiO3-Ni/YSZ FGA supported SOFCs showed a maximum power density
   of 600 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C, and was stable for 70 h in CH4. No

Abstract = {{Studies of urban metabolism provide important insights for environmental
   management of cities, but are not widely used in planning practice due
   to a mismatch of data scale and coverage. This paper introduces the
   Spatial Allocation of Material Flow Analysis (SAMFA) model as a
   potential decision support tool aimed as a contribution to overcome some
   of these difficulties and describes its pilot use at the county level in
   the Republic of Ireland. The results suggest that SAMFA is capable of
   identifying hotspots of higher material and energy use to support
   targeted planning initiatives, while its ability to visualise different
   policy scenarios supports more effective multi-stakeholder engagement.
   The paper evaluates this pilot use and sets out how this model can act
   as an analytical platform for the industrial ecology-spatial planning
   nexus.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of inter-organizational trust to project success has been
   increasingly highlighted in the construction industry. This study aims
   to explore the role of trust between project parties. It adopts a
   combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Based on the
   analysis of the responses of a questionnaire survey, trust is
   demonstrated to have a significant contribution to the development of
   cooperative or collaborative relationships; fostering trust proves to
   have a major influence on the improvement of project performance; and
   some relationship and performance indicators are found to have closer
   associations with trust than others so that trust is more important to
   the development of relationship and the improvement of performance in
   these aspects. The analysis of questionnaire responses also provides
   significant evidence for the reduction in monitoring and control
   following the increase of mutual trust. The questionnaire survey is
   followed by a series of expert interviews, both of which contribute to
   the establishment of a model that links trust with relationship and
   performance and distinguishes the new approach that is based on trust
   from the traditional mechanism that relies on monitoring and control.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of detecting relatively small
   targets in the presence of Gaussian disturbance with unknown covariance
   matrix. To this end, we jointly exploit the spillover of target energy
   to consecutive range samples and the particular persymmetric structure
   of the disturbance covariance matrix to improve the performances of
   detection and range localization. In this context, we derive two
   adaptive detectors relying on the generalized likelihood ratio test and
   on ad hoc design procedure. Remarkably, the new receivers ensure the
   constant false alarm rate property with respect to the disturbance
   covariance matrix. The performance assessments, conducted on both
   simulated data and real recorded datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed detectors compared with both the traditional
   unstructured counterparts and the state-of-the-art persymmetric
   detectors that ignore the spillover.}},

Abstract = {{The scale-up of a radiofrequency (RF) heated micro trickle bed reactor
   for hydrogenation of 2-methyl-3-butyne-2-ol (MBY) over a Pd/TiO2
   catalyst has been performed. The axial and radial temperature profiles
   were calculated using a 2D convection and conduction heat transfer
   model. The effect of the reactor length, tube diameter and number of
   parallel tubes on the temperature non-uniformity parameter has been
   studied. The axial scale-up was achieved by repeating a single periodic
   unit consisting of one heating and one catalytic zone along the reactor
   length. The catalyst loading can be increased by an order of magnitude
   following this approach. A radial temperature difference of 2 K was
   developed in a reactor with an inner diameter of 15 mm. The scale-up by
   numbering up allows the accommodation of seven parallel tubes inside a
   single RF coil. It creates a 7 K difference in the average temperature
   between the central and the outer tubes which results in a 5\%
   difference in MBY conversion. An overall scale-up factor of near 700 is
   achieved which corresponds to a production rate of 0.5 kg of

Abstract = {{Geopolymer binders are generally formed by reacting powdered
   aluminosilicate precursors with alkali silicate activators. Most
   research to date has concentrated on using either pulverised fuel ash or
   high purity dehydroxylated kaolin (metakaolin) in association with
   ground granulated blast furnace slag as the main precursor material.
   However, recently, attention has turned to alternative calcined clays
   that are abundant throughout the globe and have lower kaolinite contents
   than commercially available metakaolins. Due to the lack of clear and
   simple screening protocols enabling assessment of such geological
   resources for use as precursors in geopolymer systems, the present paper
   presents results from experimental work that was carried out to develop
   a functional binder using materials containing kaolinite taken from the
   Interbasaltic Formation of Northern Ireland. The influence of mineralogy
   has been examined, and a screening process, using three Interbasaltic
   materials as examples, that will assist in the rapid selection of
   suitable geopolymeric precursors from such materials is outlined.}},

Abstract = {{The British standard constant-head triaxial test for measuring the
   permeability of fine-grained soils takes a relatively long time. A
   quicker test could provide savings to the construction industry,
   particularly for checking the quality of landfill clay liners. An
   accelerated permeability test has been developed, but the method often
   underestimates the permeability values compared owing to structural
   changes in the soil sample. This paper reports on an investigation into
   the accelerated test to discover if the changes can be limited by using
   a revised procedure. The accelerated test is assessed and compared with
   the standard test and a ramp-accelerated permeability test. Four
   different fine-grained materials are compacted at various water contents
   to produced analogous samples for testing using the three different
   methods. Fabric analysis is carried out on specimens derived from
   post-test samples using mercury intrusion porosimetry and scanning
   electron microscopy to assess the effects of testing on soil structure.
   The results show that accelerated testing in general underestimates
   permeability compared with values derived from the standard test, owing
   to changes in soil structure caused by testing. The ramp-accelerated
   test is shown to provide an improvement in terms of these structural
   changes.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{483-502}},

Abstract = {{Geologic field mapping surveys integrated with structural,
   thermochronological, and geochronological analyses confirm the existence
   of an orogen-parallel strike-slip-dominated shear zone in the upper
   Karnali valley of northwestern Nepal. This shear zone obliquely cuts
   through the upper Greater Himalayan Sequence and is characterized by a
   S-dipping, high-strain foliation and intensely developed
   ESE-WNW-trending, shallow-plunging mineral elongation lineation.
   Monazite grains within the Greater Himalayan Sequence are deformed and
   transposed parallel to the orogen-parallel shear zone and ESE-WNW
   elongation lineations. In situ U-Th/Pb monazite geochronology constrains
   metamorphism between 19 and 15 Ma, which is consistent with the timing
   of Neohimalayan metamorphism and S-directed extrusion of the Greater
   Himalayan Sequence across the Himalaya, and it is therefore interpreted
   to have preceded orogen-parallel strike-slip deformation. Mineral
   deformation mechanisms and quartz c-axis patterns of orogen-parallel
   fabrics record a rapid increase in temperature of deformation from
   similar to 350 degrees C along upper levels of the shear zone to greater
   than 630 degrees C at similar to 2.5 km depth structurally below the
   shear zone. Symmetric quartz c-axis fabrics further suggest deformation
   included a significant component of pure shear. The Ar-40/Ar-39
   thermochronology of foliation-defining muscovite indicates that
   orogen-parallel shearing was active in the area between ca. 13 and 10 Ma
   while temperatures cooled through the muscovite closure temperature for
   argon. By integrating these data with the current understanding of
   tectonic processes in the Himalaya, we interpret a transition from
   S-directed extrusion of the Greater Himalayan Sequence to
   orogen-parallel extension between ca. 15 and 13 Ma in the upper Karnali
   valley. Integration of our findings with chronological constraints from
   other migmatite-cored domes supports the growing recognition of a
   Himalayan-wide mid-Miocene initiation of orogen-parallel extension.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a point cloud de-noising and calibration approach
   that takes advantage of point redundancy in both space and time (4D).
   The purpose is to detect displacements using terrestrial laser scanner
   data at the sub-mm scale or smaller, similar to radar systems, for the
   study of very small natural changes, i.e., pre-failure deformation in
   rock slopes, small-scale failures or talus flux. The algorithm
   calculates distances using a multi-scale normal distance approach and
   uses a set of calibration point clouds to remove systematic errors. The
   median is used to filter distance values for a neighbourhood in space
   and time to reduce random type errors. The use of space and time
   neighbours does need to be optimized to the signal being studied, in
   order to avoid smoothing in either spatial or temporal domains. This is
   demonstrated in the application of the algorithm to synthetic and
   experimental case examples. Optimum combinations of space and time
   neighbours in practical applications can lead to an improvement of an
   order or two of magnitude in the level of detection for change, which
   will greatly improve our ability to detect small changes in many
   disciplines, such as rock slope pre-failure deformation, deformation in
   civil infrastructure and small-scale geomorphological change.}},

Abstract = {{The origin of carbonate muds (grain sizes, 63 mm) in shallow,
   nontropical marine environments is poorly documented. Coarse-grained
   carbonates often characterize coastal temperate seafloors, but many such
   deposits also have abundant carbonate muds. Spencer Gulf, a large,
   shallow embayment along the southern Australian margin (< 60 m water
   depth), contains mixtures of carbonate gravels, sands, and muds, with
   muds constituting up to 84\% volumetrically. Benthic environments
   include dense seagrass meadows, sand barrens, and rhodolith pavements
   where bivalves, benthic foraminifera, coralline algae, and bryozoans
   dominate heterozoan carbonate assemblages. Mud grain morphologies were
   investigated using scanning electron microscopy, leading to the
   conclusion that muds are predominantly composed of skeletal fragments
   (bivalves, benthic foraminifera, ascidians, echinoderms, and coralline
   algae), interpreted to have formed due to breakdown of rigid material
   via maceration. X-ray diffraction analysis confirms that these muds
   contain combinations of intermediate-Mg calcite, low-Mg calcite, and
   aragonite; with concentrations varying among locations according to
   skeletal grain types. Spencer Gulf muds differ in mineralogy and
   composition from those of classic models of tropical and deep-water
   carbonate mud deposition. Unlike shallow-water, tropical carbonate muds,
   these temperate muds are not dominated by aragonite and there is no
   evidence of carbonate precipitation from seawater. Pelagic organisms
   contribute only trivial amounts to these deposits, in contrast to
   deep-water muds.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The quantification of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) has been
   investigated using an algorithm based on the tesselation of unstructured
   data points. The applicability of the algorithm in resolving an LCS was
   tested using a synthetically generated unsteady double-gyre flow and
   experimentally in a nominally two-dimensional free shear flow. The
   effects of two parameters on LCS identification were studied: the
   threshold track length used to quantify the LCS and resulting effective
   seeding density upon applying the threshold. At lower threshold track
   lengths, increases in the threshold track length resulted in finite-time
   Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field convergence towards the expected LCS
   ridge of the double-gyre flow field at several effective seeding
   densities. However, at higher track lengths, further increases to the
   threshold track length failed to improve convergence at low effective
   seeding densities. The FTLE of the experimental data set was
   well-resolved using moderate threshold track lengths that achieved field
   convergence but maintained a sufficiently high seeding density. In
   contrast, the use of lower or higher track lengths produced an FTLE
   field characterized by an incoherent LCS ridge. From the analytical and
   experimental results, recommendations are made for future experiments
   for identifying LCS directly from unstructured data.}},

Journal = {{FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{463-470}},

Abstract = {{Creosote-treated wooden railway ties and roofing asphalt shingles are
   discarded in large quantities and may be significant sources of energy;
   however, they may have rotted or oxidized, and the chemical changes that
   result from such weathering could affect their behavior as a fuel or
   pyrolysis feedstock. Such changes in railway tie wood, and roofing
   asphalt shingles were studied by identifying isothermal 250 and 550
   degrees C pyrolysis products (pyrolyzates) with pyrolysis-gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS). Poplar wood pyrolysis was
   also studied and compared to existing literature to establish a
   reference scenario; identified poplar wood pyrolyzates assisted in the
   analysis of railway tie and asphalt shingle pyrolyzates. Poplar
   pyrolyzates included the products of polysaccharide ring-breaking and
   lignin pyrolysis, confirming one of the two competing low-temperature
   pyrolysis models. Railway tie pyrolyzates showed few signs of bacterial
   degradation or oxidation, indicating that the tie considered here did
   not undergo extensive weathering. Roofing asphalt pyrolyzates included
   many carbonyl, hydroxyl, and ether functionalized cyclic species, as
   well as sulfur dioxide; these pyrolyzates indicate extensive and
   preferential oxidation of cyclic carbon and sulfur. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The hydrogenation of 4-phenyl-2-butanone over Pt/TiO2 and Pt/SiO2
   catalysts has been performed in a range of solvents and it has been
   observed that the solvent impacted on the selectivity of ketone and
   aromatic ring hydrogenation as well as the overall TOF of the titania
   catalyst with no solvent effect on selectivity observed using the silica
   supported catalyst where ring hydrogenation was favored. For the titania
   catalyst, alkanes were found to favor ring hydrogenation whereas
   aromatics and alcohols led to carbonyl hydrogenation. A two-site
   catalyst model is proposed whereby the aromatic ring hydrogenation
   occurs over the metal sites while carbonyl hydrogenation is thought to
   occur predominantly at interfacial sites, with oxygen vacancies in the
   titania support activating the carbonyl. The effect of the solvent on
   the hydrogenation reaction over the titania catalyst was related to
   competition for the active sites between solvent and
   4-phenyl-2-butanone. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The rate and, more importantly, selectivity (ketone vs aromatic ring) of
   the hydrogenation of 4-phenyl-2-butanone over a Pt/TiO2 catalyst have
   been shown to vary with solvent. In this study, a fundamental kinetic
   model for this multi-phase reaction has been developed incorporating
   statistical analysis methods to strengthen the foundations of
   mechanistically sound kinetic models.
   A 2-site model was determined to be most appropriate, describing
   aromatic hydrogenation (postulated to be over a platinum site) and
   ketone hydrogenation (postulated to be at the platinum-titania
   interface). Solvent choice has little impact on the ketone hydrogenation
   rate constant but strongly impacts aromatic hydrogenation due to
   solvent-catalyst interaction. Reaction selectivity is also correlated to
   a fitted product adsorption constant parameter. The kinetic analysis
   method shown has demonstrated the role of solvents in influencing
   reactant adsorption and reaction selectivity. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Title = {{Interlaboratory studies on in vitro test methods for estimating in vivo
   resorption of calcium phosphate ceramics}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{347-355}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{A potential standard method for measuring the relative dissolution rate
   to estimate the resorbability of calcium-phosphate-based ceramics is
   proposed. Tricalcium phosphate (TCP), magnesium-substituted TCP (MgTCP)
   and zinc-substituted TCP (ZnTCP) were dissolved in a buffer solution
   free of calcium and phosphate ions at pH 4.0, 5.5 or 7.3 at nine
   research centers. Relative values of the initial dissolution rate
   (relative dissolution rates) were in good agreement among the centers.
   The relative dissolution rate coincided with the relative volume of
   resorption pits of ZnTCP in vitro. The relative dissolution rate
   coincided with the relative resorbed volume in vivo in the case of
   comparison between microporous MgTCPs with different Mg contents and
   similar porosity. However, the relative dissolution rate was in poor
   agreement with the relative resorbed volume in vivo in the case of
   comparison between microporous TCP and MgTCP due to the superimposition
   of the Mg-mediated decrease in TCP solubility on the Mg-mediated
   increase in the amount of resorption. An unambiguous conclusion could
   not be made as to whether the relative dissolution rate is predictive of
   the relative resorbed volume in vivo in the case of comparison between
   TCPs with different porosity. The relative dissolution rate may be
   useful for predicting the relative amount of resorption for
   calcium-phosphate-based ceramics having different solubility under the
   condition that the differences in the materials compared have little
   impact on the resorption process such as the number and activity of
   resorbing cells.
   Statement of significance
   The evaluation and subsequent optimization of the resorbability of
   calcium phosphate are crucial in the use of resorbable calcium
   phosphates. Although the resorbability of calcium phosphates has usually
   been evaluated in vivo, establishment of a standard in vitro method that
   can predict in vivo resorption is beneficial for accelerating
   development and commercialization of new resorbable calcium phosphate
   materials as well as reducing use of animals. However, there are only a
   few studies to propose such an in vitro method within which direct
   comparison was carried out between in vitro and in vivo resorption. We
   propose here an in vitro method based on measuring dissolution rate. The
   efficacy and limitations of the method were evaluated by international
   round-robin tests as well as comparison with in vivo resorption studies
   for future standardization. This study was carried out as one of
   Versailles Projects on Advanced Materials and Standards (VAMAS). (C)

Abstract = {{The role that bacterial factors play in determining how bacteria respond
   to photocatalytic degradation is becoming increasingly recognised.
   Fimbriae which are thin, proteinaceous cell surface structures produced
   by many enterobacteria are generally considered to be important
   bacterial virulence determinants in the host. Recent studies, however,
   suggest that their expression may be increased during times of
   environmental stress to protect them against factors such as nutrient
   depletion and oxidation. In this study bacteria were grown under defined
   culture conditions to promote the expression of type 1 fimbriae and
   subjected to photocatalytic treatment.
   Results showed that Escherichia coli grown under conditions to express
   type 1 fimbriae were more resistant to photocatalytic destruction than
   control cultures, taking 75 min longer to be destroyed. Curli fimbriae
   are also known to play a role in environmental protection of bacteria
   and they are associated with biofilm production. The ability of the E.
   coli strain to produce curli fimbriae was confirmed and biofilms were
   grown and subjected to photocatalytic treatment. Biofilm destruction by
   photocatalysis was assessed using a resazurin viability assay and a loss
   of cell viability was demonstrated within 30 min treatment time. This
   study suggests that intrinsic bacterial factors may play a role in
   determining an organism's response to photocatalytic treatment and
   highlights their importance in this disinfection process. (C) 2015

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{A solvent vapour thermoplastic bonding process is reported which
   provides high-strength bonding of PMMA over a large area for
   multi-channel and multi-layer microfluidic devices with shallow
   high-resolution channel features. The bond process utilises a
   low-temperature vacuum thermal fusion step with prior exposure of the
   substrate to chloroform (CHCl3) vapour to reduce bond temperature to
   below the PMMA glass transition temperature. Peak tensile and shear bond
   strengths > 3 MPa were achieved for a typical channel depth reduction of
   25 A mu m. The device-equivalent bond performance was evaluated for
   multiple layers and high-resolution channel features using double-side
   and single-side exposure of the bonding pieces. A single-sided exposure
   process was achieved which is suited to multi-layer bonding with channel
   alignment at the expense of greater depth loss and a reduction in peak
   bond strength. However, leak and burst tests demonstrate bond integrity
   up to at least 10 bar channel pressure over the full substrate area of
   100 mm x 100 mm. The inclusion of metal tracks within the bond resulted
   in no loss of performance. The vertical wall integrity between channels
   was found to be compromised by solvent permeation for wall thicknesses
   of 100 A mu m which has implications for high-resolution serpentine
   structures. Bond strength is reduced considerably for multi-layer
   patterned substrates where features on each layer are not aligned,
   despite the presence of an intermediate blank substrate. Overall a
   high-performance bond process has been developed that has the potential
   to meet the stringent specifications for lab-on-chip deployment in harsh
   environmental conditions for applications such as deep ocean profiling.}},

Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{15-39}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The overhead imposed by connection-based protocols for high-performance
   computing (HPC) systems can be detrimental to system resource usage and
   performance. This paper demonstrates for the first time a unified
   send/recv and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) Write over datagrams
   design for RDMA-capable network adapters. We previously designed the
   first and only unreliable datagram RDMA model, RDMA Write-Record, and
   demonstrated its superior performance over connection-based RDMA. RDMA
   Write-Record can be applied to several RDMA capable networks, such as
   iWARP and InfiniBand (which does not support unreliable RDMA Writes).
   iWARP is a state-of-the-art, high-speed, connection-based RDMA
   networking technology for both local and wide-area Ethernet networks.
   iWARP is used as the platform to demonstrate our unreliable RDMA
   operation design for both channel and memory semantics. We previously
   outlined the requirements for extending iWARP to operate over datagrams.
   Here we extend our work on commercial datacenter applications by
   providing broadcast support for send/recv. In order to study the
   scalability of datagram-iWARP, we added Message Passing Interface
   support for RDMA Write-Record to investigate the scalability of
   HPC-based scientific applications for both send/recv and RDMA
   Write-Record. The results show that both models outperform their
   connection-based alternatives, providing superior performance and
   scalability in a software prototype. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{To more closely mimic the native cellular microenvironment, 3D scaffolds
   derived from the extracellular matrix (ECM) are being developed as
   alternatives to conventional 2D culture systems. In the present study,
   we established methods to fabricate nonchemically cross-linked 3D porous
   foams derived entirely from decellularized porcine left ventricle (DLV)
   for use as an in vitro cardiac cell culture platform. Furthermore, we
   explored the effects of physically preprocessing the DLV through
   mechanical mincing versus cryomilling, as well as varying the ECM
   concentration on the structure, composition, and physical properties of
   the foams. Our results indicate that the less highly processed minced
   foams had a more cohesive and complex network of ECM components,
   enhanced mechanical properties, and improved stability under simulated
   culturing conditions. To validate the DLV foams, a proof-of-concept
   study was conducted to explore the early cardiomyogenic differentiation
   of pericardial fat adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (pfASCs) on the
   minced DLV foams relative to purified collagen I gel controls.
   Differentiation was induced using a modified cardiomyogenic medium (MCM)
   or through stimulation with 5-azacytidine (5-aza), and cardiomyocyte
   marker expression was characterized by immunohistochemistry and
   real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Our results
   indicate that early markers of cardiomyogenic differentiation were
   significantly enhanced on the DLV foams cultured in MCM, suggesting a
   synergistic effect of the cardiac ECM-derived scaffolds and the culture
   medium on the induction of pfASC differentiation. Furthermore, in
   analyzing the response in the noninduced control groups, the foams were
   observed to provide a mildly inductive microenvironment for pfASC
   cardiomyogenesis, supporting the rationale for using tissue-specific ECM
   as a substrate for cardiac cell culture applications.}},

   analogues, their formulation with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and in vitro
   delivery into Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO-K1) cells. The formulations
   were evaluated against each other based on structural differences in the
   hydrophobic domain and headgroup. Structurally the library is divided
   into four sets based on lipids derived from two 7- or two 11-carbon
   hydrophobic chains, C7 and C11 respectively, which possess either a
   dimethylamine or a trimethylamine derived headgroup. Each set includes
   four cationic lipids based on an acyclic or macrocyclic, saturated or
   unsaturated hydrophobic domain. All lipids were co-formulated with the
   commercial cationic lipid
   1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine (EPC) in a 1:1 molar
   ratio, along with one of two distinct neutral co-lipids, cholesterol or
   1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) in an overall
   cationic-to-neutral lipid molar ratio of 3:2. Binding of lipid
   formulations with DNA, and packing morphology associated with the
   individual lipid-DNA complexes were characterized by gel electrophoresis
   and small angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD), respectively. As a general
   trend, lipoplex formulations based on mismatched binary cationic lipids,
   composed of a shorter C7 lipid and the longer lipid EPC (C14), were
   generally associated with higher transfection efficiency and lower
   cytotoxicity than their more closely matched C11/EPC binary lipid
   formulation counterparts. Furthermore, the cyclic lipids gave
   transfection levels as high as or greater than their acyclic
   counterparts, and formulations with cholesterol exhibited higher
   transfection and lower cytotoxicity than those formulated with DOPE. A
   number of the lipid formulations with cholesterol as co-lipid performed
   as well as, or better than Lipofectamine 2000 (TM) and EPC, the two
   positive controls employed in these studies. These results suggest that
   our novel cyclic and acyclic cationic lipid vectors are effective
   nonviral gene transfer agents that warrant further investigation. (C)

Title = {{Dynamic behaviour of concrete filled FRP tubes subjected to impact
   loading}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{212-225}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Numerous experimental investigations have demonstrated the advantages of
   Concrete Filled FRP Tubes (CFFTs) over reinforced concrete members under
   various loading conditions. None of the studies, however, investigated
   whether these advantages of CFFTs extended to resisting dynamic impact
   loads. This presented a fertile field for investigation as it was well
   known that the addition of the tube confined and protected the concrete
   core and increased its load carrying capacity, and by extension, its
   energy absorption. This investigation aimed at understanding the dynamic
   behaviour of CFFT's under impact loading and to develop a procedure for
   their analysis and design. These aims were achieved by testing six
   specimens, three of which were CFFTs and three were reinforced concrete.
   The specimens were tested in pairs to facilitate comparisons. The first
   pair were tested monotonically to act as a benchmark and tie into
   previous research. The remaining two pairs were tested under impact
   loading. The parameters investigated were the presence of the GFRP tube,
   the internal steel reinforcement ratio, and the input kinetic energy.
   The monotonic tests showed that the addition of the tube increased the
   flexural capacity and maximum displacement by 112\%, which translated
   into a 487.5\% increase in energy absorption, when compared to the
   reinforced concrete counterpart. The addition of the tube increased the
   impact specimens' energy absorbing capacity by 467\% when the steel
   reinforcement ratio was 1.2\% and 1223\% when the steel reinforcement
   ratio was 2.4\%, compared to the reinforced concrete specimens. The GFRP
   tube also protected the concrete core and prevented its spalling and
   crushing during the impact tests. These encouraging experimental results
   led to the development of a nonlinear single degree of freedom (SDOF)
   model capable of capturing the behaviour of the system under multiple
   impacts to be used as a sophisticated analysis and design tool.
   Additionally, a simplified design method based on the conservation of
   energy was outlined. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid EVs are the way forward for green
   transportation and for establishing low-carbon economy. This paper
   presents a split converter-fed four-phase switched reluctance motor
   (SRM) drive to realize flexible integrated charging functions (dc and ac
   sources). The machine is featured with a central-tapped winding node,
   eight stator slots, and six rotor poles (8/6). In the driving mode, the
   developed topology has the same characteristics as the traditional
   asymmetric bridge topology but better fault tolerance. The proposed
   system supports battery energy balance and on-board dc and ac charging.
   When connecting with an ac power grid, the proposed topology has a merit
   of the multilevel converter; the charging current control can be
   achieved by the improved hysteresis control. The energy flow between the
   two batteries is balanced by the hysteresis control based on their
   state-of-charge conditions. Simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink and
   experiments on a 150-W prototype SRM validate the effectiveness of the
   proposed technologies, which may provide a solution to EV charging
   issues associated with significant infrastructure requirements.}},

   layer over roughness}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{780}},
Pages = {{192-214}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The direct numerical simulation of an accelerating boundary layer over a
   rough wall has been carried out to investigate the coupling between the
   effects of roughness and strong free-stream acceleration. While the
   favourable pressure gradient is sufficient to achieve
   quasi-laminarization on a smooth wall, the flow reversion is prevented
   on a rough wall, and a higher friction coefficient, a faster increase of
   turbulence intensity compared to the free-stream velocity and more
   isotropic turbulence near the wall are observed. The logarithmic region
   of the mean-velocity profile presents an initial decrease in slope as in
   the smooth case, but soon recovers, as the fully rough regime is reached
   and a new overlap region is established. A strong coupling between the
   roughness and acceleration effects develops as roughness leads to more
   responsive turbulence and prevents the strong acceleration from
   stabilizing the turbulence, and the acceleration intensifies the
   velocity scale of the wake field (i.e. the near-wall spatial
   heterogeneity of the time-averaged velocity distribution). The combined
   effect is a `rougher' surface as the flow accelerates. In addition, the
   link between the local values of the free stream and the near-wall
   velocity depends on the flow history; this explains the different flow
   responses observed in previous studies, in terms of friction
   coefficient, turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds-stress anisotropy.
   This study elucidates the near-wall flow dynamics, which may be used to
   explain other non-canonical flows over rough walls.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of recovering sparse and compressible signals using

   better model different types of non-Gaussian (bounded) noise, the
   minimization program is subject to a data-fidelity constraint expressed
   as the l(p)(2 <= q < infinity) norm of the residual error. We show
   theoretically that the reconstruction error of this optimization is
   bounded (stable) if the sensing matrix satisfies an extended restricted
   isometry property. Numerical results show that the proposed method,
   which extends the range of and comparing with previous works,
   outperforms other noise-aware basis pursuit programs. For p < 1 since
   the optimization is not convex, we use a variant of an iterative

Abstract = {{Improvements in the structural performance of glulam timber beams by the
   inclusion of reinforcing materials can increase both the service
   performance and ultimate capacity. This paper describes a series of
   four-point bending tests conducted, under service loads and to failure,
   on unreinforced, reinforced and post-tensioned glulam timber beams,
   where the reinforcing tendon used is 12 mm dia. basalt fibre-reinforced
   polymer. The research is designed to evaluate the benefits offered by
   including an active reinforcement in contrast to the passive
   reinforcement typically used within timber strengthening works, in
   addition to establishing the effect that bonding the reinforcing tendon
   has on the material's performance. Further experimental tests have also
   been developed to investigate the long-term implications of this
   research, with emphasis placed upon creep and loss of post-tensioning;
   however, this is ongoing and is not presented in this paper. The
   laboratory investigations establish that the flexural strength and
   stiffness increase for both the unbonded and bonded post-tensioned
   timbers compared to the unreinforced and reinforced beams. Timber that
   is post-tensioned with an unbonded basalt fibre-reinforced polymer
   tendon shows a flexural strength increase of 2.8\% and an increase in
   stiffness of 8.7\%. Post-tensioned beams with a bonded basalt
   fibre-reinforced polymer tendon show increases in flexural strength and

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were modified through a one-step
   1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI)-mediated coupling with
   1-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole (APIm). The CNC-APIm prepared could be
   readily dispersed into carbonated water. Subsequent sparging of N-2 into
   the dispersion gave rise to the formation of aggregates. This
   dispersion/aggregation cycle was reproducible by alternatively sparging
   CO2/N-2 into the CNC-APIm aqueous dispersion, indicating that the
   chemically bonded imidazole groups on the CNC surface were stable and
   could respond to the CO2 stimulus in an effective and repeatable manner.
   Moreover, above certain concentrations (around 5.5-10 mg/ml) the
   CNC-APIm dispersion could be gelled in the presence of N-2 while
   subsequent sparging CO2 could break the gel and regenerate a low
   viscosity CNC-APIm dispersion. This dispersion-gelation conversion was
   reversible by alternatively switching between sparging CO2 and N-2. To
   our knowledge, the present work is the first report of CO2-switchable

Abstract = {{Bilateral teleoperation control systems are designed for guaranteed
   stability against uncertainties in operator and environment dynamics. In
   this paper, we study the effect of human operator dynamics on the
   coupled stability by incorporating the operator dynamics in the
   master-slave network. We will analytically prove and graphically show
   that for any potentially unstable control architecture, as the operator
   minimum damping grows, the teleoperation system can stably tolerate a
   larger range of variations in the environment impedance parameters. More
   importantly, we will demonstrate how the proposed coupled stability
   analysis method can be utilized to design stabilizing controllers for
   enhanced transparency, given a priori knowledge or online estimate of
   human operator damping.}},

Abstract = {{Our elastic viscoplastic self-consistent (EVPSC) model is improved by
   including thermal strain to allow study of the behavior of a Zircaloy-2
   slab under moderately large strains. The approach of introducing thermal
   strain effect is similar to the one developed by Turner et al. (1995)
   and used by Xu et al. (2008a). Various self-consistent schemes (SCSs) of
   the EVPSC model are then evaluated in terms of the deformation behavior
   of the material under different uniaxial strain paths. The material
   parameters for the various models are determined by fitting experimental
   data from uniaxial tension and compression tests along the normal
   direction (ND) and from uniaxial tension tests along the rolling
   direction (RD). The quality of the various SCS predictions is assessed
   based on comparisons of macroscopic deformation behavior (stress-strain
   curves and R-values) and microscopic mechanical response (the evolution
   of lattice strains and texture coefficients) between the predicted and
   experimental data. It is revealed that the Affine and Meff = 0.1
   self-consistent models give much better performance than the Secant and
   Tangent models. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A full-scale (FS) activated sludge system treating wastewater from a
   meat rendering plant with a long history of sludge management problems
   (pin-point flocs; >80\% of floc <50 mu m diameter; poor settling) was
   the focus of a study that entailed characterization of floc properties.
   This was coupled with parallel well-controlled lab-scale (LS) sequencing
   batch reactors (SBRs) treating the same wastewater and operated
   continuously over 1.5 years. Distinct differences in the proportion of
   proteins and polysaccharides associated with extracellular polymeric
   substances (EPS) were observed when comparing the properties of flocs
   from the FS and the LB systems. Further differences in the proportion of
   tightly bound (TB) and loosely bound (LB) fractions of EPS were also
   observed for flocs derived from conditions where differences in settling
   and dewatering properties of flocs occurred (i.e. FS and LS systems). FS
   flocs contained higher levels of EPS along with a higher proportion of
   LB than TB EPS, and possessing characteristics associated with
   non-filamentous bulking (SVI >150 mL/g). Floc formed in the LS system,
   following inoculation from sludge taken from the FS system, was markedly
   larger in size (>70\% of floc >300 mu m diameter), spherical in shape,
   compact and firm, and appeared to be granular in form. Flocs formed in
   the LS system, when an anoxic phase was introduced into the react stage
   of the SBR cycle, were found to be more hydrophobic and contained more
   TB and less loosely bound (LB) EPS when compared to the FS floc. TB-EPS
   contained a greater amount of protein, whereas the polysaccharide
   content of LB-EPS was larger. Protein was predominantly localized in the
   core region of granular flocs where cells were compactly packed. When
   assessing the operating conditions of the FS and LS systems parameters
   that appear to impact the floc properties and the transition to a
   granular form include dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and food to
   microorganism (F/M) ratio. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the finite element simulation of debonding
   failures in FRP-strengthened concrete beams. A key challenge for such
   simulations is that common solution techniques such as the
   Newton-Raphson method and the arc-length method often fail to converge.
   This paper examines the effectiveness of using a dynamic analysis
   approach in such FE simulations, in which debonding failure is treated
   as a dynamic problem and solved using an appropriate time integration
   method. Numerical results are presented to show that an appropriate
   dynamic approach effectively overcomes the convergence problem and
   provides accurate predictions of test results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{An injectable elastin-based gene delivery platform for dose-dependent
   modulation of angiogenesis and inflammation for critical limb ischemia}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{126-139}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Critical limb ischemia is a major clinical problem. Despite rigorous
   treatment regimes, there has been only modest success in reducing the
   rate of amputations in affected patients. Reduced level of blood flow
   and enhanced inflammation are the two major pathophysiological changes
   that occur in the ischemic tissue. The objective of this study was to
   develop a controlled dual gene delivery system capable of delivering
   therapeutic plasmid eNOS and IL-10 in a temporal manner. In order to
   deliver multiple therapeutic genes, an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP)
   based injectable system was designed. The injectable system was
   comprised of hollow spheres and an in situ-forming gel scaffold of
   elastin-like polypeptide capable of carrying gene complexes, with an
   extended manner release profile. In addition, the ELP based injectable
   system was used to deliver human eNOS and IL-10 therapeutic genes in
   vivo. A subcutaneous dose response study showed enhanced blood vessel
   density in the treatment groups of eNOS (20 rig) and IL-10 (10 mu
   g)/eNOS (20 mu g) and reduced inflammation with IL-10 (10 mu g) alone.
   Next, we carried out a hind-limb ischemia model comparing the efficacy
   of the following interventions; Saline; IL-10, eNOS and IL-10/eNOS. The
   selected dose of eNOS, exhibited enhanced angiogenesis. IL-10 treatment
   groups showed reduction in the level of inflammatory cells. Furthermore,
   we demonstrated that eNOS up-regulated major proangiogenic growth
   factors such as vascular endothelial growth factors, platelet derived
   growth factor B, and fibroblast growth factor 1, which may explain the
   mechanism of this approach. These factors help in formation of a stable
   vascular network. Thus, ELF injectable system mediating non-viral
   delivery of human IL10-eNOS is a promising therapy towards treating limb
   ischemia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A novel radial basis function neural network principal component
   analysis scheme for PMU-based wide-area power system monitoring}},
Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{197-205}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A novel model-based principal component analysis (PCA) method is
   proposed in this paper for wide-area power system monitoring, aiming to
   tackle one of the critical drawbacks of the conventional PCA, i.e. the
   incapability to handle non-Gaussian distributed variables. It is a
   significant extension of the original PCA method which has already shown
   to outperform traditional methods like rate-of-change-of-frequency
   (ROCOF). The ROCOF method is quick for processing local information, but
   its threshold is difficult to determine and nuisance tripping may easily
   occur. The proposed model-based PCA method uses a radial basis function
   neural network (RBFNN) model to handle the nonlinearity in the data set
   to solve the no-Gaussian issue, before the PCA method is used for
   islanding detection. To build an effective RBFNN model, this paper first
   uses a fast input selection method to remove insignificant neural
   inputs. Next, a heuristic optimization technique namely
   Teaching-Learning-Based-Optimization (TLBO) is adopted to tune the
   nonlinear parameters in the RBF neurons to build the optimized model.
   The novel RBFNN based PCA monitoring scheme is then employed for
   wide-area monitoring using the residuals between the model outputs and
   the real PMU measurements. Experimental results confirm the efficiency
   and effectiveness of the proposed method in monitoring a suite of
   process variables with different distribution characteristics, showing
   that the proposed RBFNN PCA method is a reliable scheme as an effective
   extension to the linear PCA method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Elucidating the mechanism and active site of the cyclohexanol

Abstract = {{The dehydrogenation of cydohexanol to cyclohexanone is very important in
   the manufacture of nylon. Copper-based catalysts are the most popular
   catalysts for this reaction, and on these catalysts the reaction
   mechanism and active site are in debate. In order to elucidate the
   mechanism and active site of the cyclohexanol dehydrogenation on
   copper-based catalysts, density functional theory with dispersion
   corrections were performed on up to six facets of copper in two
   different oxidation states: monovalent copper and metallic copper. By
   calculating the surface energies of these facets, Cu(111) and Cu2O(111)
   were found to be the most stable facets for metallic copper and for
   monovalent copper, respectively. On these two facets, all the possible
   elementary steps in the dehydrogenation pathway of cyclohexanol were
   calculated, including the adsorption, dehydrogenation, hydrogen coupling
   and desorption. Two different reaction pathways for dehydrogenation were
   considered on both surfaces. It was revealed that the dehydrogenation
   mechanisms are different on these two surfaces: on Cu(111) the hydrogen
   belonging to the hydroxyl is removed first, then the hydrogen belonging
   to the carbon is subtracted, while on Cu2O(111) the hydrogen belonging
   to the carbon is removed followed by the subtraction of the hydrogen in
   the hydroxyl group. Furthermore, by comparing the energy profiles of
   these two surfaces, Cu2O(111) was found to be more active for
   cyclohexanol dehydrogenation than Cu(111). In addition, we found that
   the coordinatively unsaturated copper sites on Cu2O(111) are the
   reaction sites for all the steps. Therefore, the coordinatively
   unsaturated copper site on Cu2O(111) is likely to be the active site for
   cyclohexanol dehydrogenation on the copper-based catalysts. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We analyze the mean-field yrast spectrum of a two-component Bose gas in
   the ring geometry with arbitrary interaction asymmetry. Of particular
   interest is the possibility that the yrast spectrum develops local
   minima at which persistent superfluid flow can occur. By analyzing the
   mean-field energy functional, we show that local minima can be found at
   plane-wave states and arise when the system parameters satisfy certain
   inequalities. We then go on to show that these plane-wave states can be
   yrast states even when the yrast spectrum no longer exhibits a local
   minimum. Finally, we obtain conditions which establish when the
   plane-wave states cease to be yrast states. Specific examples
   illustrating the roles played by the various interaction asymmetries are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of solar-energy-conversion devices depends on the
   absorption region and intensity of the photon collectors. Organic
   chromophores, which have been widely stabilized on inorganic
   semiconductors for light trapping, are limited by the interface between
   the chromophore and semiconductor. Herein we report a novel orange zinc
   germanate (Zn-Ge-O) with a chromophore-like structure, by which the
   absorption region can be dramatically expanded. Structural
   characterizations and theoretical calculations together reveal that the
   origin of visible-light response can be attributed to the unusual
   metallic Ge-Ge bonds which act in a similar way to organic chromophores.
   Benefiting from the enhanced light harvest, the orange Zn-Ge-O
   demonstrates superior capacity for solar-driven hydrogen production.}},

Abstract = {{Mass-to-light versus colour relations (MLCRs), derived from stellar
   population synthesis models, are widely used to estimate galaxy stellar
   masses (M-{*}), yet a detailed investigation of their inherent biases
   and limitations is still lacking. We quantify several potential sources
   of uncertainty, using optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry for a
   representative sample of nearby galaxies from the Virgo cluster. Our
   method for combining multiband photometry with MLCRs yields robust
   stellar masses, while errors in M-{*} decrease as more bands are
   simultaneously considered. The prior assumptions in one's stellar
   population modelling dominate the error budget, creating a
   colour-dependent bias of up to 0.6 dex if NIR fluxes are used (0.3 dex
   otherwise). This matches the systematic errors associated with the
   method of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, indicating that
   MLCRs do not suffer from much additional bias. Moreover, MLCRs and SED
   fitting yield similar degrees of random error (similar to 0.1-0.14 dex)
   when applied to mock galaxies and, on average, equivalent masses for
   real galaxies with M-{*} similar to 10(8-11) M-circle dot. The use of
   integrated photometry introduces additional uncertainty in M-{*}
   measurements, at the level of 0.05-0.07 dex. We argue that using MLCRs,
   instead of time-consuming SED fits, is justified in cases with complex
   model parameter spaces (involving, for instance, multiparameter star
   formation histories) and/or for large data sets. Spatially resolved
   methods for measuring M-{*} should be applied for small sample sizes
   and/or when accuracies less than 0.1 dex are required. An appendix
   provides our MLCR transformations for 10 colour permutations of the
   grizH filter set.}},

   frequency/phase shifter. For a 40 Gb/s DPSK signal, simulation results
   demonstrate that an ADC sampling rate of only 335.94 MSa/s is needed to
   adequately estimate the frequency offset and phase noise, and adjust the
   pump signal accordingly. The cascadability of the 2R regenerator is
   evaluated in recirculating loop simulations for different regenerator

   signals. The influence of residual span dispersion on the performance is

Abstract = {{The three dimensional (3D) printing technology has undergone rapid
   development in the last few years and it is now possible to print
   engineering structures. This paper presents a study of the mechanical
   behavior of 3D printed structures using cementitious powder. Microscopic
   observation reveals that the 3D printed products have a layered
   orthotropic microstructure, in which each layer consists of parallel
   strips. Compression and flexural tests were conducted to determine the
   mechanical propertiesand failure characteristics of such materials. The
   test results confirmed that the 3D printed structures are laminated with
   apparent orthotropy. Based on the experimental results, a stress-strain
   relationship and a failure criterion based on the maximum stress
   criterion for orthotropic materials are proposed for the structures of
   3D printed material. Finally, a finite element analysis was conducted
   for a 3D printed shell structure, which shows that the printing
   direction has a significant influence on the load bearing capacity of
   the structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports an approach by which laboratory based testing and
   numerical modelling can be combined to predict the long term performance
   of a range of concretes exposed to marine environments. Firstly, a
   critical review of the test methods for assessing the chloride
   penetration resistance of concrete is given. The repeatability of the
   different test results is also included. In addition to the test
   methods, a numerical simulation model is used to explore the test data
   further to obtain long-term chloride ingress trends. The combined use of
   testing and modelling is validated with the help of long-term chloride
   ingress data from a North Sea exposure site. In summary, the paper
   outlines a methodology for determining the long term performance of
   concrete in marine environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The oldest members of the Ediacara biota include discoid and frondose
   forms. The fronds have been well described, but little has been done to
   quantify the relationship between the discoid fossils and the discoid
   holdfasts of fronds. Fossil surfaces from the middle Ediacaran of
   southeastern Newfoundland preserve fronds directly attached to their
   discoid holdfasts, along with numerous specimens of the isolated discoid
   fossils Aspidella and Hiemalora of less certain affinities. However,
   most specimens of Aspidella in Newfoundland are known from
   Fermeuse-style preservation of the base of discs, whereas most Mistaken
   Point fronds are known from Conception-style preservation of the tops of
   discs, hindering direct comparison of these fossils. The Discovery
   Surface on Bonavista Peninsula preserves both basal and top views of
   Aspidella-type discs on the same fossil surface, and thus serves as a
   morphological link between these preservational modes and permits
   reconstruction of these circular holdfasts in three-dimensions. We find
   a significant positive correlation between disc size and frond size
   within each frondose species, which is consistent with the purported
   function as holdfasts, tethering the frondose organisms to the seafloor.
   This supports the notion that discoid fossils relatable to Aspidella and
   its junior synonyms, and to Hiemalora, are the holdfasts of frondose
   forms whose petalodia escaped preservation, and not whole organisms or
   microbial colonies as has been suggested by some authors. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We have carried out a study of radio emission from a small sample of
   magnetic O- and B-type stars using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope,
   with the goal of investigating their magnetospheres at low frequencies.
   These are the lowest frequency radio measurements ever obtained of hot
   magnetic stars. The observations were taken at random rotational phases
   in the 1390 and the 610 MHz bands. Out of the eight stars, we detect
   five B-type stars in both the 1390 and the 610 MHz bands. The three
   O-type stars were observed only in the 1390 MHz band, and no detections
   were obtained. We explain this result as a consequence of free-free
   absorption by the free-flowing stellar wind exterior to the confined
   magnetosphere. We also study the variability of individual stars. One
   star - HD 133880 - exhibits remarkably strong and rapid variability of
   its low-frequency flux density. We discuss the possibility of this
   emission being coherent emission as reported for CU Vir by Trigilio et
   al.}},

Title = {{Identifying rock slope failure precursors using LiDAR for transportation

Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{195}},
Pages = {{93-103}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{In the Thompson and Fraser River valleys, rockfall and rothlides are a
   hazard for railway traffic in the region. In June 2013, a 2600 m(3)
   rockslide occurred in the White Canyon, causing damage to infrastructure
   and interruption to service. In the year preceding this failure, the
   slope was monitored using terrestrial Light Detection And Ranging
   (LiDAR) as part of the Railway Ground Hazards Research Program
   initiative. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a hazard management
   strategy for transportation corridors exposed to steep slopes involving
   the identification of rockfall precursors prior to significant slope
   failures. For this failure, deformation was observed in the seven months
   preceding collapse with an accelerating period occurring in the final 28
   days. A distinct pattern of smaller rockfalls was observed around the
   perimeter of the deforming rock block as well as loss of surficial
   material over the slides tension crack. This study shows that with LiDAR
   monitoring, precursors to rock slope failures can be identified allowing
   for better rock slope hazard management by focusing attention on areas
   with the highest probability of failure. Crown Copyright (C) 2015

Journal = {{SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Sepsis is the most frequent cause of death in hospitalized patients, and
   severe sepsis is a leading contributory factor to acute respiratory
   distress syndrome (ARDS). At present, there is no effective treatment
   for these conditions, and care is primarily supportive. Murine sialic
   acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin-E (Siglec-E) and its human
   orthologs Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 are immunomodulatory receptors found
   predominantly on hematopoietic cells. These receptors are important
   negative regulators of acute inflammatory responses and are potential
   targets for the treatment of sepsis and ARDS. We describe a
   Siglec-targeting platform consisting of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)
   nanoparticles decorated with a natural Siglec ligand, di(alpha 2 -> 8)
   N-acetylneuraminic acid (alpha 2,8 NANA-NP). This nanoparticle induced
   enhanced oligomerization of the murine Siglec-E receptor on the surface
   of macrophages, unlike the free alpha 2,8 NANA ligand. Furthermore,
   treatment of murine macrophages with these nanoparticles blocked the
   production of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory cytokines in a
   Siglec-E-dependent manner. The nanoparticles were also therapeutically
   beneficial in vivo in both systemic and pulmonary murine models
   replicating inflammatory features of sepsis and ARDS. Moreover, we
   confirmed the anti-inflammatory effect of these nanoparticles on human
   monocytes and macrophages in vitro and in a human ex vivo lung perfusion
   (EVLP) model of lung injury. We also established that interleukin-10
   (IL-10) induced Siglec-E expression and alpha 2,8 NANA-NP further
   augmented the expression of IL-10. Indeed, the effectiveness of the
   nanoparticle depended on IL-10. Collectively, these results demonstrated
   a therapeutic effect of targeting Siglec receptors with a
   nanoparticle-based platform under inflammatory conditions.}},

Title = {{Using Pb isotopes in surface media to distinguish anthropogenic sources

Abstract = {{The response in elemental concentrations and Pb isotopes in various
   surface media from the Cigar West unconformity-type uranium deposit
   located at a depth of 450 m were measured to ascertain if element
   migration from the deposit can be detected at the surface. The media
   included clay-size fractions separated from the A2, B and C soil
   horizons, and tree cores and twigs from black spruce (Picea mariana) and
   jack pine (Pinus banksiana) trees. Lead isotopes were used to trace any
   effect on the surface media from the deposit at depth because the
   (207)pb/Pb-206 ratios in the ore are < 0.1, whereas the background
   values in the basin are > 0.7 and modern anthropogenic Pb from aerosols
   are near 0.9. The tree cores record their lowest and therefore most
   radiogenic (207)pb/(206)pb ratios of < 0.7 near the surface projection
   of the deposit and associated structures, particularly in tree rings
   that predate any exploration and drilling activity in the area. The
   median Pb-207/Pb-206 ratios increase in the order C, B soil horizon
   clays, tree cores, A2 soil clays and twigs because of the increasing
   contribution of common Pb with high ratios from anthropogenic sources
   that affect the shallowest media the most. Although this anthropogenic
   Pb as well as that from the background dominates the composition of all
   media at the surface and the contribution from the deposit at depth is
   diminished toward the surface, ore -related Pb is still present as a few
   percent of the composition of pathfinder elements and Pb isotopes. (C)

Title = {{Social housing tenants, Climate Change and sustainable living: A study

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Pages = {{35-45}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Despite a focus in the UK on providing sustainable housing in recent
   years, it is unlikely that targets set to reduce resource consumption in
   housing will be achieved without a greater focus on human behaviour. It
   is necessary to understand the actions of people occupying dwellings, as
   it is invariably the occupants rather than the buildings that decided
   whether or not to consume resources.
   In this paper the authors present a pilot study where 53 social housing
   tenant households in Northern Ireland were interviewed to ascertain
   their perceptions of Climate Change, their current behaviours and their
   willingness to reduce energy and water consumption in the home. The
   intention was to explore links between perceptions and reported
   behaviour as well as perceptions and willingness to reduce resource
   consumption.
   Results show that 77\% of tenants believed Climate Change to be an
   important issue; 57\% accepted that it is up to the individual to take
   responsibility for tackling Climate Change; and demonstrated a strong
   desire to make a difference to reduce their impact. The researchers
   identified both passive (devices) and active (behaviours) resource
   savings currently in place and established where further resource
   reduction was feasible based on tenants' willingness to alter their
   behaviours. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{505-522}},

Abstract = {{A series of linear controlled rheology polypropylenes were produced
   through reaction with dicumyl peroxide in the melt state, to investigate
   the effect of molecular weight and viscosity on foaming. Foaming
   experiments by compression molding, using a chemical blowing agent
   (azodicarbonamide), and by batch foaming using nitrogen-blowing agent,
   revealed that lower viscosity promoted higher expansion ratios and
   larger cells, due to reduced resistance to cell growth. Linear
   polypropylene was further modified using trimethylolpropane
   trimethacrylate and triallyl trimesate coagents. Coagent modification
   resulted in pronounced changes in the shear thinning and elasticity of
   the modified polypropylenes. However, evidence of long-chain branching
   was only present in polypropylene modified by triallyl trimesate. Foams
   based on coagent-modified polypropylenes had higher expansion ratios
   than their degraded counterparts. This was ascribed in part to the lower
   viscosities, and to a nucleating effect, arising from the presence of a
   finely dispersed phase of coagent-rich nanoparticles. Strain hardening
   in polypropylenes modified by triallyl trimesate further resulted in a
   finer cell structure, due to suppressed coalescence.}},

Abstract = {{We present a mathematically rigorous iso-Quality-of-Service (QoS) metric
   which relates the achievable quality of service (QoS) for a real-time
   analytics service with workload specific and use case specific
   performance and output quality requirements to the energy cost of
   offering the service by different server architectures. Using a new
   iso-QoS evaluation methodology, we scale server resources to meet QoS
   targets and directly rank the servers in terms of their
   energy-efficiency and by extension cost of ownership. Our metric and
   method are platform-independent and enable fair comparison of datacenter
   compute servers with significant architectural diversity, including
   micro-servers. We deploy our metric and methodology to compare three
   servers running financial option pricing workloads on real-life market
   data. We find that server ranking is sensitive to data inputs and
   desired QoS level and that although scale-out micro-servers can be up to
   two times more energy-efficient than conventional heavyweight servers
   for the same target QoS, they are still six times less energy efficient
   than high-performance computational accelerators.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach for global detection of seismic damage in a single-storey
   steel concentrically braced frame (CBF) structure is presented. The
   filtered lateral in-plane acceleration response of the CBF structure is
   integrated twice to provide the lateral in-plane displacement that is
   used to infer buckling and yielding damage. The level of interstorey
   drift of the CBF during a seismic excitation allows the yield and
   buckling of the bracing members to be identified and indirectly detects
   damage based on exceedance of calculated lateral in-plane displacement
   limits. A band-pass filter removes noise from the acceleration signal
   followed by baseline correction being used to reduce the drift in
   velocity and displacement during numerical integration. This
   pre-processing results in reliable numerical integration of the frame
   acceleration that predicts the displacement response accurately when
   compared to the measured lateral displacement of the CBF structure.
   Importantly, the structural damage is not assumed through removal of
   bracing members, rather damage is induced through actual seismic
   loading. The buckling and yielding displacement threshold limits used to
   identify damage are demonstrated to identify accurately the initiation
   of buckling and yielding.}},

Abstract = {{For over 50 years bridge plugs and cement have been used for well
   abandonment, work over, and are still the material of choice. However
   the failures of cement abandonments using bridge plugs has been reported
   on many occasions, some of which have resulted in fatal consequences. A
   new patented product is designed to address the shortcomings associated
   with using bridge plugs and cement. The new developed tools use an alloy
   based on bismuth that is melted in situ using Thermite reaction. The
   tool uses the expansion properties of bismuth to seal the well. Testing
   the new technology in real held under more than 2 km deep sea water can
   be expensive. Virtual simulation of the new device under simulated
   thermal and mechanical environment can be achieved using nonlinear
   finite element method to validate the product and reduce cost.
   Experimental testing in the lab is performed to measure heat generated
   due to thermite reaction. Then, a sequential thermal mechanical
   explicit/implicit finite element solver is used to simulate the device
   under both testing lab and deep water conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Gravel aquifers act as important potable water sources in central
   western Europe, yet they are subject to numerous contamination
   pressures. Compositional and textural heterogeneity makes protection
   zone delineation around groundwater supplies in these units challenging;
   artificial tracer testing aids characterization. This paper reappraises
   previous tracer test results in light of new geological and
   microbiological data. Comparative passive gradient testing, using a
   fluorescent solute (Uranine), virus (H40/1 bacteriophage), and
   comparably sized bacterial tracers Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas
   putida, was used to investigate a calcareous gravel aquifer's ability to
   remove microbiological contaminants at a test site near Munich, Germany.
   Test results revealed E. coli relative recoveries could exceed those of
   H40/1 at monitoring wells, 10 m and 20 m from an injection well, by
   almost four times; P. putida recoveries varied by a factor of up to
   three between wells. Application of filtration theory suggested greater
   attenuation of H40/1 relative to similarly charged E. coli occurred due
   to differences in microorganism size, while estimated collision
   efficiencies appeared comparable. By contrast, more positively charged
   P. putida experienced greater attenuation at one monitoring point, while
   lower attenuation rates at the second location indicated the influence
   of geochemical heterogeneity. Test findings proved consistent with
   observations from nearby fresh outcrops that suggested thin open
   framework gravel beds dominated mass transport in the aquifer, while
   discrete intervals containing stained clasts reflect localized
   geochemical heterogeneity. Study results highlight the utility of
   reconciling outcrop observations with artificial tracer test responses,
   using microbiological tracers with well-defined properties, to
   characterize aquifer heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first part of the observations made for the Continuum
   Halos in Nearby Galaxies, an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES) project. The aim of
   the CHANG-ES project is to study and characterize the nature of radio
   halos, their prevalence as well as their magnetic fields, and the cosmic
   rays illuminating these fields. This paper reports observations with the
   compact D configuration of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) for
   the sample of 35 nearby edge-on galaxies of CHANG-ES. With the new wide
   bandwidth capabilities of the VLA, an unprecedented sensitivity was
   achieved for all polarization products. The beam resolution is an
   average of 9 `'.6 and 36 `' with noise levels reaching approximately 6
   and 30 mu Jy beam(-1) for C-and L-bands, respectively (robust
   weighting). We present intensity maps in these two frequency bands (C
   and L), with different weightings, as well as spectral index maps,
   polarization maps, and new measurements of star formation rates (SFRs).
   The data products described herein are available to the public in the
   CHANG-ES data release available at http://www.queensu.ca/changes. We
   also present evidence of a trend among galaxies with larger halos having
   higher SFR surface density, and we show, for the first time, a radio
   continuum image of the median galaxy, taking advantage of the collective
   signal-to-noise ratio of 30 of our galaxies. This image shows clearly
   that a ``typical{''} spiral galaxy is surrounded by a halo of magnetic
   fields and cosmic rays.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies of the mechanical properties of tendons in the upper
   limb have used embalmed specimens or sub-optimal methods of measurement.
   The aim of this study was to determine the biomechanical properties of
   all tendons from five fresh frozen cadaveric forearms using updated
   methodology. The cross-sectional area of tendons was accurately measured
   using a laser reflectance system. Tensile testing was done in a
   precision servo-hydraulic device with cryo-clamp fixation. We determined
   that the cross-sectional area of some tendons is variable and directly
   influences the calculated material properties; visual estimation of this
   is unreliable. Data trends illustrate that digital extensor tendons
   possess the greatest tensile strength and a higher Young's modulus than
   other tendon types.}},

Abstract = {{Exquisitely preserved and well-exposed rocky paleoshoreline omission
   surfaces in Lower Silurian Chicotte Formation limestones on Anticosti
   Island, Quebec, are interpreted to be the product of combined marine and
   meteoric diagenesis. The different omission features include: 1) planar
   erosional bedding tops, 2) scalloped erosional surfaces, 3) knobs,
   ridges, and swales at bedding contacts, and 4) paleoscarps. An
   interpretation is proposed that relates specific styles of omission
   surface to different diagenetic-depositional processes that acted in
   separate terrestrial-peritidal-shallow neritic zones. Such processes
   were linked to fluctuations in relative sea level with specific zones of
   diagenesis such as: 1) karst corrosion, 2) peritidal-shallow subtidal
   erosion, 3) subtidal seawater flushing and cementation, and 4) shallow
   subtidal deposition. Most surfaces are interpreted to have been the
   result of initial extensive shallow-water synsedimentary lithification
   forming hardgrounds that were, as sea level fell, planed by
   inner-neritic abrasion, successively altered by exposure and subaerial
   corrosion, only to be buried by sediments as sea level rose again. This
   succession was repeated several times, resulting in a suite of recurring
   polyphase omission surfaces through many meters of stratigraphic
   section. Synsedimentary cloudy marine cements are well preserved and are
   thus interpreted to have been calcitic originally. Aragonite components
   are rare and thought to have been dissolved just below the Silurian
   seafloor. Large mollusks that survived such seafloor removal were
   nonetheless leached and the resultant megamolds were filled with
   synsedimentary calcite cement. These Silurian inner-neritic-strandline
   omission surfaces are temporally unique. They are part of a suite of
   marine omission surfaces that are mostly found in early to middle
   Paleozoic neritic carbonate sedimentary rocks. These karsted hardgrounds
   formed during a calcite-sea time of elevated marine carbonate saturation
   and extensive precipitation of marine cement. The contemporaneous
   greenhouse atmosphere was supercharged with CO2, leading to profound
   surface karst under strongly acid rain. Younger peritidal omission
   surfaces, although potentially formed during aragonite-sea or
   calcite-sea times, would have been subject to very different terrestrial
   diagenetic process with lower atmospheric pCO(2) values but increasingly
   complex biogenic soils producing dissimilar alteration features.}},

Title = {{Extruding plastic pipe from eccentric dies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{223}},
Pages = {{176-199}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{To solidify plastic pipe, the pipe is transported through a long cooling
   chamber. Inside this chamber, inside the pipe, the plastic remains
   molten, and this inner surface solidifies last. The flow due to the
   self-weight of the molten plastic then causes the product to thicken on
   bottom (and to thin on top). This is why plastic pipe is normally
   extruded from an eccentric die, and specifically, from a die where the
   mandrel (also called centerpiece (Kolitawong and Giacomin, 2001) or core
   (Jones, 1964)) is decentered downward. This paper focuses on the
   consequences of this decentering in eccentric cylindrical coordinates.
   Specifically, when the molten polymer is viscoelastic, as is normally
   the case, a downward lateral force, F-x, is exerted on the mandrel. The
   die eccentricity also affects the positive axial force on the mandrel,
   F-z. These forces govern how rigidly the mandrel must be attached
   (normally, on a spider die, by eight bolts). We use the method of Jones
   (1964), called polymer process partitioning, designed for the Oldroyd
   8-constant constitutive model. We produce a method for estimating F-x
   and F-z. We also obtain an expression for the shape of the extruded
   pipe, whose thickness scales with average velocity at each angular
   positions < v(z)>(theta), by integrating the velocity profile, v(z)(xi,
   theta) through the thickness of the eccentric annulus (with respect to
   xi). We further include expressions for the stresses in the extruded
   polymer melt. These expressions can be used to estimate the upper-bound
   for the stress that is frozen into the outermost layer of the plastic
   pipe (since this layer is quenched first, shortly after extrusion). We
   include detailed dimensional worked examples to help process engineers
   with their pipe die designs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Near-inertial (Poincare) waves with a period T-p similar to 17 h are the
   dominant wind-induced internal wave motions in central Lake Erie and
   consequently have a substantial influence on lake circulation, mixing
   and biogeochemistry. However, due to the complex three-basin bathymetry
   in Lake Erie, the vertical and horizontal modal structure of these waves
   remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyze field data to show
   wind events energize frequent vertical mode-one Poincare waves. The
   horizontal modal structure was also investigated, in a sensitivity
   analysis, using a calibrated three-dimensional hydrodynamic transport
   model forced with observed and idealized spatially uniform wind events.
   Strong horizontal mode-one Poincare wave cells form in both the Central
   and Eastern Basins when wind events have a duration of 0.25 T-p to 0.5
   T-p, are impulsive and periodic at T-p, or have anticyclonic rotation
   with a duration of T-p. Momentum transfer from longer wind events (> 0.5
   Tp) will oppose the Coriolis-force rotated currents and damp Poincare
   wave generation. In agreement with theory, the most efficient wind
   events are observed and computationally modeled to have a duration of
   0.25 T-p; causing an excitation peak at similar to 0.4 T-p and
   converting similar to 0.8\% of the wind energy input to Poincare waves.
   The efficiency of wind work in generating Poincare wave kinetic energy
   is given by (1-cos (2 pi f t)) t(-1), where f is the inertial frequency
   and t is the wind duration. Therefore, the efficiency peaks during each
   nT(p) period, where n is a non-negative integer, and decreases
   significantly for longer wind events.}},

Abstract = {{Permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous machines (PMSMs) can provide excellent
   performance in terms of torque density, energy efficiency, and
   controllability. However, PMs on the rotor are prone to centrifugal
   force, which may break their physical integrity, particularly at
   high-speed operation. Typically, PMs are bound with carbon fiber or
   retained by alloy sleeves on the rotor surface. This paper is concerned
   with the design of a rotor retaining sleeve for a 1.12-MW 18-kr/min PM
   machine; its electromagnetic performance is investigated by the 2-D
   finite-element method (FEM). Theoretical and numerical analyses of the
   rotor stress are carried out. For the carbon fiber protective measure,
   the stresses of three PM configurations and three pole filler materials
   are compared in terms of operating temperature, rotor speed, retaining
   sleeve thickness, and interference fit. Then, a new hybrid protective
   measure is proposed and analyzed by the 2-D FEM for operational speeds
   up to 22 kr/min (1.2 times the rated speed). The rotor losses and
   machine temperatures with the carbon fiber retaining sleeve and the
   hybrid retaining sleeve are compared, and the sleeve design is refined.
   Two rotors using both designs are prototyped and experimentally tested
   to validate the effectiveness of the developed techniques for PM
   machines. The developed retaining sleeve makes it possible to operate
   megawatt PM machines at high speeds of 22 kr/min. This opens doors for
   many high-power high-speed applications such as turbogenerator,
   aerospace, and submarine motor drives.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for speech enhancement based on a
   dictionary learning method. The proposed approach is based on using
   coherence measure in dictionary learning. Data required for better
   fitting to atoms in sparse representation of noise is provided by a
   noise estimation algorithm that causes noise dictionary to be trained
   with the same data size as speech signal. To decrease coherence between
   dictionaries after the training step, a new method is applied to yield
   incoherent dictionaries. In sparse representation of speech data, the
   highest energy atoms of noise dictionary are replaced with the lowest
   energy atoms, under certain conditions. A similar replacement can happen
   in sparse representation of noise data. Furthermore, in this paper, only
   one noise dictionary, chosen by a classification method, is used in
   speech enhancement step, resulting in a faster algorithm. Objective and
   subjective measures are used for evaluating the simulation results.
   According to experimental results, the proposed algorithm has been found
   superior in performance and computation overhead in comparison with the
   earlier methods in this context. Moreover, this method achieves
   significantly better results compared with baseline methods such as
   multi-band and geometric spectral subtraction.}},

Abstract = {{Transparent synthetic soils have been developed as a soil surrogate to
   enable internal visualization of geotechnical processes in physical
   models. Transparency of the soil dictates the overarching success of the
   technique; however, despite this fundamental requirement, no
   quantitative framework has yet been established to appraise the visual
   quality of transparent soil. Previous approaches to assess and optimize
   transparency quality included an eye chart assessment method, although
   this approach is highly subjective and operator-dependent. In this
   paper, an independent method for quantitatively assessing the optical
   quality of transparent soil is proposed based on the optical calibration
   method, Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). The work explores this
   hypothesis and assesses the potential for MTF to quantify the optical
   quality of transparent soils for a number of aspects including (i)
   optimum oil blend ratio, (ii) depth of viewing plane, and (iii)
   temperature. The results confirmed that MTF offers a robust and reliable
   method to provide an independent quantitative measure of the optical
   quality of transparent soil. The impact of reduced soil transparency and
   the ability to track speckle patterns-thus accuracy and precision of
   displacement measurement-was correlated with MTF to evaluate the
   permissible viewing depth of transparent soil.}},

Abstract = {{Heat transport in the geosphere is important in applications of
   geothermal energy systems, thermal remediation technologies, and design
   of energy foundations. The study of these applications would benefit
   significantly from the ability to collect temperature data from within
   the porous media system, and at high spatial and temporal resolutions.
   Temperature measurements made using conventional probes have high
   temporal resolution but are limited in their spatial resolution.
   Higher-resolution methods, such as thermal imaging, are limited to
   measurements of an exposed face of an experiment. This paper presents
   the development of a technique for measuring temperature using
   transparent soil. In typical transparent soil, the refractive indices of
   the soil particles and the pore fluid are matched, creating invisible
   soil particles when saturated. However, because the refractive indices
   of the soil particles and pore fluid are different functions of
   temperature, the degree of transparency decreases as the temperature
   increases or decreases from the transparency temperature. As such,
   changes in transparency are detected by digital photographs and can be
   calibrated and used to measure temperature. This paper presents
   relationships between temperature and normalized pixel intensity for two
   oil-fused silica combinations. One combination used an oil mixture with
   a transparency temperature of 25 degrees C and the other, which was
   constructed using one of the oils in the mixture, has a transparency
   temperature of 4 degrees C. The results show that there must be at least
   a 10 degrees C differential from the transparency temperature to ensure
   a linear relationship between temperature and normalized pixel
   intensity. The capabilities of transparent soil constructed with the
   second oil are displayed in two laboratory experiments, which provide
   direct comparisons between transparent soil, conventional temperature
   probes, and thermal imaging. The results show the transparent soil
   provides reliable temperature fields across the experimental domain at
   high spatial and temporal resolutions.}},

Abstract = {{Android is currently one of the most popular smartphone operating
   systems. However, Android has the largest share of global mobile malware
   and significant public attention has been brought to the security issues
   of Android. In this paper, we investigate the use of a clone detector to
   identify known Android malware. We collect a set of Android applications
   known to contain malware and a set of benign applications. We extract
   the Java source code from the binary code of the applications and use
   NiCad, a near-miss clone detector, to find the classes of clones in a
   small subset of the malicious applications. We then use these clone
   classes as a signature to find similar source files in the rest of the
   malicious applications. The benign collection is used as a control
   group. In our evaluation, we successfully decompile more than 1 000
   malicious apps in 19 malware families. Our results show that using a
   small portion of malicious applications as a training set can detect
   95\% of previously known malware with very low false positives and high
   accuracy at 96.88\%. Our method can effectively and reliably pinpoint
   malicious applications that belong to certain malware families.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Electrical charges originate at most solid surfaces in contact with
   aqueous electrolytes which result in the formation of an electrical
   double layer. If an external electric field is tangentially applied to
   the double layer, an electroosmotic flow is induced which can be
   employed for various applications such as microfluidic pumps. Here,
   highly porous materials are especially suitable since they generate
   significant flow rates along with high pump pressures. The models which
   are currently used to describe the electroosmotic flow through porous
   substrates are based on the so-called parallel capillary flow model. In
   terms of packed beds of granular materials, these models have the
   disadvantages of oversimplifying the geometry to tortuous capillaries
   while neglecting intra- and inter-pore connections, varying pore
   cross-sectional geometries as well as the influence of the packed bed
   walls. In the current research, we employ dimensional reasoning
   (Buckingham theorem) to derive a phenomenological model which relates
   the electroosmotic flow to the averaged parameters of the packed bed as
   well as to the relevant physicochemical parameters. A comprehensive set
   of experiments is carried out to infer a semiempirical correlation which
   can be universally applied to packed beds of arbitrary granular
   materials. Additionally, we derive a dynamic model of the center-of-mass
   motion of the fluidic parts of the experimental setup. The model allows
   for an evaluation of the influence of Joule heating without monitoring
   the temperature in the bed.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the overall catalytic activity trend for rational catalyst
   design is one of the core goals in heterogeneous catalysis. In the past
   two decades, the development of density functional theory (DFT) and
   surface kinetics make it feasible to theoretically evaluate and predict
   the catalytic activity variation of catalysts within a descriptor-based
   framework. Thereinto, the concept of the volcano curve, which reveals
   the general activity trend, usually constitutes the basic foundation of
   catalyst screening. However, although it is a widely accepted concept in
   heterogeneous catalysis, its origin lacks a clear physical picture and
   definite interpretation. Herein, starting with a brief review of the
   development of the catalyst screening framework, we use a two-step
   kinetic model to refine and clarify the origin of the volcano curve with
   a full analytical analysis by integrating the surface kinetics and the
   results of first-principles calculations. It is mathematically
   demonstrated that the volcano curve is an essential property in
   catalysis, which results from the self-poisoning effect accompanying the
   catalytic adsorption process. Specifically, when adsorption is strong,
   it is the rapid decrease of surface free sites rather than the
   augmentation of energy barriers that inhibits the overall reaction rate
   and results in the volcano curve. Some interesting points and
   implications in assisting catalyst screening are also discussed based on
   the kinetic derivation. Moreover, recent applications of the volcano
   curve for catalyst design in two important photoelectrocatalytic
   processes (the hydrogen evolution reaction and dye-sensitized solar
   cells) are also briefly discussed. (C) 2015, Dalian Institute of

Abstract = {{The bottom boundary layer in lakes lies directly above the sediments and
   influences both hydrodynamic processes and biogeochemical fluxes.
   Several parameter-based models have been developed to predict the
   boundary layer characteristics, but the relative accuracy and
   applicability of these models remains under investigated, particularly
   for the Great Lakes. Here, high-resolution velocity and temperature data
   were analyzed to characterize temporal variations in the thicknesses of
   bottom mixed layer and logarithmic layer in central Lake Erie. We
   considered both weakly and strongly stratified periods, when these
   layers were primarily forced by surface seiches and near-inertial waves,
   respectively. Existing equations to predict the height of the bottom
   mixed layer (h(mix)) were calibrated and evaluated using the observed
   hmix, the bed-shear velocity, and the local Brunt-Vaisala frequency at
   the top of h(mix). We found that h(max) = 1.8u./f (1 +
   N-o(2)/f(2))(1/4), where u. is the shear velocity and f and N-o are the
   inertial and the local Brunt-Vaisala frequencies, respectively. The
   logarithmic layer height was also delineated using fit results from
   classical and modified law-of-the-wall equations. The fitting results
   were validated by comparison of the shear velocities to independent
   results from the structure function method. Stratification was shown to
   have negligible effect on the shear stresses within the log layer;
   however, the stratification term was required, at times, to describe the
   observed velocity profile for heights >1.5 m above the bed. Overall, our
   results show the thickness of logarithmic layer is a poor predictor for
   h(mix) in Lake Erie. (C) 2015 International Association for Great Lakes

Abstract = {{The food web structure of the largest lake in northwest Patagonia, Lake
   Nahuel Huapi (area 557 km(2)), was investigated. Fish, benthic
   macroinvertebrates, plankton and primary producers were analyzed for
   stable nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) isotopes in three
   sites with contrasting morphometry and environmental characteristics.
   delta N-15 and delta C-13 revealed a similar food web structure between
   basins but with distinct isotopic baselines. The SIAR (Stable Isotope
   Analysis in R) mixing model was used to study potential food sources
   (benthic or pelagic) for adult fish. Results indicated that energy flow
   to fish from both habitats is different for each site and species, and
   does not depend on the basin morphometry. An ontogenetic shift in the
   carbon source and trophic level was observed in some of the fish
   species, revealing a coupling between the pelagic and bentho-littoral
   habitats of the lake. Our findings complement the existing literature on
   trophic interactions between introduced and native fish, and provide
   novel information on plankton composition, food web structure and energy
   flow in a large lake of North Patagonia that can be extrapolated to
   other understudied lakes in the area. (C) 2015 International Association

Abstract = {{In this study, a comparison of different methods to predict drug-polymer
   solubility was carried out on binary systems consisting of five model
   drugs (paracetamol, chloramphenicol, celecoxib, indomethacin, and
   felodipine) and polyvinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymers (PVP/VA)
   of different monomer weight ratios. The drug-polymer solubility at 25
   degrees C was predicted using the Flory-Huggins model, from data
   obtained at elevated temperature using thermal analysis methods based on
   the recrystallization of a supersaturated amorphous solid dispersion and
   two variations of the melting point depression method. These predictions
   were compared with the solubility in the low molecular weight liquid
   analogues of the PVP/VA copolymer (N-vinylpyrrolidone and vinyl
   acetate). The predicted solubilities at 25 degrees C varied considerably
   depending on the method used. However, the three thermal analysis
   methods ranked the predicted solubilities in the same order, except for
   the felodipine-PVP system. Furthermore, the magnitude of the predicted
   solubilities from the recrystallization method and melting point
   depression method correlated well with the estimates based on the
   solubility in the liquid analogues, which suggests that this method can
   be used as an initial screening tool if a liquid analogue is available.
   The leamings of this important comparative study provided general
   guidance for the selection of the most suitable method(s) for the
   screening of drug-polymer solubility.}},

Abstract = {{Chatter marks on the surface of a rolled steel strip may seriously
   affect the final product quality. It is still difficult to discover the
   generation mechanism of chatter marks and develop an effective method to
   identify chatter marks. In this paper a rolling force fluctuation model
   is proposed based on the variation of the rolling force between the
   forward and backward skid area. A dynamic model coupling vertical and
   horizontal vibrations is also established to analyze the vibration
   characteristics of a Sendzimir twenty-high cold roll mill based on the
   rolling force fluctuation model. Good agreement between the simulated
   results and the experimental results verifies the effectiveness of the
   established models. Furthermore, various rolling forces and rolling
   speeds are taken into consideration in analyzing the vibration
   characteristics. The proposed models provide clear theoretical support
   for better comprehension of the mechanism of chatter mark generation.

Abstract = {{Square tabs were placed on the base of an ellipsoidal center-body (CB)
   in short annular diffusers. Tests were conducted in subsonic swirling
   flow with an inlet Reynolds number of 1 x 10(5). The tabs, with a
   projected height equivalent to the boundary layer thickness, reduced the
   outlet distortion and incurred a pressure penalty in the three smaller
   diffusers whose designs were not expected to stall. The largest area
   ratio (AR = 6.18) diffuser improved back pressure coefficient 4.6\% with
   four tabs that blocked 4.7\% of the inlet cross section over its bare
   diffuser but was 42\% lower than that obtained by the AR = 2.73 diffuser
   with no tabs. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was useful for
   capturing relevant flow features that corroborated with experimental
   data and literature. Tabs oriented normal to the diffuser axis were less
   effective at influencing the flow as swirl angle increased but similar
   elongated wakes oriented with the flow direction were observed at all
   simulated swirl angles. The CFD either predicted equivalent performance
   due to the over-prediction associated with diffusion equaling the
   under-prediction associated with vorticity or over-predicted
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Digital image correlation (DIC) is an image-processing technique that
   calculates fields of incremental displacement by comparing two digital
   images and locating numerous small regions in both images to high
   subpixel accuracy. This technique is particularly well suited to the
   visualization of geotechnical failure processes such as the plastic
   collapse of a shallow foundation or the evolution of failure within a
   physical model landslide as it can yield full-field displacements at
   high spatial and temporal resolution. The adoption of digital image
   correlation methods by the geotechnical engineering community over the
   past 15 years has therefore provided researchers with a transformative
   tool for the visualization of failure mechanisms and the quantification
   of soil and soil-structure interaction behaviour within physical model
   experiments. The objective of this Canadian Geotechnical Colloquium is
   to provide an updated review of the factors that affect accuracy and
   precision of the technique and to highlight selected recent advances and
   emerging uses of DIC in geotechnical engineering applications with
   particular emphasis on geotechnical physical modelling and field
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{An augmented form of Petri net, referred to as a choice-point net, that
   can capture timing and probability constraints is introduced.
   Choice-point nets were developed to model health-care protocols, in
   which the events or actions taken by health-care professionals,
   institutions and patients occur either at prespecified times or after a
   prespecified lapse of time. Furthermore, actions that occur and
   decisions that are made in health-care protocols occur with some
   probability and not with certainty and so choice-point nets also possess
   a mechanism for modeling probabilistic choice. In this data structure,
   timing is associated with event-based transitions that may fire multiple
   times to simulate the same event occurring several times in parallel.
   Events may result in several possible outcomes, or choices, each of
   which has a probability of occurrence. A choice-point net may be scaled
   without requiring structural changes to the model and may be analyzed by
   unravelling it into a finite-state automaton representing (perhaps
   portions of) the behavior of the system. Questions related to
   health-care protocols can be translated into the mathematical language
   of the net. Recursive algorithms have been developed to determine
   answers to such questions.}},

Abstract = {{A two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) actuator capable of producing linear
   translation, rotary motion, or helical motion would be a desirable asset
   to the fields of machine tools, robotics, and various apparatuses. In
   this paper, a novel 2-DOF split-stator induction motor was proposed and
   electromagnetic structure parameters of themotor were designed and
   optimized. The feature of the direct-drive 2-DOF induction motor lies in
   its solid mover arrangement. In order to study the complex distribution
   of the eddy current field on the ferromagnetic cylinder mover and the
   motor's operating characteristics, the mathematical model of the
   proposed motor was established, and characteristics of the motor were
   analyzed by adopting the permeation depth method (PDM) and finite
   elementmethod (FEM). The analytical and numerical results from motor
   simulation clearly show a correlation between the PDM and FEM models.
   This may be considered as a fair justification for the proposed machine
   and design tools.}},

   Three-Phase Switched Reluctance Motors}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Switched reluctance motors (SRMs) are gaining in popularity because of
   their robustness, low cost, and excellent high-speed characteristics.
   However, they are known to cause vibration and noise primarily due to
   the radial pulsating force resulting from their double-saliency
   structure. This paper investigates the effect of skewing the stator
   and/or rotor on the vibration reduction of the three-phase SRMs by
   developing four 12/8-pole SRMs, including a conventional SRM, a skewed
   rotor-SRM (SR-SRM), a skewed stator-SRM (SS-SRM), and a skewed stator
   and rotor-SRM (SSR-SRM). The radial force distributed on the stator yoke
   under different skewing angles is extensively studied by the
   finite-element method and experimental tests on the four prototypes. The
   inductance and torque characteristics of the four motors are also
   compared, and a control strategy by modulating the turn-ON and turn-OFF
   angles for the SR-SRM and the SS-SRM are also presented. Furthermore,
   experimental results validate the numerical models and the effectiveness
   of the skewing in reducing the motor vibration. Test results also
   suggest that skewing the stator is more effective than skewing the rotor
   in the SRMs.}},

Abstract = {{When molten plastic is extruded, the upper limiting throughput is often
   dictated by fine irregular distortions of the extrudate surface. Called
   sharkskin melt fracture, plastics engineers spike plastics formulations
   with processing aids to suppress these distortions. Sharkskin melt
   fracture is not to be confused with gross melt fracture, a larger scale
   distortion arising at throughputs higher than the critical throughput
   for sharkskin melt fracture. Sharkskin melt fracture has been attributed
   to a breakdown of the no slip boundary condition in the extrusion die,
   that is, adhesive failure at the die walls, where the fluid moves with
   respect to the wall. In this article, we account for the frictional
   heating at the wall, which we call slip heating. We focus on slit flow,
   which is used in film casting, sheet extrusion, curtain coating, and
   when curvature can be neglected, slit flow is easily extended to pipe
   extrusion and film blowing. In slit flow, the magnitude of the heat flux
   from the slipping interface is the product of the shear stress and the
   slip speed. We present the solutions for the temperature rise in
   pressure-driven slit flow and simple shearing flow, each subject to
   constant heat generation at the adhesive slip interface, with and
   without viscous dissipation in the bulk fluid. We solve the energy
   equation in Cartesian coordinates for the temperature rise, for steady
   temperature profiles. For this simplest relevant nonisothermal model, we
   neglect convective heat transfer in the melt and use a constant
   viscosity. We arrive at a necessary dimensionless condition for the
   accurate use of our results: Pe<<1. We find that slip heating can raise
   the melt temperature significantly, as can viscous dissipation in the
   bulk. We conclude with two worked examples showing the relevance of slip
   heating in determining wall temperature rise, and we show how to correct
   wall slip data for this temperature rise. POLYM. ENG. SCI.,

Abstract = {{The Paleoproterozoic Roraima Supergroup is a siliciclastic succession
   exposed in Guyana, Venezuela and Brazil that filled the extensive
   Roraima Basin on the Amazon Craton. Sequence stratigraphy, mineral
   geochemistry, and geochronology are integrated to understand the
   evolution of the basin within the tectonic framework of the Amazon
   Craton, and fluid flow events to evaluate its uranium resource
   potential.
   Three depositional sequences comprise the Roraima Supergroup in Guyana.
   These are bounded by laterally extensive sequence boundaries, marking
   both fluvial incision and source area uplift, followed by aggradation
   and basin subsidence. The Roraima Supergroup experienced at least three
   major fluid events following deposition, associated with: (1) early
   burial (1820 Ma); (2) metasomatism during intrusion of the Avanavero
   Suite mafic sills (1799 +/- 9 Ma to 1779 +/- 10 Ma); and 3) late burial
   diagenesis (1756 +/- 5 Ma to 1723 +/- 10 Ma). The events are identified
   based on petrography, (207)pb/(206)pb and Ar-40/Ar-39 ages of
   fluorapatite and white mica, and the isotopic compositions of H, C, O,
   and Sr in white mica and calcite.
   Despite having multiple characteristics indicating that it could host
   unconformity-related U deposits, the Roraima Basin suffered extensive
   permeability loss during early burial and then with Avanavero Suite
   intrusion. As a result, the probability that high-grade
   unconformity-related U deposits formed in the study area is unlikely.

Abstract = {{An automotive cross car beam supports instrument panels including the
   heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system, the knee airbags, the
   steering-column and steering-wheel system and the central console.
   Avoiding resonant frequencies and improving driving comfort are major
   performance requirements in the design of a cross car beam. Because of
   the nature of mass production in the automotive industry, the
   consideration of manufacturability is important, and the current
   practice in the industry does grant detailed information on the
   steering-column and steering-wheel system to the cross car beam
   designer. The objective of this paper is to perform a complete topology,
   size and shape optimization of a cross car beam by using a lightweight
   material, by considering two practical manufacturing processes
   (extrusion and casting) and by assuming a realistic situation where only
   limited information on the steering-column and steering-wheel system is
   available to the cross car beam designer. First, a simplified finite
   element model of the steering-column and steering-wheel system was
   developed, and it was calibrated using optimization such that the
   important behaviour of the simplified finite element model agrees with
   that of the real steering-column and steering-wheel system. Topology
   optimization was performed to determine the optimal material
   distribution for the parts that connect the steering-column and
   steering-wheel system and the cross car beam. Then a geometry
   reinterpretation of the favourable topology result was performed to
   address the concerns from the viewpoints of the cost and the
   manufacturability. A sensitivity study was conducted subsequently to
   determine the size optimization design variables with significant
   effects on the frequency performance. Finally, size and shape
   optimization were performed together to optimize further the details of
   the cross car beam structure. The weight of the optimal aluminium design
   was reduced by nearly 40\% compared with the steel design while the
   important performance requirements are met.}},

Abstract = {{A conventional offline single-stage light-emitting diode (LED) driver
   with a high power factor usually produces a significant

   cancellation method to remove the twice-line-frequency voltage ripple
   for an offline single-stage LED driver with a power factor correction.
   Consequently, a dc LED current can be produced to achieve flicker-free
   LED driving performance. At the same time, the required storage
   capacitor for the proposed LED driver can be greatly reduced, and the
   circuit implementation to achieve ripple cancellation is simple. Thus,
   the overall cost of the proposed LED driver is low. The proposed LED
   driver also features high efficiency because of its power structure. A

Abstract = {{Energy-efficient residential lighting such as household light-emitting
   diode (LED) lamps with ac input require an ac/dc converter (or driver)
   with large output capacitance to minimize the low frequency LED current
   ripple. The energy storage capacitor used in the conventional ac/dc LED
   driver is usually an electrolytic capacitor due to its low cost and high
   energy density. However, the average lifetime of an electrolytic
   capacitor is at least 2-3 times less than that of an LED device. Hence,
   the potential lifetime of the LED lamp is significantly affected by the
   presence of the electrolytic capacitor in the driver circuit. In this
   paper, two novel isolated single-switch ac/dc high power factor LED
   drivers without using any electrolytic capacitors are proposed. In the
   proposed circuits, the energy storage capacitor is moved to the
   rectifier side, with a three-winding transformer used to provide
   isolation; input power factor correction as well as to store and provide
   the required energy to the output. As a result, the energy storage
   capacitance is significantly reduced, which allows film capacitor to be
   used to replace the conventionally used electrolytic capacitors. The
   circuit's operating principles and its characteristics are described in
   this paper. Simulation and experimental results are given on a 120
   V-rms, 12 W prototype to confirm that a power factor of at least 0.96 is
   achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional topologies for high-power LED drivers with high power
   factors (PFs) require large capacitances to limit the low frequency (100
   or 120 Hz) LED current ripples. Electrolytic capacitors are commonly
   used because they are the only capacitors with sufficient energy density
   to accommodate high-power applications. However, the short life span of
   electrolytic capacitors significantly reduces the life span of the
   entire LED lighting fixture, which is undesirable. This paper proposes a
   bipolar (ac) ripple cancellation method with two different full-bridge
   power structures to cancel the low-frequency ac ripple in the LED
   current and minimize the output capacitance requirement, enabling the
   use of long-life film capacitors. Compared with the existing
   technologies, the proposed circuit achieves zero double-line-frequency
   current ripple through LED lamps and achieves a high PF and high
   efficiency. A 100-W (150 V/0.7 A) LED driver prototype was built which
   demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve the same
   double-line-frequency LED current ripple with only 44-mu F film
   capacitors, compared with the 4700-mu F electrolytic capacitors required
   in the conventional single-stage LED drivers. Meanwhile, the proposed
   prototype has achieved a peak power efficiency of 92.5\%, benefiting

Abstract = {{Conventional single-stage light-emitting diode (LED) drivers with a high
   power factor (PF) contain a significant LED current ripple at twice the
   ac line frequency, and would require large energy storage capacitors to
   limit the effect on LED light. Conventional designs and novel control
   techniques aim to power LED loads with a dc voltage to ensure a limited
   low-frequency LED current ripple. This paper proposes an average current
   modulation method that is designed to operate in conjunction with
   single-stage PF correction (PFC) circuits that contain significant ac
   voltage ripple, while maintaining zero low-frequency current ripple.
   This allows the energy storage capacitance of the PFC stage to be
   reduced, avoiding the need for electrolytic-type capacitors and
   prolonging the life of the LED driver. The average current modulation
   circuit requires a single low-voltage MOSFET, a current sense resistor,
   and a simple control circuit. By requiring no additional magnetic
   components, the cost of the current modulation circuit is very low and
   has minimal impact on the efficiency of the overall LED driver. Two
   experimental prototypes, an 8.75-W system with a buck-boost PFC
   converter and a 25-W system with a flyback PFC converter, have been
   built to verify the capability and excellent performance of the proposed

Title = {{Effect of implant geometry on range of motion in reverse shoulder
   arthroplasty assessed using glenohumeral separation distance}},

Abstract = {{Background: Whereas reverse shoulder arthroplasty has been successful in
   treating patients with cuff tear arthropathy, implant impingement after
   the procedure often causes complications, including reduced range of
   motion, bone loss, and instability. Attempts to simulate this problem in
   vitro typically rely on subjective visual methods to detect impingement.
   The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of humeral
   neck-shaft angle, implant diameter, humeral cup depth, and glenoid
   component eccentricity on minimum abduction angle and range of motion
   using an implant-tracking method for impingement detection.
   Methods: Tests were performed in a kinematic shoulder simulator with
   actuated cables representing the deltoid. The humerus was manually
   adducted and abducted past the point of impingement in either direction.
   Centers of the implant components were tracked with optical motion
   capture and processed with a thresholding algorithm to determine the
   minimum abduction angle where impingement occurred.
   Results: Humeral cup depth had the largest effect on minimum abduction
   angle and range of motion, with a retentive cup reducing range of motion
   by 26 degrees. A decreased neck-shaft angle reduced minimum abduction
   angle by 10 degrees but had little effect on overall range of motion.
   Diameter and eccentricity had little effect.
   Conclusion: A reduced neck-shaft angle reduces minimum abduction angle
   but does not improve overall range of motion. A more retentive humeral
   cup increases minimum abduction angle significantly. Although retentive
   cups are intended to improve joint stability, the reduced range of
   motion that they impart to the joint may partly counteract the benefits
   of increased constraint. (C) 2015 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery

Abstract = {{The former Sherritt-Gordon sulfide deposit in Sherridon, Manitoba,
   Canada, was mined for zinc, copper, silver, and gold between 1930 and
   1951. Since mine closure, two high-sulfide tailings impoundments
   underwent extensive oxidation, resulting in the release of very high
   concentrations of dissolved sulfate and metals to the tailings
   porewater. During precipitation events and Spring freshet, surface seeps
   develop along the flanks of the impoundments, discharging groundwater
   with a pH as low as 0.39 and dissolved concentrations of sulfate and
   iron up to 203 g L-1 and 68 g L-1, respectively, along with other metals
   at elevated concentrations. Several efflorescent minerals were observed
   within groundwater-seepage areas. Using a combination of powder X-ray
   diffraction and energy-dispersive spectroscopy, secondary efflorescent
   sulfate minerals at seepage zones were identified, including
   melanterite, rozenite, halotrichite, chalcanthite, alpersite, copiapite,
   hexahydrite, jurbanite, pickeringite, jarosite, and gypsum. According to
   geochemical modeling of seepage waters using a modified WATEQ4F database
   for ferrous and ferric sulfate minerals, the occurrence of most of the
   observed sulfate salts was favored. In the geochemical modeling, we used
   data available for seepage waters that were representative of
   discharging water after mineral precipitation had already occurred.
   Discrepancies between some of the observed and modeled results likely
   reflect the use of water compositions representative of the later stages
   in the reaction sequence rather than the composition during actual
   formation of the minerals. The formation of these secondary efflorescent
   minerals resulted in a temporary removal of sulfate and metals from
   solution. These minerals rapidly dissolved during laboratory dissolution
   tests; this would result in increased loading to receiving surface
   waters during precipitation events and Spring freshet.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the beneficial influence of compressive membrane
   action in fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforced in-plane restrained
   slabs in bridge deck slabs and the improved service performance when
   arching action occurs. Bridge deck slabs that are exposed to extreme
   environmental conditions can experience severe corrosion damage.
   Expansive corrosion in steel reinforcement significantly reduces the
   design life and durability of concrete structures; for example, on one
   short section of the M1 in Northern Ireland, nearly 1 pound million was
   spent last year on the maintenance and repair of bridges due to
   corrosion. Corrosion-resistant composite reinforcement such as basalt
   fibre reinforced polymer (BFRP) and glass fibre reinforced polymer
   (GFRP) provides a durable alternative to reinforcing steel. In this
   research, two BFRP reinforced slabs and two GFRP reinforced slabs were
   constructed using high-strength concrete with a target cube compressive
   strength of 65 N/mm(2). The slabs represented typical full-scale
   dimensions of a real bridge deck slab 475 mm wide by 1425 mm long and
   150 mm deep. The service and ultimate behaviour of the slabs are
   discussed and the results are compared with the relevant design
   guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{Elemental concentrations and stable isotopic compositions of 41
   sweeteners (syrups, honeys, and sugars) and 43 edible oils were
   determined to evaluate their potential as parameters for food
   authentication. The addition of as little as 10\% of corn syrup to pure
   maple syrup can be detected using molar ratios of Na/(Na + K) and Na/(Na
   + Ca) for maple syrups. The detection of more than 15\% adulterant in
   maple syrup and honey is also possible due to the 13\% difference in
   carbon isotopic composition of C3 plants for authentic honeys and maple
   syrups (25.1 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand) relative to the carbon isotopic
   composition of C4 plants for corn syrups and cane sugars (-11.4 +/- 0.8
   parts per thousand) as major adulterant agents. Nearly constant net
   oxygen (1.028 +/- 0.002) as well as hydrogen (0.974 +/- 0.005) isotope
   fractionation factors between honeys and average local meteoric waters
   from two areas, Kingston and Costa Rica, suggests that these isotope
   ratios of honeys are good candidates to authenticate their geographic
   locations. The net oxygen (1.03 +/- 0.001) as well as hydrogen (0.894
   +/- 0.003) isotope fractionation factors between olive oils and local
   meteoric waters from different parts of Italy suggests that these
   isotope ratios are independent of the oil processing method and
   therefore can be used to trace geographic locations. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An automated solar reactor system was designed and built to carry out
   catalytic pyrolysis of scrap rubber tires at 550 degrees C. To maximize
   solar energy concentration, a two degrees-of-freedom automated sun
   tracking system was developed and implemented. Both the azimuth and
   zenith angles were controlled via feedback from six photo-resistors
   positioned on a Fresnel lens. The pyrolysis of rubber tires was tested
   with the presence of two types of acidic catalysts, H-beta and H-USY.
   Additionally, a photoactive TiO2 catalyst was used and the products were
   compared in terms of gas yields and composition. The catalysts were
   characterized by BET analysis and the pyrolysis gases and liquids were
   analyzed using GC-MS. The oil and gas yields were relatively high with
   the highest gas yield reaching 32.8\% with H-beta catalyst while TiO2
   gave the same results as thermal pyrolysis without any catalyst. In the
   presence of zeolites, the dominant gasoline-like components in the gas
   were propene and cyclobutene. The TiO2 and non-catalytic experiments
   produced a gas containing gasoline-like products of mainly isoprene
   (76.4\% and 88.4\% respectively). As for the liquids they were composed
   of numerous components spread over a wide distribution of C-10 to C-29
   hydrocarbons of naphthalene and cyclohexane/ene derivatives. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for online determination of the

   of the effects of changes in system side is carried out on a simple
   two-bus system to gain an insight of the effect of system side changes
   on the estimated Thevenin equivalent parameters. The proposed method
   uses voltage and current magnitudes as well as active and reactive
   powers; thus avoiding the effect of phase angle drift of the PMU and the
   need to synchronize measurements at different instances to the same
   reference. Applying the method to the IEEE 30-bus test system has shown
   its ability to correctly determine the Thevenin equivalent even in the

Journal = {{GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{The Sokoman Formation is a ca. 100-m-thick succession of interbedded
   iron formation and fine-grained siliciclastics deposited at 1.88 Ga.
   Accumulation occurred on a dynamic paleoshelf where oxygen
   stratification, coastal upwelling of hydrothermally derived Fe and Si,
   microbial processes, tide and storm currents, diagenesis, and low-grade
   prehnite-pumpellyite metamorphism controlled lithofacies character and
   produced complex associations of multigenerational chert, hematite,
   magnetite, greenalite, stilpnomelane and Fe carbonate. Hematite-rich
   facies were deposited along suboxic segments of the coastline where
   photosynthetic oxygen oases impinged on the seafloor. Hematitic,
   cross-stratified grainstones were formed by winnowing and reworking of
   freshly precipitated Fe-(oxyhydr) oxide and opal-A by waves and currents
   into subaqueous dunes. Magnetite-rich facies contain varying proportions
   of greenalite and stilpnomelane and record deposition in anoxic middle
   shelf environments beneath an oxygen chemocline. Minor negative Ce
   anomalies in hematitic facies, but prominent positive Ce and Eu
   anomalies and high LREE/HREE ratios in magnetite-rich facies imply the
   existence of a weakly oxygenated surface ocean above anoxic bottom
   waters.
   The Fe isotopic composition of 31 whole rock (-0.46 < delta Fe-56 <=
   0.47 parts per thousand) and 21 magnetite samples (-0.29 <= delta Fe-56
   <= 0.22 parts per thousand) from suboxic and anoxic lithofacies was
   controlled primarily by the physical oceanography of the paleoshelf.
   Despite low-grade metamorphism recorded by the delta O-18 values of
   paragenetically related quartz and magnetite, the Sokoman Formation
   preserves a robust primary Fe isotopic signal. Coastal upwelling is
   interpreted to have affected the isotopic equilibria between Fe-aq(2+)
   and Fe-(oxyhydr) oxide in open marine versus coastal environments, which
   controlled the Fe isotopic composition of lithofacies. Unlike previous
   work that focuses on microbial and abiotic fractionation processes with
   little regard for paleoenvironment, our work demonstrates that
   depositional setting is paramount in governing the Fe isotopic
   composition of iron formations irrespective of what Fe-bearing minerals
   precipitated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The increasingly popular disrupted Langmuir adsorption (DLA) kinetic
   model of photocatalysis does not contain an explicit function for the
   dependence of rate on the irradiance, rho, but instead has a term alpha
   p(theta), where, alpha is a constant of the system, and theta is also a
   constant equal to 1 or 0.5 at low or high rho values, respectively.
   Several groups have recently replaced the latter term with an explicit
   function of the form chi(1)(-1 + (1 + chi(2)rho)(1/2)), where chi(1) and
   chi(2), are constants that can be related to a proposed reaction scheme.
   Here the latter schemes are investigated, and revised to create a more
   credible form by assuming an additional hole trapping step. The latter
   may be the oxidation of water or a surface saturated with O-2(-).
   Importantly, this revision suggests that it is only applicable for low
   quantum yield/efficiency processes. The revised disrupted Langmuir
   adsorption model is used to provide good fits to the kinetic data
   reported for a number of different systems including the photocatal-ytic
   oxidation of nitric oxide (NO), phenol (PhOH), and formic acid (FA).}},

Abstract = {{Entanglement between two qubits (two level atoms) mediated by surface
   plasmons in three-dimensional plasmonic waveguides is studied using a
   quantum master equation formalism. Two types of waveguides, a nanowire
   and a V-shaped channel cut in a flat metal plane, are considered. The
   Green functions for the waveguides, which rigorously describes the
   dissipative qubit environment, are calculated numerically using a direct
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solution of Maxwell's equations.
   Finite-length effects are shown to play a crucial role in enhancing
   entanglement, and resonant-length plasmonic waveguides can provide
   higher entanglement between qubits than infinite-length waveguides. It
   is also shown that coupling slots can improve entanglement via stronger
   qubit-waveguide coupling, for both the infinite-and finite-waveguide
   cases. The formalism used in the paper can be applied to a wide range of
   plasmonic waveguides. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{A counterintuitive scheme to produce ultracold hydrogen via
   fragmentation of laser cooled diatomic hydrides is presented where the
   final atomic H temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the
   molecular parent. In addition, the critical density for formation of a
   Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at a fixed temperature is reduced by a
   factor (m(H) /m(MH))(3/2) over directly cooled hydrogen atoms. The
   narrow Feshbach resonances between a S-1(0) atom and hydrogen are well
   suited to a tiny center of mass energy release necessary during
   fragmentation. With the support of ab initio quantum chemistry, it is
   demonstrated that BaH is an ideal diatomic precursor that can be laser
   cooled to a Doppler temperature of similar to 26 mu K with just two
   rovibronic transitions, the simplest molecular cooling scheme identified
   to date. Preparation of a hydrogen atom gas below the critical BEC
   temperature T-c is feasible with present cooling technology, with
   optical pulse control of the condensation process.}},

Abstract = {{We have observed the Virgo Cluster spiral galaxy, NGC 4845, at 1.6 and 6
   GHz using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, as part of the Continuum
   Halos in Nearby Galaxies-an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES). The source consists
   of a bright unresolved core with a surrounding weak central disk (1.8
   kpc diameter). The core is variable over the 6 month timescale of the
   CHANG-ES data and has increased by a factor of approximate to 6 since
   1995. The wide bandwidths of CHANG-ES have allowed us to determine the
   spectral evolution of this core, which peaks between 1.6 and 6 GHz (it
   is a Gigahertz-peaked spectrum source). We show that the spectral
   turnover is dominated by synchrotron self-absorption and that the
   spectral evolution can be explained by adiabatic expansion (outflow),
   likely in the form of a jet or cone. The CHANG-ES observations
   serendipitously overlap in time with the hard X-ray light curve obtained
   by Nikolajuk \& Walter (2013), which they interpret as due to a tidal
   disruption event (TDE) of a super-Jupiter mass object around a 10(5)
   M-circle dot black hole. We outline a standard jet model, provide an
   explanation for the observed circular polarization, and quantitatively
   suggest a link between the peak radio and peak X-ray emission via
   inverse Compton upscattering of the photons emitted by the relativistic
   electrons. We predict that it should be possible to resolve a young
   radio jet via VLBI as a result of this nearby TDE.}},

Title = {{Growing the gas-giant planets by the gradual accumulation of pebbles}},
Journal = {{NATURE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{7565}},
Pages = {{322+}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{It is widely held that the first step in forming gas-giant planets, such
   as Jupiter and Saturn, was the production of solid `cores' each with a
   mass roughly ten times that of the Earth1,2. Getting the cores to form
   before the solar nebula dissipates (in about one to ten million years;
   ref. 3) has been a major challenge for planet formation models(4,5).
   Recently models have emerged in which `pebbles'
   (centimetre-to-metre-sized objects) are first concentrated by
   aerodynamic drag and then gravitationally collapse to form objects 100
   to 1,000 kilometres in size(6-9). These `planetesimals' can then
   efficiently accrete left-over pebbles(10) and directly form the cores of
   giant planets(11,12). This model is known as `pebble accretion';
   theoretically, it can produce cores of ten Earth masses in only a few
   thousand years(11,13). Unfortunately, full simulations of this
   process(13) show that, rather than creating a few such cores, it
   produces a population of hundreds of Earth-mass objects that are
   inconsistent with the structure of the Solar System. Here we report that
   this difficulty can be overcome if pebbles form slowly enough to allow
   the planetesimals to gravitationally interact with one another. In this
   situation, the largest planetesimals have time to scatter their smaller
   siblings out of the disk of pebbles, thereby stifling their growth. Our
   models show that, for a large and physically reasonable region of
   parameter space, this typically leads to the formation of one to four
   gas giants between 5 and 15 astronomical units from the Sun, in
   agreement with the observed structure of the Solar System.}},

Abstract = {{Partnership working is nowadays a seemingly ubiquitous aspect of the
   management and delivery of public services, yet there remain major
   differences of opinion about how they best work for the different
   stakeholders they involve. The balances between mandate and trust, and
   between hard and soft power, are crucial to current debates about public
   service partnerships. This paper explores the example of social housing
   procurement in Northern Ireland, and the requirement to form mandated
   procurement groups. The research shows that the exercise of hierarchical
   power is still important in network governance; that mandated
   partnerships alter the balance between trust and power in partnership
   working, but the impact is uneven; and that these relationships are
   (re)shaping the hybrid' identity of housing associations. The balance
   between accountability for public resources and the independence of
   third sector organisations is the key tension in mandated partnerships.
   The Northern Ireland experience suggests that trust-based networks could
   provide more productive working relationships in partnerships for
   service delivery.}},

Abstract = {{The bond formation between an oxide surface and oxygen, which is of
   importance for numerous surface reactions including catalytic reactions,
   is investigated within the framework of hybrid density functional theory
   that includes nonlocal Fock exchange. We show that there exists a linear
   correlation between the adsorption energies of oxygen on LaMO3 (M =
   Sc-Cu) surfaces obtained using a hybrid functional (e.g.,
   Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof) and those obtained using a semilocal density
   functional (e.g., Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof) through the magnetic
   properties of the bulk phase as determined with a hybrid functional. The
   energetics of the spin-polarized surfaces follows the same trend as
   corresponding bulk systems, which can be treated at a much lower
   computational cost. The difference in adsorption energy due to magnetism
   is linearly correlated to the magnetization energy of bulk, that is, the
   energy difference between the spin-polarized and the non-spin-polarized
   solutions. Hence, one can estimate the correction to the adsorption
   energy as obtained from a semilocal functional directly from the bulk
   magnetization energy from a hybrid functional.}},

   of the non-doped Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 sample. As the Pr loading increases,
   the saturation magnetization, remnant magnetization and coercivity
   increase and reach the maximum at x = 0.05 and then decrease. The
   maximum values of these parameters are 67.0 emu/g, 9.7 emu/g and 87.2

Abstract = {{The advancement of telemetry control for the water industry has
   increased the difficulty of managing large volumes of nuisance alarms
   (i.e., alarms that do not require a response). The aim of this study was
   to identify and reduce the number of nuisance alarms that occur for
   Northern Ireland (NI) Water by carrying out alarm duration analysis to
   determine the appropriate length of persistence (an advanced alarm
   management tool) that could be applied. All data were extracted from
   TelemWeb (NI Water's telemetry monitoring system) and analyzed in Excel.
   Over a 6-week period, an average of 40 000 alarms occurred per week. The
   alarm duration analysis, which has never been implemented before by NI
   Water, found that an average of 57\% of NI Water alarms had a duration
   of,5 minutes. Applying 5-minute persistence, therefore, could prevent an
   average 26 816 nuisance alarms per week. Most of these alarms were from
   wastewater assets.}},

Title = {{Numerical study of joint behaviour for top-seat flange cleat connection

Abstract = {{The use of cold-formed steel for primary load bearing members in low and
   medium rise buildings has become an increasingly popular form of
   construction. The design of connections between these members is crucial
   to the overall structural integrity of such buildings. However, for
   beam-to-column joint design, recent codes of practice show ambiguity in
   the mechanical behaviour. Further research is required to investigate
   the strength, stiffness and ductility prediction of such connections.
   This paper addresses these concerns by proposing simplified formulas for
   the moment-rotation behaviour of light steel frames with bolted top-seat
   flange cleat joints. A finite element study is presented which is
   validated against laboratory experimental tests on cold-formed steel
   arrangements. The validated model is used within a parametrical study to
   investigate several additional geometrical parameters that are not
   included in the experimental works. An exponential equation has been
   proposed for large deformation of top-seat flange cleat joint under
   monotonic vertical load. The predictions using the equations are
   compared to the design codes (BS EN1993-1-8) and experimental data. From
   the comparison, the proposed equation can improve the BS EN1993-1-8
   prediction from 168.08\% difference, compared to experimental results,
   to 7.09\% difference. The new proposed model gives a safe design for
   top-seat flange cleat joint in cold-formed steel light frame
   construction. (C) 2015 Sharif University of Technology. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report 23 magnetic field measurements of the B3IV star
   HD23478: 12 obtained from high-resolution Stokes V spectra using the
   ESPaDOnS (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope) and Narval (Telescope Bernard
   Lyot) spectropolarimeters, and 11 from medium-resolution Stokes V
   spectra obtained with the DimaPol spectropolarimeter (Dominion
   Astronomical Observatory). HD23478 was one of two rapidly rotating stars
   identified as potential `centrifugal magnetosphere' hosts based on IR
   observations from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution
   Experiment survey. We derive basic physical properties of this star
   including its mass (M = 6.1(-0.7)(+0.8) M-circle dot), effective
   temperature (T-eff = 20 +/- 2 kK), radius (R = 2.7+(+1.6)(-0.9) R-circle
   dot), and age (tau(age) = 3(-1)(+37) Myr). We repeatedly detect weakly
   variable Zeeman signatures in metal, He, and H lines in all our
   observations corresponding to a longitudinal magnetic field of < B-z >
   approximate to -2.0 kG. The rotational period is inferred from Hipparcos
   photometry (P-rot = 1.0498(4) d). Under the assumption of the Oblique
   Rotator Model, our observations yield a surface dipole magnetic field of
   strength B-d >= 9.5 kG that is approximately aligned with the stellar
   rotation axis. We confirm the presence of strong and broad H alpha
   emission and gauge the volume of this star's centrifugal magnetosphere
   to be consistent with those of other H alpha emitting centrifugal
   magnetosphere stars based on the large inferred Alfven to Kepler radius
   ratio.}},

Abstract = {{The initial success of the Rigidly Rotating Magnetosphere (RRM) model
   application to the B2Vp star sigma Ori E by Townsend, Owocki \& Groote
   triggered a renewed era of observational monitoring of this archetypal
   object. We utilize high-resolution spectropolarimetry and the magnetic
   Doppler imaging (MDI) technique to simultaneously determine the magnetic
   configuration, which is predominately dipolar, with a polar strength B-d
   = 7.3-7.8 kG and a smaller non-axisymmetric quadrupolar contribution, as
   well as the surface distribution of abundance of He, Fe, C, and Si. We
   describe a revised RRM model that now accepts an arbitrary surface
   magnetic field configuration, with the field topology from the MDI
   models used as input. The resulting synthetic Ha emission and broad-band
   photometric observations generally agree with observations, however,
   several features are poorly fit. To explore the possibility of a
   photospheric contribution to the observed photometric variability, the
   MDI abundance maps were used to compute a synthetic photospheric light
   curve to determine the effect of the surface inhomogeneities. Including
   the computed photospheric brightness modulation fails to improve the
   agreement between the observed and computed photometry. We conclude that
   the discrepancies cannot be explained as an effect of inhomogeneous
   surface abundance. Analysis of the UV light variability shows good
   agreement between observed variability and computed light curves,
   supporting the accuracy of the photospheric light variation calculation.
   We thus conclude that significant additional physics is necessary for
   the RRM model to acceptably reproduce observations of not only sigma Ori
   E, but also other similar stars with significant stellar wind-magnetic
   field interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Modifications of local structure at atomic level could precisely and
   effectively tune the capacity of materials, enabling enhancement in the
   catalytic activity. Here we modulate the local atomic structure of a
   classical but inert transition metal oxide, tungsten trioxide, to be an
   efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution in acidic water, which
   has shown promise as an alternative to platinum. Structural analyses and
   theoretical calculations together indicate that the origin of the
   enhanced activity could be attributed to the tailored electronic
   structure by means of the local atomic structure modulations. We
   anticipate that suitable structure modulations might be applied on other
   transition metal oxides to meet the optimal thermodynamic and kinetic
   requirements, which may pave the way to unlock the potential of other
   promising candidates as cost-effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen
   evolution in industry.}},

Title = {{Effect of decellularized adipose tissue particle size and cell density

   hydrogels}},

Abstract = {{An injectable composite scaffold incorporating decellularized adipose
   tissue (DAT) as a bioactive matrix within a hydrogel phase capable of in
   situ polymerization would be advantageous for adipose-derived stem cell
   (ASC) delivery in the filling of small or irregular soft tissue defects.
   Building on previous work, the current study investigates DAT milling
   methods and the effects of DAT particle size and cell seeding density on
   the response of human ASCs encapsulated in photo-cross-linkable
   methacrylated chondroitin sulphate (MCS)-DAT composite hydrogels. DAT
   particles were generated by milling lyophilized DAT and the particle
   size was controlled through the processing conditions with the goal of
   developing composite scaffolds with a tissue-specific 3D
   microenvironment tuned to enhance adipogenesis. ASC proliferation and
   adipogenic differentiation were assessed in vitro in scaffolds
   incorporating small (average diameter of 38 +/- 6 mu m) or large
   (average diameter of 278 +/- 3 mu m) DAT particles in comparison to MCS
   controls over a period of up to 21 d. Adipogenic differentiation was
   enhanced in the composites incorporating the smaller DAT particles and
   seeded at the higher density of 5 x 10(5) ASCs/scaffold, as measured by
   glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) enzyme activity,
   semi-quantitative analysis of perilipin expression and oil red O
   staining of intracellular lipid accumulation. Overall, this study
   demonstrates that decellularized tissue particle size can impact stem
   cell differentiation through cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions,
   providing relevant insight towards the rational design of composite
   biomaterial scaffolds for adipose tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{The delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of brachiopod shell calcite are
   commonly used as proxies for ancient environmental marine conditions and
   secular changes in ancient ocean chemistry. The variability of delta
   O-18 and delta C-13 across modern shelf settings is, however, not well
   documented. This study presents delta O-18 and delta C-13 data from 407
   Holocene (< 5000 yr BP) and living brachiopods collected from 220 sites
   across similar to 3000 km along Australia's southern shelf, the largest
   cool- water carbonate shelf in the modern world. Significant isotopic
   variability is present in separate specimens, at individual sites, and
   across the entire region. Individual specimens analyzed at multiple
   shell positions have an isotopic range of values up to 1.3 parts per
   thousand and 1.9 parts per thousand for delta O-18 and delta C-13
   respectively. Multiple brachiopods at a single site have values that
   vary as much as 2.1 parts per thousand for delta O-18 and 1.8 parts per
   thousand for delta C-13. Regional variability ranges on the order of 3.6
   parts per thousand and 3.4 parts per thousand, for delta O-18 and delta
   C-13 respectively. The distribution of intrasite variability can be
   divided into areas of high and low variability. Areas characterized by
   low variability occur in zones of relatively consistent shelf water
   conditions. High- variability zones usually correspond to areas of
   seasonal upwelling onto the shelf, and this aspect is interpreted to be
   the main cause of isotopic variability. Upwelling waters are cold,
   leading to higher delta O-18 values, and are commonly rich in respired
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and nutrients, promoting active
   phytoplankton growth and leading to variable delta C-13 values. The
   extensive spatial coverage across this vast latitude- parallel region
   provides a valuable baseline illustrating the isotopic range that could
   occur in a single layer in the rock record. Furthermore, changes in
   isotopic signatures measured across stratigraphy might not necessarily
   reflect secular changes in ocean chemistry but, instead, could be
   recording local changes in shelf circulation and upwelling intensity.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{It is crucial to develop a catalyst made of earth-abundant elements
   highly active for a complete oxidation of methane at a relatively low
   temperature. NiCo2O4 consisting of earth-abundant elements which can
   completely oxidize methane in the temperature range of 350-550 degrees
   C. Being a cost-effective catalyst, NiCo2O4 exhibits activity higher
   than precious-metal-based catalysts. Here we report that the higher
   catalytic activity at the relatively low temperature results from the
   integration of nickel cations, cobalt cations and surface lattice oxygen
   atoms/oxygen vacancies at the atomic scale. In situ studies of complete
   oxidation of methane on NiCo2O4 and theoretical simulations show that
   methane dissociates to methyl on nickel cations and then couple with
   surface lattice oxygen atoms to form -CH3O with a following
   dehydrogenation to -CH2O; a following oxidative dehydrogenation forms
   CHO; CHO is transformed to product molecules through two different
   sub-pathways including dehydrogenation of OCHO and CO oxidation.}},

Title = {{Multi loop robust H-infinity control design based on the dynamic PLS
   approach to chemical processes}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{518-529}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a multiloop robust control strategy is proposed based on
   H-infinity control and a partial least squares (PLS) model (H
   infinity-PLS) for multivariable chemical processes. It is developed
   especially for multivariable systems in ill-conditioned plants and
   non-square systems. The advantage of PLS is to extract the strongest
   relationship between the input and the output variables in the reduced
   space of the latent variable model rather than in the original space of
   the highly dimensional variables. Without conventional decouplers, the
   dynamic PLS framework automatically decomposes the MIMO process into
   multiple single-loop systems in the PLS subspace so that the controller
   design can be simplified. Since plant/model mismatch is almost
   inevitable in practical applications, to enhance the robustness Of this
   control system, the controllers based on the H-infinity mixed
   sensitivity problem are designed in the PLS latent subspace. The
   feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed approach are
   illustrated by the simulation results of a distillation column and a
   mixing tank process. Comparisons between H infinity-PLS control and
   conventional individual control (either H-infinity control or PLS
   control only) are also made. (C) 2015 The Institution of Chemical

Abstract = {{Radio-frequency (RF) impairments, which intimately exist in wireless
   communication systems, can severely limit the performance of
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Although we can resort to
   compensation schemes to mitigate some of these impairments, a certain
   amount of residual impairments always persists. In this paper, we
   consider a training-based point-to-point MIMO system with residual
   transmit RF impairments (RTRI) using spatial multiplexing transmission.
   Specifically, we derive a new linear channel estimator for the proposed
   model, and show that RTRI create an estimation error floor in the high
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Moreover, we derive closed-form
   expressions for the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR)
   distributions, along with analytical expressions for the ergodic
   achievable rates of zero-forcing, maximum ratio combining, and minimum
   mean-squared error receivers, respectively. In addition, we optimize the
   ergodic achievable rates with respect to the training sequence length
   and demonstrate that finite dimensional systems with RTRI generally
   require more training at high SNRs than those with ideal hardware.
   Finally, we extend our analysis to large-scale MIMO configurations, and
   derive deterministic equivalents of the ergodic achievable rates. It is
   shown that, by deploying large receive antenna arrays, the extra
   training requirements due to RTRI can be eliminated. In fact, with a
   sufficiently large number of receive antennas, systems with RTRI may
   even need less training than systems with ideal hardware.}},

Title = {{Secure Transmission in MIMO Wiretap Channels Using General-Order
   Transmit Antenna Selection With Outdated CSI}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose general-order transmit antenna selection to
   enhance the secrecy performance of multiple-input-multiple-output
   multieavesdropper channels with outdated channel state information (CSI)
   at the transmitter. To evaluate the effect of the outdated CSI on the
   secure transmission of the system, we investigate the secrecy
   performance for two practical scenarios, i.e., Scenarios I and II, where
   the eavesdropper's CSI is not available at the transmitter and is
   available at the transmitter, respectively. For Scenario I, we derive
   exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage
   probability in Nakagami-m fading channels. In addition, we also derive
   the probability of nonzero secrecy capacity and the epsilon-outage
   secrecy capacity, respectively. Simple asymptotic expressions for the
   secrecy outage probability reveal that the secrecy diversity order is
   reduced when the CSI is outdated at the transmitter, and it is
   independent of the number of antennas at each eavesdropper NE, the
   fading parameter of the eavesdropper's channel m(E), and the number of
   eavesdroppers M. For Scenario II, we make a comprehensive analysis of
   the average secrecy capacity obtained by the system. Specifically, new
   closed-form expressions for the exact and asymptotic average secrecy
   capacity are derived, which are valid for general systems with an
   arbitrary number of antennas, number of eavesdroppers, and fading
   severity parameters. Resorting to these results, we also determine a
   high signal-to-noise ratio power offset to explicitly quantify the
   impact of the main channel and the eavesdropper's channel on the average
   secrecy capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are cellular
   networks where the base stations (BSs) are equipped with
   unconventionally many antennas, deployed on co-located or distributed
   arrays. Huge spatial degrees-of-freedom are achieved by coherent
   processing over these massive arrays, which provide strong signal gains,
   resilience to imperfect channel knowledge, and low interference. This
   comes at the price of more infrastructure; the hardware cost and circuit
   power consumption scale linearly/affinely with the number of BS antennas
   N. Hence, the key to cost-efficient deployment of large arrays is
   low-cost antenna branches with low circuit power, in contrast to today's
   conventional expensive and power-hungry BS antenna branches. Such
   low-cost transceivers are prone to hardware imperfections, but it has
   been conjectured that the huge degrees-of-freedom would bring robustness
   to such imperfections. We prove this claim for a generalized uplink
   system with multiplicative phase-drifts, additive distortion noise, and
   noise amplification. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for
   the user rates and a scaling law that shows how fast the hardware
   imperfections can increase with N while maintaining high rates. The
   connection between this scaling law and the power consumption of
   different transceiver circuits is rigorously exemplified. This reveals
   that one can make the circuit power increase as root N, instead of
   linearly, by careful circuit-aware system design.}},

Abstract = {{Overheating of permanent magnet (PM) machines has become a major
   technical challenge as it gives rise to magnet demagnetization,
   degradation of insulation materials, and loss of motor efficiency. This
   paper proposes a state-of-the-art cooling system for an axial flux
   permanent magnet (AFPM) machine with the focus on its structural
   optimization. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation with
   thermal consideration has been shown to be an efficient approach in the
   literature and is thus employed in this work. Meanwhile, a simplified
   numerical approach to the AFPM machine with complex configuration in 3D
   consisting of conduction, forced convection, and conjugate heat transfer
   is taken as a case study. Different simplification methods (including
   configuration and working conditions) and two optimized fans for forced
   convection cooling are designed and installed on the AFPM machine and
   compared to a natural convection cooling system. The results show that
   the proposed approach is effective for analyzing the thermal performance
   of a complex AFPM machine and strikes a balance between reasonable
   simplification, accuracy, and computational resource.}},

   metamorphic dehydration reactions in serpentinites and related rocks in
   the subducted Farallon plate. These fluids hydrated the overlying

Abstract = {{As an abstraction of natural samara flight, steadily rotating plates in
   a free-stream flow have been studied. Particle image velocimetry on
   span-normal planes has been conducted to show that increasing rotation,
   as captured by the dimensionless parameter of tip speed ratio, causes a
   transition of the mean wake topology from that of a bluff body to that
   of a stable leading-edge vortex. Despite its notable effect on topology,
   a change in tip speed ratio has negligible effect on leading-edge
   circulation at a given spanwise position, local effective angle of
   attack and local effective velocity. The effective angle-of-attack
   distribution was held constant at different tip speed ratios by
   comparing rotating plates with different twist profiles. The shear-layer
   velocity profile at the leading edge was also resolved, allowing
   quantification of the vorticity flux passing through the leading-edge
   shear layer. Interestingly, the observed equilibrium values of
   circulation are not sensitive to changes in shear-layer vorticity flux.}},

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic interaction of bacteria within bed sediment and suspended
   sediment (i.e., floc) in a wave-dominated beach environment was assessed
   using a laboratory wave flume. The influence of shear stress (wave
   energy) on bacterial concentrations and on the partitioning and
   transport of unattached and floc-associated bacteria was investigated.
   The study showed that increasing wave energy (0.60 and 5.35 N/s)
   resulted in a 0.5 to 1.5 log increase in unattached cells of the test
   bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain CTO7::gfp-2 in the water column. There
   was a positive correlation between the bacterial concentrations in water
   and the total suspended solids, with the latter increasing from values
   of near 0 to up to 200 mg/L over the same wave energy increase. The
   median equivalent spherical diameter of flocs in suspension also
   increased by an order of magnitude in all experimental trials. Under
   both low (0.60 N/s) and high (5.35 N/s) energy regime, bacteria were
   shown to preferentially associate with flocs upon cessation of wave
   activity. The results suggest that collecting water samples during
   periods of low wave action for the purpose of monitoring the
   microbiological quality of water may underestimate bacterial
   concentrations partly because of an inability to account for the effect
   of shear stress on the erosion and mobilization of bacteria from bed
   sediment to the water column. This highlights the need to develop a more
   comprehensive beach analysis strategy that not only addresses presently
   uncharacterized shores and sediments but also recognizes the importance
   of eroded flocs as a vector for the transport of bacteria in aquatic
   environments.}},

   improving the accuracy of these truncated series by replacing them with
   ratios of polynomials. Specifically, we examine replacing the truncated
   series solution for the corotational Maxwell model with its Pad,
   approximants for the shear stress response and for the normal stress
   differences. We find these Pad, approximants to agree closely with the
   corresponding exact solution, and we learn that with the right

Abstract = {{The process of accounting for heterogeneity has made significant
   advances in statistical research, primarily in the framework of
   stochastic analysis and the development of multiple-point statistics
   (MPS). Among MPS techniques, the direct sampling (DS) method is tested
   to determine its ability to delineate heterogeneity from aerial
   magnetics data in a regional sandstone aquifer intruded by
   low-permeability volcanic dykes in Northern Ireland, UK. The use of two
   two-dimensional bivariate training images aids in creating spatial
   probability distributions of heterogeneities of hydrogeological
   interest, despite relatively `noisy' magnetics data (i.e. including
   hydrogeologically irrelevant urban noise and regional geologic effects).
   These distributions are incorporated into a hierarchy system where
   previously published density function and upscaling methods are applied
   to derive regional distributions of equivalent hydraulic conductivity
   tensor K. Several K models, as determined by several stochastic
   realisations of MPS dyke locations, are computed within groundwater flow
   models and evaluated by comparing modelled heads with field
   observations. Results show a significant improvement in model
   calibration when compared to a simplistic homogeneous and isotropic
   aquifer model that does not account for the dyke occurrence evidenced by
   airborne magnetic data. The best model is obtained when normal and
   reverse polarity dykes are computed separately within MPS simulations
   and when a probability threshold of 0.7 is applied. The presented
   stochastic approach also provides improvement when compared to a
   previously published deterministic anisotropic model based on the
   unprocessed (i.e. noisy) airborne magnetics. This demonstrates the
   potential of coupling MPS to airborne geophysical data for regional
   groundwater modelling.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{A number of neural networks can be formulated as the
   linear-in-the-parameters models. Training such networks can be
   transformed to a model selection problem where a compact model is
   selected from all the candidates using subset selection algorithms.
   Forward selection methods are popular fast subset selection approaches.
   However, they may only produce suboptimal models and can be trapped into
   a local minimum. More recently, a two-stage fast recursive algorithm
   (TSFRA) combining forward selection and backward model refinement has
   been proposed to improve the compactness and generalization performance
   of the model. This paper proposes unified two-stage orthogonal least
   squares methods instead of the fast recursive-based methods. In contrast
   to the TSFRA, this paper derives a new simplified relationship between
   the forward and the backward stages to avoid repetitive computations
   using the inherent orthogonal properties of the least squares methods.
   Furthermore, a new term exchanging scheme for backward model refinement
   is introduced to reduce computational demand. Finally, given the error
   reduction ratio criterion, effective and efficient forward and backward
   subset selection procedures are proposed. Extensive examples are
   presented to demonstrate the improved model compactness constructed by
   the proposed technique in comparison with some popular methods.}},

Title = {{Durability of Bridge Deck with FRP Stay-in-Place Structural Forms under
   Freeze-Thaw Cycles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This study examines the effect of aggressive freeze-thaw (FT) cyclic
   exposure on strength and integrity of bridge decks built using glass
   fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) stay-in-place (SIP) structural forms
   that completely replace the bottom rebar layers. The concern has been
   whether entrapped moisture may cause frost-jacking of the form,
   negatively impacting deck integrity. Eleven scaled deck specimens were
   built, each using two flat GFRP plates with T-shape ribs running normal
   to girders. Both plates spanned the gap between girders and were spliced
   by overlapping, directly under the load. The study simulated the
   following surface treatments of the form: no treatment at all, adhesive
   bond to freshly cast concrete, and coarse aggregates bonded to the
   forms. Also, unbonded and bonded lap splices of the forms were tested.
   The decks were subjected to three cracking load cycles before being
   saturated and subjected to up to 300 FT cycles at +5 to -18 degrees C
   core temperatures. Freezing was in air while thawing was by water. Some
   specimens were thawed without being submerged and one specimen had
   perforated forms for drainage. Specimens of various splice and surface
   treatments survived the 300 FT cycles. Subsequent testing showed no
   reduction in ultimate load or stiffness, relative to control specimens,
   despite the 23\% reduction in tensile strength and 11\% in modulus of
   GFRP coupons exposed to the 300 FT cycles. This is because failure of
   the decks was governed by concrete punching shear. Decks with untreated
   forms and unbonded splices showed 21\% lower capacity than treated and
   bonded ones, even without any FT exposure, but this lower capacity was
   still 3.9 times higher than the equivalent design truck service load at
   this scale. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   Loading}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Blasts, whether deliberate or accidental, are a great concern for a
   society's critical infrastructure as well as expeditionary military
   installations. Improvement to existing construction methods that enhance
   blast resilience can ultimately save lives and property. Concrete-filled
   FRP tubes (CFFTs) are known to improve a conventional reinforced
   concrete member's resistance to traditional loads by strengthening,
   protecting, and confining the reinforced concrete core. Glass fibre
   reinforced polymer (GFRP) tubes are readily available in a variety of
   sizes suitable for use as a stay-in-place structural formwork for
   midsized reinforced concrete members, which can simplify and expedite
   construction. These advantages point to CFFTs' great potential in
   resisting blast loads. This study aimed to quantify the advantages of
   encasing a reinforced concrete member with a GFRP tube subjected to
   close-in blast loading and to investigate the effects of the presence of
   the tube, the internal steel reinforcement ratio, and the blast scaled
   distance on CFFTs' behavior under blast loading. This was accomplished
   by testing four CFFT and reinforced concrete specimen pairs under blast
   and monotonic loading. The specimens were tested in pairs to facilitate
   comparisons. The CFFT specimens performed significantly better than the
   conventional reinforced specimens, showing greater robustness with
   decreased localized damage and reduced residual displacements. This
   indicated the need for developing analysis and design procedures for
   this system. Therefore, a procedure for developing Pressure-Impulse
   diagrams for the tested CFFT specimens was outlined and their use for
   the design of CFFTs under close-in blast loads was explained. A
   numerical procedure for developing equivalent close-in blast forcing
   functions was also outlined. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION}},

Abstract = {{The traditional Euler's buckling theory of slender columns indicates
   that column capacity depends on flexural rigidity (EI), rather than
   material strength. As such, the availability of ultrahigh modulus carbon
   fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates, which could be much stiffer than
   steel, can offer a unique alternative for strengthening slender steel
   columns, in lieu of welding or bolting steel plates. In this study,
   twelve 2.6 m long S75 x 8 steel columns of 197 slenderness ratio that
   represents the upper limit permitted by code were tested under
   concentric axial loading using pin-ended conditions. The columns were
   allowed to buckle around their weak axes. CFRP plates were adhesively
   bonded to the flanges of the steel I-shape sections in nine of the
   columns. The main parameters studied were the level of initial
   out-of-straightness {[}length (L)/8,387 to L/1,020], CFRP modulus
   (168-430 GPa), CFRP reinforcement ratio (13-34\%) and the length of CFRP
   plate (33-95\% of L). The gain in axial strength due to CFRP
   retrofitting ranged from 11 to 29\%, depending on the various
   parameters. The gain generally increased as CFRP modulus, initial
   out-of-straightness, or CFRP reinforcement ratio increased. Global
   buckling consistently governed the maximum load. In the case of the 430
   GPa CFRP, buckling was followed by CFRP crushing in compression, then
   rupture in tension. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Sensitivity Analysis of Energy Use in Pipe-Replacement Planning for a
   Large Water-Distribution Network}},

Abstract = {{Most utilities are actively engaged in pipe replacement planning for a
   variety of reasons: to reduce the volume of lost water in their network
   by repairing or avoiding main breaks, to alleviate water quality
   concerns, to improve overall area delivery, and many others. Rarely are
   whole-of-life energy considerations taken into account when utilities
   create their pipe replacement schedules. The aim of the paper is to
   perform a sensitivity analysis on several important parameters related
   to pipe replacement, i.e., leak volume per break, leak duration, break
   rate model, and pump efficiency, on the energy use of a large-scale
   distribution network. The sensitivity analysis is carried out for a
   no-replacement baseline scenario and three replacement plans. For the
   specific water network examined, results suggest that the leakage volume
   per break, leak duration, and break forecasting model coefficients have
   a small effect on energy use, regardless of the pipe replacement plan.
   Pump efficiency was found to have the most significant effect on energy
   use. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of masonry infills on the in-plane behaviour of RC framed
   structures is a central topic in the seismic evaluation and retrofitting
   of existing buildings. Many models in the literature use an equivalent
   strut member in order to represent the infill but, among the parameters
   influencing the equivalent strut behaviour, the effect of vertical loads
   acting on the frames is recognized but not quantified. Nevertheless a
   vertical load causes a non-negligible variation in the in-plane
   behaviour of infilled frames by influencing the effective volume of the
   infill. This results in a change in the stiffness and strength of the
   system. This paper presents an equivalent diagonal pin-jointed strut
   model taking into account the stiffening effect of vertical loads on the
   infill in the initial state. The in-plane stiffness of a range of
   infilled frames was evaluated using a finite element model of the
   frame-infill system and the cross-section of the strut equivalent to the
   infill was obtained for different levels of vertical loading by imposing
   the equivalence between the frame containing the infill and the frame
   containing the diagonal strut. In this way a law for identifying the
   equivalent strut width depending on the geometrical and mechanical
   characteristics of the infilled frame was generalized to consider the
   influence of vertical loads for use in the practical applications. The
   strategy presented, limited to the initial stiffness of infilled frames,
   is preparatory to the definition of complete non-linear cyclic laws for
   the equivalent strut.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation and fouling of support structures in nuclear steam
   generators (SGs) can lead to SG tube damage and loss of SG efficiency.
   Inspection and monitoring of support structures combined with
   preventative maintenance programs can alleviate these effects and extend
   SG life. Conventional eddy current inspection technologies are
   extensively used for detecting and sizing indications from wall loss,
   frets at supports, cracks and other degradation modes in the tubes, as
   well as assessing the condition of support structures. However, these
   methods have limited capabilities when more than one degradation mode is
   present simultaneously, or when combined with fouling. Pulsed eddy
   current combined with principal components analysis (PCA) was examined
   for inspection of 15.9 mm (5/8{''}) Alloy-800 tubes and surrounding
   stainless steel (SS410) support structures. Clear separation of PCA
   scores associated with tubes from those associated with ferromagnetic
   SS410 supports permitted measurement of tube-to-support gaps, in either
   the presence of tube fretting or variation of relative position of the
   tube within SS410 supports. For concentric tubes, frets could be sized
   independently of SS410 hole diameter variations, which in other
   materials could represent support corrosion. Capability to clearly
   separate scores was attributed to large differences in relaxation times
   for diffusion of transient fields through the tube compared with
   diffusion into the ferromagnetic support structure.}},

Abstract = {{In order to carry out high-precision machining of aerospace structural
   components with large size, thin wall and complex surface, this paper
   proposes a novel parallel kinematic machine (PKM) and formulates its
   semi-analytical theoretical stiffness model considering gravitational
   effects that is verified by stiffness experiments. From the viewpoint of
   topology structure, the novel PKM consists of two substructures in terms
   of the redundant and overconstrained parallel mechanisms that are
   connected by two interlinked revolute joints. The theoretical stiffness
   model of the novel PKM is established based upon the virtual work
   principle and deformation superposition principle after mapping the
   stiffness models of substructures from joint space to operated space by
   Jacobian matrices and considering the deformation contributions of
   interlinked revolute joints to two substructures. Meanwhile, the
   component gravities are tteated as external payloads exerting on the end
   reference point of the novel PKM resorting to static equivalence
   principle. This approach is proved by comparing the theoretical
   stiffness values with experimental stiffness values in the same
   configurations, which also indicates equivalent gravity can be employed
   to describe the actual distributed gravities in an acceptable accuracy
   manner. Finally, on the basis of the verified theoretical stiffness
   model, the stiffness distributions of the novel PKM are illustrated and
   the contributions of component gravities to the stiffness of the novel
   PKM are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the simplest relevant molecular model for large-amplitude
   oscillatory shear (LAOS) flow of a polymeric liquid: the suspension of
   rigid dumbbells in a Newtonian solvent. We find explicit analytical
   expressions for the shear rate amplitude and frequency dependences of
   the zeroth, second and fourth harmonics of the first and second normal
   stress difference responses. We include a detailed comparison of these
   predictions with the corresponding results for the simplest relevant
   continuum model: the corotational Maxwell model. We find that the
   responses of both models are qualitatively alike. The rigid dumbbell
   model relies entirely on the dumbbell orientation to explain the
   viscoelastic response of the polymeric liquid, including the higher
   harmonics in large-amplitude oscillatory shear flow. Our analysis
   employs the general method of Bird and Armstrong (1972) for analyzing
   the behavior of the rigid-dumbbell model in any unsteady shear flow.
   We derive the first three terms of the deviation of the orientational
   distribution function from the equilibrium state. Then, after getting
   the ``paren functions,{''} we use these for evaluating the normal stress
   differences for large amplitude oscillatory shear flow. We find the
   shapes of the first normal stress difference versus shear rate loops
   predicted to be reasonable {[}see Fig. 1(a)]. We find that the second
   normal stress difference is not proportional to the first, and that its
   shape differs markedly from that of the first {[}cf. Fig. 1(a) and (b)].
   We discover the same remarkable qualitative similarity between the
   predictions of the rigid dumbbell model and the corotational Maxwell
   model for the first normal stress difference. We find no qualitative
   similarities between the dumbbell and the continuum models for any of
   the predicted coefficients of the second normal stress differences in
   large-amplitude oscillatory shear flow. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The leading edge of the ENE-trending Himalayan thrust front in Pakistan
   exhibits along-strike changes in deformational style, ranging from
   fault-bend to fault-propagation folds. Although the structural geometry
   is very gently deformed throughout the Salt Range, it becomes
   progressively more complex to the east as the leading edge of the
   emergent Salt Range Thrust becomes blind. Surface geology, seismic
   reflection, petroleum well, and chronostratigraphic data are synthesized
   to produce a 3-D kinematic model that reconciles the contrasting
   structural geometries along this part of the Himalayan thrust front. We
   propose a model whereby displacement was transferred, across a
   newly-identified lateral ramp, from a fault-bend fold in the west to
   fault-propagation folds in the east and comparable shortening was
   synchronously accommodated by two fundamentally different mechanisms:
   translation vs. telescoping. However, substantially different shortening
   distribution patterns within these structurally contrasting segments
   require a tear fault, which later is reactivated as a thrust fault. The
   present geometry of this S-shaped displacement transfer zone is a
   combined result of the NW SE compression of the lateral culmination wall
   and associated tear fault, and their subsequent modification due to
   mobilization of underlying ductile salt. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{We use scaled physical analog (centrifuge) modeling to investigate
   along- and across-strike structural variations in the Salt Range and
   Potwar Plateau of the Himalayan foreland fold-thrust belt of Pakistan.
   The models, composed of interlayered plasticine and silicone putty
   laminae, comprise four mechanical units representing the Neoproterozoic
   Salt Range Formation (basal detachment), Cambrian-Eocene carapace
   sequence, and Rawalpindi and Siwalik Groups (Neogene molasse), on a
   rigid base representing the Indian craton. Pre-cut ramps simulate
   basement faults with various structural geometries.
   A pre-existing north-dipping basement normal fault under the model
   foreland induces a frontal ramp and a prominent fault-bend-fold
   culmination, simulating the Salt Range. The ramp localizes displacement
   on a frontal thrust that occurs out-of-sequence with respect to other
   foreland folds and thrusts. With a frontal basement fault terminating to
   the east against a right-stepping, east-dipping lateral ramp,
   deformation propagates further south in the east; strata to the east of
   the lateral ramp are telescoped in ENE-trending detachment folds,
   fault-propagation folds and pop-up structures above a thick basal
   detachment (Salt Range Formation), in contrast to translated but
   less-deformed strata with E-W-trending Salt-Range structures to the
   west. The models are consistent with Salt Range Potwar Plateau
   structural style contrasts being due to basement fault geometry and
   variation in detachment thickness. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{An ageing demographic has increased the number of people with dementia.
   Although dementia is commonly associated with memory loss, other early
   symptoms include difficulty with wayfinding. Dementia alters
   visuo-spatial perception and the processes used to interpret the
   physical environment. The role of the design of the physical environment
   for people with dementia has gained increased recognition. Despite this,
   design for dementia is often overlooked, focusing on issues relating to
   physical impairment. This paper presents the results of a PhD study and
   aims to examine the role of the design of the physical environment in
   supporting wayfinding for people with dementia living in long-term care
   settings in Northern Ireland. Mixed methods combined the observation of
   wayfinding walks and conversational style interviews to elicit
   perspectives and experiences of residents with dementia. The findings
   aim to promote well-being for those with dementia living in long-term
   care settings.}},

Abstract = {{The article examines everyday life in Northern Ireland's segregated
   communities and focus on a neglected empirical dimension of ethnic and
   social segregation developed within the socio-spatial relations between
   people and their built environment. it shows how the everyday urban
   encounters are reproduced through negotiating differences and the ways
   in which living in divided communities lead to social inequality and
   imbalanced use of space. The article employed qualitative research
   methods with individuals and community groups from the Fountain estate,
   a small Protestant enclave in Derry/Londonderry. Their stories were
   replete with cases of injustice and insights into the daily struggles
   that have generally occurred within theories of contact and social
   segregation as a whole. In fact, people in the Fountain presented their
   own intertextual references on what was more significant for them as a
   matter of routine survival and belonging, which allowed them to be more
   constructive about themselves. While segregation has persisted for
   multiple decades; time is believed to be the factor most likely to
   change it, as it is hoped that the younger generation will provide
   lasting change to Northern Ireland and eventual peace between currently
   segregated communities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) survey data was used to supplement
   geotechnical investigations for a highway construction project in
   Norway. Heterogeneous geology throughout the survey and consequent
   variable bedrock threshold resistivity hindered efforts to directly
   track depth to bedrock, motivating us to develop an automated algorithm
   to extract depth to bedrock by combining both boreholes and AEM data. We
   developed two variations of this algorithm: one using simple Gaussian or
   inverse distance weighting interpolators, and another using ordinary
   kriging and combined probability distribution functions of input
   parameters.
   Evaluation shows that for preliminary surveys, significant savings in
   boreholes required can be made without sacrificing bedrock model
   accuracy. In the case study presented, we estimate data collection
   savings of 1000 to 10,000 NOK/km (c.\$160 to \$1600 USD/km) would have
   been possible for early phases of the investigation. However, issues
   with anthropogenic noise, low signal, and uncertainties in the inversion
   model likely reduced the comparative advantage that including AEM
   provided.
   AEM cannot supersede direct sampling where the model accuracy required
   exceed the resolution possible with the geophysical measurements.
   Nevertheless, with the algorithm we can identify high probability zones
   for shallow bedrock, identify steep or anomalous bedrock topography, and
   estimate the spatial variability of depth at earlier phases of
   investigation. Thus, we assert that our method is still useful where
   detailed mapping is the goal because it allows for more efficient
   planning of secondary phases of drilling, (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDSelection of polymers for two-phase partitioning bioreactors
   (TPPBs) has been focused primarily on predicting a polymer's affinity
   for the target molecule. Although the extent to which a polymer absorbs
   a solute is important, the rate of uptake/release must be sufficiently
   rapid such that a TPPB is not mass transfer limited. This work focused
   on developing a guide to identify combinations of polymer diffusivities
   and diffusional path lengths that will ensure a TPPB is not limited by
   substrate delivery.
   RESULTSTPPB systems limited by substrate delivery yielded linear growth,
   while biologically limited systems exhibited exponential growth. Release
   rates of phenol from various polymer phases increased as polymer
   diffusivity increased, or as diffusional path length (polymer bead size)
   decreased. A polymer selection guide was developed identifying
   combinations of polymer diffusivity and bead size that will ensure a
   TPPB is not mass transfer limited, for a desired maximum substrate
   consumption rate.
   CONCLUSIONIn selecting polymers for TPPB applications, solute affinity
   (extent of uptake) has been relatively well characterized using first
   principles methods, and the present work has now completed the picture'
   by providing a description of polymer transport properties (diffusivity
   and diffusional path length) to be able to generate a guide for
   selecting polymers. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Production of fatty alcohols through selective hydrogenation of fatty

   hydrogenated to octadecanol at temperatures and pressures between

   yield of octadecanol was attributed to a strong adsorption of the acid
   compared to alcohol on the catalyst, which inhibits further alcohol
   transformation to alkanes. Low amounts (<7\%) of alkanes (mainly
   octadecane) were formed during the conversion of stearic acid. However,
   it was found that the catalyst could be tuned for the production of
   alkanes. The reaction intermediates were octadecanal and stearyl
   stearate. Based on the reaction products analysis and catalyst
   characterization, a reaction mechanism and possible pathways were

Abstract = {{Aesthetics of concrete structures is directly related to the quality of
   their surface finish. The objective of this investigation was to examine
   the effect of theological properties of cement-based mortars on the
   quality of their surface finish. The study was divided into two phases.
   Firstly, the influence of the mix composition of mortars, viz, the water
   to cement (w/c) ratio, the sand content and the superplasticiser (SP)
   dosage on their rheology was evaluated. Secondly, the surface finish
   quality was characterised and related to the rheology of the studied
   systems. Rheology of these materials, i.e. the yield value, was measured
   using a vane viscometer. The quality of the surface finish was assessed
   by quantification of the surface air voids by analysing digital
   photographs of the mould finished sample surfaces. It was found that an
   increase in the w/c ratio and the SP content decreased the yield value,
   whilst the increase in the sand content had an opposite effect. When the
   surface quality is concerned, an increase in the yield value was found
   to increase the total content of the surface air voids and especially
   those with size smaller than 1 mm in diameter. Moreover, the analysis of
   the location of the surface air voids along the height of the sample
   revealed that with the increase in the yield value their concentration
   was higher in the bottom section of the analysed samples. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Core SE2 from the landward part of the modem Qiantang River (QR) estuary
   contains a 50 + m-thick succession of late Pleistocene to Holocene
   deposits that records the transgressive-regressive environmental
   transition from fluvial sedimentation, through a paleo-estuary phase and
   shallow-marine deposition, to the modern estuarine setting. Sand and
   silt samples from the Paleo-QR estuary phase were analyzed for
   heavy-mineral and geochemical compositions, as well as the U-Pb ages of
   detrital zircons, in order to investigate the source of the sediment
   during the Holocene. The Paleo-QR estuary sediments in core SE2, which
   accumulated between approximately 10,100 and 9500 cal yr B.P., contain a
   characteristic heavy-mineral assemblage of hematite-limonite, epidote,
   zircon, leucoxene and magnetite, consistent with derivation from the QR
   drainage basin. These data, as well as geochemical proxies including the
   fractionation patterns of trace and rare earth elements, and elemental
   ratios La/Sc and Th/Co, suggest that the Paleo-QR estuary sediments
   cannot be derived from the modern Changjiang River to the north, which
   is contributing to the infill of the present-day QR estuary. Two major
   zircon-grain age peaks (99-250 Ma and 740-1000 Ma) coincide with the
   main tectonic and magmatic events in the QR catchment, whereas the
   characteristic age peaks for the modern Changjiang River sediments (e.g.
   200-400 Ma and 1800-2100 Ma) are absent. Because the portion of the
   Paleo-QR estuary sampled is interpreted to lie seaward of the
   contemporaneous bedload convergence, in the area experiencing
   flood-dominant, landward transport of sediment, the sand and silt are
   unlikely to have come directly from the QR. Instead, we infer that the
   sediments were derived from the offshore part of the QR incised valley
   by flood-tidal reworking and landward transport. During the Paleo-QR
   estuary period, the incised valleys of the QR and Changjiang River were
   separate from each other for a considerable distance offshore. Sediment
   supplied by the Changjiang River was trapped in its estuary such that
   there was no sediment exchange between the two systems as there is now.
   This case study indicates that the combination of sediment geochemistry,
   heavy-mineral composition, and zircon chronology can supply important
   constraints on sediment dispersal patterns, even in dynamic estuarine
   and coastal areas with complex sediment transport pathways. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper presents an investigation of the residual structural response
   of corroded, deep, reinforced concrete (RC) beams. A three-point loading
   test was carried out on two corroded deep beams that had been stored in
   a natural corrosive environment for 28 years. Two uncorroded beams with
   the same steel configuration and span were tested to understand the
   impact of corrosion on the residual mechanical performance of the deep
   beams. The distribution of corrosion and gravimetric cross-section loss
   of the tension bars were measured. The corroded tension bars were
   extracted from the beams to study the residual mechanical properties.
   The load-bearing capacities of the corroded beams were assessed using
   the measured mechanical properties and the residual cross-section of the
   bars according to different failure mechanisms. The results show that,
   in this case, the corrosion of steel reinforcing bars could change the
   failure mode of the reinforced concrete beams from shear to flexure. (C)

Title = {{The effects of spur gear tooth spatial crack propagation on gear mesh
   stiffness}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{103-119}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Due to the presence of non-uniform load distribution, local
   non-homogeneity of material quality and potential misalignment of gear
   shafts and bearings, etc., spatial cracks may occur in the fillet region
   of spur gear teeth. These cracks will eventually propagate in three
   distinct directions either individually or simultaneously. These
   directions are the crack depth direction, the tooth width direction and
   the tooth profile direction. In this paper, an analytical investigation
   of the influence of spatial crack propagation on the time-varying Gear
   Mesh Stiffness (GMS) and also the Load Sharing Ratio (LSR) is presented.
   In order to quantitatively define the spatial crack propagation
   scenario, the involute spur gear tooth geometry cut with a typical
   double rounded rack is first determined using two parametric equations.
   The effects of some gear design parameters and initial crack locations
   on GMS and LSR are determined and compared with the results from
   previous papers that used Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in order to
   verify the proposed analytical model. Finally, a quasi-parabolic crack
   propagation scenario is assumed, in which 7 propagation cases and 3
   typical crack growth paths on the tooth surface are investigated to
   determine their effect on the maximum reduction of GMS when compared to
   normal conditions. The results are important for the dynamic simulation
   of gear transmission behavior, and consequently helpful for the
   monitoring of gearbox working condition and detection of early crack
   damage that may exist in gear sets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},

Volume = {{523}},

Abstract = {{Contaminants discharging from on-site wastewater treatment systems
   (OSWTSs) can impact groundwater quality, threatening human health and
   surface water ecosystems. Risk of negative impacts becomes elevated in
   areas of extreme vulnerability with high water tables, where thin
   unsaturated intervals limit vadose zone attenuation. A combined
   geophysical/hydrogeological investigation into the effects of an OSWTS,
   located over a poorly productive aquifer (PPA) with thin subsoil cover,
   aimed to characterise effluent impacts on groundwater. Groundwater,
   sampled from piezometers down-gradient of the OSWTS percolation area
   displayed spatially erratic, yet temporally consistent, contaminant
   distributions. Electrical resistivity tomography identified an area of
   gross groundwater contamination close to the percolation area and, when
   combined with seismic refraction and water quality data, indicated that
   infiltrating effluent reaching the water table discharged to a deeper
   more permeable zone of weathered shale resting on more competent
   bedrock. Subsurface structure, defined by geophysics, indicated that
   elevated chemical and microbiological contaminant levels encountered in
   groundwater samples collected from piezometers, down-gradient of
   sampling points with lower contaminant levels, corresponded to those
   locations where piezometers were screened close to the weathered
   shale/competent rock interface; those immediately up-gradient were too
   shallow to intercept this interval, and thus the more impacted zone of
   the contaminant plume. Intermittent occurrence of faecal indicator
   bacteria more than 100 m down gradient of the percolation area suggested
   relatively short travel times. Study findings highlight the utility of
   geophysics as part of multidisciplinary investigations for OSWTS
   contaminant plume characterisation, while also demonstrating the
   capacity of effluent discharging to PPAs to impact groundwater quality
   at distance. Comparable geophysical responses observed in similar
   settings across Ireland suggest the phenomena observed in this study are
   more widespread than previously suspected. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   Also, 65\% reduction in switching frequency variation is obtained. This

Abstract = {{The anterior oblique ligament (AOL) and the dorsoradial ligament (DRL)
   are both regarded as mechanical stabilizers of the thumb carpometacarpal
   (CMC) joint, which in older women is often affected by osteoarthritis.
   Inferences on the potential relationship of these ligaments to joint
   pathomechanics are based on clinical experience and studies of cadaveric
   tissue, but their functions has been studied sparsely in vivo. The
   purpose of this study was to gain insight into the functions of the AOL
   and DRL using in vivo joint kinematics data. The thumbs of 44 healthy
   subjects were imaged with a clinical computed tomography scanner in
   functional-task and thumb range-of-motion positions. The origins and
   insertion sites of the AOL and the DRL were identified on the
   three-dimensional bone models and each ligament was modeled as a set of
   three fibers whose lengths were the minimum distances between insertion
   sites. Ligament recruitment, which represented ligament length as a
   percentage of the maximum length across the scanned positions, was
   computed for each position and related to joint posture. Mean AOL
   recruitment was lower than 91\% across the CMC range of motion, whereas
   mean DRL recruitment was generally higher than 91\% in abduction and
   flexion. Under the assumption that ligaments do not strain by more than
   10\% physiologically, our findings of mean ligament recruitments across
   the CMC range of motion indicate that the AOL is likely slack during
   most physiological positions, whereas the DRL may be taut and therefore
   support the joint in positions of CMC joint abduction and flexion. (C)

Abstract = {{Accurate modelling of the internal climate of buildings is essential if
   building energy management systems (BEMS) are to efficiently maintain
   adequate thermal comfort. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are
   usually utilised to predict internal climate. Nevertheless CFD models,
   although providing the necessary level of accuracy, are highly
   computationally expensive, and cannot practically be integrated in BEMS.
   This paper presents and describes validation of a CFD-ROM method for
   real-time simulations of building thermal performance. The CFD-ROM
   method involves the automatic extraction and solution of reduced order
   models (ROMs) from validated CFD simulations. ROMs are shown to be
   adequately accurate with a total error below 5\% and to retain
   satisfactory representation of the phenomena modelled. Each ROM has a
   time to solution under 20 s, which opens the potential of their
   integration with BEMS, giving real-time physics-based building energy
   modelling. A parameter study was conducted to investigate the
   applicability of the extracted ROM to initial boundary conditions
   different from those from which it was extracted. The results show that
   the ROMs retained satisfactory total errors when the initial conditions
   in the room were varied by +/- 5 degrees C. This allows the production
   of a finite number of ROMs with the ability to rapidly model many
   possible scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Antibacterial Properties and Mechanism of Activity of a Novel
   Silver-Stabilized Hydrogen Peroxide}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{Huwa-San peroxide (hydrogen peroxide; HSP) is a NSF Standard 60 (maximum
   8mg/L-1) new generation peroxide stabilized with ionic silver suitable
   for continuous disinfection of potable water. Experiments were
   undertaken to examine the mechanism of HSP against planktonic and
   biofilm cultures of indicator bacterial strains. Contact/kill time (CT)
   relationships that achieve effective control were explored to determine
   the potential utility in primary disinfection. Inhibitory assays were
   conducted using both nutrient rich media and a medium based on synthetic
   wastewater. Assays were compared for exposures to three disinfectants
   (HSP, laboratory grade hydrogen peroxide (HP) and sodium hypochlorite)
   at concentrations of 20 ppm (therefore at 2.5 and 5 times the NSF limit
   for HP and sodium hypochlorite, respectively) and at pH 7.0 and 8.5 in
   dechlorinated tap water. HSP was found to be more or equally effective
   as hypochlorite or HP. Results from CT assays comparing HSP and HP at
   different bacterial concentrations with neutralization of residual
   peroxide with catalase suggested that at a high bacterial concentration
   HSP, but not HP, was protected from catalase degradation possibly
   through sequestration by bacterial cells. Consistent with this
   hypothesis, at a low bacterial cell density residual HSP was more
   effectively neutralized as less HSP was associated with bacteria and
   therefore accessible to catalase. Silver in HSP may facilitate this
   association through electrostatic interactions at the cell surface. This
   was supported by experiments where the addition of mono (K+) and
   divalent (Ca+2) cations (0.005-0.05M) reduced the killing efficacy of
   HSP but not HP. Experiments designed to distinguish any inhibitory
   effect of silver from that of peroxide in HSP were carried out by
   monitoring the metabolic activity of established P. aeruginosa PAO1
   biofilms. Concentrations of 70-500 ppm HSP had a pronounced effect on
   metabolic activity while the equivalent concentrations of ionic silver
   (50-375 ppb) had a negligible effect, demonstrating that the
   microbiocidal activity of HSP was due to peroxide rather than silver.
   Overall, it was found that the antimicrobial activity of HSP is enhanced
   over that of hydrogen peroxide; the presence of the ionic silver
   enhances interactions of HSP with the bacterial cell surface rather than
   acting directly as a biocide at the tested concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Strontium isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86) can be useful biological markers for a
   wide range of forensic science applications, including wildlife
   tracking. However, one of the main advantages of using Sr-87/Sr-86
   values, that there is no fractionation from geological bedrock sources
   through the food web, also happens to be a critical assumption that has
   never been tested experimentally. We test this assumption by measuring
   Sr-87/Sr-86 values across three trophic levels in a controlled
   greenhouse experiment. Adult monarch butterflies were raised on obligate
   larval host milkweed plants that were, in turn, grown on seven different
   soil types collected across Canada. We found no significant differences
   between Sr-87/Sr-86 values in leachable Sr from soil minerals, organic
   soil, milkweed leaves, and monarch butterfly wings. Our results suggest
   that strontium isoscapes developed from Sr-87/Sr-86 values in bedrock or
   soil may serve as a reliable biological marker in forensic science for a
   range of taxa and across large geographic areas.}},

Abstract = {{A novel experimental technique has been used to measure particle
   concentration distributions in agitated tanks. This approach consisted
   in using pyrite (FeS2) particles and a Pt electrode connected to a
   potentiostat to measure variations in the electrode potential caused by
   galvanic interactions between FeS2 particles and the Pt electrode. In
   order to discern collisions between the particles and the Pt electrode
   from random variations in electrode potential, a time and a frequency
   domain method of analysis were used. The latter showed no periodicity in
   the collision rate indicating that the process was stochastic. The
   presented method is convenient because of its simplicity and it can
   provide important information regarding the hydrodynamic behaviour of
   solids in agitated tanks, particularly when non-intrusive techniques are
   not an option. Finally, the advantages and drawbacks of the technique,

Abstract = {{Military decision makers need to understand and assess the benefits and
   consequences of their decisions in order to make cost efficient, timely,
   and successful choices. Technology selection is one such critical
   decision, especially when considering the design or retrofit of a
   complex system, such as an aircraft. An integrated and systematic
   methodology that will support decision making between technology
   alternatives and options while assessing the consequences of such
   decisions is a key enabler. This paper demonstrates, through application
   to a notional medium-range short takeoff and landing aircraft, one such
   enabler: the Technology Impact Forecasting (TIF) method. The goal of the
   TIF process is to explore both generic, undefined areas of technology,
   as well as specific technologies, and assess their potential impacts.
   This is actualized through the development and use of technology
   scenarios, and allows the designer to determine where to allocate
   resources for further technology definition and refinement, as well as
   provide useful design information. The paper particularly discusses the
   use of technology scenarios and demonstrates their use in the

Abstract = {{This work proposes a novel approach to compute transonic limit-cycle

   enabling harmonic balance methods to accurately capture limit-cycle
   oscillations; this is achieved by defining a frequency-updating
   procedure based on a coupled
   computational-fluid-dynamics/computational-structural-dynamics harmonic
   balance formulation to find the limit-cycle oscillation condition. A
   pitch/plunge airfoil and delta wing aerodynamic and respective linear
   structural models are used to validate the new method against
   conventional time-domain simulations. Results show consistent agreement
   between the proposed and time-marching methods for both limit-cycle

   relative abundances of specific algae and aquatic plant (macrophyte)
   taxa were assessed and correlated to water chemistry data. A strong
   shift from the dominance of green algae, chlorophyceae, in WSP\#2, to
   the dominance of aquatic macrophytes, embryophyta, in WSP\#4, was
   observed and corresponded to field observations. Correlation of the
   abundances to nutrient parameters suggested that the macronutrient rich
   conditions in WSP\#2 allowed floating green algae to proliferate against
   macrophytes. In WSP\#1 and WSP\#4, macrophytes competed against algae
   and thrived, due to their adaptability to lower nutrient conditions. The
   pH increases occurred primarily in WSP\#2 and were not buffered or
   reduced in WSP\#1 and WSP\#4. Two alternatives strategies for pH control
   were recommended for the system: decreasing algae growth in WSP\#2
   through duckweed seeding or macronutrient loading reduction; or
   designing and implementing a constructed wetland (CW) in WSP\#4 with
   soil and vegetation to buffer pH prior to release.}},

Title = {{DDT and detonation propagation limits in an obstacle filled tube}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Experiments with hydrogen-air and ethylene-air mixtures at atmospheric
   pressure were carried out in a 6.1 m long, 0.1 m diameter tube with
   different obstacle configurations and ignition types. Classical DDT
   experiments were performed with the first part of the tube filled with
   equally spaced 75 mm (44\% area blockage ratio) orifice-plates. The DDT
   limits, defining the so-called quasi-detonation regime, where the wave
   propagates at a velocity above the speed of sound in the products, were
   found to be well correlated with d/lambda = 1, where d is orifice-plate
   diameter and lambda is the detonation cell size. The only exception was
   the rich ethylene limit where d/lambda = 1.9 was found. In a second
   experiment detonation propagation limits were measured by transmitting a
   CJ detonation wave into an obstacle filled (same equally spaced 44\%
   orifice plates) section of the tube. An oxy-acetylene driver promptly
   initiated a detonation wave at one end. In this experiment the
   quasi-detonation propagation limits were found to agree very well with
   the d/lambda = 1 correlation. This indicates that the d/lambda = 1
   represents a propagation limit. In general, One can conclude that the
   classical DDT limits measured in an orifice-plate filled tube are
   governed by the wave propagation mechanism, independent of detonation
   initiation (DDT process) that can occur locally in the obstacles outside
   these limits. For rich mixtures, transmission of the quasi-detonation
   into the smooth tube resulted in CJ detonation wave. However, in a
   narrow range of mixtures on the lean side, the detonation failed to
   transmit in the smooth tube. This highlights the critical role that
   shock reflection plays in the propagation of quasi-detonation waves. (C)

Abstract = {{A widespread marine microbialite and underlying truncation surface occur
   in Permian-Triassic sections of South China. We interpret the
   microbialite to have formed as a shallow, open-marine benthic framework
   stimulated by high seawater CaCO3 saturation. The widespread
   distribution across platform interiors and lack of asymmetry or
   thickening toward platform margins is incompatible with an alternative
   hypothesis, that microbialite deposition was stimulated by upwelling
   anoxic, alkaline waters. The truncation surface beneath the microbialite
   is irregular with overhangs and small caverns extending up to 30 cm
   beneath the surface indicating a dissolutional origin. Petrographic
   observations refute the interpretation that strata immediately beneath
   the surface contain pendant cements, meniscus cements, and vadose silt.
   Measurements of the anisopachous fibrous cements show that thickened
   areas have random, not downward orientations. Pores retain the pointed
   geometry consistent with isopachous cement. Carbon and oxygen isotope
   measurements, from immediately beneath the surface, do not show a
   negative shift as would be expected with subaerial exposure. Also
   incompatible with a subaerial origin is the occurrence of only one
   truncation surface within a subtidal succession, similar to 50 m thick
   below the surface and the limited vertical penetration of dissolution.
   The surface closely resembles a hardground containing a micritized
   alteration zone with stromatolites encrusted on the surface. We
   interpret the surface to have formed by submarine dissolution driven by
   a pulse of ocean acidification associated with Siberian Traps eruptions
   and the end-Permian extinction. After a hiatus of, similar to 30-100
   kyr, seafloor dissolution would have brought seawater back to saturation
   coupled with increased delivery of calcium to the oceans as the result
   of elevated continental weathering and caused a rebound in carbonate
   saturation and precipitation of microbialites.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach for the multi-objective design optimisation of aerofoil
   profiles is presented. The proposed method aims to exploit the relative
   strengths of global and local optimisation algorithms, whilst using
   surrogate models to limit the number of computationally expensive CFD
   simulations required. The local search stage utilises a
   re-parameterisation scheme that increases the flexibility of the
   geometry description by iteratively increasing the number of design
   variables, enabling superior designs to be generated with minimal user
   intervention. Capability of the algorithm is demonstrated via the
   conceptual design of aerofoil sections for use on a lightweight laminar
   flow business jet. The design case is formulated to account for take-off
   performance while reducing sensitivity to leading edge contamination.
   The algorithm successfully manipulates boundary layer transition
   location to provide a potential set of aerofoils that represent the
   trade-offs between drag at cruise and climb conditions in the presence
   of a challenging constraint set. Variations in the underlying flow
   physics between Pareto-optimal aerofoils are examined to aid
   understanding of the mechanisms that drive the trade-offs in objective
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey has recently determined the
   luminosity function of galaxies in the core of the Virgo cluster down to
   unprecedented magnitude and surface brightness limits. Comparing
   simulations of cluster formation to the derived central stellar mass
   function, we attempt to estimate the stellar-to-halo-mass ratio (SHMR)
   for dwarf galaxies, as it would have been before they fell into the
   cluster. This approach ignores several details and complications, e.g.,
   the contribution of ongoing star formation to the present-day stellar
   mass of cluster members, and the effects of adiabatic contraction and/or
   violent feedback on the subhalo and cluster potentials. The final
   results are startlingly simple, however; we find that the trends in the
   SHMR determined previously for bright galaxies appear to extend down in
   a scale-invariant way to the faintest objects detected in the survey.
   These results extend measurements of the formation efficiency of field
   galaxies by two decades in halo mass or five decades in stellar mass,
   down to some of the least massive dwarf galaxies known, with stellar
   masses of similar to 10(5) M-circle dot.}},

Abstract = {{When polymeric liquids undergo large-amplitude shearing oscillations,
   the shear stress responds as a Fourier series, the higher harmonics of
   which are caused by fluid nonlinearity. Previous work on large-amplitude
   oscillatory shear flow has produced analytical solutions for the first
   few harmonics of a Fourier series for the shear stress response (none
   beyond the fifth) or for the normal stress difference responses (none
   beyond the fourth) {[}JNNFM, 166, 1081 (2011)], but this growing
   subdiscipline of macromolecular physics has yet to produce an exact
   solution. Here, we derive what we believe to be the first exact
   analytical solution for the response of the extra stress tensor in
   large-amplitude oscillatory shear flow. Our solution, unique and in
   closed form, includes both the normal stress differences and the shear
   stress for both startup and alternance. We solve the corotational
   Maxwell model as a pair of nonlinear-coupled ordinary differential
   equations, simultaneously. We choose the corotational Maxwell model
   because this two-parameter model ((0) and ) is the simplest constitutive
   model relevant to large-amplitude oscillatory shear flow, and because it
   has previously been found to be accurate for molten plastics (when
   multiple relaxation times are used). By relevant we mean that the model
   predicts higher harmonics. We find good agreement between the first few
   harmonics of our exact solution, and of our previous approximate
   expressions (obtained using the Goddard integral transform). Our exact
   solution agrees closely with the measured behavior for molten plastics,
   not only at alternance, but also in startup.}},

Abstract = {{Alginate-based amphiphilic graft copolymers were synthesized by single
   electron transfer living radical polymerization (SET-LRP), forming
   stable micelles during polymerization induced self-assembly (PISA).
   First, alginate macroinitiator was prepared by partial depolymerization
   of native alginate, solubility modification and attachment of initiator.
   Depolymerized low molecular weight alginate (similar to 12 000 g/mol)
   was modified with tetrabutylammonium, enabling miscibility in anhydrous
   organic solvents, followed by initiator attachment via esterification
   yielding a macroinitiator with a degree of substitution of 0.02, or 1-2
   initiator groups per alginate chain. Then, methyl methacrylate was
   polymerized from the alginate macroinitiator in mixtures of water and
   methanol, forming poly(methyl methacrylate) grafts, prior to
   self-assembly, of similar to 75 000 g/mol and polydispersity of 1.2.
   PISA of the amphiphilic graft-copolymer resulted in the formation of
   micelles with diameters of 50-300 nm characterized by light scattering
   and electron microscopy. As the first reported case of LRP from
   alginate, this work introduces a synthetic route to a preparation of
   alginate-based hybrid polymers with a precise macromolecular
   architecture and desired functionalities. The intended application is
   the preparation of micelles for drug delivery; however, LRP from
   alginate can also be applied in the field of biomaterials to the
   improvement of alginate-based hydrogel systems such as nano- and
   microhydrogel particles, islet encapsulation materials, hydrogel
   implants, and topical applications. Such modified alginates can also
   improve the function and application of native alginates in food and
   agricultural applications.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate secure transmission for multiuser relay networks, where
   the undesired users who are not selected for data reception may overhear
   the source message as eavesdroppers. In this system, the secrecy
   performance may deteriorate as the number of users increases, since the
   number of eavesdroppers also increases. To address this issue, we
   consider a multiuser relay scheme with cooperative jamming (MUCJ). In
   this scheme, the desired user sends a jamming signal to the relay while
   the source sends its message to the relay, and then the relay amplifies
   and forwards the received signal to the desired user. Since the jamming
   can be subtracted only at the desired user, it acts as interference to
   prevent the eavesdroppers from intercepting the source message. We
   propose an optimal user selection scheme for the MUCJ, which is optimal
   in the sense of maximizing the secrecy rate. For the existing multiuser
   relay scheme (MURS) without cooperative jamming and the MUCJ, we derive
   the ergodic secrecy rates and analyze the asymptotic secrecy rate gains.
   We reveal that the ergodic secrecy rate can be increased as the number
   of users grows and much higher secrecy rate can be achieved by the MUCJ.}},

Abstract = {{The Holocene evolution of Currituck Sound, North Carolina, is
   investigated using geological data and a hydrodynamic model to
   understand how this depositional basin changed in response to sea-level
   rise and regional climate patterns. Five depositional units (one
   Pleistocene and four Holocene) are defined based on geophysical surveys,
   lithofacies, biofacies, and geochronological data. The earliest Holocene
   unit (ca. 5000 cal YBP) represents a midsalinity (10-25 parts per
   thousand) sand shoal above the transgressive ravinement surface. This
   unit is overlain, successively, by (1) a freshwater swamp forest
   deposit, (2) a relatively saline (25-35 parts per thousand) back-barrier
   estuarine deposit associated with increased inlet activity, and (3) a
   mid- to low-salinity (<10 parts per thousand) deposit that is typical of
   modern (post-1827) Currituck Sound, a back-barrier estuary with no
   inlets in the barrier island. Geomorphic reconstructions provided the
   boundary conditions input to hydrodynamically model tide and current
   patterns and to constrain the probable size and location of inlets. The
   evolution of this system depends on sea-level rise and barrier
   morphology, regional hydrological factors, and regional climatic
   conditions, which modulate storm impacts and inlet activity along the
   fronting barrier system. The late Holocene stratigraphy reflects climate
   variability also recorded in the sediments of Chesapeake Bay (to the
   north) and Pamlico Sound (to the south) and is consistent with an
   increase in tropical cyclone activity during the Medieval Climate
   Anomaly and subsequent decrease in tropical storm activity since ca. 500
   cal YBP.}},

Abstract = {{Stem cell interactions through paracrine cell signalling can regulate a
   range of cell responses, including metabolic activity, proliferation and
   differentiation. Moving towards the development of optimized
   tissue-engineering strategies with adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs),
   the focus of this study was on developing indirect co-culture models to
   study the effects of mature adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts on
   bovine ASC multilineage differentiation. For each lineage, ASC
   differentiation was characterized by histology, gene expression and
   protein expression, in the absence of key inductive differentiation
   factors for the ASCs. Co-culture with each of the mature cell
   populations was shown to successfully induce or enhance lineage-specific
   differentiation of the ASCs. In general, a more homogeneous but
   lower-level differentiation response was observed in co-culture as
   compared to stimulating the bovine ASCs with inductive differentiation
   media. To explore the role of the Wnt canonical and non-canonical
   signalling pathways within the model systems, the effects of the Wnt
   inhibitors WIF-1 and DKK-1 on multilineage differentiation in co-culture
   were assessed. The data indicated that Wnt signalling may play a role in
   mediating ASC differentiation in co-culture with the mature cell
   populations. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Driven by the requirements of the bionic joint or tracking equipment for
   the spherical parallel manipulators (SPMs) with three rotational
   degrees-of-freedom (DoFs), this paper carries out the topology synthesis
   of a class of three-legged SPMs employing Lie group theory. In order to
   achieve the intersection of the displacement subgroups, the subgroup
   characteristics and operation principles are defined in this paper.
   Mainly drawing on the Lie group theory, the topology synthesis procedure
   of three-legged SPMs including four stages and two functional blocks is
   proposed, in which the assembly principles of three legs are defined. By
   introducing the circular track, a novel class of three-legged SPMs is
   synthesized, which is the important complement to the existing SPMs.
   Finally, four typical examples are given to demonstrate the finite
   displacements of the synthesized three-legged SPMs.}},

Abstract = {{The last three decades have seen social enterprises in the United
   Kingdom pushed to the forefront of welfare delivery, workfare and
   area-based regeneration. For critics, this is repositioning the sector
   around a neoliberal politics that privileges marketization, state
   roll-back and disciplining community groups to become more self-reliant.
   Successive governments have developed bespoke products, fiscal
   instruments and intermediaries to enable and extend the social finance
   market. Such assemblages are critical to roll-out tactics, but they are
   also necessary and useful for more reformist understandings of economic
   alterity. The issue is not social finance itself but how it is used,
   which inevitably entangles social enterprises in a form of legitimation
   crises between the need to satisfy financial returns and at the same
   time keep community interests on board. This paper argues that social
   finance, how it is used, politically domesticated and achieves
   re-distributional outcomes is a necessary component of counter-hegemonic
   strategies. Such assemblages are as important to radical community
   development as they are to neoliberalism and the analysis concludes by
   highlighting the need to develop a better understanding of finance, the
   ethics of its use and tactical compromises in scaling it as an
   alternative to public and private markets.}},

Abstract = {{With a significant growth in the use of titanium alloys in the aviation
   manufacturing industry, the key challenge of making high-quality holes
   in the aircraft assembly process needs to be addressed. In this work,
   case studies deploying traditional drilling and helical milling
   technologies are carried out to investigate the tool life and hole
   surface integrity for hole-making of titanium alloy. Results show that
   the helical milling process leads to much longer tool life, generally
   lower hole surface roughness, and higher hole subsurface microhardness.
   In addition, no plastically deformed layer or white layer has been
   observed in holes produced by helical milling. In contrast, a slightly
   softened region was always present on the drilled surface. The residual
   stress distributions within the hole surface, including compressive and
   tensile residual stress, have also been investigated in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Soil gas emissions of methane and carbon dioxide on brownfield sites are
   usually attributed to anthropogenic activities; however geogenic sources
   of soil gas are often not considered during site investigation and risk
   management strategies. This paper presents a field study at a
   redeveloped brownfield site on a flood plain to identify accumulations
   of methane biogas trapped in underlying sediments. The investigation is
   based on a multidisciplinary approach using direct multi-level sampling
   measurements and Earth resistivity tomography . Resistivity imaging was
   applied to evaluate the feasibility of identifying the size and spatial
   continuity of soil gas accumulations in anthropogenic and naturally
   occurring deposits. As a result, biogas accumulations are described
   within both anthropogenic deposits and pristine organic sediments. This
   result is important to identify the correct approaches to identify and
   manage risks associated with soil gas emissions on brownfield and
   pristine sites. The organic-rich sediments in Quaternary fluvial
   environments of So Paulo Basin in particular the Tiet River, biogas
   reservoirs can be generated and trapped beneath geogenic and
   anthropogenic layers, potentially requiring the management of brownfield
   developments across this region.}},

Abstract = {{Driven by the advent of sophisticated and ubiquitous applications, and
   the ever-growing need for information, wireless networks are without a
   doubt steadily evolving into profoundly more complex and dynamic
   systems. The user demands are progressively rampant, while application
   requirements continue to expand in both range and diversity. Future
   wireless networks, therefore, must be equipped with the ability to
   handle numerous, albeit challenging, requirements. Network
   reconfiguration, considered as a prominent network paradigm, is
   envisioned to play a key role in leveraging future network performance
   and considerably advancing current user experiences. This paper presents
   a comprehensive overview of reconfigurable wireless networks and an
   in-depth analysis of reconfiguration at all layers of the protocol
   stack. Such networks characteristically possess the ability to
   reconfigure and adapt their hardware and software components and
   architectures, thus enabling flexible delivery of broad services, as
   well as sustaining robust operation under highly dynamic conditions. The
   paper offers a unifying framework for research in reconfigurable
   wireless networks. This should provide the reader with a holistic view
   of concepts, methods, and strategies in reconfigurable wireless
   networks. Focus is given to reconfigurable systems in relatively new and
   emerging research areas such as cognitive radio networks, cross-layer
   reconfiguration, and software-defined networks. In addition, modern
   networks have to be intelligent and capable of self-organization. Thus,
   this paper discusses the concept of network intelligence as a means to
   enable reconfiguration in highly complex and dynamic networks. Key
   processes in network intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and
   context awareness, are presented to illustrate how these methods can
   take reconfiguration to a new level. Finally, the paper is supported
   with several examples and case studies showing the tremendous impact of
   reconfiguration on wireless networks.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{313-325}},

Abstract = {{This is the first study to report that bacteria from the genera
   Ochrobactrum, Brevundimonas and Bacillus can be isolated by growth on
   naphthenic acids (NAs) extracted from oil sands process water (OSPW).
   These pure cultures were screened for their ability to use a range of
   aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic NA surrogates in 96-well microtiter
   plates using water-soluble tetrazolium redox dyes (Biolog Redox Dye H)
   as the indicator of metabolic activity. Of the three cultures,
   Ochrobactrum showed most metabolic activity on the widest range of NA
   surrogates. Brevundomonas and especially Ochrobactrum had higher
   metabolic activity on polycyclic aromatic compounds than other classes
   of NA surrogates. Bacillus also oxidized a wide range of NA surrogates
   but not as well as Ochrobactrum. Using this method to characterize NA
   utilisation, one can identify which NAs or NA classes in OSPW are more
   readily degraded. Since aromatic NAs have been shown to have an
   estrogenic effect and polycyclic monoaromatic compounds have been
   suggested to pose the greatest environmental threat among the NAs, these
   bacterial genera may play an important role in detoxification of OSPW.
   Furthermore, this study demonstrates that bacteria belonging to the
   genera Ochrobactrum and Bacillus can also degrade surrogates of
   tricyclic NAs.}},

Abstract = {{Wind power is one of the most developed renewable energy resources
   worldwide. To integrate offshore wind farms to onshore grids, the
   high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission cables interfaced with
   voltage source converters (VSCs) are considered to be a better solution
   than conventional approaches. Proper DC voltage indicates successive
   power transfer. To connect more than one onshore grid, the DC voltage
   droop control is one of the most popular methods to share the control
   burden between different terminals. However, the challenges are that
   small droop gains will cause voltage deviations, while higher droop gain
   settings will cause large oscillations. This study aims to enhance the
   performance of the traditional droop controller by considering the DC
   cable dynamics. Based on the backstepping control concept, DC cables are
   modelled with a series of capacitors and inductors. The final droop
   control law is deduced step-by-step from the original remote side. At
   each step the control error from the previous step is considered.
   Simulation results show that both the voltage deviations and
   oscillations can be effectively reduced using the proposed method.
   Further, power sharing between different terminals can be effectively
   simplified such that it correlates linearly with the droop gains, thus
   enabling simple yet accurate system operation and control.}},

Abstract = {{Stress heterogeneity within each individual grain of polycrystalline
   Zircaloy-2 is studied using a crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE)
   model. For this purpose, the weighted Voronoi tessellation method is
   used to construct 3D geometries of more than 2600 grains based on their
   center-of-mass positions and volumes as measured by three-dimensional
   X-ray diffraction (3DXRD) microscopy. The constructed microstructure is
   meshed with different element densities and for different numbers of
   grains. Then a selected group of twin and parent pairs are studied. It
   is shown that the measured average stress for each grain from the 3DXRD
   experiment is within the stress variation zone of the grain modeled in
   the CPFE simulation. Also, the CPFE average stress calculation for each
   grain is in good agreement with the measured average stress values. It
   is shown that upon considering the stress variations within each grain,
   stresses in the parent and twin are quite different if they are plotted
   in the global coordinate system. However, if the stress tensor is
   rotated into the local coordinate system of the twin habit plane, all
   the stress components averaged over the presented population are close,
   except for the shear acting on the twin plane and the transverse stress.
   This result is significant as it provides information needed to model
   such parent-twin interactions in crystal plasticity codes. (C) 2015 Acta

   within grains. Understanding the mechanism of load sharing between
   different grains becomes more complicated when deformation twinning
   plays a significant role in accommodating an externally applied load. In
   this paper, a comprehensive study of stress development in a coarse
   grained strongly textured hcp polycrystal Zircaloy-2, is given using
   three-dimensional X-ray diffraction (3DXRD) microscopy. In-situ uniaxial
   straining was carried out at seven steps up to 2.7\% in the macroscopic
   direction that favors twin formation, while center-of-mass position,
   crystallographic orientation, elastic strain, stress, and relative
   volume of each grain were measured. This information was used to
   reconstruct the 3D microstructure and statistically study neighborhood
   effects on the load sharing. The investigated volume of the sample
   contained 6132 grains initially, yet as a result of twin formation, 9724
   grains were measured in the same volume at the last loading step. It is
   shown that the most favored (highest Schmid factor) twin variant
   contributes the most to the twin number fraction; however, if the
   measured local stress within each grain is used for the calculation of
   Schmid factor, the contribution of other variants is relatively
   independent of Schmid factor. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Tropical cyclones deliver intense winds that can generate some of the
   most severe surface wave and storm surge conditions in the coastal
   ocean. Hurricane Irene (2011) crossed a large, shallow lagoonal
   estuarine system in North Carolina, causing flooding and erosion of the
   adjacent low-lying coastal plain and barrier islands. This event
   provided an opportunity to improve understanding of the estuarine
   response to strong and rotating wind forcing. Observations from acoustic
   sensors in subestuaries and water-level elevation measurements from a
   network of pressure sensors across the system are presented. Data are
   examined with two modeling techniques: (1) a simple numerical approach
   using a momentum balance between the wind stress, flow acceleration,
   pressure gradient, and bottom friction that gives insight into temporal
   variability in water levels through the passage of the storm; and (2) an
   advanced hydrodynamic model based on the full shallow water fluid
   momentum equations, coupled to a spectral surface wave model that
   accounts for the spatially varying bathymetry and wind field. The
   results indicate that both wind-generated surface waves and the
   wind-driven storm surge are important contributors to the total water
   surface elevations that induce flooding along estuarine shorelines under
   strong hurricane forcing.}},

   Following a study on corrosion protection, in which the coating showed a

   on bond strength. A self-reacting inverted T-shaped beam was designed to
   simulate the stress conditions of flexural structural members. Six
   T-beams were fabricated, each of which contained eight rebar test
   samples. Tests were conducted at approximately seven days and at three
   months after casting to investigate curing effect on bond. Although the
   bond strength of the coated samples were reduced compared with the
   uncoated bars, theoretical development lengths obtained from current
   concrete design code equations were sufficient to reach the yield
   strength of the bars. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   analysis attributes such as mesh associativity or boundary conditions
   between equivalent model representations. Virtual Topology descriptions
   used for geometry clean-up operations are explicitly stored so they can

Title = {{On the deformation twinning of Mg AZ31B: A three-dimensional synchrotron

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{77-97}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Crystals with a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure are inherently
   anisotropic, and have a limited number of independent slip systems,
   which leads to strong deformation textures and reduced formability in
   polycrystalline products. Tension along the c-axis of the crystal
   ideally activates extension twinning as a deformation mode due to the
   lack of easy-slip systems. In this work, experiments were devised to
   study extension twinning in a polycrystalline Mg alloy AZ31B with a
   strong basal rolling texture by tensile deformation parallel to the
   plate normal. Three-dimensional synchrotron X-ray diffraction (3DXRD)
   was used to map the center-of-mass positions, volumes, orientations,
   elastic strains, and stress tensors of over 1400 grains in-situ up to a
   true strain of 1.4\%. More than 700 tensile twins were observed to form
   in the mapped volume under deformation. The measured center-of-mass
   positions and grain volumes are used to construct various 3D
   microstructures and model them with a Crystal Plasticity Finite Element
   (CPFE) code. It is observed that the average grain-resolved stress did
   not always select the highest ranked Schmid factor twin variant. In
   fact, the contribution of lower ranked variants was non-negligible. The
   CPFE simulation indicates that there is a small variation in the stress
   within each grain in the elastic regime, which increases drastically
   upon the onset of plasticity. One of the significant outcomes of this
   work is the new statistical information on the interaction between twin
   and parent grain. It is shown that, on average, there is a small
   difference between the stress normal to the twin habit plane in the
   parent and twin, but that this is not the case for the shear acting on
   the habit plane. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation
   technologies have each been shown separately to be beneficial for
   optimizing screw and baseplate positioning in reverse shoulder
   arthroplasty (RSA) but to date have not been combined. This study
   describes development of a system for performing computer-assisted RSA
   glenoid baseplate and screw placement, including preoperative planning,
   intraoperative navigation, and postoperative evaluation, and compares
   this system with a conventional approach.
   Materials and methods: We used a custom-designed system allowing
   computed tomography (CT)-based preoperative planning, intraoperative
   navigation, and postoperative evaluation. Five orthopedic surgeons
   defined common preoperative plans on 3-dimensional CT reconstructed
   cadaveric shoulders. Each surgeon performed 3 computer-assisted and 3
   conventional simulated procedures. The 3-dimensional CT reconstructed
   postoperative units were digitally matched to the preoperative model for
   evaluation of entry points, end points, and angulations of screws and
   baseplate. Values were used to find accuracy and precision of the 2
   groups with respect to the defined placement. Statistical analysis was
   performed by t tests (alpha = .05).
   Results: Comparison of the groups revealed no difference in accuracy or
   precision of screws or baseplate entry points (P >.05). Accuracy and
   precision were improved with use of navigation for end points and
   angulations of 3 screws (P <.05). Accuracy of the inferior screw showed
   a trend of improvement with navigation (P >. 05). Navigated baseplate
   end point precision was improved (P <. 05), with a trend toward improved
   accuracy (P >.05).
   Conclusion: We conclude that CT-based preoperative planning and
   intraoperative navigation allow improved accuracy and precision for
   screw placement and precision for baseplate positioning with respect to
   a predefined placement compared with conventional techniques in RSA.

Abstract = {{This paper concerns the prediction of the bed development time of
   alluvial meandering streams. It is assumed that the stream centreline
   follows a sine-generated curve; the banks are rigid; the flow is
   turbulent and subcritical; and the width-to-depth ratio is ``large''.
   The bed is flat at the beginning of an ``experiment''. The bed
   development consists of the formation of large-scale, laterally adjacent
   pool-bar complexes strictly induced by the stream curvature. The paper
   is to be viewed as an extension of previous work by the writers, who
   have introduced an equation for the aforementioned bed development time,
   albeit with a proportionality factor that remains a not yet known
   function of the stream initial deflection angle. The objective of this
   paper is to reveal this function, and thus bring the equation for the
   bed development time into a form suitable for practical applications.
   This is achieved on the basis of a series of experiments carried out by
   the writers in three sine-generated meandering streams of varying
   sinuosity, as well as data from the literature. The paper concludes with
   examples of application of the resulting equation to real rivers. (C)

Abstract = {{Large-eddy simulations of the flow over surfaces with alternating forest
   patches and clearings of different horizontal scale were performed,
   modelling the forest canopies as a horizontally homogeneous drag field.
   The objective was to extend previous works that studied the flow over
   sudden changes in aerodynamic roughness length occurring typically in
   the transition between small vegetation and forest but neglected the
   variations of displacement height. It was found that the internal
   boundary layers that formed in the transition between surface patches
   initially grew similarly for both the sudden changes of roughness and
   the alternating forest patches and clearings, but the turbulence
   produced at the tops of trees could break the regular growth, increasing
   the vertical propagation of surface heterogeneity and, consequently, the
   blending height. Also, the forest patches enhanced the Reynolds shear
   stress at the tree height over the clearings: when the energy extraction
   by the forest canopy ceased, the turbulent fluctuations increased and
   the turbulent shear production was kept high over much of the following
   clearing. Consequently, the Reynolds shear stress over the clearings
   decayed slowly, or not at all in the case of short patches. This
   resulted in higher average shear stress and effective aerodynamic
   roughness length than was the case when variations of displacement
   height were neglected.}},

Abstract = {{Scintillating calorimeters are cryogenic detectors combining a
   measurement of scintillation with one of phonons to provide particle
   identification. In view of developing alkali halide devices of this type
   able to check the DAMA/LIBRA claim for the observation of dark matter,
   we have simulated detector performances to determine their sensitivity
   by two methods with little model-dependence. We conclude that if
   performance of the phonon channel can be brought in line with those of
   other materials, an exposure of 10 kg-days would suffice to check the
   DAMA/LIBRA claim in standard astrophysical scenarios. Additionally, a
   fairly modest array of 5 kg with background rejection would be able to
   directly check the DAMA/LIBRA modulation result in 2 years. (C) 2015

Title = {{Saliency-directed prioritization of visual data in wireless surveillance
   networks}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION FUSION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{16-30}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In wireless visual sensor networks (WVSNs), streaming all imaging data
   is impractical due to resource constraints. Moreover, the sheer volume
   of surveillance videos inhibits the ability of analysts to extract
   actionable intelligence. In this work, an energy-efficient image
   prioritization framework is presented to cope with the fragility of
   traditional WVSNs. The proposed framework selects semantically relevant
   information before it is transmitted to a sink node. This is based on
   salient motion detection, which works on the principle of human
   cognitive processes. Each camera node estimates the background by a
   bootstrapping procedure, thus increasing the efficiency of salient
   motion detection. Based on the salient motion, each sensor node is
   classified as being high or low priority. This classification is
   dynamic, such that camera nodes toggle between high-priority and
   low-priority status depending on the coverage of the region of interest.
   High-priority camera nodes are allowed to access reliable radio channels
   to ensure the timely and reliable transmission of data. We compare the
   performance of this framework with other state-ofthe-art methods for
   both single and multi-camera monitoring. The results demonstrate the
   usefulness of the proposed method in terms of salient event coverage and
   reduced computational and transmission costs, as well as in helping
   analysts find semantically relevant visual information. (C) 2014

   multitude of new optical elements for the terahertz regime. The
   fabricated samples are free-standing films and, hence, benefit from the

   dispersion, losses or alter the reflection properties. Three devices are
   demonstrated: a wire-grid polariser, a polarisation converter and

Volume = {{638}},

Abstract = {{Microstructures, retained austenite (RA) stability and tensile behaviour
   were investigated for an aluminum-alloyed TRIP steel. Two distinct
   microstructural variants (equiaxed and lamellar) were studied: (i) at
   constant volume percent RA and (ii) at constant UTS. The RA in the
   lamellar variant transforms more slowly with tensile strain than for the
   equiaxed variant and stabilizes at similar to 80\% transformed. The
   higher RA stability for lamellar microstructures is primarily due to the
   stress shielding effect of RA grains by the surrounding bainite. A
   secondary contributor is the elongated shape of the RA grains in the
   lamellar microstructure. The tensile work hardening behaviour correlates
   with RA transformation behaviour for the two model microstructural
   variants. The lamellar variant exhibits a relatively constant work
   hardening rate sustained up to the point of necking. By contrast, the
   equiaxed variant exhibits a maximum work hardening rate at low strain,
   followed by a monotonic decrease to the necking point. Comparing the
   results reported here with those of a previous study on silicon-alloyed
   TRIP steel shows that for both microstructural variants RA transforms
   more slowly with tensile strain and the UTS x El values are higher for
   the aluminum-alloyed steel. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present new wide-field photometry and spectroscopy of the globular
   clusters (GCs) around NGC 4649 (M60), the third brightest galaxy in the
   Virgo cluster. Imaging of NGC 4649 was assembled from a recently
   obtained Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys mosaic, and
   new Subaru/Suprime-Cam and archival Canada-France-Hawaii
   Telescope/MegaCam data. About 1200 sources were followed up
   spectroscopically using combined observations from three multi-object
   spectrographs: Keck/Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph,
   Gemini/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph and Multiple Mirror
   Telescope/Hectospec. We confirm 431 unique GCs belonging to NGC 4649, a
   factor of 3.5 larger than previous data sets and with a factor of 3
   improvement in velocity precision. We confirm significant GC colour
   bimodality and find that the red GCs are more centrally concentrated,
   while the blue GCs are more spatially extended. We infer negative GC
   colour gradients in the innermost 20 kpc and flat gradients out to large
   radii. Rotation is detected along the galaxy major axis for all tracers:
   blue GCs, red GCs, galaxy stars and planetary nebulae. We compare the
   observed properties of NGC 4649 with galaxy formation models. We find
   that formation via a major merger between two gas-poor galaxies,
   followed by satellite accretion, can consistently reproduce the
   observations of NGC 4649 at different radii. We find no strong evidence
   to support an interaction between NGC 4649 and the neighbouring spiral
   galaxy NGC 4647. We identify interesting GC kinematic features in our
   data, such as counter-rotating subgroups and bumpy kinematic profiles,
   which encode more clues about the formation history of NGC 4649.}},

Abstract = {{Radiochromic leuco crystal violet (LCV) micelle gel dosimeters are
   promising three-dimensional radiation dosimeters because of their
   spatial stability and suitability for optical readout. The effects of
   surfactant type and surfactant concentration on dose sensitivity of LCV
   micelle gels are tested, demonstrating that dose sensitivity and initial
   colour of the gel increases with increasing Triton x-100 (Tx100)
   concentration. Using Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in place of
   Tx100 produces gels that are nearly colourless prior to irradiation, but
   reduces the dose sensitivity. The separate effects of Tri-chloro acetic
   acid concentration and pH are investigated, revealing that controlling
   the pH near 3.6 is crucial for achieving high dose sensitivity. The
   sensitizing effect of chlorinated species on dose sensitivity is tested
   using 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (TCE), chloroform, and
   1,1,1-trichloro-2methyl-2-propanol hemihydrate. TCE gives the largest
   improvement in dose sensitivity and is recommended for use in micelle
   gel dosimeters because it is less volatile and safer to use than
   chloroform. Preliminary experiments on a new gel containing CTAB as the
   surfactant and TCE show that this new gel gives a dose sensitivity that
   is 24\% higher than that of previous LCV micelle gels and is nearly
   colourless prior to irradiation.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, recipe optimization of Leuco Crystal Violet (LCV) micelle
   gels made with the surfactant Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB)
   and the chemical sensitizer 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (TCE) was aided by a
   two-level three-factor designed experiment. The optimized recipe
   contains 0.75 mM LCV, 17.0 mM CTAB, 120 mM TCE, 25.0 mM tri-chloro
   acetic acid (TCAA), 4 wt\% gelatin and similar to 96 wt\% water. Dose
   sensitivity of the optimized gel is 1.5 times higher than that of
   Jordan's standard LCV micelle gel. Spatial integrity of the 3D dose
   distribution information in 1L phantoms filled with this recipe is
   maintained for > 120 d. Unfortunately, phantoms made using the optimized
   recipe showed dose-rate dependence (14\% difference in optical
   attenuation at the peak dose using electron beam irradiations at 100 and
   400 MU min(-1)). Further testing suggests that the surfactant CTAB is
   the cause of this dose rate behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The underlying mechanisms for the nucleation of carbon nanotubes as well
   as their helicity, remain elusive. Here, using van der Waals dispersion
   force calculations implemented within density functional theory, we
   study the cap formation, believed to be responsible for the chirality of
   surface-catalyzed carbon nanotubes. We find the energetics associated
   with growth along different facets to be independent of the surface
   orientation and that the growth across an edge along the axis of the
   metal particle leads to a perfect honeycomb lattice in a curved
   geometry. The formation of defects in the graphene matrix, which bend
   the carbon plane, requires that two or more graphene embryos with
   significantly different growth axis merge. Such scenario is only
   possible at the front- or back-end of the metal particle where growth
   symmetry is broken. The graphene embryos reconstruct their hexagonal
   structure into pentagons, heptagons, and octagons counterpart to
   accommodate the tube curvature.}},

Abstract = {{A novel and facile strategy to modify chitosan (CTS) with a wide catalog
   of well-defined molecular weight graft hydrophilic and hydrophobic
   polymers and copolymers via nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) in
   homogeneous media is reported. This strategy involves three steps:
   functionalization of CTS with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and sodium
   dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) to yield CTS-SDBS-g-GMA, which is soluble
   in organic media; synthesis of SG1-terminated polymers including
   poly(styrene) (PS), poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA), poly(acrylic acid)
   (PAA), poly(styrene-b-acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA), and
   poly(styrene-r-acrylic acid) (PS-r-PAA) via SG1-based nitroxide-mediated
   polymerization; and grafting of the SG1-functionalized polymers or
   copolymers to CTS-SDBS-g-GMA. Following polymerization, the SOBS was
   removed from the new CTS-based materials. NMR, TGA, and FT-IR were used
   to confirm the synthesis of CTS-SDBS-g-GMA, CTS-SDBS-g-GMA-PS,
   CTS-SDBS-g-GMA-PBA, CTS-SDBS-g-GMA-PAA, CTS-SDBS-g-GMA-PS-b-PAA, and
   CTS-SDBS-g-GMA-PS-r-PAA. The SOBS was then fully removed from the new
   CTS-based graft copolymers. New CTS-based materials could find potential
   applications in fields such as biomedical, water and wastewater
   treatment, biopharmaceutics and agriculture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A series of in situ compression tests have been carried out at room
   temperature on three dual-phase Zr-2.5 wt\% Nb alloys with different
   concentrations of the interstitial alloying elements oxygen and iron.
   Oxygen and iron are potent strengthening additives in two-phase alloys
   with a hexagonal-close packed alpha phase and body-centred cubic beta
   phase, such as the Zr-Nb and Ti-V-Al systems. The evolution of
   interphase stress, along with the progression of twinning, were
   monitored during deformation by neutron diffraction. The twin volume
   fraction measured following deformation was not strongly dependent on
   ingot chemistry, contrary to previously reported results. Annealing in
   the alpha+beta and the beta region allowed for variation in the initial
   residual stress distribution and crystallographic texture, respectively,
   and the effect of these parameters on deformation mode selection was
   also investigated. Interstitial oxygen has a greater strengthening
   effect on prismatic < a > slip than on basal < a > slip at room
   temperature. High impurity contents were not observed to suppress \{10
   (1) over bar2\}< 10 (1) over bar1 > tensile twinning. Despite being an
   alpha-stabilizer, oxygen is observed to strengthen the beta phase under
   suitable heat treatment conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A satellite galaxy or dark matter subhalo that passes through a stellar
   disc may excite coherent oscillations in the disc perpendicular to its
   plane. We determine the properties of these modes for various
   self-gravitating plane symmetric systems (Spitzer sheets) using the
   matrix method of Kalnajs. In particular, we find an infinite series of
   modes for the case of a barotropic fluid. In general, for a
   collisionless system, there is a double series of modes, which include
   normal modes and/or Landau-damped oscillations depending on the phase
   space distribution function of the stars. Even Landau-damped
   oscillations may decay slowly enough to persist for several hundred Myr.
   We discuss the implications of these results for the recently discovered
   vertical perturbations in the kinematics of solar neighbourhood stars
   and for broader questions surrounding secular phenomena such as spiral
   structure in disc galaxies.}},

Title = {{ESTIMATING THE GALACTIC MASS PROFILE IN THE PRESENCE OF INCOMPLETE DATA}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{806}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{A powerful method to measure the mass profile of a galaxy is through the
   velocities of tracer particles distributed through its halo.
   Transforming this kind of data accurately to a mass profile M (r),
   however, is not a trivial problem. In particular, limited or incomplete
   data may substantially affect the analysis. In this paper we develop a
   Bayesian method to deal with incomplete data effectively; we have a
   hybrid-Gibbs sampler that treats the unknown velocity components of
   tracers as parameters in the model. We explore the effectiveness of our
   model using simulated data and then apply our method to the Milky Way
   (MW) using velocity and position data from globular clusters and dwarf
   galaxies. We find that, in general, missing velocity components have
   little effect on the total mass estimate. However, the results are quite
   sensitive to the outer cluster Pal 3. Using a basic Hernquist model with
   an isotropic velocity dispersion, we obtain credible regions for the
   cumulative mass profile M (r) of the MW and provide estimates for the
   model parameters with 95\% Bayesian credible intervals. The mass
   contained within 260 kpc is 1.37 x 10(12) M-circle dot, with a 95\%
   credible interval of (1.27, 1.51) x 10(12) M-circle dot. The Hernquist
   parameters for the total mass and scale radius are 1.55(-0.13) (+0.18) x
   10(12) M-circle dot and 16.9(-4.1) (+4.8) kpc, where the uncertainties
   span the 95\% credible intervals. The code we developed for this work,
   Galactic Mass Estimator (GME), will be available as an open source
   package in the R Project for Statistical Computing.}},

Abstract = {{In this Letter, an unambiguous synthetic strategy is reported for the
   preparation of enantiomerically pure cis-5-halo-piperazic acid
   derivatives in single diastereoisomer form. Contrary to the recent
   report by Shin and co-workers (Chem. Lett. 2001, 1172), in which it is
   claimed that the Ph3P and N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS)-mediated
   chlorination of (3R,5S)-trans-N(1),N(2)-di-t-Boc-5-hydroxy-piperazic
   acid derivative 1 proceeds with retention of configuration at C(5) to
   give 2, we now show that this and related Ph3P-mediated halogenations
   all occur with S(N)2 inversion at the alcohol center, as is customary
   for such reactions. Specifically, we demonstrate that the
   (3R,5S)-trans-5-Cl-piperazic acid derivative 2 claimed by Shin and
   co-workers (Chem. Lett. 2001, 1172) is in actual fact the chlorinated
   (3S,5R)-enantiomer 6, which must have been prepared from the
   cis-(3S,5S)-alcohol 3, a molecule whose synthesis is not formally
   described in the Shin paper. We further show here that the
   cis-(3R,5R)-5-Cl-Piz 13 claimed by Shin and co-workers in Chem. Lett.
   2001, 1172, is also (3S,5R)-trans-5-Cl-Piz 6. Authentic 13 has now been
   synthesized by us, for the very first time, here. Since Lindsley and
   Kennedy have recently utilized the now invalid Shin and co-workers'
   retentive Ph3P/NCS chlorination procedure on 1 in their synthetic
   approach to piperazimycin A (Tetrahedron Lett. 2010, 51, 2493), it
   follows that their claimed 5-Cl-Piz-containing dipeptide 25 probably has
   the alternate structure 26, where the 5-Cl-Piz residue has a
   3,5-cis-configuration. The aforementioned stereochemical misassignments
   appear to have come from a mix-up of starting materials by Shin and
   co-workers (Chem. Lett. 2001, 1172), and an under-appreciation of the
   various steric and conformational effects that operate in N(2)-acylated
   piperazic acid systems, most especially rotameric A(1,3)-strain. The
   latter has now been unambiguously delineated and defined here under the
   banner of the A(1,3)-rotamer effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Generating Electricity during Walking with a Lower Limb-Driven Energy
   Harvester: Targeting a Minimum User Effort}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Much research in the field of energy harvesting has sought to develop
   devices capable of generating electricity during daily activities with
   minimum user effort. No previous study has considered the metabolic cost
   of carrying the harvester when determining the energetic effects it has
   on the user. When considering device carrying costs, no energy harvester
   to date has demonstrated the ability to generate a substantial amount of
   electricity (> 5W) while maintaining a user effort at the same level or
   lower than conventional power generation methods (e.g. hand crank
   generator).
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We developed a lower limb-driven energy harvester that is able to
   generate approximately 9W of electricity. To quantify the performance of
   the harvester, we introduced a new performance measure, total cost of
   harvesting (TCOH), which evaluates a harvester's overall efficiency in
   generating electricity including the device carrying cost. The new
   harvester captured the motion from both lower limbs and operated in the
   generative braking mode to assist the knee flexor muscles in slowing the
   lower limbs. From a testing on 10 participants under different walking
   conditions, the harvester achieved an average TCOH of 6.1, which is
   comparable to the estimated TCOH for a conventional power generation
   method of 6.2. When generating 5.2W of electricity, the TCOH of the
   lower limb-driven energy harvester (4.0) is lower than that of
   conventional power generation methods.
   Conclusions/Significance
   These results demonstrated that the lower limb-driven energy harvester
   is an energetically effective option for generating electricity during
   daily activities.}},

Abstract = {{Electric vehicles (EV) are proposed as a measure to reduce greenhouse

   be implemented using Smart Grid controls. This research presents the
   results of an EV roll-out in the all island grid (AIG) in Ireland using
   the long term generation expansion planning model called the Wien
   Automatic System Planning IV (WASP-IV) tool to measure carbon dioxide
   emissions and changes in total energy. The model incorporates all
   generators and operational requirements while meeting environmental
   emissions, fuel availability and generator operational and maintenance
   constraints to optimize economic dispatch and unit commitment power
   dispatch. In the study three distinct scenarios are investigated base

Abstract = {{Two radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) downconverters are
   presented, each consisting of an active mixer and a variable gain
   amplifier (VGA). The downconverter blocks (DCBs) have identical mixing
   stages but different VGA topologies. The mixers use a commutating
   switching network and a low-noise RF transconductance stage to reduce
   the system noise figure (NF). VGA gain control in one DCB (DCB-1) is
   done using a current-steering approach, while the second DCB (DCB-2)
   employs a transistor-based attenuator. Both RFICs were designed and
   fabricated using a standard 130-nm CMOS process and they were tested
   over the RF band covering 1-6 GHz and at an IF of 140 MHz. Measurements
   show that the conversion gain (CG) of DCB-1 ranges from 9.6 to 25.3 dB,
   and for DCB-2, the CG ranges from 10.7 to 23.7 dB. The minimum
   double-sideband NF for both the downconverters is 3.8 dB but their
   maximum NFs are different: 1) 14.2 dB for DCB-1 and 2) 11.5 dB for
   DCB-2.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the efflux velocity in a ship's propeller jet is the key to
   calculating the velocity at any other location within the diffusing jet.
   Current semi-empirical equations used to calculate the magnitude of the
   efflux velocity have been based on studies that employed a limited range
   of propeller characteristics. This paper reports on the findings of an
   experimental investigation into the magnitude of the efflux velocities
   of the jets produced by four different propellers, where the
   characteristic of the blade geometry has been chosen to extend the range
   of applicability of the outcomes. Measurements of velocity have been
   made using a three-dimensional laser Doppler anemometry system, with the
   test propellers operating at a range of rotational speeds that bound
   typical operational values. Comparisons are made with current predictive
   theories and, to aid engineers in the design of marine infrastructure,
   methods are presented by which the three-dimensional efflux velocity
   components, as well as the resultant efflux value, can be more
   accurately determined.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a current sensorless adaptive secondary-side control is
   proposed for the series resonant converter (SRC), making it a good
   candidate for MHz 48 voltage regulators. By means of varying ac
   equivalent resistance, the output voltage regulation is achieved by
   controlling the duty cycle of the synchronous MOSFET. By taking
   advantage of the secondary-side control, SRCs can operate under
   zero-voltage switching at any input voltage and load conditions. A
   current sensorless adaptive digital control is proposed to control the
   current-type synchronous MOSFETs, which automatically compensates the
   delay caused by the current-sensor circuit and the gate driver, and also
   eliminates the current sensor in the power path. A hybrid control
   strategy is introduced to overcome the efficiency degradation caused by
   the secondary-side control.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an adaptive and intelligent power control approach
   for microgrid systems in the gridconnected operation mode. The proposed
   critic-based adaptive control system contains a neuro-fuzzy controller
   and a fuzzy critic agent. The fuzzy critic agent employs a reinforcement
   learning algorithm based on neuro-dynamic programming. The system
   feedback is made available to the critic agent's input as the
   controller's action in the previous state. The evaluation or
   reinforcement signal produced by the critic agent together with the
   back-propagation of error is then used for online tuning of the output
   layer weights of the neuro-fuzzy controller. The proposed controller
   shows superior results compared with the traditional PI control. The
   transient response time is significantly reduced, power oscillations are
   eliminated, and fast convergence is achieved. The simple design and
   improved dynamic behavior of the proposed controller make it a promising
   nominee for power control of microgrid systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a new model is presented for the dilation angle of rocks

   This model, which is defined by a smaller number of independent

   a wide variety of rocks (sedimentary rocks, diabase, marble, granites,
   and quartzite). A detailed investigation of each model parameter is
   performed, and potential links to geological and geotechnical properties
   are made. A mechanistic interpretation of the observed dilation angle
   data is also presented, in the context of the new model. Model
   parameters for the rock types studied are presented, and recommendations
   for parameter determination/estimation are made. The key strength of the
   model is shown to be its flexibility to accommodate a data-poor or

Abstract = {{Rateless codes have been shown to be able to provide greater flexibility

   following, we optimize rateless codes for unequal error protection (UEP)
   for multimedia multicasting to a set of heterogeneous users. The
   proposed designs have the objectives of providing either guaranteed or
   best-effort quality of service (QoS). A randomly interleaved rateless
   encoder is proposed whereby users only need to decode symbols up to
   their own QoS level. The proposed coder is optimized based on measured
   transmission properties of standardized raptor codes over wireless
   channels. It is shown that a guaranteed QoS problem formulation can be
   transformed into a convex optimization problem, yielding a globally
   optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed
   optimized random interleaved UEP rateless coder's performance compares
   favorably with that of other recently proposed UEP rateless codes.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Big data analysis is an emerging research topic in various domains, and
   clone detection is no exception. The goal is to create big data
   inter-project clone corpora across open-source or corporate-source code
   repositories. Such corpora can be used to study developer behavior and
   to reduce engineering costs by extracting globally duplicated efforts
   into new APIs and as a basis for code completion and API usage support.
   However, building scalable clone detection tools is challenging. It is
   often impractical to use existing state-of-the-art tools to analyze big
   data because the memory and execution time required exceed the average
   user's resources. Some tools have inherent limitations in their data
   structures and algorithms that prevent the analysis of big data even
   when extraordinary resources are available. These limitations are
   impossible to overcome if the source code of the tool is unavailable or
   if the user lacks the time or expertise to modify the tool without
   harming its performance or accuracy. In this research, we have
   investigated the use of our shuffling framework for scaling classical
   clone detection tools to big data. The framework achieves scalability on
   commodity hardware by partitioning the input dataset into subsets
   manageable by the tool and computing resources. A non-deterministic
   process is used to randomly `shuffle' the contents of the dataset into a
   series of subsets. The tool is executed for each subset, and its output
   for each is merged into a single report. This approach does not require
   modification to the subject tools, allowing their individual strengths
   and precision to be captured at an acceptable loss of recall. In our
   study, we explored the performance and applicability of the framework
   for the big data dataset, IJaDataset 2.0, which consists of 356 million
   lines of code from 25,000 open-source Java projects. We begin with a
   computationally inexpensive version of our framework based on pure
   random shuffling. This version was successful at scaling the tools to
   IJaDataset but required many subsets to achieve a desirable recall.
   Using our findings, we incrementally improved the framework to achieve a
   satisfactory recall using fewer resources. We investigated the use of
   efficient file tracking and file-similarity heuristics to bias the
   shuffling algorithm toward subsets of the dataset that contain
   undetected clone pairs. These changes were successful in improving the
   recall performance of the framework. Our study shows that the framework
   is able to achieve up to 90-95\% of a tool's native recall using
   standard hardware. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{With the proliferation of geo-positioning and geo-tagging techniques,
   spatio-textual objects that possess both a geographical location and a
   textual description are gaining in prevalence, and spatial keyword
   queries that exploit both location and textual description are gaining
   in prominence. However, the queries studied so far generally focus on
   finding individual objects that each satisfy a query rather than finding
   groups of objects where the objects in a group together satisfy a query.
   We define the problem of retrieving a group of spatio-textual objects
   such that the group's keywords cover the query's keywords and such that
   the objects are nearest to the query location and have the smallest
   inter-object distances. Specifically, we study three instantiations of
   this problem, all of which are NP-hard. We devise exact solutions as
   well as approximate solutions with provable approximation bounds to the
   problems. In addition, we solve the problems of retrieving top-k groups
   of three instantiations, and study a weighted version of the problem
   that incorporates object weights. We present empirical studies that
   offer insight into the efficiency of the solutions, as well as the
   accuracy of the approximate solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene, with its unique electronic and structural qualities, has
   become an important playground for studying adsorption and assembly of
   various materials including organic molecules. Moreover,
   organic/graphene vertical structures assembled by van der Waals
   interaction have potential for multifunctional device applications.
   Here, we investigate structural and electrical properties of vertical
   heterostructures composed of C-60 thin film on graphene. The assembled
   film structure of C-60 on graphene is investigated using transmission
   electron microscopy, which reveals a uniform morphology of C-60 film on
   graphene with a grain size as large as 500 nm. The strong epitaxial
   relations between C-60 crystal and graphene lattice directions are
   found, and van der Waals ab initio calculations support the observed
   phenomena. Moreover, using C-60 graphene heterostructures, we fabricate
   vertical graphene transistors incorporating n-type organic
   semiconducting materials with an on/off ratio above 3 x 10(3). Our work
   demonstrates that graphene can serve as an excellent substrate for
   assembly of molecules, and attained organic/graphene heterostructures
   have great potential for electronics applications.}},

Abstract = {{A novel similarity-based form is derived of the transport equation for
   the second-order velocity structure function of <(delta q)(2)> along the
   centreline of a round turbulent jet using an equilibrium similarity
   analysis. This self-similar equation has the advantage of requiring less
   extensive measurements to calculate the inhomogeneous (decay and
   production) terms of the transport equation. It is suggested that the
   normalised thirdorder structure function can be uniquely determined when
   the normalised second-order structure function, the power-law exponent
   of < q(2)> and the decay rate constants of < u(2)> and < v(2)> are
   available. In addition, the current analysis demonstrates that the
   assumption of similarity, combined with an inverse relation between the
   mean velocity U and the streamwise distance x-x(0) from the virtual
   origin (i.e. U alpha (x - x(0))(-1)), is sufficient to predict a
   power-law decay for the turbulence kinetic energy (< q(2)> alpha (x -
   x(0))(m)), rather than requiring a power-law decay (m = -2) as an
   additional ad hoc assumption. On the basis of the current analysis, it
   is suggested that the mean kinetic energy dissipation rate, <epsilon > ,
   varies as (x - x(0))(m-2). These theoretical results are tested against
   new experimental data obtained along the centreline of a round turbulent
   jet as well as previously published data on round jets for 11 000 <=
   Re-D <= 184 000 over the range 10 <= x/D <= 90. For the present
   experiments, < q(2)> exhibits power-law behaviour with m = -1.83. The
   validity of this solution is confirmed using other experimental data
   where < q(2)> follows a power law with 1 : 89 <= m <= -1.78. The present
   similarity form of the transport equation for <(delta q)(2)> is also
   shown to be closely satisfied by the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{The Bay of Quinte, Ontario, receives excessive nutrient loads and
   suffers from poor water quality. The 70 km long z-shaped bay traps the
   nutrients due to limited flushing with Lake Ontario, leading to
   increased nutrient residence times. Therefore, it is important to
   understand the three-dimensional hydrodynamic conditions within the bay,
   as these drive horizontal transport, dilution of nutrient rich inflows
   and water exchange to the lake. In this study, the effects of
   meteorological forcing, river inflows and Lake Ontario exchange on the
   hydrodynamics and mixing were investigated using a numerical model. The
   model was validated against temperature time series and profile data,
   with a maximum root-mean-square deviation < 2.3 degrees C in comparison
   to observed temperature profiles. Six methods were applied to estimate
   flushing from the bay, with three methods (tracer release, drifter
   paths, bulk residence time) converging to predict the main channel of
   the bay flushes 5 times a year. Isolated embayments have higher water
   ages (4-5 months) and may trap nutrients with sufficient time and
   conditions for algae blooms to occur. Strong advection is modeled in the
   main channel, with low horizontal transport in the embayments and
   efficient flushing near the connection with Lake Ontario. This provides
   insight for watershed management, for example, to design ideal locations
   for nutrient discharges (e.g. wastewater plumes), to target specific
   rivers for nutrient load reductions, and to support future coupled
   hydrodynamic and biogeochemical modeling of the bay. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The surface transport of point and non-point source discharges into
   eastern Lake Ontario and upper St. Lawrence River was modeled as passive
   tracers using the Estuary and Lake Computer Model (ELCOM) during the
   ice-free period of 2006. Model hydrodynamics were validated against
   temperature and current observations and Lagrangian drifter tracks.
   Root-mean-square (RMS) errors of simulated temperature profiles were
   comparable to other model applications; however, current RMS errors and
   Fourier Norms were nominally larger than in open lake applications, and
   RMS errors for drifter tracks were 0.5-4.0 km (3 day duration). The
   errors in simulating currents and drifters, relative to temperatures,
   are likely the result of the difficulty in representing the complex
   geometry of the region, which is composed of numerous channels and
   islands. To determine the physical processes responsible for tracer
   transport, cross-correlation coefficients were calculated when model
   processes were switched off (e.g., wind forcing, surface thermodynamics,
   Earth rotation, St. Lawrence River outflow, etc.). Wind was found to be
   the most dominant process forcing transport of tracers both in the
   Kingston Basin and the St. Lawrence River, whereas the St. Lawrence
   River outflow, controlled by the Moses Saunders Dam, was found to
   influence the transport of tracers along the river. Tracers were
   transported similar to 60 km eastward under moderate to strong winds (>5
   ms(-1)), remained nearshore when constrained within channels or by
   islands and had minimum dilutions of 20\% and 39\% at the Kingston
   Central and Kingston West drinking water intakes, respectively. The
   results suggest that factors such as the proximity between intakes and
   outfalls and presence of flow constraining topography, should be
   considered in future source and wastewater planning. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A mathematical model is developed to simulate the production of
   bio-based polytrimethylene ether glycol (PO3G) using 1,3-propanediol.
   The effect of super-acid catalyst is accounted for in the model, as is
   mass transfer of small species (water, monomer, and propanal) and linear
   oligomers (dimer to heptamer). This model correctly predicts dynamic
   trends in concentrations of linear oligomers, but the predicted maxima
   in these concentrations appear slightly earlier than in the experimental
   data. Predictions of the degree of polymerization (DP) are improved
   compared with those from a previous model, where evaporation of linear
   oligomers was not considered. Additional model improvements, including
   accounting for the effects of cyclic oligomers, are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{We study multicarrier multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO)
   systems, in which the base station employs an asymptotically large
   number of antennas. We analyze a fully correlated channel matrix and
   provide a beam domain channel model, where the channel gains are
   independent of sub-carriers. For this model, we first derive a
   closed-form upper bound on the achievable ergodic sum-rate, based on
   which, we develop asymptotically necessary and sufficient conditions for
   optimal downlink transmission that require only statistical channel
   state information at the transmitter. Furthermore, we propose a beam
   division multiple access (BDMA) transmission scheme that simultaneously
   serves multiple users via different beams. By selecting users within
   non-overlapping beams, the MU-MIMO channels can be equivalently
   decomposed into multiple single-user MIMO channels; this scheme
   significantly reduces the overhead of channel estimation, as well as,
   the processing complexity at transceivers. For BDMA transmission, we
   work out an optimal pilot design criterion to minimize the mean square
   error (MSE) and provide optimal pilot sequences by utilizing the
   Zadoff-Chu sequences. Simulations demonstrate the near-optimal
   performance of BDMA transmission and the advantages of the proposed
   pilot sequences.}},

Title = {{An Efficient LS-SVM-Based Method for Fuzzy System Construction}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an efficient learning mechanism to build fuzzy
   rule-based systems through the construction of sparse least-squares
   support vector machines (LS-SVMs). In addition to the significantly
   reduced computational complexity in model training, the resultant
   LS-SVM-based fuzzy system is sparser while offers satisfactory
   generalization capability over unseen data. It is well known that the
   LS-SVMs have their computational advantage over conventional SVMs in the
   model training process; however, the model sparseness is lost, which is
   the main drawback of LS-SVMs. This is an open problem for the LS-SVMs.
   To tackle the nonsparseness issue, a new regression alternative to the
   Lagrangian solution for the LS-SVM is first presented. A novel efficient
   learning mechanism is then proposed in this paper to extract a sparse
   set of support vectors for generating fuzzy IF-THEN rules. This novel
   mechanism works in a stepwise subset selection manner, including a
   forward expansion phase and a backward exclusion phase in each selection
   step. The implementation of the algorithm is computationally very
   efficient due to the introduction of a few key techniques to avoid the
   matrix inverse operations to accelerate the training process. The
   computational efficiency is also confirmed by detailed computational
   complexity analysis. As a result, the proposed approach is not only able
   to achieve the sparseness of the resultant LS-SVM-based fuzzy systems
   but significantly reduces the amount of computational effort in model
   training as well. Three experimental examples are presented to
   demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed learning
   mechanism and the sparseness of the obtained LS-SVM-based fuzzy systems,
   in comparison with other SVM-based learning techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with integrated design and operation of energy
   systems that are subject to significant uncertainties. The problem is
   cast as a two-stage stochastic programming problem, which can be
   transformed into a large-scale nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear
   programming problem (MINLP). The MINLP exhibits a decomposable structure
   that can be exploited by nonconvex generalized Benders decomposition
   (NGBD) for efficient global optimization. This paper extends the NGBD
   method developed by the authors recently, such that the method can
   handle non-separable functions and integer operational decisions. Both
   the standard NGBD algorithm and an enhanced one with piecewise convex
   relaxations are discussed. The advantages of the proposed formulation
   and solution method are demonstrated through case studies of two
   industrial energy systems, a natural gas production network and a
   polygeneration plant. The first example shows that the two-stage
   stochastic programming formulation can result in better expected
   economic performance than the deterministic formulation, and that NGBD
   is more efficient than a state-of-the-art global optimization solver.
   The second example shows that the integration of piecewise convex
   relaxations can improve the efficiency of NGBD by at least an order of
   magnitude. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel electrical current applied technique known as flash sintering
   has been applied to rapidly (within 10min) densify electrolytes
   including Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 (GDC20), Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC10), and
   Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC20) for application in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells
   (SOFCs). The densification temperature for the three electrolytes was
   554 degrees C, 635 degrees C, and 667 degrees C, respectively, which is
   far below conventional sintering temperatures. All specimens after flash
   sintering maintained the pure fluorite structure and exhibited a
   well-densified microstructure. To investigate the flash-sintering
   mechanism, we have applied Joule heating effect with blackbody radiation
   theory, and found that this theory could reasonably interpret the
   flash-sintering phenomenon by matching theoretically calculated
   temperature with the real temperature. More importantly, one of the
   materials inherent properties, the electronic conductivity, has been
   found correlated with the onset of flash sintering, which indicates that
   the electrons and holes are the primary current carriers during the
   start of flash-sintering process. As a result, potential densification
   mechanisms have been discussed in terms of spark plasma discharge.}},

Abstract = {{We analyse a high-resolution spectropolarimetric data set collected for
   the He-weak B3p IV star HR 2949. The Zeeman effect is visible in the
   circularly polarized component of numerous spectral lines. The
   longitudinal magnetic field varies between approximately -650 and +150
   G. The polar strength of the surface magnetic dipole is calculated to be
   2.4(-0.2)(+0.3) kG. The star has strong overabundances of Fe-peak
   elements, along with extremely strong overabundances of rare-earth
   elements; however, He, Al, and S are underabundant. This implies that HR
   2949 is a chemically peculiar star. Variability is seen in all
   photospheric lines, likely due to abundance patches as seen in many
   Ap/Bp stars. Longitudinal magnetic field variations measured from
   different spectral lines yield different results, likely a consequence
   of uneven sampling of the photospheric magnetic field by the abundance
   patches. Analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data for both HR 2949
   and its companion star, HR 2948, suggests a revision of HR 2949's
   fundamental parameters: in particular, it is somewhat larger, hotter,
   and more luminous than previously believed. There is no evidence of
   optical or ultraviolet emission originating in HR 2949's magnetosphere,
   despite its moderately strong magnetic field and relatively rapid
   rotation; however, when calculated using theoretical and empirical
   boundaries on the initial rotational velocity, the spin-down age is
   compatible with the stellar age. With the extensive phase coverage
   presented here, HR 2949 will make an excellent subject for Zeeman
   Doppler imaging.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate fit of a patient-specific instrument guide during an
   intervention is one of the critical factors affecting accuracy of the
   surgical procedure. In this study, we investigated how well osteophytes,
   which are abnormal bone growths that form along joints, are depicted in
   clinical preoperative CT scans and estimated the influence of such
   depiction errors on the intraoperative accuracy of the guide.
   In 34 hip resurfacing patients, 227 osteophyte surface points on the
   anterior aspect of the femoral neck were collected intraoperatively,
   using an optoelectronic navigation system. These points were registered
   to a preoperative CT scan of the patient, and distances between
   collected points and segmented virtual bone surface, as well as
   Hounsfield units for these points, were determined. We simulated the
   registration error of a patient-specific guide, using a modified
   registration algorithm, to test placement on the anterior aspect of the
   femoral neck without removing any osteophytes. This error was then
   applied to the surgical plan of the femoral central-pin position and
   orientation for evaluation.
   The average distance between the collected points and the segmented
   surface was 2.6 mm. We estimated the average error for the entrance
   point of the central-pin to be 0.7 mm in the distal direction and 3.2 mm
   in the anterior direction. The average orientation error was in
   anteversion.
   The depiction of osteophytes in clinical preoperative CT scans for
   proximal femurs can be unreliable and can possibly result in significant
   intraoperative instrument alignment errors during image-guided
   surgeries.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{469-479}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Real-time early warning systems for shallow landslides are typically
   built upon real-time measurements and forecasts of rainfall and
   empirical correlations between past patterns of rainfall and landslide
   occurrence. Whereas these relationships describe whether certain
   combinations of rainfall and preexisting groundwater levels are of
   elevated risk of landslide triggering, not all combinations leading to
   landslide events necessarily have the same consequences in terms of
   landslide mobility (velocity and distal reach of the landslide). In this
   paper, the technique of geotechnical centrifuge modeling is used to
   quantitatively evaluate the hypothesis that the mobility of a landslide
   triggered under elevated antecedent groundwater conditions is higher
   than scenarios under drier antecedent conditions. Five identical slope
   models with a shallow depth to bedrock were subjected to different
   antecedent conditions ranging from zero groundwater flux to nearly
   saturated conditions prior to rainfall. The results from these scenarios
   show that higher antecedent groundwater conditions can result in
   landslides with velocities about three times higher and travel distances
   about eight times higher than low antecedent conditions due to static
   liquefaction of the soil at the base of the slope.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with strategic optimization of a typical
   industrial chemical supply chain, which involves a material purchase and
   transportation network, several manufacturing plants with on-site
   material and product inventories, a product transportation network, and
   several regional markets. In order to address large uncertainties in
   customer demands at the different regional markets, a novel robust
   scenario formulation, which has been recently developed by the authors,
   is tailored and applied for strategic optimization. Case study results
   show that the robust scenario formulation works well for this real
   industrial supply chain system, and it outperforms the deterministic
   formulation and the classical scenario-based stochastic programming
   formulation by generating better expected economic performance and
   solutions that are guaranteed to be feasible for all uncertainty
   realizations. The robust scenario problem exhibits a decomposable
   structure that can be taken advantage of by Benders decomposition for
   efficient solution, so the application of Benders decomposition to the
   solution of the strategic optimization is also discussed. The case study
   results show that Benders decomposition can reduce the solution time by
   almost an order of magnitude when the number of scenarios in the problem
   is large.}},

Abstract = {{The 2.67 Ga Hackett River volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits
   located in the northeastern Slave province, Nunavut, Canada, are among
   the largest undeveloped massive sulfide resources in Canada and are
   silver rich compared to other such deposits of similar age, with Ag
   grades up to 3,000 g/t. The deposits are hosted by the Ignerit Formation
   of the felsic to intermediate calc-alkaline Hackett River Group
   metavolcanic rocks that are part of the province-wide supracrustal
   Yellowknife Supergroup. One of the most economically significant of the
   Hackett River deposits is the Hackett River Main zone (Main zone), which
   consists of two parts: a stratigraphically lower chalcopyrite-rich
   stringer zone and an upper massive to semi massive polymetallic sulfide
   lens. The mineralization is subdivided into five types based on
   mineralogy, textures, and approximate stratigraphic position: (1.)
   disseminated footwall sulfides, (2) copper-rich stringer sulfides, (3)
   pyrite-poor sphalerite-pyrrhotite-chalcoprite mineralization at the top
   of the stringer zone, (4) mineralization in calc-silicate altered
   calcareous tuff units, and (5) sphalerite-pyrite massive sulfide. In
   type 1 mineralization, disseminated pyrite, pyrrhotite, and sphalerite
   contain negligible Ag and in type 2, Bi-Ag-(Pb)) sulfides, Ag-Bi-Se
   enriched galena and chalcopyrite are the dominant Ag hosts. Within type
   3, Ag-rich tetrahedrite (freibergite) and galena are the main Ag hosts.
   In type 4, Ag is hosted in disseminated electrum and freibergite, and
   within type 5 mineralization, freibergite hosts 99\% of the Ag. Overall
   within the Main zone, Ag-rich freibergite contains 79.4\% of the Ag,
   whereas chalcopyrite hosts 6.3\% and galena contains 1.8\%. Trace
   minerals such as electrum host the remainder of the Ag, and these have a
   limited spatial distribution.
   Zone refining is the most important control on the distribution of Ag
   within the Main zone and the principal controls on Ag residence are
   mineralizing fluid temperature, deposit-scale relative redox conditions,
   sulfidation state, location of the mineralization relative to the
   hydrothermal conduit, and the ratio of Bi to SI) in the mineralizing
   fluid available for coupled substitution. Within the freibergite and
   chalcopyrite, Ag directly substitutes for Cu and replaces Pb in galena
   by coupled substitution with Bi and, to a lesser extent, SI). Lower
   temperatures <ca. 250 degrees C and more oxidizing conditions favored
   partitioning of Ag into freibergite and less oxidizing conditions
   favored galena as a host. At higher temperatures, >ca. 250 degrees C,
   the most reducing conditions favored incorporation in Ag-Bi-rich galena
   (plus Se) and Bi-bearing sulfides or Ag-rich chalcopyite under lesser
   reducing conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A novel digital image correlation (DIC) technique has been developed to

   shear angles and effective yarn strains are calculated and visualised
   using this new DIC technique for bias extension testing of an aerospace
   grade, carbon-fibre reinforcement material with a plain weave
   architecture. The DIC results are validated by direct measurement, and
   the use of a wide bias extension sample is evaluated against a more
   commonly used narrow sample. Wide samples exhibit a shear angle range
   25\% greater than narrow samples and peak loads which are 10 times
   higher. This is primarily due to excessive yarn slippage in the narrow
   samples; hence, the wide sample configuration is recommended for
   characterisation of shear properties which are required for accurate
   modelling of textile draping.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The application of mineralogical characterization to mine waste has the
   potential to improve risk assessment, guide appropriate mine planning
   for planned and active mines and optimize remediation design at closed
   or abandoned mines. Characterization of minerals, especially sulphide
   and carbonate phases, is particularly important for predicting the
   potential for acidic drainage and metal(loid) leaching. Another valuable
   outcome from mineralogical studies of mine waste is an understanding of
   the stability of reactive and metal(loid)-bearing minerals under various
   redox conditions. This paper reviews analytical methods that have been
   used to study mine waste mineralogy, including conventional methods such
   as X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, and advanced
   methods such as synchrotron-based microanalysis and automated
   mineralogy. We recommend direct collaboration between researchers and
   mining companies to choose the optimal mineralogical techniques to solve
   complex problems, to co-publish the results, and to ensure that
   mineralogical knowledge is used to inform mine waste management at all
   stages of the mining life cycle. A case study of arsenic-bearing gold
   mine tailings from Nova Scotia is presented to demonstrate the
   application of mineralogical techniques to improve human health risk
   assessment and the long-term management of historical mine wastes. (C)

Abstract = {{Heavy contamination of soil with crude oil has caused significant
   negative environmental impacts and presents substantial hazards to human
   health. To explore a highly efficient bioaugmentation strategy for these
   contaminations, experiments were conducted over 180 days in soil heavily
   contaminated with crude oil (50,000 mg kg(-1)), with four treatments
   comprised of Bacillus subtilis inoculation with no further inoculation
   (I), or reinoculation after 100 days with either B. subtilis (II),
   Acremonium sp.(III), or a mixture of both organisms (IV). The removal
   values of total petroleum hydrocarbons were 60.1 +/- A 2.0, 60.05 +/- A
   3.0, 71.3 +/- A 5.2 and 74.2 +/- A 2.7 \% for treatment (I-IV),
   respectively. Treatments (III-IV) significantly enhanced the soil
   bioremediation compared with treatments (I-II) (p < 0.05). Furthermore,
   significantly (p < 0.05) greater rates of degradation for petroleum
   hydrocarbon fractions were observed in treatments (III-IV) compared to
   treatments (I-II), and this was especially the case with the degradative
   rates for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and crude oil heavy
   fractions. Dehydrogenase activity in treatment (III-IV) containing
   Acremonium sp. showed a constant increase until the end of experiments.
   Therefore reinoculation with pure fungus or fungal-bacterial consortium
   should be considered as an effective strategy in bioaugmentation for
   soil heavily contaminated with crude oil.}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing use of various mineral additions along with chemical
   admixtures such as superplasticizers justifies the need for further
   research. Understanding and quantifying their effects and possible
   synergies on the fresh and hardened properties of cement-based materials
   is necessary, especially if some of these components are known to have a

   and relates their properties to the proportioning of these materials and
   the superplasticizer dosage. Mini-slump, Marsh cone and Lombardi cone
   tests were used to examine the properties of the fresh mortars, and to
   assess density, plastic shrinkage, and drying shrinkage up to 20 days.
   The equations presented in this paper make it possible to optimize
   mortar proportionings to the required levels of performance in both
   fresh and hardened states. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Exploring switchgrass and hardwood combustion on excess air and ash
   fouling/slagging potential: Laboratory combustion test and
   thermogravimetric kinetic analysis}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},

Abstract = {{Biomass combustion generates renewable energy, which is optimized by
   designing a biomass combustion system that controls excess air intake
   and evaluates the ash fouling/slagging potential. The objective of this
   study was to (1) investigate the effect of excess air ratio (EAR) on the
   combustion of switchgrass (Panicum vigratum L.) and hardwood, (2) assess
   their ash fouling and slagging tendencies, and (3) perform an in-depth
   thermogravimetric kinetic analysis to understand their combustion.
   Switchgrass and hardwood contained 17.5 and 17.7 MJ/kg of energy value,
   which was appropriate for heat generation. The greatest energy
   conversion efficiency and combustion completeness rate were obtained
   with an EAR of 20\% for switchgrass and 30\% for hardwood based on our
   combustion system with 4 mm particles of fuel. Kinetic analysis
   confirmed that increasing the oxygen availability resulted in superior
   energy conversion. In general, switchgrass ash had lower fouling and
   slagging tendencies than hardwood owing to its more acidic chemical
   composition. Heat and mass transfer delays were still observed from this
   combustion system, thus making the combustion request more air to even
   achieve a stoichiometric condition. However, rather than an ideal test
   (e.g. single particle combustion), the conclusions made by this study
   were a practical guidance for boiler operations, since the heat and mass
   transfer delays were a common phenomenon in real applications that
   should not be eliminated in our lab-scale studies.. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{An integrated approach for real-time model-based state-of-charge
   estimation of lithium-ion batteries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{283}},
Pages = {{24-36}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Lithium-ion batteries have been widely adopted in electric vehicles
   (EVs), and accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation is of paramount
   importance for the EV battery management system. Though a number of
   methods have been proposed, the SOC estimation for Lithium-ion
   batteries, such as LiFePo4 battery, however, faces two key challenges:
   the flat open circuit voltage (OCV) vs SOC relationship for some SOC
   ranges and the hysteresis effect. To address these problems, an
   integrated approach for real-time model-based SOC estimation of
   Lithium-ion batteries is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an
   auto-regression model is adopted to reproduce the battery terminal
   behaviour, combined with a non-linear complementary model to capture the
   hysteresis effect. The model parameters, including linear parameters and
   non-linear parameters, are optimized off-line using a hybrid
   optimization method that combines a meta-heuristic method (i.e., the
   teaching learning based optimization method) and the least square
   method. Secondly, using the trained model, two real-time model-based SOC
   estimation methods are presented, one based on the real-time battery OCV
   regression model achieved through weighted recursive least square
   method, and the other based on the state estimation using the extended
   Kalman filter method (EKF). To tackle the problem caused by the flat
   OCV-vs-SOC segments when the OCV-based SOC estimation method is adopted,
   a method combining the coulombic counting and the OCV-based method is
   proposed. Finally, modelling results and SOC estimation results are
   presented and analysed using the data collected from LiFePo4 battery
   cell. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
   in particular the joint-EKF method. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published

   martensitic NiTi wire, detwinning of the {[}011](B19') type II twins and
   the \{010\}(B19') compound twins is responsible for internal strains
   formed at the early stage of deformation. (2) The measured diffraction
   moduli of individual martensite families show large elastic anisotropy
   and strong influences of texture. (3) For the austenitic NiTi wire,
   internal residual stresses were produced due to transformation-induced
   plasticity, which is more likely to occur in austenite families that
   have higher elastic moduli than their associated martensite families.
   (4) Plastic deformation was observed in the SIM at higher stresses,
   which largely decreased the lower plateau stresses.}},

Title = {{Droop setting design for multi-terminal HVDC grids considering voltage
   deviation impacts}},
Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{67-75}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In multi-terminal high voltage direct current (HVDC) grids, the widely
   deployed droop control strategies will cause a non-uniform voltage
   deviation on the power flow, which is determined by the network topology
   and droop settings. This voltage deviation results in an inconsistent
   power flow pattern when the dispatch references are changed, which could
   be detrimental to the operation and seamless integration of HVDC grids.
   In this paper, a novel droop setting design method is proposed to
   address this problem for a more precise power dispatch. The effects of
   voltage deviations on the power sharing accuracy and transmission loss
   are analysed. This paper shows that there is a trade-off between
   minimizing the voltage deviation, ensuring a proper power delivery and
   reducing the total transmission loss in the droop setting design. The
   efficacy of the proposed method is confirmed by simulation studies. (C)

Abstract = {{Scale-dependent statistical depictions of surface morphology offer the
   potential to parameterize complex geometrical scaling relationships with
   greater detail than traditional fractal measures. Using multiscale
   operators, it is possible to identify points belonging to rough
   discontinuous surfaces in noisy point clouds solely on the basis of
   their local geometry. Many strategies for point cloud feature
   classification have been developed since the proliferation of laser
   scanning systems. Most of the techniques which are applicable to natural
   scenes employ external data sources such as hyperspectral imagery,
   return pulse intensity, and waveform data. In this letter, multiscale
   geometric parameters are used to identify individual point observations
   corresponding to rock surfaces in point clouds acquired by terrestrial
   laser scanning in scenes with man-made clutter and scanning artifacts.
   Three multiscale operators, namely, the approximate shape and density of
   a defined neighborhood and the distance of its mean point from its
   geometric center, are fused into a single feature vector. The procedure
   is demonstrated using real point cloud data acquired in a mine drift,
   with the goal of identifying points belonging to the rock face obscured
   by an overlying wire support mesh. Using the extra-trees classifier,
   extraneous returns caused by the mesh were excluded from the point cloud
   with a 97\% success rate, while 87\% of the desired surface points were
   retained.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{305}},
Pages = {{29-36}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Although the NO removal-based air-purification ISO method ISO
   22197-1:2007 is well established, its preconditioning requirements mean
   that only the initial activity of the photocatalyst under test is
   measured owing to the often-reported, gradual alteration of the surface
   kinetics for NO oxidation by air through the accumulation of surface
   HNO3. Herein, we compare the photocatalytic NO removal abilities of a
   number of different, common TiO2 materials, surface-saturated with
   photogenerated HNO3, with their behaviours observed during the typical 5
   h-long ISO standard test. It is found that all the TiO2 materials
   studied eventually become largely NO to NO2 converters after sufficient
   exposure to NO under irradiation (>5 h) due to the accumulation of
   surface HNO3. The UV exposure time, t{*}, necessary to reach this HNO3
   saturated condition is different for each different catalyst. As a
   consequence, an alternative preconditioning process for the ISO method
   is proposed which can be used to provide a more realistic measure of the
   photocatalytic activity of the underlying material and provide a measure
   of the NOx removing capacity of the photocatalytic material under test.

Abstract = {{This paper presents the rational for the selection of fluids for use in
   a model based study of sub and supercritical Waste Heat Recovery (WHR)
   Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). The study focuses on multiple vehicle heat
   sources and the potential of WHR ORC's for its conversion into useful
   work. The work presented on fluid selection is generally applicable to
   any waste heat recovery system, either stationary or mobile and, with
   careful consideration, is also applicable to single heat sources. The
   fluid selection process presented reduces the number of potential fluids
   from over one hundred to a group of under twenty fluids for further
   refinement in a model based WHR ORC performance study. The selection
   process uses engineering judgement, legislation and, where applicable,
   health and safety as fluid selection or de-selection criteria. This
   paper also investigates and discusses the properties of specific ORC
   fluids with regard to their impact on the theoretical potential for
   delivering efficient WHR ORC work output. The paper concludes by looking
   at potential temperature and pressure WHR ORC limits with regard to
   fluid properties thereby assisting with the generation of WHR ORC

Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{133-139}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In order to predict and optimize the contour laser transmission welding
   (LTW) process, it is important to understand how the laser energy
   behaves during transmission through the transparent part. In this study,
   transmission measurements were made on unreinforced and
   glass-fiber-reinforced amorphous and semi-crystalline thermoplastics at
   different thicknesses. Using the ratio of transmitted power to laser
   power, apparent absorption coefficients and apparent reflections were
   calculated. The results indicate that there is a linear relationship
   between the glass fiber volume fraction and the apparent absorption
   coefficient of reinforced polymers; similar effects were also observed
   for crystallinity. A simple model was developed to estimate apparent
   absorption coefficient of reinforced polymers as a function of
   composition.
   The apparent reflection increased with crystallinity due to increased
   back scattering. However, for glass-fiber-reinforced polymers, the
   apparent reflection displayed a more complex behavior. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{System efficiency and cost effectiveness are of critical importance for

Abstract = {{The optimisation of Fe and Al oxyhydroxide materials produced using
   industrial grade coagulants is presented in this work. The effects of
   synthesis pH and post-synthesis washing procedure onto the arsenic
   adsorption capacity of the materials were investigated. It was shown
   that the materials produced at higher pH were more efficient in removing
   As(V), especially after cleaning procedure. The materials produced at
   lower pH were less efficient in removing As(V) but the higher presence
   of sulphate groups in the materials produced at lower pH enhanced
   As(III) adsorption. Most performing materials can remove up to 84.7 mg
   As(V) g(-1) or 77.9 mg As(III) g(-1). (C) 2014 The Korean Society of

Abstract = {{A new type of balanced filter with a very wide common mode (CM) free
   band is presented. In this design, the filter's symmetry line lies
   parallel to the resonator's current flow. Therefore, when a differential
   signal is excited, a virtual open circuit is forced all along this
   symmetry line, which results in the excitation of parallel resonances on
   the resonators. However, for CM operation, a short circuit is forced all
   along the resonator, therefore eliminating any parallel CM resonances.
   The filter was designed with Chebyshev response using four poles at a
   differential frequency of 1.11GHz. Its fractional bandwidth is 5\%. It
   was fabricated on a substrate with epsilon(r)=10.2 and a thickness of
   1.9mm. Experimental and simulated results on the test filter show good
   agreement. The first CM resonance is excited at about 10 times the
   desired center frequency. This is due to orthogonal resonances of the
   resonator.}},

Abstract = {{Fountain codes were introduced to provide high reliability and
   scalability and low complexities for networks such as the Internet.
   Luby-transform (LT) codes, which are the first realisation of Fountain
   codes, achieve the capacity of the binary erasure channel (BEC)
   asymptotically and universally. Most previous work on single-layer
   Fountain coding targets the design via the right degree distribution.
   The left degree distribution of an LT code is left as a Poisson to
   protect the universality. For finite lengths, this is no longer an
   issue; thus, the author's focus is on designing better codes for the BEC
   at practical lengths. Their left degree shaping provides codes
   outperforming LT codes and all other competing schemes in the
   literature. At a bit error rate of 10(-7) and packet length k = 256,
   their scheme provides a realised rate of 0.6 which is 23.5\% higher than
   that of Sorensen et al.'s decreasing-ripple-size scheme.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a nanowire-based photonic-crystal waveguide system capable
   of controllably mediating the photon coupling between two quantum dots
   which are macroscopically separated. Using a rigorous Green-function-
   based master equation approach, our two-dot system is shown to provide a
   wide range of interesting quantum transport regimes. In particular, we
   demonstrate the formation of long-lived entangled states and study the
   resonance fluorescence spectrum which contains clear signatures of the
   coupled quantum dot pair. Depending upon the operating frequency, one
   can obtain a modified Mollow triplet spectrum or a Mollow nonuplet,
   namely, a spectrum with nine spectral peaks. These multiple peaks are
   explained in the context of photon-exchange-mediated dressed states.
   Results are robust with respect to scattering loss, and spatial
   filtering via propagation allows for each quantum dot's emission to be
   observed individually.}},

   nanotubes were prepared by a simple and efficient electrospinning
   technique. These materials displayed an initial discharge capacity of
   7205 mAh g(-1) with a plateau at around 2.66 V at a current density of
   100 mA g(-1). It was found that the La0.5Sr0.5CoO2.91 nanotubes promoted
   both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline media
   and a nonaqueous electrolyte, thereby improving the energy and coulombic
   efficiency of the Li-O-2 batteries. The cyclability was maintained for
   85 cycles without any sharp decay under a limited discharge depth of
   1000 mAh g(-1), suggesting that such a bifunctional electrocatalyst is a
   promising candidate for the oxygen electrode in Li-O-2 batteries. (C)

Abstract = {{The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx compounds with NH3 is a
   hot topic in recent years. Among various catalysts, zeolites are proved
   to be efficient and promising for NH3-SCR, yet the whole processes and
   intrinsic mechanism are still not well understood due to the structural
   complexity of zeolites. With the improvement of theoretical chemistry
   techniques, quantum-chemical calculations are now capable of modeling
   the structure, acidity, adsorption, and ultimately reaction pathways
   over zeolites to some extent. In this review, a brief summary of
   relevant concepts of NH3-SCR is presented. Cluster approaches, embedded
   techniques, and periodic treatments are described as three main methods.
   Details of quantum-chemical investigations toward the key issues such
   as, the structure of active sites, the adsorption of small molecules,
   and the reaction mechanism of NH3-SCR over zeolites are discussed.
   Finally, a perspective for future theoretical research is given. (c)

Abstract = {{Mechanochemical preparation of Ag/Al2O3 catalysts used for the selective
   catalytic reduction of NOx using(2)O(3) hydrocarbons has been shown to
   substantially increase the activity of the catalyst in comparison with
   Ag/Al2O3 prepared by wet impregnation. The effect of using different
   ball-milling experimental parameters on both the structure of the
   material as well as the catalyst activity has been investigated and the
   optimum conditions established. A phase transition from to gamma- to
   alpha-alumina was observed milling at high speeds which was found to
   result in lower catalyst activities. At lower milling speeds both
   fracturing and agglomeration of the alumina support can be observed
   depending on the grinding time. However, due to ball-milling, a general
   enhancement in the NOx reduction activity was observed for all catalysts
   compared with the conventionally prepared catalysts irrespective of the
   reductant used. Transient DRIFTS-MS experiments were performed to
   investigate the effect of H-2 in the absence and presence of water on
   the SCR reaction over catalysts prepared by both ball milling and wet
   impregnation. In-situ DRIFTS-MS analysis revealed significant
   differences in both gas phase and surface species. Most notably,
   isocyanate species were formed significantly more quickly and at higher
   surface concentration in the case of the mechanochemically prepared
   catalyst. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report here the microstructural changes occurring in the zirconium
   alloy Excel (Zr-3.5 wt\% Sn-0.8Nb-0.8Mo-0.2Fe) during heavy ion
   irradiation. In situ irradiation experiments were conducted at reactor
   operating temperatures on two Zr Excel alloy microstructures with
   different states of alloying elements, with the states achieved by
   different solution heat treatments. In the first case, the alloying
   elements were mostly concentrated in the beta (beta) phase, whereas, in
   the second case, large Zr-3(Mo,Nb,Fe)(4) secondary phase precipitates
   (SPPs) were grown in the alpha (alpha) phase by long term aging. The
   heavy ion induced damage and resultant compositional changes were
   examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in combination
   with scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM)-energy dispersive
   x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping. Significant differences were seen in
   microstructural evolution between the two different microstructures that
   were irradiated under similar conditions. Nucleation and growth of < c
   >-component loops and their dependence on the alloying elements are a
   major focus of the current investigation. It was observed that the < c
   >-component loops nucleate readily at 100, 300, and 400 degrees C after
   a threshold incubation dose (TID), which varies with irradiation
   temperature and the state of alloying elements. It was found that the
   TID for the formation of < c >-component loops increases with decrease
   in irradiation temperature. Alloying elements that are present in the
   form of SPPs increase the TID compared to when they are in the beta
   phase solid solution. Dose and temperature dependence of loop size and
   density are presented. Radiation induced redistribution and clustering
   of alloying elements (Sn, Mo, and Fe) have been observed and related to
   the formation of < c >-component loops. It has been shown that at the
   higher temperature tests, irradiation induced dissolution of
   precipitates occurs whereas irradiation induced amorphization occurs at
   100 degrees C. Furthermore, dose and temperature seem to be the main
   factors governing the dissolution of SPPs and redistribution of alloying
   elements, which in turn controls the nucleation and growth of < c
   >-component loops. The correlation between the microstructural evolution
   and microchemistry has been found by EDS and is discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Data from a series of in situ neutron diffraction tests has previously
   demonstrated that the way that deformation is applied does influence the

   self-consistent (EVPSC) model. It was found that the time sensitive
   EVPSC model was better able to reproduce the deformation behavior of
   incrementally loaded Zircaloy-2 than the time insensitive EPSC model.
   Specifically, EVPSC was able to better reproduce the experimentally
   measured data for all types of loading using one single set of hardening
   parameters, while EPSC required a different set of parameters for each
   type of incremental loading mode. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{We model third-harmonic generation in doped monolayer graphene at
   terahertz frequencies by employing a nearest-neighbor tight-binding
   model in the length gauge. We show that for a given incident-field
   amplitude there is an optimum Fermi level that maximizes the emitted
   third-harmonic field. The optimum Fermi level depends very strongly on
   the incident-field amplitude as well as on the scattering time and
   increasing either enhances the third-harmonic response. We consider the
   general case of Fermi-level-independent scattering as well as three
   different scattering mechanisms that are Fermi-level dependent: phonon,
   long-range impurity, and short-range impurity scattering. For each case,
   we determine the optimal Fermi level as well as the amplitude of the
   optimized third-harmonic response for single-cycle incident fields with
   central frequencies of 1 THz and amplitudes in the range of 25-75 kV/cm.
   We find that although nonlinear processes beyond third order suppress
   third-harmonic generation, we still obtain third-harmonic amplitudes as
   large as 1.6\% of the fundamental of the transmitted field.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic economic load dispatch (DELD) is one of the most important steps
   in power system operation. Various optimisation algorithms for solving
   the problem have been developed; however, due to the non-convex
   characteristics and large dimensionality of the problem, it is necessary
   to explore new methods to further improve the dispatch results and
   minimise the costs. This article proposes a hybrid differential
   evolution (DE) algorithm, namely clonal selection-based differential
   evolution (CSDE), to solve the problem. CSDE is an artificial
   intelligence technique that can be applied to complex optimisation
   problems which are for example nonlinear, large scale, non-convex and
   discontinuous. This hybrid algorithm combines the clonal selection
   algorithm (CSA) as the local search technique to update the best
   individual in the population, which enhances the diversity of the
   solutions and prevents premature convergence in DE. Furthermore, we
   investigate four mutation operations which are used in CSA as the
   hyper-mutation operations. Finally, an efficient solution repair method
   is designed for DELD to satisfy the complicated equality and inequality
   constraints of the power system to guarantee the feasibility of the
   solutions. Two benchmark power systems are used to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that
   the proposed CSDE/best/1 approach significantly outperforms nine other
   variants of CSDE and DE, as well as most other published methods, in
   terms of the quality of the solution and the convergence
   characteristics.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Wind-power ramps are a significant source of uncertainty in wind-energy
   forecasting and are a challenge to electric-grid stability. In the
   Canadian province of Alberta, strong westerly winds buffet the Rocky
   Mountains creating an abundant yet intermittent wind energy resource in
   the plains of Alberta. In the current study, wind-power ramp events have
   been detected and correlated to several environmental factors including
   time-of-day, atmospheric stability, season and a Fohn wind event known
   locally as a Chinook wind at a field wind measurement station downstream
   of the Rocky Mountains. Large wind-power ramps (a 50\% change in power
   in less than 4 h) were found to occur on days when a Fohn wind was
   present over 50\% of the time. The result highlights the importance of
   this meteorological phenomenon to wind energy production locally and

Abstract = {{The artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) is one of the
   state-of-the-art swarm intelligent techniques, which is widely utilized
   for optimization purposes. Fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) error parameters
   such as scale factors, biases and misalignment errors are relatively
   unstable, especially with the environmental disturbances and the aging
   of fiber coils. These uncalibrated error parameters are the main reasons
   that the precision of FOG-based strapdown inertial navigation system
   (SINS) degraded. This research is mainly on the application of a novel
   artificial fish swarm algorithm (NAFSA) on FOG error coefficients
   recalibration/identification. First, the NAFSA avoided the demerits
   (e.g., lack of using artificial fishes' pervious experiences, lack of
   existing balance between exploration and exploitation, and high
   computational cost) of the standard AFSA during the optimization
   process. To solve these weak points, functional behaviors and the
   overall procedures of AFSA have been improved with some parameters
   eliminated and several supplementary parameters added. Second, a hybrid
   FOG error coefficients recalibration algorithm has been proposed based
   on NAFSA and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) approaches. This combination
   leads to maximum utilization of the involved approaches for FOG error
   coefficients recalibration. After that, the NAFSA is verified with
   simulation and experiments and its priorities are compared with that of
   the conventional calibration method and optimal AFSA. Results
   demonstrate high efficiency of the NAFSA on FOG error coefficients
   recalibration.}},

Abstract = {{Internal solitary waves (ISWs) of depression are common features of
   coastal environments and believed to resuspend sediments where they
   shoal. In this study, the sediment resupension process associated with
   ISWs propagating over a flat bed was investigated in the laboratory. The
   first-ever profile measurements of the three-dimensional instantaneous
   velocity field beneath the ISWs revealed that resuspension occurs during
   burst like vertical velocity events, which lift sediments into the water
   column, in the adverse pressure gradient region beneath the trailing
   part of the wave. Resuspension was not observed when the wave-induced
   viscous bed stress was maximal directly beneath the ISW trough.
   Prediction of wave-induced resuspension was, therefore, unsuccessful
   using a traditional viscous bed stress-based Shields diagram. A
   parameterization for ISW-induced resuspension is proposed as a function
   of the maximum instantaneous vertical velocity in the bursts wmax. Here
   we have replaced the viscous bed stress with ISW=2wmax2, where ISW is
   the instantaneous resuspending bed stress and 2 is the near-bed fluid
   density. From these results, it is possible for field-oceanographers to
   predict the occurrence of ISW-induced resuspension from the bulk wave
   and stratifications characteristics in a two-layer stratification.
   Further research is required to extend the parameterization to larger
   Reynolds numbers at field-scale.}},

Abstract = {{End-users conduct various on-line activities. Quite often, they re-visit
   websites and use services to perform re-occurring activities, such as
   on-line shopping. The end-users are required to enter the same
   information into various web services to accomplish such re-occurring
   tasks. It can negatively impact user experience when a user needs to
   type the re-occurring information repetitively into such web services.
   In this paper, we propose an approach to prevent end-users from
   performing such repetitive tasks. Our approach propagates user inputs
   across services by linking similar input and output parameters. Our
   approach pre-fills values to the input parameters for an end-user using
   his or her previous inputs. To increase the chance of identifying a
   proper value for an input parameter performed by one end-user, our
   approach also leverages the inputs from other end-users. We identify and
   link similar end-users to enable the propagation of user inputs among
   end-users. We have designed and developed a prototype. We also conduct
   an empirical study to evaluate our approach using the real world
   services. The empirical results show that our approach using an
   end-user's previous inputs can reduce on average 41 percent of
   repetitive typing for the execution of composed services. Furthermore,
   the previous inputs from the similar end-users can improve our approach
   in reducing the repetitive typing for an end-user.}},

Abstract = {{Web service composition enables seamless and dynamic integration of Web
   services. The behavior of participant Web services determines the
   overall performance of a composition. Therefore, it is important to
   choose high quality services for service composition. Existing Web
   service selection and discovery approaches rely on non-functional
   aspects (also known as quality of service or OoS), e.g., response time
   and availability. Though these parameters are crucial for selecting Web
   services, they may not reflect the user's perspective of quality. In
   this paper, we explore the feasibility of incorporating perceived
   quality from user's perspective for service selection and composition.
   We name such quality attributes as quality of experience (QoE). First,
   we propose a solution that automatically mines and identifies QoE
   attributes from the Web. Second, we study the application of such
   dynamically extracted QoE attributes for service selection. For the
   evaluation purpose, we collected more than 34,000 reviews from 58
   different services in six domains. Our findings show that it is possible
   to automatically identify QoE attributes with an average precision and
   recall of 92 and 80 percent respectively. Our study shows that there is
   a strong positive correlation between QoS and QoE. Hence QoE can be used
   during service selection especially when QoS data are not available.
   Furthermore, we found 70 percent of service discovery queries indeed
   contain QoE attributes showing the importance of QoE attributes during
   the service discovery phase.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive study on the state-of-the-art and
   emerging wind energy technologies from the electrical engineering
   perspective. In an attempt to decrease cost of energy, increase the wind
   energy conversion efficiency, reliability, power density, and comply
   with the stringent grid codes, the electric generators and power
   electronic converters have emerged in a rigorous manner. From the market
   based survey, the most successful generator-converter configurations are
   addressed along with few promising topologies available in the
   literature. The back-to-back connected converters, passive
   generator-side converters, converters for multiphase generators, and
   converters without intermediate dc-link are investigated for high-power
   wind energy conversion systems (WECS), and presented in low and medium
   voltage category. The onshore and offshore wind farm configurations are
   analyzed with respect to the series/parallel connection of wind turbine
   ac/dc output terminals, and high voltage ac/dc transmission. The
   fault-ride through compliance methods used in the induction and
   synchronous generator based WECS are also discussed. The past, present
   and future trends in megawatt WECS are reviewed in terms of mechanical
   and electrical technologies, integration to power systems, and control
   theory. The important survey results, and technical merits and demerits
   of various WECS electrical systems are summarized by tables. The list of
   current and future wind turbines are also provided along with technical

Journal = {{PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{159-171}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The overpressure produced by the boiling liquid expanding vapor
   explosion (BLEVE) is still not well understood. Various methods have
   been published on the overpressure modeling in the far field. They
   mostly differ by the modeling of the expansion energy, used to scale the
   distance to the source where the overpressure needs to be calculated.
   But these methods usually include a experimentally fitted reduction
   factor, and are mostly overestimating the overpressures. Today there is
   a growing interest in modeling the BLEVE overpressure in the near field,
   for studying the blast effect on critical infrastructure such as bridges
   and buildings. This requires a much better understanding of the BLEVE
   blast. This paper goes deeper in the understanding of the physical
   phenomenon leading to the BLEVE blast wave generation and propagation.
   First, mid-scale BLEVE experiments in addition to new experimental data
   for near field blast from a small scale supercritical BLEVE are
   analyzed. And second, an analysis method of the shocks observed in the
   experiments is presented based on fundamental gas dynamics, and allows
   the elaboration of a new modeling approach for BLEVE overpressure, based
   on the calculation of the initial overpressure and radius of the blast.

Abstract = {{Poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) (PHO), poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and PHO/PLA
   blends were reactively modified in the melt state, using dicumyl
   peroxide (DCP) and triallyl trimesate (TAM) trifunctional coagent. The
   viscosity and elasticity of PHO and PLA increased substantially
   following reactive modification. The processability of the partially
   cross-linked PHO was improved, whereas coagent-modified PIA displayed
   strain hardening and enhanced crystallization. Reactive compounding of
   PLA and PHO in the presence of DCP and TAM resulted in blends with
   enhanced strain hardening, indicative of high melt strength, and
   improved crystallinity compared to the unreacted blend. Furthermore
   these blends had a finer morphology, which was attributed to a
   compatibilizing effect possibly arising from copolymer formation at the
   interface. The elongation at break and impact properties of the blends
   were improved compared to the neat PLA, while the heat deflection
   temperature remained unaffected. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Biowaste chicken eggshells contain high amounts of calcium carbonate or
   calcite. Waste eggshells generated by processing industries have the
   potential to be used as limestone or lime in a variety of applications.
   Studies have shown removal of membrane from eggshells can be separated
   at the laboratory level, but mass production has not been
   industrialized. The aim of this study was to optimize two membrane
   removable techniques; heat treatment and bleach treatment. The
   as-received eggshell samples were first water ball milled into a 63 mu m
   powder. In the first method, fine eggshell powders were submitted to
   elevated temperatures from 105 to 800 degrees C in air. The second
   method involved submitting the powder to a chemical treatment of 10\% to
   100\% bleach concentrations and holding in the solutions for different
   soak times. The powdered samples were characterized for chemical
   composition and microstructural analysis. The results indicated pure
   calcite can be produced by heating to a temperature of 300 degrees C for
   a period of 2 h or a 10\% bleach treatment for 48 h or a 50\% bleach for
   10 min. In addition, calcite from eggshells could be transformed into
   lime by heating to 750 degrees C for 1 h. The heat treatment method can
   easily be scaled up to mass production. This study signified eggshells
   can be used as a total or partial alternative replacement to mined
   limestone.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the end-to-end performance of dual-hop
   proactive decode-and-forward relaying networks with Nth best relay
   selection in the presence of two practical deleterious effects: i)
   hardware impairment and ii) co-channel interference. In particular, we
   derive new exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions for the outage
   probability and average channel capacity of Nth best partial and
   opportunistic relay selection schemes over Rayleigh fading channels.
   Insightful discussions are provided. It is shown that, when the system
   cannot select the best relay for cooperation, the partial relay
   selection scheme outperforms the opportunistic method under the impact
   of the same co-channel interference (CCI). In addition, without CCI but
   under the effect of hardware impairment, it is shown that both selection
   strategies have the same asymptotic channel capacity. Monte Carlo
   simulations are presented to corroborate our analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike the existing detectors, which are developed for
   decode-and-forward (DF) networks in the ideal interference-free case, we
   consider a more practical scenario where arbitrary interference exists.
   We consider a DF cooperative network consisting of a source, multiple
   relays, a destination, and multiple interferers affecting both the
   relays and the destination. Each relay is equipped with multiple
   antennas and knows its local instantaneous channel state information
   (CSI). Assuming that the destination knows the instantaneous CSI of the
   source-relay, relay-destination, and source-destination channels, we
   develop, for the first time in the literature, the end-to-end optimum
   maximum-likelihood (ML) detectors in closed-form for DF systems
   employing either simultaneous or orthogonal transmissions in the
   presence of interference. Furthermore, theoretical analysis shows that
   the proposed detectors achieve full diversity gains in the presence of
   interference with finite interference-to-noise ratios. Numerical results
   demonstrate that the proposed optimum detectors substantially outperform
   the conventional schemes which simply ignore interference.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates a strengthening technique of slender S-section
   steel columns against global buckling about their strong axes. Carbon
   fibre-reinforced polymer plates of various Young's moduli, ranging from
   168 to 430GPa, were adhesively bonded to the steel flanges. The number
   of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer layers was varied to produce
   reinforcement ratios of 11-34\%. The study comprised eight 2.6m long
   pin-ended columns with a slenderness ratio of 83, including five
   strengthened with carbon fibre-reinforced polymer. The
   out-of-straightness imperfection of the columns ranged from length
   (L)/29,000 to L/1600. It was shown that the increase in strength ranged
   from 15\% for the smallest out-of-straightness to 25\% for the largest.
   Increasing reinforcement ratio of the 168GPa modulus carbon
   fibre-reinforced polymer from 11 to 34\% increased strength from 5 to
   15\%. Although a higher modulus carbon fibre-reinforced polymer would
   generally be favoured for achieving higher gains in buckling strength
   according to Euler's buckling theory, this study showed that failure
   strain of such carbon fibre-reinforced polymer could be a critical
   limiting factor. It is important that global buckling, and hence the
   peak load, is achieved before carbon fibre-reinforced polymer crushing.}},

   solve the diffusion equation analytically to explore molecular
   orientation induced by oscillatory shear flow. We see that the
   orientation distribution is neither even nor odd. We find zeroth, first,
   second, third, and fourth harmonics of the orientation distribution, and
   we have derived explicit analytical expressions for these. We provide a
   clear visualization of the orientation distribution in large-amplitude
   oscillatory shear flow in spherical coordinates all the way around one
   full alternant cycle. The Newtonian distribution is nearly isotropic,
   the linearly viscoelastic, only slightly anisotropic, and the nonlinear

Abstract = {{The formulation of BCS Class II drugs as amorphous solid dispersions has
   been shown to provide advantages with respect to improving the aqueous
   solubility of these compounds. While hot melt extrusion (HME) and spray
   drying (SD) are among the most common methods for the production of
   amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs), the high temperatures often required
   for HME can restrict the processing of thermally labile drugs, while the
   use of toxic organic solvents during SD can impact on end-product
   toxicity. In this study, we investigated the potential of supercritical
   fluid impregnation (SFI) using carbon dioxide as an alternative process
   for ASD production of a model poorly water-soluble drug, indomethacin
   (INM). In doing so, we produced ASDs without the use of organic solvents
   and at temperatures considerably lower than those required for HME.
   Previous studies have concentrated on the characterization of ASDs
   produced using HME or SFI but have not considered both processes
   together. Dispersions were manufactured using two different polymers,
   Soluplus and polyvinylpyrrolidone K15 using both SFI and HME and
   characterized for drug morphology, homogeneity, presence of drug polymer
   interactions, glass transition temperature, amorphous stability of the
   drug within the formulation, and nonsink drug release to measure the
   ability of each formulation to create a supersaturated drug solution.
   Fully amorphous dispersions were successfully produced at 50\% w/w drug
   loading using HME and 30\% w/w drug loading using SFI. For both
   polymers, formulations containing 50\% w/w INM, manufactured via SFI,
   contained the drug in the gamma-crystalline form. Interestingly, there
   were lower levels of crystallinity in PVP dispersions relative to SOL.
   FTIR was used to probe for the presence of drug polymer interactions
   within both polymer systems. For PVP systems, the nature of these
   interactions depended upon processing method; however, for Soluplus
   formulations this was not the case. The area under the dissolution curve
   (AUC) was used as a measure of the time during which a supersaturated
   concentration could be maintained, and for all systems, SFI formulations
   performed better than similar HME formulations.}},

Abstract = {{The recent development of the massive multiple-input multiple-output
   (MIMO) paradigm, has been extensively based on the pursuit of favorable
   propagation: in the asymptotic limit, the channel vectors become nearly
   orthogonal and inter-user interference tends to zero {[}1]. In this
   context, previous studies have considered fixed inter-antenna distance,
   which implies an increasing array aperture as the number of elements
   increases. Here, we focus on a practical, space-constrained topology,
   where an increase in the number of antenna elements in a fixed total
   space imposes an inversely proportional decrease in the inter-antenna
   distance. Our analysis shows that, contrary to existing studies,
   inter-user interference does not vanish in the massive MIMO regime,
   thereby creating a saturation effect on the achievable rate.}},

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{609-625}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Joint behaviour in reinforced concrete pipes when buried and subjected
   to service live loading needs to be assessed to define the expected
   response of these elements, as excessive rotation and (or) shear across
   the joint could generate structural damage or leakage and subsequent
   loss in soil support that can bring the system to its serviceability or
   resistance limits. Two reinforced concrete pipelines with bell and
   spigot joints, one 600 mm (24 in.) and the other 1200 mm (48 in.) in
   diameter, were buried and subjected to the maximum service live loading
   for a simulated wheel pair at three independent locations above the
   pipeline. The smaller specimen was also tested with the protruding bells
   placed directly on the stiff foundation. Each pipeline was then tested
   up to and beyond the fully factored load at shallow cover and with the
   load applied directly over the central joint. The response of a single
   joint within the pipe system can be conservatively evaluated considering
   two rigid pipes connected by a hinge, and considering a single wheel
   pair (not axle loads), the most severe surface load condition.
   Neglecting leakage that was not studied, the joint strength was
   controlled by the circumferential response of the bells.}},

Abstract = {{Solutions for expected shear force and rotation across joints connecting
   rigid pipes are formulated for use in the structural design of rigid
   pipe joints and possible inclusion in current pipe standards. The
   loading system is divided into live loading and earth loading, and these
   cases are treated separately. Exact algebraic solutions are derived
   using the beam-on-elastic-spring approximation for two rigid pipes
   connected by a moment-release joint, which is considered conservative.
   Additional discussions are also presented about the conservative nature
   of the ``two-beam{''}-on-elastic-spring approximation compared to finite
   element solutions for beam-on-elastic-springs problems involving more
   pipe segments. A parametric study is then presented examining the key
   controlling factors. Vehicle load calculations assume live load
   spreading with depth approximated by a trapezoidal loading prism. Earth
   load calculations are derived for a change in the stiffness of soil
   support from one section of the pipeline to the next. Comparisons with
   experimental measurements indicate that the design equations reflect
   observed changes in joint response as burial depth or pipe diameter
   increases. Experimental variability is considerable however, and the
   design calculations are generally conservative.}},

Abstract = {{A series of 30 tests on dry granular flows were performed using a
   large-scale flume under varying source volumes and basal friction
   conditions to capture grain-scale interactions and their impact on
   overall runout behaviour. These grain interactions and ultimately the
   flow regimes developed were found to be a function of material source
   volume and boundary roughness. The dimensionless inertial number was
   computed for each flow, but was found to be of limited utility except
   perhaps to define a general state (e.g., liquid regime) for the material
   due to the high slip velocity encountered in the granular flows. Using
   the depth-averaged ``dynamic analysis{''} numerical model DAN, it was
   found that a single set of semi-empirically derived frictional
   parameters (i.e., specific to internal and basal friction conditions)
   was appropriate for matching the overall mobility of the experimental
   flows over a range of flow volumes and slope inclinations. However,
   these angles were found to be lower than those determined from
   laboratory interface friction tests, highlighting the importance of
   collisional stress transfer in the basal zone of the dry flowing
   landslides.}},

Title = {{Correlation Equations for Natural Convective Heat Transfer From Two
   Inclined Vertically Spaced Narrow Isothermal Flat Plates}},

Abstract = {{Natural convective flow over narrow plates induces an inward flow near
   the edges of the plate causing the flow to be three-dimensional near the
   edges of the plate. This influences the heat transfer rate near the
   edges of the plate and is referred to as the edge effect. The primary
   objective of this paper is to numerically study this edge effect and the
   interaction of the flows over two inclined vertically separated narrow
   heated plates of the same size embedded in a plane adiabatic surface.
   The cases where the plates and surrounding adiabatic surface are
   inclined at positive or negative angles to the vertical have been
   considered. Results were obtained by numerically solving the full
   three-dimensional form of governing equations using the commercial
   finite volume based software FLUENT(C). Results have only been obtained
   for a Prandtl number of 0.7; this being the value existing in the
   application which involved airflow that originally motivated this study.
   The results presented here cover Rayleigh numbers between 10(3) and
   10(7), at all values of W considered, plate width-to-height ratios
   between 0.2 and 1.2, gap, at all values of W considered, to the plate
   height ratios of between 0 and 1.5, and, at all values of W considered,
   angles of inclination of between -45 deg and +45 deg. The effects of the
   Rayleigh number, dimensionless plate width, dimensionless gap between
   plates, and inclination angle on the heat transfer rate have been
   studied in detail. Empirical correlations defining the effect of these
   parameters on the heat transfer rate have been derived.}},

Abstract = {{A servo-controlled testing setup was used to investigate the
   stress-strain behaviour of three carbonate rocks into the post-failure
   region. A series of uniaxial and triaxial tests on Indiana limestone,
   Carrara marble, and Toral de Los Vados limestone have been performed,
   gathering information on the evolution of the strength parameters and
   stiffness of these rocks, as well as on their post-yield dilatational
   properties. The Carrara marble was found to be extremely ductile, even
   under uniaxial conditions, whereas the Indiana limestone and Toral de
   Los Vados limestone were more brittle. The Indiana limestone, which was
   the weakest rock tested, showed a notable transition to more ductile
   failure modes, even at modest confinements on the order of 10 MPa; this
   transition was reflected in the volumetric strain evolution of the rock
   in the form of a transition of the dilation angle towards lower, less
   variable values. All of the rocks tested were found to be consistent
   with a cohesion-weakening-friction-strengthening model for yield, with
   the peak friction angle of both the Carrara marble and Indiana limestone
   being attained after peak strength. The evolution of stiffness was also
   considered as a function of accumulated plastic strain. Each rock
   decreased in stiffness significantly following the onset of yield, and
   eventually reached a near-constant residual stiffness on the order of 50
   \% of the initial elastic stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{Condensation of volatile organic compounds in colder zones can be
   detrimental to the performance of an in situ thermal treatment
   application for the remediation of chlorinated solvent source zones. A
   novel method to increase gas production and limit convective heat loss
   in more permeable, potentially colder, zones involves the injection and
   liberation of dissolved gas from solution during heating. Bench-scale
   electrical resistance heating experiments were performed with a
   dissolved carbon dioxide and sodium chloride solution to investigate
   exsolved gas saturations and transport regimes at elevated, but
   sub-boiling, temperatures. At sub-boiling temperatures, maximum exsolved
   gas saturations of S-g = 0.12 were attained, and could be sustained when
   the carbon dioxide solution was injected during heating rather than
   emplaced prior to heating. This gas saturation was estimated to decrease
   groundwater relative permeability to k(rw) = 0.64. Discontinuous gas
   transport was observed above saturations of S-g = 0.07, demonstrating
   the potential of exsolved CO2 to bridge vertical gas transport through
   colder zones. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The search for ideal biomaterials is still on-going for tissue
   regeneration. In this study, blends of poly epsilon-caprolactone (PCL)
   with poly L-lactic acid (PLLA), nalidixic acid (NA) and polyethylene
   glycol (PEG) were prepared. Mechanical and thermal properties of the
   blends were investigated by tensile and flexural analysis, DSC, TGA,
   WXRD, MFI, BET, SEM and hot stage optical microscopy. Results showed
   that the loading of PLLA caused a significant decrease in tensile
   strength and almost total eradication of the elongation at break of PCL
   matrix, especially after PEG and NA addition. Increased stiffness was
   also noted with additional NA, PEG and PLLA, resulting in an increase in
   the flexural modulus of the blends.
   Isothermal degradation indicated that bulk PCL, PLLA and the blends were
   thermally stable at 200 degrees C for the duration of 2 h making
   extrusion of the blends at this temperature viable. Morphological study
   showed that increasing the PLLA content and addition of the very low
   viscosity PEG and powder NA decreased the Melt Flow Indexer and
   increased the viscosity.
   At the higher temperature, the PLLA begins to soften and eventually
   melts allowing for increased flow and, coupling this with, the natural
   increase in MFI caused by temperature is enhanced further. The PEG and
   NA addition increased dramatically the pore volume which is important
   for cell growth and flow transport of nutrients and metabolic waste. (C)

Abstract = {{Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) exhibits fundamental
   limitations as a method to reduce energy consumption in computing
   systems. In the HPC domain, where performance is of highest priority and
   codes are heavily optimized to minimize idle time, DVFS has limited
   opportunity to achieve substantial energy savings. This paper explores
   if operating processors near the transistor threshold voltage (NTV) is a
   better alternative to DVFS for breaking the power wall in HPC. NTV
   presents challenges, since it compromises both performance and
   reliability to reduce power consumption. We present a first of its kind
   study of a significance-driven execution paradigm that selectively uses
   NTV and algorithmic error tolerance to reduce energy consumption in
   performance-constrained HPC environments. Using an iterative algorithm
   as a use case, we present an adaptive execution scheme that switches
   between near-threshold execution on many cores and above-threshold
   execution on one core, as the computational significance of iterations
   in the algorithm evolves over time. Using this scheme on
   state-of-the-art hardware, we demonstrate energy savings ranging between
   35 and 67 \%, while compromising neither correctness nor performance.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, 39 sets of hard turning (HT) experimental trials were
   performed on a Mori-Seiki SL-25Y (4-axis) computer numerical controlled
   (CNC) lathe to study the effect of cutting parameters in influencing the
   machined surface roughness. In all the trials, AISI 4340 steel workpiece
   (hardened up to 69 HRC) was machined with a commercially available CBN
   insert (Warren Tooling Limited, UK) under dry conditions. The surface
   topography of the machined samples was examined by using a white light
   interferometer and a reconfirmation of measurement was done using a Form
   Talysurf. The machining outcome was used as an input to develop various
   regression models to predict the average machined surface roughness on
   this material. Three regression models - Multiple regression, Random
   forest, and Quantile regression were applied to the experimental
   outcomes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first
   to apply random forest or quantile regression techniques to the
   machining domain. The performance of these models was compared to
   ascertain how feed, depth of cut, and spindle speed affect surface
   roughness and finally to obtain a mathematical equation correlating
   these variables. It was concluded that the random forest regression
   model is a superior choice over multiple regression models for
   prediction of surface roughness during machining of AISI 4340 steel (69
   HRC). Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The use of CO2-expanded methanol (cxMeOH) and liquid carbon dioxide
   (lCO(2)) is proposed to extract lipids from Botryococcus braunii. When
   compressed CO2 dissolves in methanol, the solvent expands in volume,
   decreases in polarity and so increases in its selectivity for biodiesel
   desirable lipids. Solid phase extraction of the algal extract showed
   that the cxMeOH extracted 21 mg of biodiesel desirable lipids per mL of
   organic solvent compared to 3 mg/mL using either neat methanol or
   chloroform/methanol mixture. The non-polar lCO(2) showed a high affinity
   for non-polar lipids. Using lCO(2), it is possible to extract up to 10\%
   neutral lipids relative to the mass of dry algae. Unlike extractions
   using conventional solvents, these new methods require little to no
   volatile, flammable, or chlorinated organic solvents. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Improving photoelectron counting and particle identification in

Journal = {{ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{40-54}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Many current and future dark matter and neutrino detectors are designed
   to measure scintillation light with a large array of photomultiplier
   tubes (PMTs). The energy resolution and particle identification
   capabilities of these detectors depend in part on the ability to
   accurately identify individual photoelectrons in PMT waveforms despite
   large variability in pulse amplitudes and pulse pileup. We describe a
   Bayesian technique that can identify the times of individual
   photoelectrons in a sampled PMT waveform without deconvolution, even
   when pileup is present. To demonstrate the technique, we apply it to the
   general problem of particle identification in single-phase liquid argon
   dark matter detectors. Using the output of the Bayesian photoelectron
   counting algorithm described in this paper, we construct several test
   statistics for rejection of backgrounds for dark matter searches in
   argon. Compared to simpler methods based on either observed charge or
   peak finding, the photoelectron counting technique improves both energy
   resolution and particle identification of low energy events in
   calibration data from the DEAP-1 detector and simulation of the larger
   MiniCLEAN dark matter detector. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS}},

Number = {{5, SI}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) power modules find widespread
   use in numerous power conversion applications where their reliability is
   of significant concern. Standard IGBT modules are fabricated for
   general-purpose applications while little has been designed for bespoke
   applications. However, conventional design of IGBTs can be improved by
   the multiobjective optimization technique. This paper proposes a novel
   design method to consider die-attachment solder failures induced by
   short power cycling and baseplate solder fatigue induced by the thermal
   cycling which are among major failure mechanisms of IGBTs. Thermal
   resistance is calculated analytically and the plastic work design is
   obtained with a high-fidelity finite-element model, which has been
   validated experimentally. The objective of minimizing the plastic work
   and constrain functions is formulated by the surrogate model. The
   nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is used to search for the
   Pareto-optimal solutions and the best design. The result of this
   combination generates an effective approach to optimize the physical
   structure of power electronic modules, taking account of historical
   environmental and operational conditions in the field.}},

Abstract = {{The wettability and hydrophobicity of super-hydrophobic (SH) meshes is
   greatly influenced by their topographic structures, chemical composition
   and coating process. In this study, the properties of copper and
   stainless steel meshes, coated with super-hydrophobic electrolessly
   deposited silver were investigated. A new method to test the pressure
   resistance of super-hydrophobic mesh was applied to avoid any
   deformation of mesh. Results showed that SH copper mesh and SH stainless
   steel meshes with the same pore size have almost the same contact angle
   and the same hydrophobicity. SH copper mesh with a pore size of 122 pin
   can resist water pressure of 4900 Pa and a decrease of pore size of mesh
   can increase the pressure resistance of SH copper mesh. The SH copper
   mesh modified with 0.1 M HS(CH2)(10)COOH solution in ethanol has a
   controllable water permeation property by simply adjusting the pH of
   water solution. SH copper mesh shows super-oleophilicity with organic
   solvents and so with a water contact angle of 0 and it can be an
   effective tool for organic solvents/water separation. The separation
   efficiency of SH copper mesh for separating mixtures of organic solvent
   and water can be as high as 99.8\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In current cellular networks, schedulers allocate wireless channel
   resources to users based on instantaneous channel gains and short-term
   moving averages of user rates and queue lengths. By using only such
   short-term information, schedulers ignore the users' service history in
   previous cells and, thus, cannot guarantee long-term quality of service
   (QoS) when users traverse multiple cells with varying load and capacity.
   In this paper, we propose a new long-term lookback scheduling (LLS)
   framework, which extends conventional short-term scheduling with
   long-term (QoS) information from previously traversed cells. We
   demonstrate the application of (LLS) for common channel aware, as well
   as channel and queue-aware schedulers. The developed long-term
   schedulers also provide a controllable trade-off between emphasizing the
   immediate user (QoS) or the long-term measures. Our simulation results
   show high gains in long-term (QoS) without sacrificing short-term user
   requirements. Therefore, the proposed scheduling approach improves
   subscriber satisfaction and increases operational efficiency. Copyright

Abstract = {{It is demonstrated that electromagnetic (EM) transmission through a
   subwavelength or non-resonant aperture in a conductive screen can be
   significantly enhanced by loading it with folded metallic strips
   exhibiting resonant properties. When illuminated by an EM plane wave,
   these loaded apertures enable very tight, subwavelength, collimation of
   the EM power in the near-field zone. The authors propose quasi-planar
   resonant insertion geometries that should allow, for the first time,
   simultaneous subwavelength near field focusing of both electric and
   magnetic fields. The proposed technique for resonance transmission
   enhancement and near-field confinement forms a basis for a new class of
   microwave near-field imaging probe with subwavelength resolution capable
   of operating over a wide range of imaging distances (0.01-0.25 lambda).
   Measurement results demonstrate the possibility of high-contrast (more
   than 3 dB in amplitude and 40 degrees in phase) near-field subwavelength
   imaging of active sources as well as the characterisation of planar
   subwavelength non-resonant dielectric targets located in free space and

Abstract = {{Scanning optics enable many laser applications in manufacturing because
   their low inertia allows rapid movement of the process beam across the
   sample. We describe our method of inline coherent imaging for real-time
   (up to 230 kHz) micron-scale (7-8 mu m axial resolution) tracking and
   control of laser machining depth through a scanning galvotelecentric
   beam delivery system. For 1 cm trench etching in stainless steel, we
   collect high speed intrapulse and interpulse morphology which is useful
   for further understanding underlying mechanisms or comparison with
   numerical models. We also collect overall sweep-to-sweep depth
   penetration which can be used for feedback depth control. For trench
   etching in silicon, we show the relationship of etch rate with average
   power and scan speed by computer processing of depth information without
   destructive sample post-processing. We also achieve three-dimensional
   infrared continuous wave (modulated) laser machining of a 3.96 x 3.96 x
   0.5 mm(3) (length x width x maximum depth) pattern on steel with depth
   feedback. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful
   demonstration of direct real-time depth monitoring and control of laser
   machining with scanning optics.}},

Abstract = {{Tetrahexahedral Pd nanocrystals (THH Pd NCs) were prepared on a glassy
   carbon electrode using a programmed square-wave potential
   electrodeposition method, and modified by Bi adatoms with a range of
   coverages via the cyclic voltammetry method. The reactivity of the
   catalysts prepared towards ethanol electrooxidation reaction (EOR) was
   studied in alkaline medium at various temperatures and under other
   conditions that practical fuel cells operate. Significant activity
   enhancements were observed for the Bi-modified THH Pd NCs with an
   optimum Bi coverage (theta(Bi)) of around 0.68 being obtained.
   Furthermore, it was found that increasing temperature from 25 degrees C
   to 60 degrees C enhances the reactivity significantly. The general
   kinetics data of EOR on Bi-decorated and bare THH Pd NCs have also been
   obtained, from the activation energy calculated based on Arrhenius
   plots, and compared. At the optimum Bi coverage, an enhancement in the
   activity of almost 3 times was achieved, and the corresponding
   activation energy was found to be reduced significantly. (C) 2015

Volume = {{512}},
Pages = {{261-272}},

Abstract = {{A former silver mine in Tynagh, Co. Galway, Ireland is one of the most
   contaminated mine sites in Europe with maximum concentrations of Zn, As,
   Pb, Mn, Ni, Cu, and Cd far exceeding guideline values for water and
   sediment. The aims of this research were to 1) further assess the
   contamination, particularly metals, in surface water and sediment around
   the site, and 2) determine if the contamination has increased 10 years
   after the Environmental Protection Agency Ireland (EPAI) identified
   off-site contamination. Site pH is alkaline to neutral because
   CaCO3-rich sediment and rock material buffer the exposed acid generating
   sulphide-rich ore. When this study was compared to the previous EPAI
   study conducted 10 years earlier, it appeared that further weathering of
   exposed surface sediment had increased concentrations of As and other
   potentially toxic elements. Water samples from the tailings ponds and
   adjacent Barnacullia Stream had concentrations of Al, Cd, Mn, Zn and Pb
   above guideline values. Lead and Zn concentrations from the tailings
   pond sediment were 16 and 5 times higher, respectively, than
   concentrations reported 10 years earlier. Pb and Zn levels in most
   sediment samples exceeded the Expert Group (EGS) guidelines of 1000 and
   5000 mg/kg, respectively. Arsenic concentrations were as high as 6238
   mg/kg in the tailings ponds sediment, which is 62 and 862 times greater
   than the EGS and Canadian Soil Quality Guidelines (CSQG), respectively.
   Cadmium, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn concentrations in water and sediment were
   above guideline values downstream of the site. Additionally, Fe, Mn and
   organic matter (OM) were strongly correlated and correlated to Zn, Pb,
   As, Cd, Cu and Ni in stream sediment. Therefore, the nearby Barnacullia
   Stream is also a significant pathway for contaminant transport to
   downstream areas. Further rehabilitation of the site may decrease the
   contamination around the area. (C) 2015 Elsevier ay. All rights

Abstract = {{A number of tetraalkylammonium methylcarbonate and hydrogencarbonate

   liberating methanol and carbon dioxide. Extraction of the neutralised
   complex into a separate methanol phase and subsequent regeneration using
   aqueous carbonic acid results in similar to 70\% of the ionic liquid
   being recovered for recycle. Isolation of the naphthenic acids shows
   that these make up to 0.85 wt\% of the crude oil. Speciation of the
   naphthenic acids shows a mixture of monocyclic, through to tetracyclic
   structures with carbon numbers in the range C-12-C-40. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Poly((diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate-co-styrene)-b-poly(methyl

   via nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP). For synthesizing the first
   block, the SG1-mediated copolymerization of 2-(diethylamino)ethyl
   methacrylate (DEAEMA), a pH-sensitive monomer, and a small percentage of
   styrene (S) was performed in water at 90 degrees C using
   2,2'-azobis{[}2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane] dihydrochloride (VA-044) as
   a positively charged stabilizer and initiator. The resultant
   macroalkoxyamine was then employed without any purification in the
   protonated form as both macroinitiator and stabilizer in the same pot
   for the surfactant-free emulsion copolymerization of methyl methacrylate
   (MMA) and styrene at 90 degrees C, which proceeded via
   polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA). Latex particles had
   monomodal size distribution, narrow size polydispersity, and small
   average size. The polymerization kinetics, the control over molar mass
   and molar mass distribution, the effect of the charge density on the
   particles size and latex stability, and the colloidal characteristics of
   the in situ formed block copolymer micelles were studied in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Using toluene dioxygenase as biocatalyst, enantiopure cis-dihydrodiol
   and cis-tetrahydrodiol metabolites, isolated as their ketone tautomers,
   were obtained from meta and ortho methoxyphenols. Although these
   isomeric phenol substrates are structurally similar, the major
   bioproducts from each of these biotransformations were found at
   different oxidation levels. The relatively stable cyclohexenone cis-diol
   metabolite from meta methoxyphenol was isolated, while the corresponding
   metabolite from ortho methoxyphenol was rapidly bioreduced to a
   cyclohexanone cis-diol. The chemistry of the 3-methoxycyclohexenone
   cis-diol product was investigated and elimination, aromatization,
   hydrogenation, regioselective O-exchange, Stork-Danheiser transposition
   and O-methylation reactions were observed. An offshoot of this
   technology provided a two-step chemoenzymatic synthesis, from meta
   methoxyphenol, of a recently reported chiral fungal metabolite; this
   synthesis also established the previously unassigned absolute

Abstract = {{In this paper, the overall formation stability of an unmanned
   multi-vehicle is mathematically presented under interconnection
   topologies. A novel definition of formation error is first given and
   followed by the proposed formation stability hypothesis. Based on this
   hypothesis, a unique extension-decomposition-aggregation scheme is then
   employed to support the stability analysis for the overall multi-vehicle
   formation under a mesh topology. It is proved that the overall formation
   control system consisting of N number of nonlinear vehicles is not only
   asymptotically stable, but also exponentially stable in the sense of
   Lyapunov within a neighbourhood of the desired formation. This technique
   is shown to be applicable for a mesh topology but is equally applicable
   for other topologies. A simulation study of the formation manoeuvre of
   multiple Aerosonde UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), in 3-D space, is
   finally carried out verifying the achieved formation stability result.}},

Abstract = {{Asymmetric MarcusHush (AMH) theory is applied for the first time in
   ionic solvents to model the voltammetric reduction of oxygen in
   1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide and of
   2-nitrotoluene (2-NT), nitrocyclopentane (NCP), and 1-nitro-butane (BuN)
   in trihexyltetradecylphosphonium
   tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate on a gold microdisc electrode.
   An asymmetry parameter, gamma, was estimated for all systems as -0.4 for
   the reduction of oxygen and -0.05, 0.25, and 0 +/- 0.05 for the
   reductions of 2-NT, NCP, and BuN, respectively, which suggests equal
   force constants of reactants and products in the case of 2-NT and BuN
   and unequal force constants for oxygen and NCP where the force constants
   of the oxidized species are greater than the reduced species in the case
   of oxygen and less than the reduced species in the case of NCP.
   Previously measured values for a, the Butler-Volmer transfer
   coefficient, reflect this in each case. Where appreciable asymmetry
   occurs, AMH theory was seen to parametrize the experimental data better
   than either Butler-Volmer or symmetric Marcus-Hush theory, allowing
   additionally the extraction of reorganization energy. This is the first
   study to provide key physical insights into electrochemical systems in
   room-temperature ionic liquids using AMH theory, allowing elucidation of
   the reorganization energies and the relative force constants of the
   reactants and products in each reaction.}},

Abstract = {{We study a harmonically confined atomic gas which is subjected to an

   exact relation showing that the centre-of-mass position of the atomic
   cloud is directly related to the global optical conductivity of the
   system. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by calculating
   the optical conductivity of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. In the
   Mott insulating phase, there is clear evidence of an optical Mott gap,
   providing a proof-of-principle demonstration that the global optical
   conductivity gives high-quality information about the excitations of

Abstract = {{Radar radio frequency (RF) stealth is very important in electronic war
   (EW), and waveform design and selection. Existing evaluation rules of
   radar RF stealth include too many parameters of radar and interceptors,
   such as Schleher interception factor, which makes it difficult to
   evaluate radar RF stealth technologies if interceptor parameters are
   unknown. In communication, security capacity has been presented to
   describe the possible ability to communicate in complete security. Since
   the essential of the security capacity is to have the interceptor get
   none valued information from the emitter, this paper is proposed to
   study security information factors taking advantage of mutual
   information to evaluate radar RF stealth under some conditions. Through
   analyzing mutual information obtained by the radar and the interceptor,
   this paper defines the security information factor with and without
   cooperative jamming. Furthermore, this paper deduces the ratio of the
   match filter to the match incoherent filter and discuss mutual
   information received by the interceptor. Numerical simulations
   illustrate radar RF stealth effects based on the security information
   factor concept under different conditions.}},

Abstract = {{To improve knowledge of the wind loads on photovoltaic structures
   mounted on flat roofs at the high angles required in high latitudes, and
   to study starting flow on low aspect ratio wind turbine blades, a series
   of wind tunnel tests were undertaken. Thin flat plates of aspect ratios
   between 0.4 and 9.0 were mounted on a sensitive three-component
   instantaneous force and moment sensor. The Reynolds numbers varied from
   6 x 10(4) to 2 x 10(5). Measurements were made for angles of attack
   between 0 degrees and 90 degrees both in the free stream and in wall
   proximity with increased turbulence and mean shear. The ratio of drag to
   lift closely follows the inverse tangent of the angle of incidence for
   virtually all measurements. This implies that the forces of interest are
   due largely to the instantaneous pressure distribution around the plate
   and are not significantly influenced by shear stresses. The
   instantaneous forces appear most complex for the smaller aspect ratios
   but the intensity of the normal force fluctuations is between 10\% and
   20\% in the free-steam but can exceed 30\% near the wall. As the wind
   tunnel floor is approached, the lift and drag reduce with increasing
   aspect ratio, and there is a reduction in the high frequency components
   of the forces. It is shown that the centre of pressure is closer to the
   centre of the plates than the quarter-chord position for nearly all
   cases.}},

Journal = {{EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{336-373}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Many software companies are shifting from the traditional multi-month
   release cycle to shorter release cycles. For example, Google Chrome and
   Mozilla Firefox release new versions every 6 weeks. These shorter
   release cycles reduce the users' waiting time for a new release and
   offer better feedback and marketing opportunities to companies, but it
   is unclear if the quality of the software product improves as well,
   since developers and testers are under more pressure. In this paper, we
   extend our previous empirical study of Mozilla Firefox on the impact of
   rapid releases on quality assurance with feedback by Mozilla project
   members. The study compares crash rates, median uptime, and the
   proportion of pre- and post-release bugs in traditional releases with
   those in rapid releases, and we also analyze the source code changes
   made by developers to identify potential changes in the development
   process. We found that (1) with shorter release cycles, users do not
   experience significantly more pre- or post-release bugs
   (percentage-wise) and (2) bugs are fixed faster, yet (3) users
   experience these bugs earlier during software execution (the program
   crashes earlier). Increased integration activity and propagation of
   harder bugs to later versions account for some of these findings.
   Overall, our case study suggests that a clear release engineering
   process with thorough automation is one of the major challenges when
   switching to rapid releases.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{466-478}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The effect of spanwise flexibility on the development of leading-edge
   vortices for impulsively started flat plates at low Reynolds numbers has
   been investigated. A theoretical model is proposed, based on the
   Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, coupled with a vortex growth model based on
   vorticity flux through a leading-edge shear layer. The model was
   validated for rigid and flexible flat plates undergoing a towing motion
   at an angle-of-attack of 45 degrees. It is shown that a phase-delay in
   lift and drag generation occurs between rigid and flexible cases. The
   model indicates decreasing vorticity along the span as the wing is
   accelerated and begins to bend. Particle image velocimetry measurements
   conducted at three different spanwise planes showed a delay in vortex
   growth along the span, despite a uniform spanwise circulation. This
   uniform spanwise distribution of circulation is in contrast to the
   quasi-two-dimensional model, which predicted a reduced circulation near
   the profile tip where plate motion was delayed. It is therefore
   concluded that circulation must be dynamically redistributed through
   vorticity convection during the impulsive motion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{In search of common grounds: Stitching the divided landscape of urban
   parks in Belfast}},
Journal = {{CITIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{40-49}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Political and spatial contestation in divided cities contributes to
   strategies of self-defense that Utilize physical and spatial settings to
   enable the constitution of social boundaries, borders and territories.
   Urban parks that are designed to ease division through an open
   transitional landscape can instead facilitate further segregation
   through their spatial order and facility layout. This paper investigates
   the role of the spatial design and material landscape of integrated
   parks in Belfast interface areas as instruments of engagement or
   division. It does so by analyzing the spatial organization of the parks'
   facilities and the resultant `social voids.' Space, time and distance
   were found to be effective tools for the negotiation of privacy, the
   manifestation of power, and the interplay of dominance and
   self-confidence. In the context of a divided city, strong
   community-culture tends to reproduce new boundaries and territories
   within the shared landscape. Through user interviews and spatial
   analysis, this paper outlines the design principles that influence
   spatial behavior in the urban parks of contested urban landscapes. It
   argues that despite granting equal access to shared public facilities,
   social voids and physical gaps can instill practices of division that
   deepen territorial barriers, both psychologically and spatially. (C)

Title = {{Integrated Indoor Navigation System for Ground Vehicles With Automatic
   3-D Alignment and Position Initialization}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces an autonomous integrated indoor navigation system
   for ground vehicles that fuses inertial sensors, light detection and
   ranging (LiDAR) sensors, received signal strength (RSS) observations in
   wireless local area networks (WLANs), odometry, and predefined occupancy
   floor maps. This paper proposes a solution for the problem of automatic
   self-alignment and position initialization indoors under the absence of
   an absolute navigation system such as Global Navigation Satellite
   Systems (GNSS). The initial tilt angles (roll and pitch) are estimated
   by an extended Kalman filter (EKF) that uses two horizontal
   accelerometers as measurements. The initial position and heading
   estimation is performed using a subimage matching algorithm based on
   normalized cross-correlation between projected 2-D LiDAR scans and an
   occupancy floor map of the environment. The ambiguities in
   position/heading initialization are resolved using RSS. The proposed
   position/heading estimation module is also utilized in navigation mode
   as a source of absolute position/heading updates to EKF for enhanced
   observability. The state predictor is an enhanced 3-D inertial
   navigation system that utilizes low-cost microelectromechanical system
   (MEMS)-based reduced inertial sensor set aided by vehicle odometry. In
   navigation mode, LiDAR scans are used to estimate the vehicle's relative
   motions using an inertial-aided iterative closest point algorithm. To
   fuse all available measurements, a multirate multimode EKF design is
   proposed to correct navigation states and estimate sensor biases. The
   developed system was tested under a real indoor office environment
   covered by an IEEE 802.11 WLAN on a mobile robot platform equipped with
   MEMS inertial sensors, a WLAN interface, a 2-D LiDAR scanner, and a
   quadrature encoder. Results demonstrated the capabilities of the
   self-alignment and initialization module and showed average
   submeter-level positioning accuracy.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an algorithm for estimating the instantaneous
   fundamental frequency of a noisy non-stationary periodic signal whose
   components are harmonically related. To this end, the authors' propose a
   harmonic state-space model for the input signal and use it to derive an
   extended Kalman filter (EKF), an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and a
   particle filter (PF). In this model, the input signal is characterised
   by a time-varying fundamental frequency and amplitude which is a
   practical assumption for real-world periodic signals. In contrast to
   most of existing methods such as short-time Fourier transform, the
   proposed algorithm does not use any windowing technique. Therefore the
   trade-off between time and frequency resolutions is less controversial
   and so can be used for real-time frequency tracking. It also reveals
   some fine and continuous variations in signal pitch such as Vibrato and
   Glissando. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs
   well even when most of the signal energy is contained in the
   higher-order harmonics. The performance of the proposed algorithm using
   EKF, UKF and PF is also evaluated and the results are compared in
   diverse conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The solubility of carbon dioxide in five tetraalkylphosphonium superbase

   trihexyltetradecylphoshonium benzimidazolide,

   under dry and wet conditions at 22 A degrees C and at atmospheric
   pressure, using a gravimetric saturation technique. The effects of anion
   structure and of the presence or absence of water in the solution on the
   carbon dioxide solubility were then deduced from the data. H-1 and
   C-13-NMR spectroscopy and ab initio calculations were also conducted to
   probe the interactions in these solutions, as carbon dioxide and water
   can compete in the ionic liquid structure during the absorption process.
   Additionally, the viscosity of selected superbase ionic liquids was
   measured under dry and wet conditions, in the presence or absence of
   CO2, to evaluate their practical application in carbon dioxide capture
   processes. Finally, the recyclability of the
   trihexyltetradecylphoshonium 1,2,4-triazolide under dry and wet

   electrode was then investigated by following the evolution of
   Li/electrolyte interfaces through impedance measurements. Interestingly,
   the impedances of the investigated Li/electrolyte interfaces were found
   to be more than three times lower than that measured using the standard
   electrolyte. Finally, electrochemical performances of the ionic
   liquid-based electrolytes were investigated using galvanostatic charge

Abstract = {{Herein, we report the densities and speeds of sound in binary mixtures
   of three hydrophobic and one hydrophilic ionic liquids:
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide,
   {[}C(4)mim]{[}NTf2], 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium
   bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide, {[}C(4)mpyr]{[}NTf2],
   1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide,
   {[}C(3)mim]{[}NTf2] and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate,
   {[}C(2)mim]{[}SCN], with water at 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa. The
   concentration range of water, which encompassed relatively small values
   well below the saturation point, is often regarded as an impurity for
   hydrophobic ionic liquids. On the basis of experimental results the
   molar volume, adiabatic molar compressibility, partial molar volume and
   apparent molar volume, as well as, partial molar and apparent molar
   isentropic compressibility properties were then calculated. Interesting
   results are obtained using the solutions based on the hydrophilic
   {[}C(2)mim]{[}SCN], since these mixtures are characterized by relatively
   low density and high values of speed of sound. Furthermore, the partial
   molar volumes and partial molar adiabatic compressibilities of water in
   solution with {[}C(2)mim]{[}SCN] are the lowest among the investigated
   in mixtures with ionic liquids. However, in the case of the hydrophobic
   ionic liquid solutions, only small differences are observed for molar
   adiabatic compressibilities with the change of the cation structure,
   i.e. for water + {[}C(4)mim]{[}NTf2] or + {[}C(4)mpyr]{[}NTf2]. A more
   pronounced difference has been observed for the partial molar
   compressibility of water in solutions with these two ionic liquids.}},

   within the composite, whereas annealing alone results in the formation
   of randomly interconnected nanotubes. Dielectric spectroscopy shows
   that, due to their ordered carbon nanotube structures, the electrified
   composites exhibit substantially higher conductivity and storage
   capacity compared to the as-compounded composites and consistently
   better electrical properties than their annealed counterparts. An

Abstract = {{Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) following aqua regia digestion and
   X-ray fluorescence (XRF) are both geochemical techniques used to
   determine `total' concentrations of elements in soil. The aim of this
   study is to compare these techniques, identify elements for which
   inconsistencies occur and investigate why they arise. A study area
   (similar to 14,000 km(2)) with a variety of total concentration controls
   and a large geochemical dataset (n = 7950) was selected. Principal
   component analysis determined underlying variance in a dataset composed
   of both geogenic and anthropogenic elements. Where inconsistencies
   between the techniques were identified, further numerical and spatial
   analysis was completed. The techniques are more consistent for elements
   of geogenic sources and lead, whereas other elements of anthropogenic
   sources show less consistency within rural samples. XRF is affected by
   sample matrix, while the form of element affects ICP concentrations.
   Depending on their use in environmental studies, different outcomes
   would be expected from the techniques employed, suggesting the choice of
   analytical technique for geochemical analyses may be more critical than
   realised.}},

Abstract = {{Wind generation in highly interconnected power networks creates local
   and centralised stability issues based on their proximity to
   conventional synchronous generators and load centres. This study
   examines the large disturbance stability issues (i.e. rotor angle and
   voltage stability) in power networks with geographically distributed
   wind resources in the context of a number of dispatch scenarios based on
   profiles of historical wind generation for a real power network.
   Stability issues have been analysed using novel stability indices
   developed from dynamic characteristics of wind generation. The results
   of this study show that localised stability issues worsen when
   significant penetration of both conventional and wind generation is
   present because of their non-complementary characteristics. In contrast,
   network stability improves when either high penetration of wind and
   synchronous generation is present in the network. Therefore network
   regions can be clustered into two distinct stability groups (i.e.
   superior stability and inferior stability regions). Network stability
   improves when a voltage control strategy is implemented at wind farms,
   however both stability clusters remain unchanged irrespective of change
   in the control strategy. Moreover, this study has shown that the
   enhanced fault ride-through strategy for wind farms can improve both
   voltage and rotor angle stability locally, but only a marginal
   improvement is evident in neighbouring regions.}},

Abstract = {{A novel diffraction-based method has been developed to determine the
   substructure in terms of the fraction of prevailing slip systems and
   dislocation densities in multiple individual texture components of
   strongly textured materials. The method was applied to a strongly
   textured cold-rolled Zircaloy-2 sample, compressed along the normal
   direction of the rolled plate. Fourteen diffraction patterns were
   collected by time-of-flight neutron diffraction experiments at seven
   different purposely selected sample orientations. The diffraction peaks
   corresponding only to one single texture component out of the four
   prevailing components were identified and used to construct
   texture-specific diffraction patterns. The best five such patterns were
   evaluated by the convolutional multiple whole profile procedure of line
   profile analysis for the fractions of the prevailing a-, c+a- and c-type
   slip systems and the corresponding dislocation densities. It is found
   that in the three texture components with the c axis not parallel to the
   normal direction of rolling the average dislocation densities and
   fractions of slip-system types are the same. However, in the texture
   component with the c axis parallel to the normal direction of rolling
   the fraction of the a-type slip system is somewhat smaller than in the
   other components and that of the c-type slip system is somewhat larger
   than zero. The fractions of the prevailing slip systems are in good
   correlation with literature data of self-consistent polycrystal
   plasticity modeling of Zircaloy-2.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new technique for the detection of islanding

   prevalent in systems with significant penetrations of distributed
   renewable generation. The proposed technique is based on the application
   of principal component analysis (PCA) to data sets of wide-area
   frequency measurements, recorded by phasor measurement units. The PCA
   approach was able to detect islanding accurately and quickly when
   compared with conventional RoCoF techniques, as well as with the
   frequency difference and change-of-angle difference methods recently
   proposed in the literature. The reliability and accuracy of the proposed
   PCA approach is demonstrated by using a number of test cases, which
   consider islanding and nonislanding events. The test cases are based on
   real data, recorded from several phasor measurement units located in the
   U.K. power system.}},

Abstract = {{Uniform submicron La2NiO4+delta (sm-LNO) powders have been synthesized
   by a facile polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-assisted hydrothermal route. In
   the presence of PVP, sm-LNO of pure phase has been obtained by
   calcination at the relatively low temperature of 900 A degrees C for 8
   h. Compared micron-sized LNO (m-LNO) particles obtained at 1,000 A
   degrees C by hydrothermal synthesis route without PVP assisted, the
   sm-LNO-PVP displays regularly shaped and well-distributed particles in
   the range of 0.3-0.5 mu m. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   results showed that the sm-LNO sample is submicronic and that the m-LNO
   sample shows agglomerates with a broad size distribution. The
   electrochemical performance of m-LNO and sm-LNO-PVP has been
   investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The polarization
   resistance of the sm-LNO-PVP cathode reaches a value of 0.40 Omega cm(2)
   at 750 A degrees C, which is lower than that of m-LNO (0.62 Omega
   cm(2)). This result indicates that a fine electrode microstructure with
   submicron particles can help to increase the active sites, accelerate
   oxygen diffusion, and reduce polarization resistance. An anode-supported
   single cell with sm-LNO cathode has been fabricated and tested over a
   temperature range from 650 to 800 A degrees C. The maximum power density
   of the cell has achieved 834 mW cm(-2) at 750 A degrees C. These results
   therefore show that this PVP-assisted hydrothermal method is an
   effective approach to construct submicron-structured cathode and enhance
   the performance of intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-consolidated carbon fibre-reinforced polyphenylene sulphide (CF/PPS)
   laminates were thermoformed into V-shaped parts via designed out of
   autoclave thermoforming experiments. The different processing conditions
   tested in the experiment have resulted in final part angles whose
   differences ranged from 2.087 to 3.431 degrees from the original mould
   angle. The test results show that processing conditions influenced
   finished part dimensions as the final sample angles were found to
   decrease relative to the tooling dimensions, as mould temperature
   increases. Higher mould temperature conditions produce thinner parts due
   to the thermal expansion of mould tools. The mould temperature of 170
   degrees C, which can produce parts with high degree of crystallinity as
   well as small size of crystal, has been established as the optimal
   thermoforming condition for CF/PPS composites.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of temperature on the tensile and fatigue strength of
   vibration-welded and unwelded postindustrial waste nylon 6 reinforced
   with 30 wt\% glass fiber (PIWGF) was experimentally examined, and the
   results were compared to those obtained from a 30 wt\% glass fiber
   reinforced prime nylon 6 compound (PAGF) from a previous study. Fatigue
   tests were performed under sinusoidal constant amplitude tension-tension
   load at a stress ratio of R=0.1 and within the frequency range of 2-10
   Hz at temperatures from 24 to 120 degrees C. Stress levels from just
   under the tensile strength down to the run-out point at 5 million cycles
   were used. It was found that increasing temperature led to a significant
   decrease in both tensile strength and fatigue life. For PIWGF, there was
   approximate to 20\% strength reduction under both static tensile and
   cyclic loading as compared to PAGF. For both welded and unwelded PIWGF,
   the endurance ratio; i.e., the ratio of fatigue strength to static
   tensile strength, was approximate to 45\% regardless of the temperature.
   The fatigue notch factor (K-f) was between 1.4 and 1.8 for all test

Title = {{A design strategy of large grain lithium-rich layered oxides for

Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},

Abstract = {{Li-rich materials are considered the most promising for Li-ion battery
   cathodes, as high capacity can be achieved. However, poor cycling
   stability is a critical drawback that leads to poor capacity retention.
   Here a strategy is used to synthesize a large-grain lithium-rich layered
   oxides to overcome this difficulty without sacrificing rate capability.
   This material is designed with micron scale grain with a width of about
   300 nm and length of 1-3 mu m. This unique structure has a better
   ability to overcome stress-induced structural collapse caused by Li-ion
   insertion/extraction and reduce the dissolution of Mn ions, which enable
   a reversible and stable capacity. As a result, this cathode material
   delivered a highest discharge capacity of around 308 mAh g (1) at a
   current density of 30 mAg (1) with retention of 88.3\% (according to the
   highest discharge capacity) after 100 cycles, 190 mAhg (1) at a current
   density of 300 mA g (1) and almost no capacity fading after 100 cycles.
   Therefore, Lithium-rich material of large-grain structure is a promising
   cathode candidate in Lithium-ion batteries with high capacity and high
   cycle stability for application. This strategy of large grain may
   furthermore open the door to synthesize the other complex architectures
   for various applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The world's oceans have undergone significant ecological changes
   following European colonial expansion and associated industrialization.
   Seabirds are useful indicators of marine food web structure and can be
   used to track multidecadal environmental change, potentially reflecting
   long-term human impacts. We used stable isotope (C-13, N-15) analysis of
   feathers from glaucous-winged gulls (Larus glaucescens) in a heavily
   disturbed region of the northeast Pacific to ask whether diets of this
   generalist forager changed in response to shifts in food availability
   over 150years, and whether any detected change might explain long-term
   trends in gull abundance. Sampled feathers came from birds collected
   between 1860 and 2009 at nesting colonies in the Salish Sea, a
   transboundary marine system adjacent to Washington, USA and British
   Columbia, Canada. To determine whether temporal trends in stable isotope
   ratios might simply reflect changes to baseline environmental values, we
   also analysed muscle tissue from forage fishes collected in the same
   region over a multidecadal timeframe. Values of C-13 and N-15 declined
   since 1860 in both subadult and adult gulls (C-13, similar to 2-6 parts
   per thousand; N-15, similar to 4-5 parts per thousand), indicating that
   their diet has become less marine over time, and that birds now feed at
   a lower trophic level than previously. Conversely, forage fish C-13 and
   N-15 values showed no trends, supporting our conclusion that gull
   feather values were indicative of declines in marine food availability
   rather than of baseline environmental change. Gradual declines in
   feather isotope values are consistent with trends predicted had gulls
   consumed less fish over time, but were equivocal with respect to whether
   gulls had switched to a more garbage-based diet, or one comprising
   marine invertebrates. Nevertheless, our results suggest a long-term
   decrease in diet quality linked to declining fish abundance or other
   anthropogenic influences, and may help to explain regional population
   declines in this species and other piscivores.}},

Abstract = {{Belief revision performs belief change on an agent's beliefs when new
   evidence (either of the form of a propositional formula or of the form
   of a total pre-order on a set of interpretations) is received. Jeffrey's
   rule is commonly used for revising probabilistic epistemic states when
   new information is probabilistically uncertain. In this paper, we
   propose a general epistemic revision framework where new evidence is of
   the form of a partial epistemic state. Our framework extends Jeffrey's
   rule with uncertain inputs and covers well-known existing frameworks
   such as ordinal conditional function (OCF) or possibility theory. We
   then define a set of postulates that such revision operators shall
   satisfy and establish representation theorems to characterize those
   postulates. We show that these postulates reveal common characteristics
   of various existing revision strategies and are satisfied by OCF
   conditionalization, Jeffrey's rule of conditioning and possibility
   conditionalization. Furthermore, when reducing to the belief revision
   situation, our postulates can induce Darwiche and Pearl's postulates C1
   and C2. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites are used to retrofit
   or reinforce existing civil infrastructure. When a new combination of
   carbon fiber/epoxy system is to be implemented, elevated temperature
   requirements must be evaluated to determine performance in fire or hot
   climates. This article presents experimental results conducted on
   small-scale CFRP laminates produced by the hand layup technique to
   determine tensile strength and single lap-splice shear strength at
   temperatures from 23 to 200 degrees C. Two curing regimes were
   evaluated: room temperature (23 degrees C) and elevated temperature (120
   degrees C). The dynamic mechanical analyzer was used to determine the
   glass transition values from each curing regime. Strength tests were
   performed at steady-state (heat, then load to failure) and transient
   (hold load, increase temperature to failure) temperatures. Loss of
   tensile strength and modulus at elevated temperature is thought to be
   due to polymer resin matrix softening and loss of load transfer
   capability from fiber to fiber, whereas failure of the tensile bond
   strength between the two laminates is believed to be due to the
   degradation of the polymer resin matrix material. Analysis of variance
   (ANOVA) one-way statistical analysis has shown that CFRP composite
   specimens have a statistically significant loss in tensile strength,
   stiffness, and bond strength as the test temperature was increased but
   are not statistically significant when grouped above and below the glass
   transition temperature. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Axial Loading Tests and Simplified Modeling of Sandwich Panels with GFRP
   Skins and Soft Core at Various Slenderness Ratios}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Experimental and analytical studies were conducted to investigate the
   axial strength and failure modes of sandwich panels with glass fiber
   reinforced polymer (GFRP) skins and soft polyurethane core. A total of
   45 specimens of 78 x 150 mm cross-section and of lengths L-e varying
   from 500 to 2,400 mm {[}i.e., slenderness ratio (KLe:r) of 15-70, where
   r is the radius of gyration] were tested concentrically using pin-ends
   (K = 1). The effects of skin thickness and an internal GFRP rib on axial
   behavior were studied. The study first assessed the level of
   out-of-straightness and concluded that all specimens generally fall
   within an acceptable limit of span/1,000. A model based on sandwich
   panel theory, accounting for excessive shear deformations of the soft
   core, was used to predict axial strength at a wide range of KLe:r and
   then used in a parametric study. It was shown that short panels with
   KLe:r of 15-17 experienced local failure, outwards skin wrinkling in
   non-ribbed panels, or skin crushing in ribbed panels. Slender panels
   with KLe:r of 41-70 experienced global buckling followed by secondary
   local failure. Panels with intermediate slenderness (17-41) showed mixed
   failure modes. The load at which local failure governs at low KLe:r
   appears to be a constant, independent of KL(e)r, whereas the global
   buckling load decreases significantly with increasing KLe:r. Increasing
   skin thickness appears to be more effective at high KLe:r whereas
   increasing core shear modulus appears to be more effective at low KLe:r.

Abstract = {{Widespread deterioration of reinforced concrete (RC) bridge structures
   due to corrosion of steel reinforcement has resulted in an increased use
   of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforcing bars as an
   alternative reinforcement type for new bridge construction.
   Disadvantages of glass fiber-reinforced polymer reinforced concrete
   (GFRP-RC) flexural elements may include increased deflections and crack
   widths, significant reductions in the concrete contribution to shear
   resistance and susceptibility to fatigue failure. Posttensioned carbon
   fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) tendons can be used to effectively
   improve serviceability and shear resistance while increasing the fatigue
   life of the structure. An experimental study on the fatigue behavior of
   full-scale slab bridge strips with a reinforcement system combining
   passive GFRP reinforcing bars and active CFRP tendons is presented,
   along with analytical models to predict their fatigue lives and changes
   in stiffness resulting from repeated loading. The fatigue models
   presented are applicable to any GFRP-RC flexural members to predict
   changes in deflections, crack widths, and fatigue strength. The proposed
   reinforcement system presents a viable alternative to conventional
   design for short span slab bridges. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The flexural and shear performances are evaluated for concrete beams
   reinforced with basalt fiber-reinforced polymer (BFRP) rebar and
   stirrups. Nine 150 x 300 x 3, 100-mm beams were tested in four-point
   bending to examine the effect of BFRP flexural reinforcement ratios
   varying from 0.28 to 1.60 the balanced ratio on the structural
   performance. The beams were reinforced by either BFRP or steel stirrups,
   and some had no shear reinforcement. It was shown that ultimate and
   service loads increased with flexural reinforcement ratio for all shear
   reinforcement types while the service load levels were not affected by
   stirrup type. Beams without stirrups and those with BFRP stirrups failed
   in shear, with the former reaching 55-58\% of ultimate flexural capacity
   and the latter failing by stirrup rupture at 90-96\% of flexural
   capacity. Beams with steel stirrups failed in flexure. Deformability
   values show that methods that combine strength and curvature digress
   more from those based on midspan strain energy as shear-related
   deformation increases. Standard provisions predicted well the capacity
   of beams failing in flexure. For beams failing in shear, standards were
   both conservative and nonconservative. The modified compression field
   theory predicted well the shear capacity for members with and without
   stirrups. Designated methods gave reasonable predictions for service
   loads at deflections of span/360 and span/180. (C) 2014 American Society

Abstract = {{The effect of colloidal nanosilica on the fresh and rheological
   parameters, plastic shrinkage, heat of hydration, and compressive
   strength of cement-based grouts is investigated in this paper. The fresh
   and rheological properties were evaluated by the minislump flow, Marsh
   cone flow time, Lombardi plate cohesion meter, yield value, and plastic
   viscosity. The key parameters investigated were the dosages of
   nanosilica and superplasticizer and temperature of mixing water.
   Statistical models and isoresponse curves were developed to capture the
   significant trends. The dosage of nanosilica had a significant effect on
   the results. The increase in the dosage of nanosilica led to increasing
   the values of flow time, plate cohesion meter, yield stress, plastic
   viscosity, heat of hydration at 1 day and 3 days, and compressive
   strength at 1 day, while reducing the minislump, plastic shrinkage up 24
   h, and compressive strength at 3, 7, and 28 days. Conversely, the
   increase in the dosage of superplasticizer led to decreasing the values
   of flow time, plate cohesion meter, yield stress, plastic viscosity,
   heat of hydration at 1 day and 3 days, and compressive strength at 1
   day, while increasing the minislump, plastic shrinkage, and compressive
   strength at 3 and 7 days. Increasing the temperature of mixing water led
   to a notable increase in the results of minislump, flow time, plastic
   viscosity, heat of hydration at 3 days, and compressive strength at 1
   day, while it reduced the plate cohesion, compressive strength at 3, 7,

   facilitate optimizing the mixture proportions of grouts for target

Abstract = {{Lower Cretaceous meandering and braided fluvial sandstones of the Nubian
   Formation form some of the most important subsurface reservoir rocks in
   the Sirt Basin, north-central Libya. Mineralogical, petrographical and
   geochemical analyses of sandstone samples from well BB6-59, Sarir
   oilfield, indicate that the meandering fluvial sandstones are fine- to
   very fine-grained subarkosic arenites (av. Q(91)F(5)L(4)), and that
   braided fluvial sandstones are medium- to very coarse-grained quartz
   arenites (av. Q(96)F(3)L(1)). The reservoir qualities of these
   sandstones were modified during both eodiagenesis (ca. <70 degrees C; <2
   km) and mesodiagenesis (ca. >70 degrees C; >2 km). Reservoir quality
   evolution was controlled primarily by the dissolution and
   kaolinitization of feldspars, micas and mud intraclasts during
   eodiagenesis, and by the amount and thickness of grain-coating clays,
   chemical compaction and quartz overgrowths during mesodiagenesis.
   However, dissolution and kaolinitization of feldspars, micas and mud
   intraclasts resulted in the creation of intercrystalline micro- and
   mouldic macro-porosity and permeability during eodiagenesis, which were
   more widespread in braided fluvial than in meandering fluvial
   sandstones. This was because of the greater depositional porosity and
   permeability in the braided fluvial sandstones which enhanced
   percolation of meteoric waters. The development of only limited quartz
   overgrowths in the braided fluvial sandstones, in which quartz grains
   are coated by thick illite layers, retained high porosity and
   permeability (12-23\% and 30-600 mD). By contrast, meandering fluvial
   sandstones underwent porosity loss as a result of quartz overgrowth
   development on quartz grains which lack or have thin and incomplete
   grain-coating illite (2-15\% and 0-0.1 mD). Further loss of porosity in
   the meandering fluvial sandstones occurred as a result of chemical
   compaction (pressure dissolution) induced by the occurrence of micas
   along grains contacts. Other diagenetic alterations, such as the growth
   of pyrite, siderite, dolomite/ankerite and albitization, had little
   impact on reservoir quality. The albitization of feldspars may have had
   minor positive influence on reservoir quality through the creation of
   intercrystalline micro-porosity between albite crystals. The results of
   this study show that diagenetic modifications of the braided and
   meandering fluvial sandstones in the Nubian Formation, and resulting
   changes in reservoir quality, are closely linked to depositional
   porosity and permeability. They are also linked to the thickness of
   grain-coating infiltrated clays, and to variations in detrital
   composition, particularly the amounts of mud intraclasts, feldspars and
   mica grains as well as climatic conditions.}},

   incomplete. So we have studied this system using ab initio total energy
   calculations and scanning tunneling microscopy. We find that although
   perturbations to the equilibrium geometry of the surface are in general
   weak, the perturbations to the electronic structure can be quite strong
   due to the presence of dangling bonds composed of Si-3p(z) orbitals.
   Additionally, we propose a possible structure for a previously

   images as an equilateral triangular arrangement of Si adatoms with

   fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates, this approach should be quite
   efficient according to Euler's buckling rule, in which column strength
   is stiffness-controlled. This approach is different from the classical
   transverse-wrapping method for confinement, a technique that achieves
   strengthening by enlarging the (P-M) diagram in the
   compression-controlled region. The proposed model accounts for concrete
   nonlinearity in compression, cracking in tension, steel rebar
   plasticity, and certainly geometric nonlinearity, in addition to the
   possibility of premature CFRP-debonding failure in tension and the lower
   CFRP strength in compression than tension. The model is validated
   against experimental results and used in a parametric study to assess
   the effects of slenderness ratio., axial load initial eccentricity ratio
   e(0)/h, CFRP reinforcement ratio rho(f), and modulus E-f. It was shown
   that significant gains in axial strength, ranging from 17 to 90\%, occur
   as the magnitudes of lambda, rho(f), E-f and e(0)/h increase. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Many countries are considering policy instruments such as a carbon tax
   and economic discounting to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in key
   sectors like the water sector. This paper examines the impact of
   economic discounting and a carbon tax on the optimization of water main
   rehabilitation. A new pipe rehabilitation optimization algorithm that
   accounts for GHGs was developed and applied to the Fairfield water
   distribution system in Amherstview, Ontario, Canada. GHG intensity
   factors for the provinces of Ontario (low-carbon) and Alberta
   (high-carbon) were applied to the Fairfield network. In both cases,
   adopting a low discount rate and levying a carbon tax had a weak effect
   in reducing energy use, GHG emissions, pipe breaks, and leakage.
   Further, a low discount rate and a carbon tax encouraged the search
   process to invest in rehabilitation early in the planning period to
   reduce continuing leakage, pipe repair, energy, and GHG costs. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We compare the ratio of the amplitudes of the third to the first
   harmonic of the torque, , measured in rotational parallel-disk flow,
   with the ratio of the corresponding harmonics of the shear stress, |tau
   (3)|/|tau (1)|, that would be observed in sliding-plate or cone-plate
   flow. In other words, we seek a correction factor with which must be
   multiplied, to get the quantity |tau (3)|/|tau (1)|, where |tau
   (3)|/|tau (1)| is obtained from any simple shearing flow geometry. In
   this paper, we explore theoretically, the disagreement between and tau
   (3)/tau (1) using the simplest continuum model relevant to
   large-amplitude oscillatory shear flow: the single relaxation time
   co-rotational Maxwell model. We focus on the region where the harmonic
   amplitudes and thus, their ratios, can be fully described with power
   laws. This gives the expression for , by integrating the explicit
   analytical solution for the shear stress. In the power law region, we
   find that, for low Weissenberg numbers, for the third harmonics , and
   for the fifth harmonics, . We verify these results experimentally. In
   other words, the heterogeneous flow field of the parallel-disk geometry
   significantly attenuates the higher harmonics, when compared with the
   homogeneous, sliding-plate flow. This is because only the outermost part
   of the sample is subject to the high shear rate amplitude. Furthermore,
   our expression for the torque in large-amplitude oscillatory
   parallel-disk flow is also useful for the simplest design of viscous
   torsional dampers, that is, those incorporating a viscoelastic liquid
   between two disks.}},

Abstract = {{The texture and phase evolution of metastable beta-III Ti alloy wires,
   produced in a medical-grade wire-processing facility, are examined via
   synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The texture development in the beta-phase
   was interpreted by a simple viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) modeling
   approach. Both the stress-induced martensite and stress-induced omega
   phase transformations are observed during the early stage of cold
   deformation. The < 1 1 0 >(beta) texture is gradually replaced by the <
   2 1 0 >(beta) texture at cold work levels above 50\% total area
   reduction or equivalently 0.70 axial true strain. Formation of the < 2 1
   0 >(beta)-fiber from the combined activity of \{1 1 2\} and \{3 3 2\}
   twinning plus conventional slip is observed and may not directly depend
   upon the stress-induced phase per se. According to the VPSC model,
   similar texture should occur in other metastable beta-Ti alloys
   subjected to similar wire processing. These data should help inform
   process-structure-function towards better wire design in titanium-based
   medical devices. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Predicting low velocity impact damage and Compression-After-Impact (CAI)
   behaviour of composite laminates}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES PART A-APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{212-226}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Low-velocity impact damage can drastically reduce the residual strength
   of a composite structure even when the damage is barely visible. The
   ability to computationally predict the extent of damage and
   compression-after-impact (CAI) strength of a composite structure can
   potentially lead to the exploration of a larger design space without
   incurring significant time and cost penalties. A high-fidelity
   three-dimensional composite damage model, to predict both low-velocity
   impact damage and CAI strength of composite laminates, has been
   developed and implemented as a user material subroutine in the
   commercial finite element package, ABAQUS/Explicit. The intralaminar
   damage model component accounts for physically-based tensile and
   compressive failure mechanisms, of the fibres and matrix, when subjected
   to a three-dimensional stress state. Cohesive behaviour was employed to
   model the interlaminar failure between plies with a bi-linear
   traction-separation law for capturing damage onset and subsequent damage
   evolution. The virtual tests, set up in ABAQUS/Explicit, were executed
   in three steps, one to capture the impact damage, the second to
   stabilize the specimen by imposing new boundary conditions required for
   compression testing, and the third to predict the CAI strength. The
   observed intralaminar damage features, delamination damage area as well
   as residual strength are discussed. It is shown that the predicted
   results for impact damage and CAI strength correlated well with
   experimental testing without the need of model calibration which is
   often required with other damage models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Mesoproterozoic-Neoproterozoic sedimentary succession of the eastern
   part of the Siberian Craton consists of several unconformity-bounded,
   kilometer-scale siliciclastic-carbonate cycles. The overlying Lower
   Cambrian rocks are often compositionally similar to the uppermost units
   of the Neoproterozoic succession.
   Twenty-nine samples were collected for U-Pb detrital zircon study and 27
   samples were analyzed for whole-rock Sm-Nd isotopes. In total, 1491
   detrital zircon grains were dated and 1148 grains were selected for
   provenance interpretation. Samples from the Uchur and Aimchan groups
   only contain detrital zircons of Paleoproterozoic and Archean age.
   Samples from the Kerpyl Group located on the Siberian Craton contain
   Paleoproterozoic and Archean grains as well, but samples from the Kerpyl
   Group in the Sette-Daban Ridge have significant numbers of
   Mesoproterozoic detrital zircons. Mesoproterozoic detrital zircons
   predominate in samples from the Uy Group. In the northern part of the
   study area, samples from the uppermost Neoproterozoic and Lower Cambrian
   strata contain numerous ca. 790-590 Ma detrital zircons, whereas in the
   southern part of the study area only Paleoproterozoic and Archean grains
   have been found. The whole-rock Sm-Nd isotopic values of clastic rocks
   show that most samples have isotopic signatures typical for the Siberian
   Craton basement, whereas some samples from the Kerpyl Group and younger
   rock units have isotopic signatures typical of the Grenville Orogen.
   Most of the Archean and Paleoproterozoic detrital zircons were eroded
   from the basement of the Siberian Craton, although some ca. 2080-2030 Ma
   detrital zircons are likely to have a non-Siberian provenance. However,
   rocks younger than ca. 1700 Ma are not known in the Siberian Craton
   basement and all Mesoproterozoic and younger grains must therefore have
   a non-Siberian provenance.
   The detrital zircon age distributions and whole-rock Nd isotopic
   signatures of many samples from the Kerpyl Group and younger units are
   very close to those of the Grenville Orogen in North America, suggesting
   that erosion of the latter contributed to clastic deposition along the
   Siberian margin. Three paleocontinental restorations proposed by Sears
   and Price (1978, 2003), Rainbird et al. (1998) and Pisarevsky and
   Natapov (2003) are invoked to explain the occurrence of Grenville-age
   detrital zircons in the Siberian sedimentary succession. The provenance
   of ca. 790-590 Ma detrital zircons is most likely to be located within
   the Central Taimyr accretionary belt formed along the northern margin of
   the Siberian Craton in the Neoproterozoic. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Forensic issues in the analysis of trace nitrofuran veterinary residues

Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{92-103}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Over the past twelve years hundreds of official analyses for nitrofuran
   antibiotic residues in farmed shrimp and prawns have led to product
   recalls, border rejections, and de-listed suppliers. Positive-release
   testing regimes have been instigated at huge economic cost. There have
   been repeated occasions when new scientific information or policy
   clarification has led to enforcement decisions being seen in a new light
   and current practice continues to evolve. There remain discrepancies
   between results found pre-harvest and pre-export in some countries, and
   results from Border Inspection Posts' analyses when consignments arrive
   at their destination, despite international harmonisation of test
   methods and quality criteria. Forensic issues around enforcement
   decisions following laboratory results for noncompliant consignments
   containing nitrofurans are summarised herein, including those that have
   been referred for technical appeal to the UK Government Chemist. Current
   best practice is collated and specific recommendations and suggestions
   made for the decision-making process in food safety enforcement. We
   recommend an approach to semicarbazide analysis from core flesh, removal
   of ice glaze prior to analysis and that measurement uncertainty is
   subtracted from the mean result to yield a `not less than' figure used
   for reporting purposes `beyond reasonable doubt'. Research is needed to
   fill knowledge gaps with regard to sample homogeneity and sampling
   protocols for nitrofurans in food of animal origin. Sampling should be
   standardised, as has been established for mycotoxin controls and a
   modern toxicology risk assessment of nitrofurans and their metabolites
   in food appears to be warranted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Multiblock-structured meshes have significant advantages over fully
   unstructured meshes in numerical simulation, but automatically
   generating these meshes is considerably more difficult. A method is
   described herein for automatically generating high-quality multiblock
   decompositions of surfaces with boundaries. Controllability and
   flexibility are useful capabilities of the method. Additional alignment
   constraints for forcing the appearance of particular features in the
   decomposition can be easily handled. Also, adjustments are made
   according to input metric tensor fields that describe target element
   size properties. The general solution strategy is based around using a
   four-way symmetry vector-field, called a cross-field, to describe the
   local mesh orientation on a triangulation of the surface. Initialisation
   is performed by propagating the boundary alignment constraints to the
   interior in a fast marching method. This is similar in a way to an
   advancing-front or paving method but much more straightforward and
   flexible because mesh connectivity does not have to be managed in the
   cross-field. Multiblock decompositions are generated by tracing the
   separatrices of the cross-field to partition the surface into
   quadrilateral blocks with square corners. The final task of meshing the
   decomposition requires solving an integer programming problem for block
   division numbers. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   Proteins}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{Repeat proteins have become increasingly important due to their
   capability to bind to almost any proteins and the potential as
   alternative therapy to monoclonal antibodies. In the past decade repeat
   proteins have been designed to mediate specific protein-protein
   interactions. The tetratricopeptide and ankyrin repeat proteins are two
   classes of helical repeat proteins that form different binding pockets
   to accommodate various partners. It is important to understand the
   factors that define folding and stability of repeat proteins in order to
   prioritize the most stable designed repeat proteins to further explore
   their potential binding affinities. Here we developed distance-dependant
   statistical potentials using two classes of alpha-helical repeat
   proteins, tetratricopeptide and ankyrin repeat proteins respectively,
   and evaluated their efficiency in predicting the stability of repeat
   proteins. We demonstrated that the repeat-specific statistical
   potentials based on these two classes of repeat proteins showed
   paramount accuracy compared with non-specific statistical potentials in:
   1) discriminate correct vs. incorrect models 2) rank the stability of
   designed repeat proteins. In particular, the statistical scores
   correlate closely with the equilibrium unfolding free energies of repeat
   proteins and therefore would serve as a novel tool in quickly
   prioritizing the designed repeat proteins with high stability.
   StaRProtein web server was developed for predicting the stability of
   repeat proteins.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{285}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to examine (I) the distribution of U
   and Th in dolomitic gravel fill and shale saprolite, and (2) the removal
   of uranium from acidic groundwater by dolomitic gravel through
   precipitation with amorphous basaluminite at the U.S. DOE Oak Ridge
   Integrated Field Research Challenge (ORIFRC) field site west of the Oak
   Ridge Y-12 National Security Complex in East Tennessee. Media reactivity
   and sustainability are a technical concern with the deployment of any
   subsurface reactive media. Because the gravel was placed in the
   subsurface and exposed to contaminated groundwater for over 20 years, it
   provided a unique opportunity to study the solid and water phase
   geochemical conditions within the media after this length of exposure.
   This study illustrates that dolomite gravel can remove U from acidic
   contaminated groundwater with high levels of Al3+, Ca2+, NO3-, and SO42-
   over the long term. As the groundwater flows through high pH carbonate
   gravel, U containing amorphous basaluminite precipitates as the pH
   increases. This is due to an increase in groundwater pH from 3.2 to
   similar to 6.5 as it comes in contact with the gravel. Therefore,
   carbonate gravel could be considered as a possible treatment medium for
   removal and sequestration of U and other pH sensitive metals from acidic
   contaminated groundwater. Thorium concentrations are also high in the
   carbonate gravel. Thorium generally shows an inverse relationship with U
   from the surface down into the deeper saprolite. Barite precipitated in
   the shallow saprolite directly below the dolomitic gravel from barium
   present in the acidic contaminated groundwater. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The local-field (LF) problem of a finite-size dipole emitter radiating
   inside a lossy inhomogeneous structure is a long-standing and
   challenging quantum optical problem, and it now is becoming more
   important due to rapid advances in solid-state fabrication technologies.
   Here we introduce a simple and accurate quasi-normal mode (QNM)
   technique to solve this problem analytically by separating the
   scattering problem into contributions from the QNM and an image dipole.
   Using a real-cavity model to describe an artificial atom inside a lossy
   and dispersive gold nanorod, we show when the contribution of the QNM to
   LFs will dominate over the homogeneous contribution. We also show how to
   accurately describe surface scattering for real cavities that are close
   to the metal interface and explore regimes when the surface scattering
   dominates. Our results offer an intuitive picture of the underlying
   physics for the LF problem and facilitate the understanding of novel
   photon sources within lossy structures. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{187}},
Pages = {{170-182}},
Month = {{MAR 17}},
Abstract = {{In the absence of water, a dry granular landslide mass released on an
   incline will experience greater acceleration than an otherwise identical
   mass released on a plane of lower inclination. However, when water is
   introduced to the system, the outcome is more complicated. While it
   requires less water pressure to trigger a landslide on a steep slope,
   the additional saturated soil in a gentle slope can make it more
   susceptible to flow liquefaction, which in turn can make it the slope of
   greater risk in terms of the landslide velocity and distal reach.
   Results from seven geotechnical centrifuge tests were evaluated to
   compare the behavior of flow slides triggered in a loose granular soil
   layer inclined at 20 degrees and 30 degrees. The results indicate that
   the influence of slope inclination on mobility is highly dependent on
   antecedent groundwater conditions. In low antecedent groundwater
   scenarios, the mobility of the failures triggered in the 20 degrees and
   30 degrees were similar. However, in a high antecedent groundwater
   scenario, a flow slide triggered on the 20 degrees slope was observed to
   travel twice the distance, and reaching nearly twice the maximum
   velocity than a flow slide triggered on the steeper 30 degrees slope.
   These results provide experimental data documenting the complex
   interaction between slope inclination and antecedent groundwater
   conditions to control the triggering and distal reach of
   hydraulically-induced flow slides. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We evaluated the accuracy of the inertial dissipation method to estimate
   the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy within boundary
   layers by performing well-resolved numerical simulations of turbulent
   channel flows and comparing the dissipation calculated directly from the
   data, with that deduced from the frequency spectra. The convection
   velocity, commonly used to convert frequency spectra into wave number
   spectra is found to be larger than the local mean velocity by
   approximately a factor of 2 near the bed and about 10\% in the
   logarithmic layer and beyond. Usage of the standard Kolmogorov constants
   (particularly in the vertical and spanwise directions) also leads to
   significant errors (50\% or more) in computation of dissipation. Usage
   of the optimal Kolmogorov constants and the convection velocity,
   obtained from the simulation results could result in improved accuracy
   in dissipation calculation with the inertial method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates a flexible fault ride through strategy for power
   systems in China with high wind power penetration. The strategy
   comprises of adaptive fault ride through requirements and maximum power
   restrictions of the wind farms with weak fault ride through
   capabilities. The slight faults arid moderate faults with high
   probability are the main defending objective of the strategy. The
   adaptive fault ride through requirement in the strategy consists of two
   sub fault ride through requirements, a temporary slight voltage ride
   through requirement corresponding to a slight fault incident, with a
   moderate voltage ride through requirement corresponding to a moderate
   fault. The temporary overloading capability of the wind farm is
   reflected in both requirements to enhance the capability to defend
   slight faults and to avoid tripping when the crowbar is disconnected
   after moderate faults are cleared. For those wind farms that cannot meet
   the adaptive fault ride through requirement, restrictions are put on the
   maximum power output. Simulation results show that the flexible fault
   ride through strategy increases the fault ride through capability of the
   wind farm clusters and reduces the wind power curtailment during faults.

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces improved design-oriented confinement models for
   cylindrical concrete members wrapped with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP)
   composites based on a rigorous statistical evaluation of a large
   database. As most of the existing design-oriented models for ultimate
   condition of FRP-confined concrete were developed based on limited
   experimental data points, a large experimental database of 518
   cylindrical concrete specimens wrapped with unidirectional fabrics in
   the hoop direction with reported actual rupture strain of the wrap was
   compiled from the literature. The database is used to evaluate the
   performance of major existing strength and strain models. Then, using a
   general regression analysis, different forms of models are examined to
   obtain the best fit, and the performance of the models is compared to
   the existing models using the database. Based on two different
   statistical indices, the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the Root
   Mean Square Error (RMSE), the best performing strength and strain models
   are proposed for use in design applications. A parametric study is also
   performed on fiber type, cylinder diameter, concrete strength, and FRP
   wrap thickness, elastic modulus, and strength using the proposed models.

Abstract = {{With a new test facility, we have investigated fretting fatigue
   properties of Ti-1023 titanium alloy at different contact pressure. Both
   fatigue fracture and fretting scar were analyzed by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). Moreover, the depth of crack initiation area in
   fatigue fracture has been analyzed quantitatively, to investigate the
   relationship between the depth of crack initiation area and the fretting
   fatigue strength. The changing trends of the depth of crack initiation
   area and fretting fatigue strength with the increase of contact pressure
   show obvious opposite correlations. The depth of crack initiation area
   increases rapidly with the increase of contact pressure at low contact
   pressure (smaller than 10 MPa), and the fretting fatigue strength drops
   rapidly. At the contact pressure of 10-45 MPa, both the depth of crack
   initiation area and the fretting fatigue strength do not vary
   significantly. Contact pressure influences fatigue strength through
   influencing the initiation of fatigue crack. The main damage patterns
   are fatigue flake and plow. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Swimming alone? The role of social capital in enhancing local resilience
   to climate stress: a case study from Bangladesh}},
Journal = {{CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{110-123}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{There has been increasing examination of resilience as a concept
   applicable to climate adaptation. In this paper, resilience is used to
   explore the layers of responses to past and present climate stress. It
   examines the factors and circumstances that may hinder or enhance
   resilience, providing insights into past and present adaptation
   processes that may be relevant for adaptation to future climate change.
   Specifically, this paper tests the value of social capital in
   influencing resilience to climate stress. While there are many examples
   where social capital influences resilience to climate stress, this paper
   aims to determine the relative importance of different types of social
   capital for enhancing resilience, by exploring how relationships of
   exchange and reciprocity influence responses to climate stress. This
   study involved case studies of specific communities in the southwest
   coastal region of Bangladesh. This case study highlights a complex
   rather than a uniformly positive relationship between social capital and
   enhancing resilience to climate stress. Specifically, it identifies four
   types of social capital-based support (with monetary support as a
   subset) and the interlinkages among the types (and processes) of social
   capital with diverse effects on resilience. It emphasizes the moral and
   ethical importance of reconceptualizing resilience with an emphasis on
   the most vulnerable, as resilience approaches that fail to recognize the
   differentiated nature of resilience, risk reinforcing vulnerability.
   Westernized concepts have important benefits, but crucial limitations
   when applied to the particular conditions, value sets and modes of
   community working in the south. The uncritical importation of social
   capital needs to be treated with caution, especially in the context of
   climate adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{While the benefits of renewable energy are well known and used to
   influence government policy there are a number of problems which arise
   from having significant quantities of renewable energies on an
   electricity grid. The most notable problem stems from their intermittent
   nature which is often out of phase with the demands of the end users.
   This requires the development of either efficient energy storage
   systems, e.g. battery technology, compressed air storage etc. or through
   the creation of demand side management units which can utilise power
   quickly for manufacturing operations. Herein a system performing the
   conversion of synthetic biogas to synthesis gas using wind power and an
   induction heating system is shown. This approach demonstrates the
   feasibility of such techniques for stabilising the electricity grid
   while also providing a robust means of energy storage. This exemplar is
   also applicable to the production of hydrogen from the steam reforming
   of natural gas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A density functional theory study of methanol dehydrogenation over
   stepped Pt(211) surfaces without and with Ru modification was carried
   out to understand fuel catalytic reactions on Pt-based catalysts. Two
   main pathways of the CH3OH dehydrogenation were examined: the O-H
   pathway which was initiated by O-H bond scission to form the methoxy
   (CH3O) intermediate followed by sequential cleavage of C-H bonds to CO,
   and the C-H pathway which was initiated by C-H bond scission to form the
   hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) followed by two C-H bond cleavages to COH and then
   CO. Possible crossover reactions between the O-H and C-H pathways were
   also computed. Compared to flat Pt(111), stepped Pt(211) increases the
   adsorption energies of intermediates, making no significant contribution
   to decreasing the reaction barriers of most elementary steps involved,
   except in the first hydrogen scission. However, on the Ru-modified
   surface, a significant reduction was found in reaction barriers for the
   first step of the C-H bond scission and a number of further
   dehydrogenation steps crossing over to the O-H pathway, with the most
   facile paths identified. Our data reveals the complexity of methanol
   catalytic reaction processes at the atomic level and contributes to a
   fundamental understanding of fuel reactions on Pt-based catalysts. (C)

Abstract = {{The effect of heavy-ion irradiation on deformation mechanisms of a
   Zr-2.5Nb alloy was investigated by using the in situ transmission
   electron microscopy deformation technique. The gliding behavior of
   prismatic < a > dislocations has been dynamically observed before and
   after irradiation at room temperature and 300 degrees C. Irradiation
   induced loops were shown to strongly pin the gliding dislocations.
   Unpinning occurred while loops were incorporated into or eliminated by <
   a > dislocations. In the irradiated sample, loop depleted areas with a
   boundary parallel to the basal plane trace were found by post-mortem
   observation after room temperature deformation, supporting the
   possibility of basal channel formation in bulk neutron irradiated
   samples. Strong activity of pyramidal slip was also observed at both
   temperatures, which might be another important mechanism to induce
   plastic instability in irradiated zirconium alloys. Finally, \{01 (1)
   over bar1\}< 0 (1) over bar 12 > twinning was identified in the
   irradiated sample deformed at 300 degrees C. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Unlike other BCC metals, the plastic deformation of nanocrystalline
   Tantalum (Ta) during compression is regulated by deformation twinning.
   Whether or not this twinning exhibits anisotropy was investigated
   through simulation of displacement-controlled nanoindentation test using
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. MD data was found to correlate well
   with the experimental data in terms of surface topography and hardness
   measurements. The mechanism of the transport of material was identified
   due to the formation and motion of prismatic dislocations loops (edge
   dislocations) belonging to the 1/2 < 111 > type and < 100 > type Burgers
   vector family. Further analysis of crystal defects using a fully
   automated dislocation extraction algorithm (DXA) illuminated formation
   and migration of twin boundaries on the (110) and (111) orientation but
   not on the (010) orientation and most importantly after retraction all
   the dislocations disappeared on the (110) orientation suggesting
   twinning to dominate dislocation nucleation in driving plasticity in
   tantalum. A significant finding was that the maximum shear stress
   (critical Tresca stress) in the deformation zone exceeded the
   theoretical shear strength of Ta (Shear modulus/2 pi similar to 10.03
   GPa) on the (010) orientation but was lower than it on the (110) and the
   (111) orientations. In light of this, the conventional lore of assuming
   the maximum shear stress being 0.465 times the mean contact pressure was
   found to break down at atomic scale. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{ON THE GLOBAL MASS DISTRIBUTION IN DISK GALAXIES}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{801}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{We present a summary of recent assessments of the mass distribution in
   disk galaxies. In order to characterize galaxy formation models the
   relative fraction of baryons and dark matter at all radii in galaxies
   must be determined. For disk galaxies, various measurements of the mass
   distribution in galaxies based on vertical kinematics, strong lensing,
   residuals of scaling relations, fluid dynamical modeling, bar strength
   and pattern speed, warps, and others have called for either a maximal or
   sub-maximal contribution of the baryons in the inner parts of the disk.
   We propose a global picture whereby all galaxies are typically
   baryon-dominated (maximal) at the center and dark-matter dominated
   (sub-maximal) in their outskirts. Using as a fiducial radius the peak of
   the rotation curve of a pure baryonic exponential disk at R-2.2 = 2.2
   R-d, where Rd is the disk scale length, the transition from maximal to
   sub-maximal baryons occurs within or near R-2.2 for low-mass disk
   galaxies (with V-tot less than or similar to 200 km s(-1)) and beyond
   R-2.2 for more massive systems. The mass fraction's inverse dependence
   on circular velocity in disk galaxies is largely insensitive to the
   presence of a bar at R-2.2. The mean mass fractions of late-and
   early-type galaxies are shown to be different at the same fiducial
   radius and circular velocity, pointing to different galaxy formation
   mechanisms. Feedback, dynamical friction, size, and IMF variations are
   key ingredients for understanding these differences.}},

Abstract = {{Redispersible polystyrene (PS) latexes were prepared through

   initiator 2,2'-azobis{[}2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane]dihydrochloride
   (VA-044) as positively charged stabilizing moieties. The polymer
   particles can be dried into powder by air-drying and be readily
   redispersed by adding water with similar to 90 s of sonication to yield
   latexes with similar particle size and zeta potential as the original
   latexes. The resulting polymer particles, ranging in diameter from
   similar to 180 to 400 nm, are spherical with narrow size polydispersity
   (PDI <= 0.05) as confirmed by TEM, SEM and DLS. This is the simplest
   method reported to date to prepare PS latexes which can be dried and
   then be redispersed, using only low amounts of stabilizer and requiring
   low energy input for redispersion. This facile redispersion process
   could enable energy reduction and cost savings in the transportation of

Abstract = {{The departure point for the paper is the need to scrutinize previously
   unconsidered dimensions which are fundamental to understanding the
   dynamics of the planning enforcement system. Drawing upon emerging
   themes in regulation theory the paper fuses these with knowledge
   constructs. The rationale is that the regulatory regimes must be
   informed by knowledge imparted from a range of sources and the resultant
   quality of decision making in pursuit of remedies is inextricably linked
   to the robustness of the evidence base collated. The theoretical
   analysis, coupled with radical legislative changes, provides a lens for
   an empirical investigation which scrutinizes tactics, strategies,
   operational mechanisms, attitudinal dimensions and ethics with a view to
   identifying the key factors impacting upon enforcement efficacy. Prizes
   and pitfalls are identified in the course of the analysis and
   evaluation, with evidence-based remedies suggested where appropriate.
   The paper concludes by reflecting on the importance of theoretical
   synergy and epistemological advancement, taking cognisance of ethical
   and attitudinal challenges facing the planning profession; and, brings
   to book those who flagrantly breach the Code of Professional Conduct.}},

Abstract = {{Landfills are the primary option for waste disposal all over the world.
   Most of the landfill sites across the world are old and are not
   engineered to prevent contamination of the underlying soil and
   groundwater by the toxic leachate. The pollutants from landfill leachate
   have accumulative and detrimental effect on the ecology and food chains
   leading to carcinogenic effects, acute toxicity, and genotoxicity among
   human beings. Management of this highly toxic leachate presents a
   challenging problem to the regulatory authorities who have set specific
   regulations regarding maximum limits of contaminants in treated leachate
   prior to disposal into the environment to ensure minimal environmental
   impact. There are different stages of leachate management such as
   monitoring of its formation and flow into the environment,
   identification of hazards associated with it, and its treatment prior to
   disposal into the environment. This article focuses on: (i) leachate
   composition, (ii) plume migration, (iii) contaminant fate, (iv) leachate
   plume monitoring techniques, (v) risk assessment techniques,
   hazard-rating methods, mathematical modeling, and (vi) recent
   innovations in leachate treatment technologies. However, due to seasonal
   fluctuations in leachate composition, flow rate, and leachate volume,
   the management approaches cannot be stereotyped. Every scenario is
   unique and the strategy will vary accordingly. This article lays out the
   choices for making an educated guess leading to the best management
   option.}},

Title = {{Numerical Determination of Equivalent Reflected Blast Parameters Acting
   on Circular Cross Sections}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROTECTIVE STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{A number of experimenters observed that the blast shockwave loads
   experienced by circular cross sections were lower than the predicted
   loads. These observations revealed a gap in the understanding of the
   interaction between blasts and structures. The question of quantifying
   these reduced loads for purposes of analysis and design presented itself
   for investigation. This paper presents the numerical investigation of
   the blast reflection reduction due to diffraction around a circular
   cross section using the commercial software ANSYS Autodyn. The
   investigation focused on the effects of the cross section's diameter and
   the explosion's scaled distance on the reflected blast pressure and
   impulse. Nine numerical gauge points recorded pressure-time and
   impulse-time histories at regular radial intervals around the front
   quarter of the circular section. The model's results agreed with
   incident and reflected pressure and impulse design values. The results
   indicated that as the diameter of the section increased the peak
   reflected pressure and impulse at the point of incidence rapidly
   approached the design values. The results also indicated that both the
   pressure and the impulse varied sinusoidally between a maximum at the
   point of incidence and a minimum, approximately equal to the incident
   pressure and impulse, at the side of the section. Using a sinusoidal
   curve fit to obtain equivalent reflected pressure and impulse values
   showed that the actual pressure and impulse acting on a circular cross
   section were approximately half the recommended design values. The
   results supported the obvious advantages of designing circular members
   to resist blast loading. Simplified equations are proposed for
   calculating the equivalent pressure and impulse acting on circular
   sections from the standard design values.}},

Abstract = {{We present TPR0F, an energy profiling tool for OpenMP-like task-parallel
   programs. To compute the energy consumed by each task in a parallel
   application, TPRoF dynamically traces the parallel execution and uses a
   novel technique to estimate the per-task energy consumption. To achieve
   this estimation, TPRoF apportions the total processor energy among cores
   and overcomes the limitation of current works which would otherwise make
   parallel accounting impossible to achieve. We demonstrate the value of
   TPRoF by characterizing a set of task parallel programs, where we find
   that data locality, memory access patterns and task working sets are
   responsible for significant variance in energy consumption between
   seemingly homogeneous tasks. In addition, we identify opportunities for
   fine-grain energy optimization by applying per-task Dynamic Voltage and
   Frequency Scaling (DVFS). (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{New Ediacaran fossil finds at Sekwi Brook occur in lower shoreface to
   offshore transition beds at the top of the Blueflower Formation, which
   are the most shallow-water facies and the youngest strata in which
   Ediacara-type fossils have been described from the Mackenzie Mountains
   of NW Canada. Newly discovered Ediacaran body fossils include two new
   tubular genera: Sekwitubulus annulatus new genus new species was a
   mm-diameter rigid annulated tube that was rooted to the sea bottom by a
   holdfast; Annulatubus flexuosus n. gen. n. sp. was a cm-diameter,
   flexible annulated tube. In conjunction with previously described large
   attachment discs representing the form-genus Aspidella and a single
   specimen of the dickinsonid Windermeria, these fossils define an
   assemblage that differs markedly from the rangeomorph-dominated
   deeper-water and older assemblages lower in the same section at Sekwi
   Brook. In contrast, trace fossils show little change upwards through the
   Blueflower Formation, at least in part reflecting their origin by
   microbial grazers on mats that formed during low-energy periods in both
   deep-and shallow-water environments. This implies that the stratigraphic
   succession of Ediacaran fossils in NW Canada and probably globally
   represents both evolutionary changes with age and the paleoecology of
   specific depositional settings.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the stress-corrosion cracking (SCC) behaviour of
   laser-welded NiTi wires before and after post-weld heat-treatment (PWHT)
   was investigated. The samples were subjected to slow strain rate testing
   (SSRT) under tensile loading in Hanks' solution at 37.5 degrees C (or
   310.5 K) at a constant anodic potential (200 mV(SCE)). The current
   density of the samples during the SSRT was captured by a potentiostat,
   and used as an indicator to determine the susceptibility to SCC.
   Fractography was analyzed using scanning-electron microscopy (SEM). The
   experimental results showed that the laser-welded sample after PWHT was
   immune to the SCC as evidenced by the stable current density throughout
   the SSRT. This is attributed to the precipitation of fine and coherent
   nano-sized Ni4Ti3 precipitates in the welded regions (weld zone, WZ and
   heat-affected zone, HAZ) after PWHT, resulting in (i) enrichment of TiO2
   content in the passive film and (ii) higher resistance against the local

Title = {{Fourier decomposition of polymer orientation in large-amplitude
   oscillatory shear flow}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In our previous work, we explored the dynamics of a dilute suspension of
   rigid dumbbells as a model for polymeric liquids in large-amplitude
   oscillatory shear flow, a flow experiment that has gained a significant
   following in recent years. We chose rigid dumbbells since these are the
   simplest molecular model to give higher harmonics in the components of
   the stress response. We derived the expression for the dumbbell
   orientation distribution, and then we used this function to calculate
   the shear stress response, and normal stress difference responses in
   large-amplitude oscillatory shear flow. In this paper, we deepen our
   understanding of the polymer motion underlying large-amplitude
   oscillatory shear flow by decomposing the orientation distribution
   function into its first five Fourier components (the zeroth, first,
   second, third, and fourth harmonics). We use three-dimensional images to
   explore each harmonic of the polymer motion. Our analysis includes the
   three most important cases: (i) nonlinear steady shear flow (where the
   Deborah number lambda omega is zero and the Weissenberg number
   lambda(gamma) over dot(0) is above unity), (ii) nonlinear
   viscoelasticity (where both lambda omega and lambda(gamma) over dot(0)
   exceed unity), and (iii) linear viscoelasticity (where lambda omega
   exceeds unity and where lambda(gamma) over dot(0) approaches zero). We
   learn that the polymer orientation distribution is spherical in the
   linear viscoelastic regime, and otherwise tilted and peanut-shaped. We
   find that the peanut-shaping is mainly caused by the zeroth harmonic,
   and the tilting, by the second. The first, third, and fourth harmonics
   of the orientation distribution make only slight contributions to the
   overall polymer motion. (C) 2015 Author(s).}},

   continue to live at home, given the risks of self-harm and getting lost.
   More imaginative and inclusive forms of collective housing are needed.
   For people with dementia, a move to a new environment is often a
   stressful experience that causes shock, withdrawal, and anger. Hence,
   more research is needed to develop more fitting long-term housing
   options for people with dementia. This article presents a brief review
   on housing choices and housing design for people with dementia.
   Interviews with managers of 22 care homes were conducted to explore
   housing choices and design issues. Results show that the main housing
   choices available to people with dementia offer different levels of
   care. The choice of care homes relates to the atmosphere of a home as
   some occupants favor a homely or relaxing environment and others prefer
   dynamic settings. A combination of appropriate level of care, a good
   atmosphere, and design quality within the care home are elements that
   lead to a more enabling environment. Design of a successful caring
   environment also requires appropriate care and a positive therapeutic
   and domestic-looking environment.}},

Abstract = {{Small-scale, decentralized and community-owned renewable energy is
   widely acknowledged to be a desirable feature of low carbon futures, but
   faces a range of challenges in the context of conventional, centralized
   energy systems. This paper draws on transition frameworks to investigate
   why the UK has been an inhospitable context for community-owned
   renewables and assesses whether anything fundamental is changing in this
   regard. We give particular attention to whether political devolution,
   the creation of elected governments for Scotland, Wales and Northern
   Ireland, has affected the trajectory of community renewables. Our
   analysis notes that devolution has increased political attention to
   community renewables, including new policy targets and support schemes.
   However, these initiatives are arguably less important than the
   persistence of key features of socio-technical regimes: market support
   systems for renewable energy and land-use planning arrangements that
   systemically favour major projects and large corporations, and keep
   community renewables to the margins. There is scope for rolling out
   hybrid pathways to community renewables, via joint ownership or through
   community benefit funds, but this still positions community energy as an
   adjunct to energy pathways dominated by large, corporate generation
   facilities. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP

   CLUSTER NGC 188}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{149}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper provides a detailed comparison of the differences in
   parameters derived for a star cluster from its color-magnitude diagrams
   (CMDs) depending on the filters and models used. We examine the
   consistency and reliability of fitting three widely used stellar
   evolution models to 15 combinations of optical and near-IR photometry
   for the old open cluster NGC 188. The optical filter response curves
   match those of theoretical systems and are thus not the source of fit
   inconsistencies. NGC 188 is ideally suited to this study thanks to a
   wide variety of high-quality photometry and available proper motions and
   radial velocities that enable us to remove non-cluster members and many
   binaries. Our Bayesian fitting technique yields inferred values of age,
   metallicity, distance modulus, and absorption as a function of the
   photometric band combinations and stellar models. We show that the
   historically favored three-band combinations of UBV and VRI can be
   meaningfully inconsistent with each other and with longer baseline data
   sets such as UBVRIJHK(S). Differences among model sets can also be
   substantial. For instance, fitting Yi et al. (2001) and Dotter et al.
   (2008) models to UBVRIJHKS photometry for NGC 188 yields the following
   cluster parameters: age=\{5.78 +/- 0.03, 6.45 +/- 0.04\} Gyr, {[}Fe/H] =
   \{+0.125 +/- 0.003, -0.077 +/- 0.003\} dex, (m-M)(V) =\{11.441 +/-
   0.007, 11.525 +/- 0.005\} mag, and A(V) =\{0.162 +/- 0.003, 0.236 +/-
   0.003\} mag, respectively. Within the formal fitting errors, these two
   fits are substantially and statistically different. Such differences
   among fits using different filters and models are a cautionary tale
   regarding our current ability to fit star cluster CMDs. Additional
   modeling of this kind, with more models and star clusters, and future
   Gaia parallaxes are critical for isolating and quantifying the most
   relevant uncertainties in stellar evolutionary models.}},

Abstract = {{The design cycle for complex special-purpose computing systems is
   extremely costly and time-consuming. It involves a multiparametric
   design space exploration for optimization, followed by design
   verification. Designers of special purpose VLSI implementations often
   need to explore parameters, such as optimal bitwidth and data
   representation, through time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. A
   prominent example of this simulation-based exploration process is the
   design of decoders for error correcting systems, such as the Low-Density
   Parity-Check (LDPC) codes adopted by modern communication standards,
   which involves thousands of Monte Carlo runs for each design point.
   Currently, high-performance computing offers a wide set of acceleration
   options that range from multicore CPUs to Graphics Processing Units
   (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The exploitation of
   diverse target architectures is typically associated with developing
   multiple code versions, often using distinct programming paradigms. In
   this context, we evaluate the concept of retargeting a single OpenCL
   program to multiple platforms, thereby significantly reducing design
   time. A single OpenCL-based parallel kernel is used without
   modifications or code tuning on multicore CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. We use
   SOpenCL (Silicon to OpenCL), a tool that automatically converts OpenCL
   kernels to RTL in order to introduce FPGAs as a potential platform to
   efficiently execute simulations coded in OpenCL. We use LDPC decoding
   simulations as a case study. Experimental results were obtained by
   testing a variety of regular and irregular LDPC codes that range from
   short/medium (e.g., 8,000 bit) to long length (e.g., 64,800 bit) DVB-S2
   codes. We observe that, depending on the design parameters to be
   simulated, on the dimension and phase of the design, the GPU or FPGA may
   suit different purposes more conveniently, thus providing different
   acceleration factors over conventional multicore CPUs.}},

Abstract = {{A forward and backward least angle regression (LAR) algorithm is
   proposed to construct the nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous

   sparsity and generalization performance of the original forward LAR
   algorithm. This is achieved by introducing a replacement scheme using an
   additional backward LAR stage. The backward stage replaces insignificant
   model terms selected by forward LAR with more significant ones, leading
   to an improved model in terms of the model compactness and performance.
   A numerical example to construct four types of NARX models, namely
   polynomials, radial basis function (RBF) networks, neuro fuzzy and

Journal = {{EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{18-37}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The Late Triassic was a pivotal period in reef evolution, but the
   majority of information about reef ecology during this time comes from
   buildups in the Alps (e.g., the Tethys Ocean). Recent studies of reefs
   in western North America have recognized unique ecologies along the
   eastern margin of the Panthalassa Ocean. Although there are numerous
   (twenty-five) localities with putative reef builders, only four buildups
   had syndepositional relief and a rigid framework (i.e. true reefs). The
   most paleo-northern true reefs were microbial patch reefs with only a
   few large skeletal bioconstructors; hypercalcified sponges and
   spongiomorphs built the mid-latitude reefs, with secondary microbial
   encrustation and branching, phaceloid Retiophyllia corals. Corals are
   the primary bioconstructors in Panthalassa's most paleo-equatorial reefs
   and calcareous microbes are sparse. When all reefal deposits are
   analyzed, the N-S gradient is also present, with microbial and bivalve
   deposits in the north, sponge-coral deposits in the mid latitudes, and
   coral deposits near the equator. This ecological gradient is not
   apparent in the Tethys Ocean. Tethyan reefs thrived in oligotrophic,
   tropical waters without strong latitudinal gradients; by contrast,
   paleoceanographic considerations suggest that cool, nutrient-rich waters
   swept south along the western North American borderlands in the Late
   Triassic The eastern boundary current is interpreted to have created a
   strong north-south differentiation of environments in northeastern (NE)
   Panthalassa that was manifested in both the biotic and abiotic
   characteristics of eastern Panthalassic reefs. Reefs from equatorial
   Panthalassa are similar to Tethyan reefs (warm-water, photozoan, coral
   reef structures), whereas higher paleo-latitude reefs from Panthalassa
   are interpreted as cool-water (heterozoan) buildups, with abundant
   calcareous microbes, diminutive biocalcifiers, and few large,
   framework-building corals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{DC line faults on high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems utilising
   voltage source converters (VSCs) are a major issue for multi-terminal
   HVDC systems in which complete isolation of the faulted system is not a
   viable option. Of these faults, single line-to-earth faults are the most
   common fault scenario. To better understand the system under such
   faults, this study analyses the behaviour of HVDC systems based on both
   conventional two-level converter and multilevel modular converter
   technology, experiencing a permanent line-to-earth fault. Operation of
   the proposed system under two different earthing configurations of
   converter side AC transformer earthed with converter unearthed, and both
   converter and AC transformer unearthed, was analysed and simulated, with
   particular attention paid to the converter operation. It was observed
   that the development of potential earth loops within the system as a
   result of DC line-to-earth faults leads to substantial overcurrent and
   results in oscillations depending on the earthing configuration.}},

   Thermoplastics}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL POLYMER PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{38-43}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Laser transmission welding involves joining of transmitting and
   absorbing thermoplastic polymer components. Absorption is normally
   controlled by addition of small amounts of carbon black (CB). In thermal
   modelling of the process, the laser-light absorption coefficient is an
   important parameter that controls the rate and distribution of heat
   generation in the absorbing component. This paper introduces a novel
   experimental method to conveniently and accurately measure the
   absorption coefficient in the absorbing component. In this method, a
   laser beam scans rapidly over the surface of the CB-filled polymer. The
   laser power resulting in the onset of surface melting can be obtained
   and used to calculate the absorption coefficient based on an analytical
   model presented in this paper. To validate the proposed method, the
   experimental results were compared with those obtained by the
   spectrophotometer and the power-meter methods using unreinforced and
   glass-fiber reinforced nylon 6. The results indicate that there is a
   linear relationship between the absorption coefficient and carbon black
   level for these two polymers. The influence of glass fibers and laser
   scan speed on the measurement are also discussed.}},

Title = {{Slip Heating in Die Drool with Viscous Dissipation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL POLYMER PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{141-146}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Plastics can build-up on the die lip during extrusion. This phenomenon
   is called die drool and can be costly for plastics producers, requiring
   periodic shutdowns for die cleaning. Die drool has been attributed to
   the cohesive fracture of the melt into a drool layer and a bulk layer.
   The bulk layer slips on the drool layer after fracture, resulting in
   heating at the slip interface, called slip heating. The heat generated
   through slip heating can contribute to polymer thermal degradation, and
   to the die drool degradation. The impact of slip heating on die
   temperature rise has been investigated by neglecting viscous dissipation
   (Gilbert and Giacomin, 2014). This work considers viscous dissipation
   and its importance to slip heating. We find that viscous dissipation and
   slip heating contribute equally to the melt temperature rise, and we
   conclude with a worked example showing the importance of these two
   heating sources during polymer processing. We also develop two
   sufficient conditions for the accurate use of our results, Pe << 1 and
   partial derivative Theta/partial derivative zeta << partial
   derivative(2)Theta/partial derivative zeta(2).}},

Volume = {{157}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{A nanocomposite porous electrode structure consisting of hierarchical
   iodine-doped zinc oxide (I-ZnO) aggregates combined with the two simple
   solution-processed interfacial modifications i.e. a ZnO compact layer
   (CL) and a TiO2 protective layer (PL) has been developed in order to
   understand electron transport and recombination in the photoanode
   matrix, together with boosting the conversion efficiency of I-ZnO based
   dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Electrochemical impedance spectra
   demonstrate that ZnO CL pre-treatment and TiO2 PL post-treatment
   synergistically reduce charge-transfer resistance and suppress electron
   recombination. Furthermore, the electron lifetime in two combined
   modifications of I-ZnO + CL + PL photoelectrode is the longest in
   comparison with the other three photoelectrodes. As a consequence, the
   overall conversion efficiency of I-ZnO + CL + PL DSC is significantly
   enhanced to 6.79\%, with a 36\% enhancement compared with unmodified
   I-ZnO DSC. Moreover, the stability of I-ZnO + CL + PL cell is improved
   as compared to I-ZnO one. The mechanism of electron transfer and
   recombination upon the introduction of ZnO CL and TiO2 PL is also
   proposed in this work. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of alternatives to rehabilitate culverts have been developed
   over the past decades given their advantages over conventional open-cut
   culvert replacement. However, the performance of many of these systems
   has not yet been examined through laboratory testing. The objective of
   the present paper is to examine the performance of deteriorated steel
   culverts rehabilitated with spray-on liners when subjected to surface
   loads. Two 1200 mm diameter corrugated steel pipelines with similar
   levels of deterioration in the invert-haunch area were buried to a depth
   of 1200 mm and tested under service load employing a load frame
   simulating a single axle of a Canadian design truck. The pipelines were
   then rehabilitated with spray on-cementitious liners (each with a
   different target thickness). Once rehabilitated, the pipelines were
   examined again under the service load employing the single axle load
   frame at 1200 mm of soil cover, and then tested employing a tandem axle
   load frame at 2100 and 1200 mm of soil cover. During all tests, changes
   in diameter, curvature and liner strains were monitored. The data
   obtained indicates that the flexible pipelines responded like semi-rigid
   structures after rehabilitation. It was also observed that the
   difference in liner thickness of 30\% did influence the response of the
   pipelines, and that extreme fiber tensions during service loading were
   7\% and 13\% of the tensile strength of the liner materials for the 76
   mm and 51 mm liner thicknesses that were specified. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Lead (Pb) is a non-threshold toxin capable of inducing toxic effects at

   domains accounted for elevated Pb concentrations compared to rural

Abstract = {{Credal nets are probabilistic graphical models which extend Bayesian
   nets to cope with sets of distributions. An algorithm for approximate
   credal network updating is presented. The problem in its general
   formulation is a multilinear optimization task, which can be linearized
   by an appropriate rule for fixing all the local models apart from those
   of a single variable. This simple idea can be iterated and quickly leads
   to accurate inferences. A transformation is also derived to reduce
   decision making in credal networks based on the maximality criterion to
   updating. The decision task is proved to have the same complexity of
   standard inference, being NPPP-complete for general credal nets and
   NP-complete for polytrees. Similar results are derived for the
   E-admissibility criterion. Numerical experiments confirm a good
   performance of the method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic (EM) tracking of instruments within a clinical setting
   is notorious for fluctuating measurement performance. Position location
   measurement uncertainty of an EM system was characterized in various
   environments, including control, clinical, cone beam computed tomography
   (CBCT), and CT scanner environments. Static and dynamic effects of CBCT
   and CT scanning on EM tracking were evaluated.
   Two guidance devices were designed to solely translate or rotate the
   sensor in a non-interfering fit to decouple pose-dependent tracking
   uncertainties. These devices were mounted on a base to allow consistent
   and repeatable tests when changing environments. Using this method,
   position and orientation measurement accuracies, precision, and 95 \%
   confidence intervals were assessed.
   The tracking performance varied significantly as a function of the
   environment-especially within the CBCT and CT scanners-and sensor pose.
   In fact, at a fixed sensor position in the clinical environment, the
   measurement error varied from 0.2 to 2.2 mm depending on sensor
   orientations. Improved accuracies were observed along the vertical axis
   of the field generator. Calibration of the measurements improved
   tracking performance in the CT environment by 50-85 \%.
   EM tracking can provide effective assistance to surgeons or
   interventional radiologists during procedures performed in a clinical or
   CBCT environment. Applications in the CT scanner demand precalibration
   to provide acceptable performance.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{When molten plastic is extruded from a die, it can collect on the open
   die face. Called die drool, this phenomenon costs plastics manufacturers
   by requiring shutdown for die cleaning. This has been attributed to
   cohesive failure within the fluid at an internal surface, where the
   fluid slips on itself; the corresponding isothermal analysis led to an
   analytical solution for the drool rate (Schmalzer and Giacomin, J.
   Polym. Eng. 2013, 33, 1). In this paper, we account for the frictional
   heating at the cohesive slip interface, which we call slip heating. We
   focus on slit flow, which is used in film casting, sheet extrusion,
   curtain coating, and in many other chemical engineering unit operations.
   In slit flow, the magnitude of the heat flux from the slipping interface
   is the product of the shear stress and the slip speed. We present the
   solution for the temperature rise in pressure-driven slit flow subject
   to constant heat generation at the cohesive slip interface. We solve the
   energy equation in Cartesian coordinates for the temperature rise, for
   both the transient and steady temperature profiles, in both the drool
   layer and the bulk polymer. We then evaluate the effect of this
   temperature rise on the rate of die drool. For this simplest relevant
   non-isothermal problem, we neglect viscous dissipation and convective
   heat transfer in the melt and we model viscosity as an Arrhenius
   function of temperature. We conclude with three worked examples showing
   the relevance of slip heating in determining die drool flow rates. We
   find that slip heating diminishes die drool. We arrive at two sufficient
   dimensionless conditions for the accurate use of our results: Br <<1 or
   Gi <<1.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{1. Predatory functional responses play integral roles in predator-prey
   dynamics, and their assessment promises greater understanding and
   prediction of the predatory impacts of invasive species. Other
   interspecific interactions, however, such as parasitism and higher-order
   predation, have the potential to modify predator-prey interactions and
   thus the predictive capability of the comparative functional response
   approach. We used a four-species community module (higher-order
   predator; focal native or invasive predators; parasites of focal
   predators; native prey) to compare the predatory functional responses of
   native Gammarus duebeni celticus and invasive Gammarus pulex amphipods
   towards three invertebrate prey species (Asellus aquaticus, Simulium
   spp., Baetis rhodani), thus, quantifying the context dependencies of
   parasitism and a higher-order fish predator on these functional
   responses. Our functional response experiments demonstrated that the
   invasive amphipod had a higher predatory impact (lower handling time) on
   two of three prey species, which reflects patterns of impact observed in
   the field. The community module also revealed that parasitism had
   context-dependent influences, for one prey species, with the potential
   to further reduce the predatory impact of the invasive amphipod or
   increase the predatory impact of the native amphipod in the presence of
   a higher-order fish predator. Partial consumption of prey was similar
   for both predators and occurred increasingly in the order A.aquaticus,
   Simulium spp. and B.rhodani. This was associated with increasing prey
   densities, but showed no context dependencies with parasitism or
   higher-order fish predator. This study supports the applicability of
   comparative functional responses as a tool to predict and assess
   invasive species impacts incorporating multiple context dependencies.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetite is a common mineral found in a wide range of mineral deposits
   and in different geological environments. The study of surface textures
   and morphology of magnetite can provide information that is useful to 1)
   discriminate different types of magnetite such as that attributed to
   magmatic, metamorphic and supergene environments, 2) identify host
   bedrocks, 3) sediment provenance, and 4) recognize chemical and
   mechanical processes affecting grains during erosion, transport, and
   after deposition in sedimentary environments. In this study, magnetite
   grains from the Izok Lake volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit (Nunavut,
   Canada) and from till covering the area have been investigated using
   scanning electron microscopy, mineral liberation analysis, and optical
   microscopy to document their mineral associations, surface textures,
   grain shape and size distribution. Evidences such as 1) contact
   relations between magnetite and sphalerite, 2) sphalerite and
   chalcopyrite inclusions in magnetite, and 3) intergrowths of magnetite
   with actinolite and gahnite suggest that in Izok Lake deposit and
   related gahnite-rich stringer zone, magnetite formed by replacement of
   sulfide minerals during regional, upper greenschist to amphibolite
   facies metamorphism. Magnetite from iron formation also formed as a
   result of oxidation-dissolution of almandine, or breakdown of Fe-bearing
   minerals during metamorphism. Euhedral, fine-grained magmatic magnetite
   in association with ilmenite, plagioclase and hornblende was identified
   in bedrock gabbro. Magnetite overgrowths on the surface of existing
   magnetite and other metamorphic minerals fingerprinted the supergene
   processes affecting bedrocks and sediments after metamorphism.
   Magnetite in till around the Izok Lake deposit is mostly imprinted by
   mechanical microtextures such as crescentic gouges, deep grooves,
   arc-shaped steps, and troughs that are diagnostic of transportation by
   thick continental ice sheets. A small proportion of magnetite grains
   characterized by V-shaped percussion cracks also indicate transportation
   by fluvial and/or glaciofluvial environments. Shape, grain-size
   distribution, and mineral association of magnetite in till suggest that
   in vicinity of the Izok Lake deposit, till has mainly been fed by the
   deposit and related alteration zones, though, a high proportion of
   grains have been derived from iron formations, bedrock gabbro, and
   Mackenzie dikes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The hydrodynamics and contaminant transport in the nearshore region of
   Lake Ontario, from Port Hope to Cobourg, were simulated. The model
   results were comprehensively validated against observations of water
   level, temperature, and currents collected during April-September, 2010.
   The model generally agrees well with the observations. A RMS error of
   similar to 2 degrees C was simulated and normalized Fourier norm
   (between 0.45 and 1.17), indicating that both the thermal stratification
   and currents are well-simulated, respectively, and are comparable to
   other model applications. Internal Kelvin waves were not observed and
   the internal Poincare wave oscillation was observed offshore, but not
   modeled. Rather, up-welling and down-welling events caused by
   southwesterly and northeasterly winds, respectively, were both modeled
   and observed to be the dominant large-scale hydrodynamic processes. The
   episodic events lasted for 4-5 days with the upwelling front extending
   similar to 10 km offshore. The up-welling and down-welling events
   generated geostrophic alongshore currents or coastal jets of similar to
   20 cm . s(-1). The influence of these dynamics on the transport of river
   and wastewater-treatment plant plumes, toward drinking water intakes,
   was investigated using tracer release simulations. Tracer concentrations
   in the range of 10-0\% (i.e., 70-90\% dilution) were found at the Port
   Hope and Cobourg drinking water intakes. The tracer concentrations were
   primarily influenced by the proximity of the intakes to the plume
   origins and the wind direction, which governs the direction of the
   alongshore currents resulting from the up-welling and downwelling
   events. These results will help municipalities better understand the
   transport of contaminants in the nearshore zone relative to drinking
   water intakes. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has become more widely used in the
   geotechnical community as its number of applications increases. It has
   been shown to be useful in tunneling for applications such as rockmass
   characterization and discontinuity measurement. LiDAR data can also be
   used to measure deformation in tunnels, but before a comprehensive
   methodology can be developed, the accuracy issues associated with
   scanning must be fully understood. Once the accuracy issues associated
   with LiDAR are well understood, any analysis technique that uses LiDAR
   data must be tested to ensure that the determined accuracy issues have
   minimal impact on the results of the analysis. To prove the usefulness
   of the newly developed elliptical fitting method for the measurement of
   convergence in tunnels and shafts proposed by Delaloye et al. (Eurock
   2012), a comprehensive analysis of accuracy issues associated with LiDAR
   scanning was conducted and then a sensitivity test of the convergence
   measurement technique was completed. The results of the analysis show
   that using the statistical techniques built into the elliptical fit
   analysis and LiDAR profile analysis, levels of real change
   (convergence), within the nominal level of random and systematic noise
   included in the data, can be measured with confidence. Furthermore, the
   new analysis is robust enough to handle large amounts of occlusion or
   missing perimeter coverage within data sets.}},

Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{8-25}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the distribution of Mel-filtered log-spectrum
   (MFLS) of speech signals in noisy environments. Without employing any
   prior assumption and using a non-parametric method, we estimate the
   Joint Probability Density Functions (JPDFs) of MFLS components of clean
   and noisy speech, and observe that noise components exhibit a normal
   distribution. Furthermore, clean and noisy speech exhibit a mixture of
   two normal distributions. The first lobe of this mixture fits to noise
   and corresponds to the intervals where speech is inactive; while the
   second one is formed by speech components. This lobe is almost equal
   (highly correlated) to the PDF of clean speech. Therefore, each MFLS
   component is accurately modeled by a normal PDF with time-varying
   parameters in a two-state Markov process. This shows where noise
   basically affects the distribution of clean speech, contrary to previous
   works. As an application example, we also present a novel noise-robust
   improvement to feature extraction for speech recognition by separating
   the non-speech and speech intervals for each MFLS component. The
   enhanced features are extracted from the minimum-mean-square-error
   (MMSE) estimates of MFLS coefficients. Our proposed method, when
   evaluated on Aurora 2 task for recognition purposes, not only
   outperforms both the MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient), as the
   baseline, and MFCC + CMVN (cepstral mean and variance normalization
   features), but also helps improve recognition performance when used in
   conjunction with ETSI-AFE, in different noisy conditions. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A technique for optimizing the efficiency of the sub-map method for
   large-scale simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is proposed. It
   optimizes the benefits of the sub-map technique to improve the accuracy
   and consistency of an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based SLAM. Error
   models were developed and engaged to investigate some of the outstanding
   issues in employing the sub-map technique in SLAM. Such issues include
   the size (distance) of an optimal sub-map, the acceptable error effect
   caused by the process noise covariance on the predictions and
   estimations made within a sub-map, when to terminate an existing sub-map
   and start a new one and the magnitude of the process noise covariance
   that could produce such an effect. Numerical results obtained from the
   study and an error-correcting process were engaged to optimize the
   accuracy and convergence of the Invariant Information Local Sub-map
   Filter previously proposed. Applying this technique to the EKF-based
   SLAM algorithm (a) reduces the computational burden of maintaining the
   global map estimates and (b) simplifies transformation complexities and
   data association ambiguities usually experienced in fusing sub-maps
   together. A Monte Carlo analysis of the system is presented as a means
   of demonstrating the consistency and efficacy of the proposed technique.}},

Title = {{Unsteady dynamics of rapid perching manoeuvres}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{767}},
Pages = {{323-341}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A perching bird is able to rapidly decelerate while maintaining lift and
   control, but the underlying aerodynamic mechanism is poorly understood.
   In this work we perform a study on a simultaneously decelerating and
   pitching aerofoil section to increase our understanding of the unsteady
   aerodynamics of perching. We first explore the problem analytically,
   developing expressions for the added-mass and circulatory forces arising
   from boundary-layer separation on a flat-plate aerofoil. Next, we study
   the model problem through a detailed series of experiments at Re = 22
   000 and two-dimensional simulations at Re = 2000. Simulated vorticity
   fields agree with particle image velocimetry measurements, showing the
   same wake features and vorticity magnitudes. Peak lift and drag forces
   during rapid perching are measured to be more than 10 times the
   quasi-steady values. The majority of these forces can be attributed to
   added-mass energy transfer between the fluid and aerofoil, and to energy
   lost to the fluid by flow separation at the leading and trailing edges.
   Thus, despite the large angles of attack and decreasing flow velocity,
   this simple pitch-up manoeuvre provides a means through which a perching
   bird can maintain high lift and drag simultaneously while slowing to a
   controlled stop.}},

Abstract = {{Solid phase extraction performed with commercial polymer beads to treat
   soil contaminated by chlorophenols (4-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol
   and pentachlorophenol) as single compounds and in a mixture has been
   investigated in this study. Soil-water-polymer partition tests were
   conducted to determine the relative affinities of single compounds in
   soil-water and polymer-water pairs. Subsequent soil extraction tests
   were performed with Hytrel 8206, the polymer showing the highest
   affinity for the tested chlorophenols. Factors that were examined were
   polymer type, moisture content, and contamination level. Increased
   moisture content (up to 100\%) improved the extraction efficiency for
   all three compounds. Extraction tests at this upper level of moisture
   content showed removal efficiencies >= 70\% for all the compounds and
   their ternary mixture, for 24 h of contact time, which is in contrast to
   the weeks and months, normally required for conventional ex situ
   remediation processes.
   A dynamic model characterizing the rate and extent of decontamination
   was also formulated, calibrated and validated with the experimental
   data. The proposed model, based on the simplified approach of ``lumped
   parameters{''} for the mass transfer coefficients, provided very good
   predictions of the experimental data for the absorptive removal of
   contaminants from soil at different individual solute levels. Parameters
   evaluated from calibration by fitting of single compound data, have been
   successfully applied to predict mixture data, with differences between
   experimental and predicted data in all cases being <= 3\%. (C) 2014

Title = {{A grid-independent length scale for large-eddy simulations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{766}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We propose a new length scale as a basis for the modelling of subfilter
   motions in large-eddy simulations (LES) of turbulent flow. Rather than
   associating the model length scale with the computational grid, we put
   forward an approximation of the integral length scale to achieve a
   non-uniform flow coarsening through spatial filtering that reflects the
   local, instantaneous turbulence activity. Through the introduction of
   this grid-independent, solution-specific length scale it becomes
   possible to separate the problem of representing small-scale turbulent
   motions in a coarsened flow model from that of achieving an accurate
   numerical resolution of the primary flow scales. The formulation
   supports the notion of grid-independent LES, in which a prespecified
   reliability measure is used. We investigate a length-scale definition
   based on the resolved turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and its
   dissipation. The proposed approach, which we call integral length-scale
   approximation (ILSA) model, is illustrated for turbulent channel flow at
   high Reynolds numbers and for homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT). We
   employ computational optimization of the model parameter based on
   various measures of subfilter activity, using the successive inverse
   polynomial interpolation (SIPI) and establish the efficiency of this
   route to subfilter modelling.}},

Title = {{Determining the relative stability of leading-edge vortices on nominally
   two-dimensional flapping profiles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{766}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{It is hypothesized that the relative stability of leading-edge vortices
   (LEVs) on flapping profiles can be improved by moderating LEV growth
   through spanwise vorticity convection and vortex stretching. Moreover,
   it is hypothesized that the reduced frequency k and profile sweep Lambda
   are critical in predicting relative LEV stability as determined by the
   aforementioned effects. These hypotheses are then confirmed
   experimentally with phase-averaged particle image velocimetry (PIV) and
   three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry. In particular, more
   stable LEVs are observed at higher reduced frequencies, which is argued
   to represent the ratio between the limiting vortex size and the rate of
   vorticity feeding. The introduction of profile sweep increased both
   relative LEV stability and spanwise vorticity transport. It is thought
   that spanwise vorticity transport improved LEV stability by acting as a
   sink for vorticity generated in the leading-edge shear layer.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) require a reliable navigation
   system that works in all environments. However, indoor navigation
   remains a challenge because the existing satellite-based navigation
   systems such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) are mostly
   unavailable indoors. In this paper, a tightly-coupled integrated
   navigation system that integrates two dimensional (2D) Light Detection
   and Ranging (LiDAR), Inertial Navigation System (INS), and odometry is
   introduced. An efficient LiDAR-based line features detection/tracking
   algorithm is proposed to estimate the relative changes in orientation
   and displacement of the vehicle. Furthermore, an error model of
   INS/odometry system is derived. LiDAR-estimated orientation/position
   changes are fused by an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with those
   predicted by INS/odometry using the developed error model. Errors
   estimated by EKF are used to correct the position and orientation of the
   vehicle and to compensate for sensor errors. The proposed system is
   verified through simulation and real experiment on an UGV equipped with
   LiDAR, MEMS-based IMU, and encoder. Both simulation and experimental
   results showed that sensor errors are accurately estimated and the
   drifts of INS are significantly reduced leading to navigation
   performance of sub-metre accuracy.}},

   Reversible doping and black spots}},
Journal = {{ORGANIC ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Polymer light-emitting electrochemical cells (PLECs) have been tested
   either continuously or intermittently for a long duration. In situ
   electrochemical doping of the polymer film causes fluorescence quenching
   and apparent luminance decay when the effect of quenching outweighs the
   effect on charge injection. The quenching-induced luminance loss,
   however, is partly recoverable when the cell is allowed to relax without
   an applied bias. The long test duration causes the appearance of large
   black spots in both photoluminescence and electroluminescence. Two very
   startling observations shed light on the nature of the black spots.
   First, black spot growth was completely suppressed when a cell was
   tested with a freshly deposited top aluminum electrode, even though the
   polymer film had been stored for up to nine months. Second, the black
   spots in photoluminescence gradually faded when the applied bias voltage
   was removed. The black spots in these PLECs were therefore sites of
   heavy doping that were promoted by changes that occurred at the
   cathode/polymer interface. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{In order to provide quantitative data to supplement visual inspections
   and numerical modelling as part of the overall bridge assessment
   process, inexpensive sensor technologies that provide useful and
   accurate data are required. Digital image correlation (DIC) is a
   measurement technique that can be used to provide displacement, crack
   width and strain data from the same set of digital images. This paper
   outlines a field application using DIC to measure static displacements
   at varying load levels and dynamic displacements at varying vehicle
   speeds of a reinforced concrete bridge. The DIC displacement
   measurements provided by two different camera systems are shown to be in
   good agreement with the results from a conventional displacement
   transducer for both the static and the dynamic tests. The results of the
   static tests with varying load levels are then used to illustrate how
   the bridge response can be evaluated by examining the load deflection
   behaviour, which remained in the linear elastic range throughout the
   loading. The dynamic displacement data were then compared to the static
   response to determine what, if any, difference in response there was to
   dynamic loading and thus if the use of impact factors should be
   considered when assessing this bridge.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{178-194}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The DEAP-1 7 kg single phase liquid argon scintillation detector was
   operated underground at SNOLAB in order to test the techniques and
   measure the backgrounds inherent to single phase detection, in support
   of the DEAP-3600 Dark Matter detector. Backgrounds in DEAP are
   controlled through material selection, construction techniques, pulse
   shape discrimination, and event reconstruction. This report details the
   analysis of background events observed in three iterations of the DEAP-1
   detector, and the measures taken to reduce them.
   The Rn-222 decay rate in the liquid argon was measured to be between 16
   and 26 mu Bq kg(-1). We found that the background spectrum near the
   region of interest for Dark Matter detection in the DEAP-1 detector can
   be described considering events from three sources: radon daughters
   decaying on the surface of the active volume, the expected rate of
   electromagnetic events misidentified as nuclear recoils due to
   inefficiencies in the pulse shape discrimination, and leakage of events
   from outside the fiducial volume due to imperfect position
   reconstruction. These backgrounds statistically account for all observed
   events, and they will be strongly reduced in the DEAP-3600 detector due
   to its higher light yield and simpler geometry. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Solar water disinfection (SODIS) is a well-established inexpensive means
   of water disinfection in developing countries, but lacks an indicator to
   illustrate its end-point. A study of the solar UV dosage required for
   SODIS, in order to achieve a bacteria concentration below the detection
   limit for: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp. and Clostridium
   perfringens, in water in PET bottles, PE and PE/EVA bags showed
   disinfection to be most efficient in PE bags, with a solar UV (290-385
   nm) dose of 389 kJ m(-2) required. In parallel to the disinfection
   experiments, a range of polyoxometalate, semiconductor photocatalysis
   and photodegradable dye-based solar UV dosimeter indicators were tested
   under the same solar UV irradiation conditions. All three types of
   dosimeter produced indicators that largely and significantly change
   colour upon exposure to 389 kJ m(-2) solar UV; further indicators are
   reported which change colour at higher doses and hence would be suitable
   for the less efficient SODIS containers tested. All indicators tested
   were robust, easy to use and inexpensive so as not to add significantly
   to the attractive low cost of SODIS. Furthermore, whilst semiconductor
   photocatalyst and photodegradable dye based indicators are disposable,
   one-use systems, the polyoxometalate based indicators recover colour in
   the dark overnight, allowing them to be reused, and hence further
   decreasing the cost of using indicators during the implementation of the
   SODIS method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an in situ diagnostic and prognostic (D\&P)
   technology to monitor the health condition of insulated gate bipolar
   transistors (IGBTs) used in EVs with a focus on the IGBTs' solder layer
   fatigue. IGBTs' thermal impedance and the junction temperature can be
   used as health indicators for through-life condition monitoring (CM)
   where the terminal characteristics are measured and the devices'
   internal temperature-sensitive parameters are employed as temperature
   sensors to estimate the junction temperature. An auxiliary power supply
   unit, which can be converted from the battery's 12-V dc supply, provides
   power to the in situ test circuits and CM data can be stored in the
   on-board data-logger for further offline analysis. The proposed method
   is experimentally validated on the developed test circuitry and also
   compared with finite-element thermoelectrical simulation. The test
   results from thermal cycling are also compared with acoustic microscope
   and thermal images. The developed circuitry is proved to be effective to
   detect solder fatigue while each IGBT in the converter can be examined
   sequentially during red-light stopping or services. The D\&P circuitry
   can utilize existing on-board hardware and be embedded in the IGBT's
   gate drive unit.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructure and texture evolution during isothermal annealing at 473
   K, 513 K and 553 K with various holding times for pure magnesium
   deformed at a strain rate of 10(2) s(-1) to a strain of -0.08 were
   studied in the present work. High strain rate deformation provides a
   higher driving force for subsequent recrystallization than a low strain
   rate. Static recrystallization (SRX) grains and grain growth associated
   with the vanishing of low angle and twin boundaries were observed during
   the annealing process. SRX grains were detected adjacent to \{10 (1)
   over bar1\}-\{10 (1) over bar2\} double twin as well as original grain
   boundaries. It indicates that both double twin and original grain
   boundaries are the sites favored for SRX nucleation, attributing to the
   relatively high stored energy accumulated by dislocations during dynamic
   plastic deformation (DPD). Grain growth rate increases with temperature
   and the highest rates occur at the period of 900-1800 s for annealing at
   513 K and 553 K, but retains a relatively low value at 473 K. The
   intensity of macro-texture increases at the beginning of annealing due
   to the similar orientation between recrystallized grains and the parent
   matrix, whereas it decreases with further annealing for the migration of
   grain boundaries during grain growth. The evidence of Schmid factor (SF)
   value evolution shows that the annealed microstructure is more favorable
   for basal glide than the deformed condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We present a detailed investigation of the cluster stellar mass-to-light
   (M{*}/L) ratio and cumulative stellar masses, derived on a
   galaxy-by-galaxy basis, for 12 massive (M-500 similar to 10(14)-10(15)
   M-circle dot), nearby clusters with available optical imaging data from
   the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 and X-ray data from the
   Chandra X-ray Observatory. Our method involves a statistical cluster
   membership using both photometric and spectroscopic redshifts when
   available to maximize completeness while minimizing contamination
   effects. We show that different methods of estimating the stellar
   mass-to-light ratio from observed photometry result in systematic
   discrepancies in the total stellar masses and average mass-to-light
   ratios of cluster galaxies. Nonetheless, all conversion methodologies
   point to a lack of correlation between M{*}/L-i and total cluster mass,
   even though low-mass groups contain relatively more blue galaxies. We
   also find no statistically significant correlation between M{*}/L-i and
   the fraction of blue galaxies (g - i < 0.85). For the mass range covered
   by our sample, the assumption of a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF)
   yields an integrated M{*}/L-i similar or equal to 1.7 +/- 0.2 M-circle
   dot/L-i,L-circle dot, a lower value than used in most similar studies,
   though consistent with the study of low-mass galaxy groups by Leauthaud
   et al. A light (diet) Salpeter IMF would imply a similar to 60\%
   increase in M{*}/L-i.}},

Title = {{STAR FORMATION IN HIGH-REDSHIFT CLUSTER ELLIPTICALS}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{800}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{We measure the star formation rates (SFRs) of massive (M-star >
   10(10.1)M(circle dot)) early-type galaxies (ETGs) in a sample of 11
   high-redshift (1.0 < z < 1.5) galaxy clusters drawn from the IRAC
   Shallow Cluster Survey (ISCS). We identify ETGs visually from Hubble
   Space Telescope imaging and select likely cluster members as having
   either an appropriate spectroscopic redshift or red-sequence color.
   Mid-infrared SFRs are measured using Spitzer 24 mu m data for isolated
   cluster galaxies for which contamination by neighbors, and active
   galactic nuclei, can be ruled out. Cluster ETGs show enhanced specific
   star formation rates (sSFRs) compared to cluster galaxies in the local
   universe, but have sSFRs more than four times lower than that of field
   ETGs at 1 < z < 1.5. Relative to the late-type cluster population,
   isolated ETGs show substantially quenched mean SFRs, yet still
   contribute 12\% of the overall star formation activity measured in 1 < z
   < 1.5 clusters. We find that new ETGs are likely being formed in ISCS
   clusters; the fraction of cluster galaxies identified as ETGs increases
   from 34\% to 56\% from z similar to 1.5 -> 1.25. While the fraction of
   cluster ETGs that are highly star-forming (SFR >= 26 M-circle dot
   yr(-1)) drops from 27\% to 10\% over the same period, their sSFRs are
   roughly constant. All these factors taken together suggest that,
   particularly at z greater than or similar to 1.25, the events that
   created these distant cluster ETGs-likely mergers, at least among the
   most massive-were both recent and gas-rich.}},

   difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion of PCL and MWCNTs. A
   numerical model was developed to explain this behavior accounting for a
   thermal expansion effect by supposing the large increase in electrical
   resistivity corresponds to the larger relative deformation due to
   thermal expansion associated with disintegration of the conductive MWCNT
   network. MWCNTs had a significant nucleating effect on PCL resulting in
   increased PCL crystallinity and an electrically insulating layer between
   MWCNTs. The onset of rheological percolation at similar to 0.18 vol\%
   MWCNTs was clearly evident as storage modulus, G' and complex viscosity,
   vertical bar eta{*}vertical bar increased by several orders of
   magnitude. From Cole-Cole and Van Gurp-Palmen plots, and extraction of
   crossover points (G(c)) from overlaying plots of G' and G `' as a
   function of frequency, the onset of rheological percolation at 0.18
   vol\% MWCNTs was confirmed, a similar MWCNT loading to that determined
   for electrical percolation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to estimate the diffusion coefficient of a solute within
   hydrogels has important application in the design and analysis of
   hydrogels used in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and regenerative
   medicine. A number of mathematical models have been derived for this
   purpose; however, they often rely on fitted parameters and so have
   limited predictive capability. Herein we assess the ability of the
   obstruction-scaling model to provide reasonable estimates of solute
   diffusion coefficients within hydrogels, as well as the assumption that
   a hydrogel can be represented as an entangled polymer solution of an
   equivalent concentration. Fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran solutes
   were loaded into sodium alginate solutions as well as hydrogels of
   different polymer volume fractions formed from photoinitiated
   cross-linking of methacrylate sodium alginate. The tracer diffusion
   coefficients of these solutes were measured using fluorescence recovery
   after photobleaching (FRAP). The measured diffusion coefficients were
   then compared to the values predicted by the obstruction-scaling model.
   The model predictions were within +/- 15\% of the measured values,
   suggesting that the model can provide useful estimates of solute
   diffusion coefficients within hydrogels and solutions. Moreover, solutes
   diffusing in both sodium alginate solutions and hydrogels were
   demonstrated to experience the same degree of solute mobility
   restriction given the same effective polymer concentration, supporting
   the assumption that a hydrogel can be represented as an entangled
   polymer solution of equivalent concentration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   and each exhibits unique reactivity and different reaction pathways.
   Detailed mechanistic and computational analysis was conducted, which
   demonstrated that the role of the base and solvent was key to the
   reactivity and selectivity observed. Crossover experiments also suggest
   that these reactions proceed with a certain degree of dissociation, and
   the mechanistic pathway is highly complex with multiple competing

Abstract = {{Microelectrode voltammetry is used to study the electrochemical
   reduction of dioxygen, O-2, in the room-temperature ionic liquid

   quantitatively modeled via digital simulation with the aim of clarifying
   apparent inconsistencies in the literature. The reduction is shown to
   proceed via a two-electron reaction and involve the likely capture of a
   proton from the solvent system. The oxidative voltammetric signals seen
   at fast scan rates are interpreted as resulting from the reoxidation of
   HO2 center dot. In the presence of large amounts of dissolved carbon
   dioxide the reductive currents decrease by a factor of ca. two,
   consistent with the trapping of the superoxide radical, O-2(center dot),
   intermediate in the two-electron reduction process.}},

   the crystallite size lies in the range of 60-80 nm. The dielectric
   constant decreases with the increase of frequency. The relaxation peaks
   in tangent loss curves indicates the presences of polarons in the
