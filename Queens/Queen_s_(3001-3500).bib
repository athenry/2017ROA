Title = {{A fast iterative single data approach to training unconstrained least
   squares support vector machines}},
Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{115}},

Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) express the training in
   terms of solving a system of linear equations or an equivalent quadratic
   program (QP) with one linear equality constraint, in contrast to a QP
   with lower and upper bounds and one linear equality constraint for
   conventional support vector machines (SVMs). But for large scale
   problems, the presence of the linear equality constraint impedes the
   applications of some well developed methods. In this paper, we first
   eliminate the linear equality constraint of the QP in training LS-SVM
   and make it an unconstrained one, then propose a fast iterative single
   data approach with stepsize acceleration to the unconstrained QP. As a
   result of combining the selection rule of variables with the coordinate
   descent approach, the proposed approach is superior to the successive
   over-relaxation (SOR) method. Meanwhile updating only one variable at
   each iteration makes the proposed approach simpler and more flexible
   than the sequential minimal optimization (SMO) method. Computational
   experiment results on several benchmark data sets show that the proposed
   approach is more efficient than the existing single data approach and
   the SMO methods. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In today's atmosphere of constrained defense spending and reduced
   research budgets, determining how to allocate resources for research and
   design has become a critical and challenging task. In the area of
   aircraft design, there are many promising technologies to be explored,
   yet limited funds with which to explore them. In addition, issues
   concerning the uncertainty in technology readiness, as well as the
   quantification of the impact of a technology (or combinations of
   technologies), are of key importance during the design process. This
   paper presents a methodology that details a comprehensive and structured
   process in which to quantitatively explore the effects of technology for
   a given baseline aircraft. This process, called technology impact
   forecasting, involves the creation of an assessment environment for use
   in conjunction with defined technology scenarios, and it will have a
   significant impact on the resource allocation strategies for defense
   acquisition. The advantages and limitations of the method are discussed.
   In addition, an example of a technology impact forecasting application,
   an uninhabited combat aerial vehicle, is presented and serves to
   illustrate the applicability of this methodology to a military system.}},

   Evidence of chemical grafting of mcl-PHA and cross-linking of the PHA
   grafts was obtained using NMR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),
   gel extraction, and rheological analysis. A high degree of mcl-PHA
   grafting was achieved by maintaining proper miniemulsion polymerization
   conditions throughout the course of the polymerization. The
   incorporation of PHA grafts was a function of the level of PHA in the
   formulations as well as the reaction conditions, as evidenced by solvent

Title = {{Assessing the construction cost of Greek transportation tunnel projects}},
Journal = {{TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{497-505}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Cost estimation is a crucial factor for the success of an engineering
   project. This element is even more important at the initial stages of
   design where decisions should be taken based on the more accurately
   available cost data. In underground construction projects especially,
   where the variability of the geotechnical conditions can change initial
   estimates, the accurate estimation of the construction cost from the
   preliminary phases of the project can minimize cost overrun issues as
   well construction claims and disputes. The purpose of this paper is to
   provide insight in cost estimation for underground projects focusing on
   tunnels. For this reason, the analysis of construction cost is
   undertaken, based on data from a set of 9 tunnels that have been
   constructed in Greece. The analysis presented focuses on the excavation
   and temporary support cost with respect to the geotechnical conditions
   encountered. Although the cost is influenced by many parameters, through
   the analysis of past data using the Case Base Reasoning approach,
   valuable lessons can be learned by decoding the effect of the ground
   conditions on the construction cost. The construction cost of the Greek
   tunnels is estimated for 2011 price levels and it is expressed though
   range estimation for 5 rock mass categories that were identified.
   Furthermore, a direct linkage between construction cost and the
   encountered geotechnical conditions, as expressed in GSI values, are
   made in an attempt to capture the general trend of construction cost in
   terms of (sic)/m(3) and (sic)/m. The findings can be used as a first
   order assessment in order to have a representative estimation of the
   tunneling cost from the initial stages of project design. (C) 2013

   Despite there not being a discernible difference in the average error in

Abstract = {{A set of cylindrical porous titanium test samples were produced using
   the three-dimensional printing and sintering method with samples
   sintered at 900 degrees C, 1000 degrees C, 1100 degrees C, 1200 degrees
   C or 1300 degrees C. Following compression testing, it was apparent that
   the stress-strain curves were similar in shape to the curves that
   represent cellular solids. This is despite a relative density twice as
   high as what is considered the threshold for defining a cellular solid.
   As final sintering temperature increased, the compressive behaviour
   developed from being elastic-brittle to elastic-plastic and while
   Young's modulus remained fairly constant in the region of 1.5 GPa, there
   was a corresponding increase in 0.2\% proof stress of approximately
   40-80 MPa. The cellular solid model consists of two equations that
   predict Young's modulus and yield or proof stress. By fitting to
   experimental data and consideration of porous morphology, appropriate
   changes to the geometry constants allow modification of the current
   models to predict with better accuracy the behaviour of porous materials
   with higher relative densities (lower porosity).}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{Solar-driven water splitting to produce hydrogen may be an ideal
   solution for global energy and environment issues. Among the various
   photocatalytic systems, platinum has been widely used to co-catalyse the
   reduction of protons in water for hydrogen evolution. However, the
   undesirable hydrogen oxidation reaction can also be readily catalysed by
   metallic platinum, which limits the solar energy conversion efficiency
   in artificial photosynthesis. Here we report that the unidirectional
   suppression of hydrogen oxidation in photocatalytic water splitting can
   be fulfilled by controlling the valence state of platinum; this
   platinum-based cocatalyst in a higher oxidation state can act as an
   efficient hydrogen evolution site while suppressing the undesirable
   hydrogen back-oxidation. The findings in this work may pave the way for
   developing other high-efficientcy platinum-based catalysts for
   photocatalysis, photoelectrochemistry, fuel cells and water-gas shift

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A capillary switch is a bi-stable system of liquid/gas interfaces with a
   trigger to toggle back and forth between the two stable equilibrium
   states. We use an electroosmotic pump as trigger. The pump, consisting
   of two electrodes and a porous substrate arranged between the droplets,
   moves volume between the droplets. This bistable system is called an
   electro-osmotic droplet switch. With the pump off, for low total
   volumes, the stable states are a pair of identical sub-hemispherical
   droplets or, for large enough total volumes, a large-small droplet
   configuration (two mirrorsymmetric states). With the pump on, these
   stationary states are shifted and, if the pump strength is too great,
   there are no stationary states at all. In this article, we report the
   pump-on behavior as a modification of the pump-off behavior. To build
   the dynamic model of the system, we first develop a characterization of
   the electro-osmotic pump in the spirit of the Blake-Kozeny correlation
   for viscous flow through a packed bed. The control-volume model is based
   on center-of-mass motion. Model predictions compare favorably to
   observation. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The flow in a plane channel with two idealized stents (one
   Lambda-shaped, the other X-shaped) is studied numerically. A periodic
   pressure gradient corresponding to one measured in the left anterior
   descending coronary artery was used to drive the flow. Two Reynolds
   numbers were examined, one (Re = 80) corresponding to resting
   conditions, the other (Re = 200) to exercise. The stents were
   implemented by an immersed boundary method. The formation and migration
   of vortices that had been observed experimentally was also seen here. In
   the previous studies, the compliance mismatch between stent and vessel
   was conjectured to be the reason for this phenomenon. However, in the
   present study we demonstrate that the vortices form despite the fact
   that the walls were rigid. Flow visualization and quantitative analysis
   lead us to conclude that this process is due to the stent wires that
   generate small localized recirculation regions that, when they interact
   with the near-wall flow reversal, result in the formation of these
   vortical structures. The recirculation regions grow and merge when the
   imposed waveform produces near-wall flow reversal, forming coherent
   quasi-spanwise vortices, that migrate away from the wall. The flow
   behavior due to the stents was compared with an unstented channel. The
   geometric characteristics of the Lambda-stent caused less deviation of
   the flow from an unstented channel than the X-stent. Investigating the
   role of advection and diffusion indicated that at Re = 80 advection has
   negligible contribution in the transport mechanism. Advection plays a
   role in the generation of streamwise vortices created for both stents at
   both Reynolds numbers. The effect of these vortices on the near-wall
   flow behavior is more significant for the Lambda-stent compared to the
   X-stent and at Re = 200 with respect to Re = 80. Finally, it was
   observed that increasing the Reynolds number leads to early vortex
   formation and the creation of the vortex in a stented channel is
   coincident with the near wall flow reversal in an unstented one. (C)

Abstract = {{We develop closed-form generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) sequence
   detectors for multi-relay amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative networks
   employing M-ary differential phase-shift keying (M-DPSK) and noncoherent
   M-ary frequency-shift keying (M-FSK). The proposed detectors achieve
   robust performance in a wide range of fading environments where prior
   knowledge of channels, signal powers, noise variances, and relay
   functionalities is unavailable to the destination. A comprehensive error
   probability performance analysis is carried out in Rayleigh fading.
   Specifically, we derive unified pairwise error probability (PEP)
   expressions for both detectors in a dual-hop network, which are valid
   for arbitrary modulation order M and arbitrary sequence length N-s. We
   also derive unified bit-error probability (BEP) expressions for both
   detectors employing binary signalings in various networks for N-s = 1.
   It is further shown that both detectors achieve near full diversity
   orders. Finally, the superiorities of the proposed detectors over the
   state-of-the-art noncoherent detectors are justified through extensive
   comparisons in practical scenarios. For example, in a multi-relay
   network where the relays are uniformly distributed between the source
   and destination, the proposed detector for noncoherent FSK with N-s = 1
   outperforms the well-known maximum energy selector by almost 15 dB in
   high signal-to-noise ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Likelihood-based algorithms for the classification of linear digital
   modulations are systematically investigated for a multiple receive
   antennas configuration. Existing modulation classification (MC)
   algorithms are first extended to the case of multiple receive antennas
   and then a critical problem is identified that the overall performance
   of the multiple antenna systems is dominated by the worst channel
   estimate of a particular antenna. To address the performance degradation
   issue, we propose a new MC algorithm by optimally combining the log
   likelihood functions (LLFs). Furthermore, to analyze the upper-bound
   performance of the existing and the proposed MC algorithms, the exact
   Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) expressions of non-data-aided joint
   estimates of amplitude, phase, and noise variance are derived for
   general rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Numerical
   results demonstrate the accuracy of the CRLB expressions and verify that
   the results reported in the literature for quadrature phase-shift keying
   (QPSK) and 16-QAM are special cases of our derived expressions. Also, it
   is demonstrated that the probability of correct classification of the
   new algorithm approaches the theoretical bounds and a substantial
   performance improvement is achieved compared to the existing MC
   algorithm.}},

Journal = {{SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{419-431}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Nutrient loss from agricultural land following organic fertilizer
   spreading can lead to eutrophication and poor water quality. The risk of
   pollution is partly related to the soil water status during and after
   spreading. In response to these issues, a decision support system (DSS)
   for nutrient management has been developed to predict when soil and
   weather conditions are suitable for slurry spreading. At the core of the
   DSS, the Hybrid Soil Moisture Deficit (HSMD) model estimates soil water
   status relative to field capacity (FC) for three soil classes (well,
   moderately and poorly drained) and has potential to predict the
   occurrence of a transport vector when the soil is wetter than FC. Three
   years of field observation of volumetric water content was used to
   validate HSMD model predictions of water status and to ensure correct
   use and interpretation of the drainage classes. Point HSMD model
   predictions were validated with respect to the temporal and spatial
   variations in volumetric water content and soil strength properties. It
   was found that the HSMD model predictions were well related to topsoil
   water content through time, but a new class intermediate between poor
   and moderate, perhaps imperfectly drained', was needed. With correct
   allocations of a field into a drainage class, the HSMD model predictions
   reflect field scale trends in water status and therefore the model is
   suitable for use at the core of a DSS.}},

Abstract = {{A novel TiO2-coconut shell powder (TCNSP) composite, prepared by the
   controlled sol-gel method with a subsequent heat treatment, was
   investigated as an innovative photocatalytic absorbent for the removal
   of carbamazepine (CBZ). CBZ is used worldwide as an antiepileptic drug,
   which has recently been recognized as an important organic pollutant
   increasingly found in wastewaters from urban areas and other aquatic
   environments. The granulation process was performed by using a
   semiautomated mass production line to produce sufficient quantities of
   TCNSP composites, possessing sufficient crush strength for
   commercialization. Physical properties of the TCNSP composite such as
   crystallinity, morphology, crush strength, and the
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)-specific surface area were controlled by
   the mass ratio of titanium dioxide sol and coconut shell powder (CNSP).
   Calcination at 700 degrees C produced anatase phase TiO2 in the TCNSP
   composites with a BET high surface area of 454 m(2)/g. Anatase
   crystallite size of the TCNSP composite increased from 2.37 to 15.11 nm
   with increasing calcination temperature from 500 degrees C to 800
   degrees C. Calcinated TCNSP composites had higher CBZ removal efficiency
   (98\%) than pure TiO2 (23\%) and CNSP (34\%) within a 40-min reaction
   time. Optimization of this innovative adsorption/photocatalytic process
   was obtained by a response surface methodology and a central composite
   design model, which indicated that this novel and sustainable technology
   was successful in removing CBZ from a solution.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated navigation systems based on a tightly coupled integration
   scheme utilize pseudoranges and pseudorange rates from Global
   Positioning System (GPS) satellites measured by the receiver. The
   positioning accuracy is highly dependent on the accuracy of the
   pseudoranges whose residual errors can deteriorate the overall
   positioning accuracy. The integrated system can be improved by the
   provision of more accurate pseudoranges through modeling the residual
   correlated errors. This paper utilizes parallel cascade identification
   (PCI), which is a nonlinear system identification technique, to model
   these correlated errors. To address the nonlinear error characteristics
   in the whole integrated navigation system, a nonlinear filter, i.e.,
   mixture particle filter (M-PF), is employed to perform tightly coupled
   integration of a 3-D reduced inertial sensor system (RISS) with a GPS.
   The M-PF can accommodate the PCI models of the pseudorange errors in the
   measurement model. The results demonstrate the advantages of using
   M-PF-PCI for correcting the pseudoranges and enhancing the positioning
   solution as compared with M-PF-only, Kalman filter (KF)-PCI, and KF-only
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The joint source-channel coding (JSCC) problem for
   soft-decision-demodulated time-correlated fading channels is
   investigated without the use of channel coding and interleaving. For the
   purpose of system design, the recently introduced nonbinary noise
   discrete channel with queue-based (QB) noise (NBNDC-QB) is adopted. This
   analytically tractable Markovian model has been shown to represent
   effectively correlated fading channels that are hard to handle
   analytically. Optimal sequence maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection of a
   discrete Markov source sent over the NBNDC-QB is first studied. When the
   Markov source is binary and symmetric, a necessary and sufficient
   condition under which the MAP decoder is reduced to a simple
   instantaneous symbol-by-symbol decoder is established. Two robust lossy
   source coding schemes with a low encoding delay are next proposed for
   the NBNDC-QB. The first scheme consists of a scalar quantizer (SQ), a
   proper index assignment, and a sequence MAP decoder designed to harness
   the redundancy left in the indexes of the quantizer and the
   soft-decision output and the noise correlation of the channel. The
   second scheme is a classical noise-resilient vector quantizer known as
   the channel-optimized vector quantizer (COVQ). It is demonstrated that
   both systems can successfully exploit the memory and soft-decision
   information of the channel. Signal-to-distortion-ratio (SDR) gains of
   more than 1.7 dB are obtained over hard-decision demodulation by using
   only two bits for soft decision. Furthermore, gains as high as 4.4 dB
   can be achieved for a strongly correlated channel, in comparison with
   systems designed for the ideally interleaved (memoryless) channel.
   Finally, it is numerically observed that, for low coding rates, the
   NBNDC-QB model can accurately approximate discrete fading channels
   (DFCs) in terms of SDR performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the use of an objective fuzzy approach for fast and
   accurate vision-based inspection. An inspection problem faced by a
   Canadian automotive parts manufacturer is being used as a case study.
   The problem is related to a vision system that is being operated to
   confirm the placement of metal fastening clips on a structural member
   that supports a truck dash panel. The manufacturer was interested in
   identifying the presence or absence of metal clips inserted by a robot
   arm. It took the manufacturer over 8 months to tune its commercial
   machine vision system to detect missing clips and yet the accuracy and
   efficiency of the system are being questioned. Five different
   universities across Canada have been working in parallel on this problem
   over a time span of 2 years. To this end, we developed an efficient
   fuzzy model after trying various statistical approaches. The proposed
   model properly identifies all the images in a database containing 1910
   images. The robustness of the fuzzy model is confirmed by its strong
   performance on the entire database.}},

Abstract = {{Facet syndrome is a condition that may cause 15-45 \% of chronic lower
   back pain. It is commonly diagnosed and treated using facet joint
   injections. This needle technique demands high accuracy, and ultrasound
   (US) is a potentially useful modality to guide the needle. US-guided
   injections, however, require physicians to interpret 2-D sonographic
   images while simultaneously manipulating an US probe and needle.
   Therefore, US-guidance for facet joint injections needs advanced
   training methodologies that will equip physicians with the requisite
   skills.
   We used Perk Tutor-an augmented reality training system for US-guided
   needle insertions-in a configuration for percutaneous procedures of the
   lumbar spine. In a pilot study of 26 pre-medical undergraduate students,
   we evaluated the efficacy of Perk Tutor training compared to traditional
   training.
   The Perk Tutor Trained group, which had access to Perk Tutor during
   training, had a mean success rate of 61.5 \%, while the Control group,
   which received traditional training, had a mean success rate of 38.5 \%
   (). No significant differences in procedure times or needle path lengths
   were observed between the two groups.
   The results of this pilot study suggest that Perk Tutor provides an
   improved training environment for US-guided facet joint injections on a
   synthetic model.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to examine the oestrogen and androgen
   hormone removal efficiency of reactive (Connelly zero-valent iron (ZVI),
   Gotthart Maier ZVI) and sorptive (AquaSorb 101 granular activated carbon
   (GAC) and OrganoLoc PM-100 organoclay (OC)) materials from HPLC grade
   water and constructed wetland system (CWS) treated dairy farm
   wastewater. Batch test studies were performed and hormone concentration
   analysis carried out using highly sensitive reporter gene assays (RGAs).
   The results showed that hormonal interaction with these materials is
   selective for individual classes of hormones. Connelly ZVI and AquaSorb
   101 GAC were more efficient in removing testosterone (Te) than 17
   beta-estradiol (E2) and showed faster removal rates of oestrogen and
   androgen than the other materials. Gotthart Maier ZVI was more efficient
   in removing E2 than Te. OrganoLoc PM-100 OC achieved the lowest final
   concentration of E2 equivalent (EEQ) and provided maximum removal of
   both oestrogens and androgens. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a bimodal biometric recognition system based on the
   extracted features of the human palmprint and iris using a new
   graph-based approach termed Fisher locality preserving projections
   (FLPP). This new technique employs two graphs with the first being used
   to characterize the within-class compactness and the second dedicated to
   the augmentation of the between-class separability. By applying the
   FLPP, only the most discriminant and stable palmprint and iris features
   are retained. FLPP was implemented on the frequency domain by
   transforming the extracted region of interest extraction of both
   biometric modalities using Fourier transform. Subsequently, the
   palmprint and iris features vectors obtained are matched with their
   counterpart in the templates databases and the obtained scores are fused
   to produce a final decision. The proposed combination of palmprint and
   iris patterns has shown an excellent performance compared to unimodal
   palmprint biometric recognition. The system was evaluated on a database
   of 108 subjects and the experimental results show that our system
   performs very well and achieves a high accuracy expressed by an equal
   error rate of 0.00\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a combination of novel feature vectors construction
   approach for face recognition using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and

   core implementation of transform block in face recognition systems.
   Initially, four experiments have been conducted including the DWT
   feature selection and filter choice, features optimisation by
   coefficient selections and feature threshold. To examine the most
   suitable method of feature extraction, different wavelet quadrant and
   scales have been evaluated, and it is followed with an evaluation of
   different wavelet filter choices and their impact on recognition
   accuracy. In this study, an approach for face recognition based on
   coefficient selection for DWT is presented, and the significant of DWT
   coefficient threshold selection is also analysed. For the hardware
   implementation, two architectures for two-dimensional (2-D) Haar wavelet
   transform (HWT) IP core with transpose-based computation and dynamic
   partial reconfiguration (DPR) have been synthesised using VHDL and
   implemented on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGAs. Experimental results and
   comparisons between different configurations using partial and
   non-partial reconfiguration processes and a detailed performance
   analysis of the area, power consumption and maximum frequency are also
   discussed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Wind turbines are increasingly being expected to provide oscillation
   damping to the power system to which they are connected. In this study,
   power oscillation damping control of variable speed wind turbines is
   studied. An energy storage device with a bidirectional DC/DC converter
   connected to the DC link of a fully rated converter-based wind turbine
   is proposed. As system oscillation is often induced by an AC fault, it
   is desirable for wind turbines to ride through the fault first and then
   provide a damping effect. During the fault period, the energy storage
   system (ESS) is controlled to assist the fault ride through process, and
   the line side converter (LSC) is controlled to provide AC voltage
   support in accordance with the grid code. Methods based on regulating
   the active power output of the ESS and modulation of reactive power
   output of the LSC are proposed so as to damp the oscillations of the
   power system. Matlab/Simulink simulations based on a simplified Irish
   power system demonstrate the performance of the ESS and LSC during fault
   periods and validate the damping effect of the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{The circumferential hydrides normally present in nuclear reactor fuel
   cladding after reactor exposure may dissolve during drying for dry
   storage and re-precipitate when cooled under load into a more radial
   orientation, which could embrittle the fuel cladding. It is necessary to
   study the rates and conditions under which hydride reorientation may
   happen in order to assess fuel integrity in dry storage.
   The objective of this work is to study the effect of applied stress and
   thermal cycling on the hydride morphology in cold-worked stress-relieved
   Zircaloy-4 by combining conventional metallography and in situ X-ray
   diffraction techniques. Metallography is used to study the evolution of
   hydride morphology after several thermo-mechanical cycles. In situ X-ray
   diffraction performed at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron provides
   real-time information on the process of hydride dissolution and
   precipitation under stress during several thermal cycles. The detailed
   study of diffracted intensity, peak position and full-width at
   half-maximum provides information on precipitation kinetics, elastic
   strains and other characteristics of the hydride precipitation process.
   The results show that thermo-mechanical cycling significantly increases
   the radial hydride fraction as well as the hydride length and
   connectivity. The radial hydrides are observed to precipitate at a lower
   temperature than circumferential hydrides. Variations in the magnitude
   and range of hydride strains due to reorientation and cycling have also
   been observed. These results are discussed in light of existing models
   and experiments on hydride reorientation. The study of hydride elastic
   strains during precipitation shows marked differences between
   circumferential and radial hydrides, which can be used to investigate
   the reorientation process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Influence of surface structures, subsurface carbon and hydrogen, and

   hydrogenation on Pd surfaces: A density functional theory study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene on several Pd
   surfaces (Pd(111), Pd(100), Pd(211), and Pd(211)-defect) and Pd surfaces
   with subsurface species (carbon and hydrogen) as well as a number of
   Pd-based alloys (Pd-M/Pd(111) and Pd-M/Pd(211) (M = Cu, Ag and Au)) are
   investigated using density functional theory calculations to understand
   both the acetylene hydrogenation activity and the selectivity of
   ethylene formation. All the hydrogenation barriers are calculated, and
   the reaction rates on these surfaces are obtained using a two-step
   model. Pd(211) is found to have the highest activity for acetylene
   hydrogenation while Pd(100) gives rise to the lowest activity. In
   addition, more open surfaces result in over-hydrogenation to form
   ethane, while the close-packed surface (Pd(111)) is the most selective.
   However, we also find that the presence of subsurface carbon and
   hydrogen significantly changes the reactivity and selectivity of
   acetylene toward hydrogenation on Pd surfaces. On forming surface alloys
   of Pd with Cu, Ag and Au, the selectivity for ethylene is also found to
   be changed. A new energy decomposition method is used to quantitatively
   analyze the factors in determining the changes in selectivity. These
   surface modifiers are found to block low coordination unselective sites,
   leading to a decreased ethane production. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Title = {{Anisotropy of single-crystal 3C-SiC during nanometric cutting}},
Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{3C-SiC (the only polytype of SiC that resides in a diamond cubic lattice
   structure) is a relatively new material that exhibits most of the
   desirable engineering properties required for advanced electronic
   applications. The anisotropy exhibited by 3C-SiC during its nanometric
   cutting is significant, and the potential for its exploitation has yet
   to be fully investigated. This paper aims to understand the influence of
   crystal anisotropy of 3C-SiC on its cutting behaviour. A molecular
   dynamics simulation model was developed to simulate the nanometric
   cutting of single-crystal 3C-SiC in nine (9) distinct combinations of
   crystal orientations and cutting directions, i.e. (1 1 1) <-1 1 0 >, (1
   1 1) <-2 1 1 >, (1 1 0) <-1 1 0 >, (1 1 0) < 0 0 1 >, (1 1 0) < 1 1 -2
   >, (0 0 1) <-1 1 0 >, (0 0 1) < 1 0 0 >, (1 1 -2) < 1 -1 0 > and (1 -2
   0) < 2 1 0 >.
   In order to ensure the reliability of the simulation results, two
   separate simulation trials were carried out with different machining
   parameters. In the first trial, a cutting tool rake angle of -25
   degrees, d/r (uncut chip thickness/cutting edge radius) ratio of 0.57
   and cutting velocity of 10 ms(-1) were used whereas a second trial was
   done using a cutting tool rake angle of -30 degrees, d/r ratio of 1 and
   cutting velocity of 4 m s(-1). Both the trials showed similar
   anisotropic variation.
   The simulated orthogonal components of thrust force in 3C-SiC showed a
   variation of up to 45\%, while the resultant cutting forces showed a
   variation of 37\%. This suggests that 3C-SiC is highly anisotropic in
   its ease of deformation. These results corroborate with the
   experimentally observed anisotropic variation of 43.6\% in Young's
   modulus of 3C-SiC. The recently developed dislocation extraction
   algorithm (DXA) {[}1, 2] was employed to detect the nucleation of
   dislocations in the MD simulations of varying cutting orientations and
   cutting directions. Based on the overall analysis, it was found that
   3C-SiC offers ease of deformation on either (1 1 1) <-1 1 0 >, (1 1 0) <
   0 0 1 >, or (1 0 0) < 1 0 0 > setups.}},

Title = {{Farmer perception of suitable conditions for slurry application compared
   with decision support system recommendations}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{49-60}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The application of slurry nutrients to land can be associated with
   unintended losses to the environment depending on soil and weather
   conditions. Correct timing of slurry application, however, can increase
   plant nutrient uptake and reduce losses. A decision support system
   (DSS), which predicts optimum conditions for slurry spreading based on
   the Hybrid Soil Moisture Deficit (HSMD) model, was investigated for use
   as a policy tool. The DSS recommendations were compared to farmer
   perception of suitable conditions for slurry spreading for three soil
   drainage classes (well, moderate and poorly drained) to better
   understand on farm slurry management practices and to identify potential
   conflict with farmer opinion. Six farmers participated in a survey over
   two and a half years, during which they completed a daily diary, and
   their responses were compared to Soil Moisture Deficit (SMD)
   calculations and weather data recorded by on farm meteorological
   stations. The perception of land drainage quality differed between
   farmers and was related to their local knowledge and experience. It was
   found that the allocation of grass fields to HSMD drainage classes using
   a visual assessment method aligned farmer perception of drainage at the
   national scale. Farmer opinion corresponded to the theoretical
   understanding that slurry should not be applied when the soil is wetter
   than field capacity, i.e. when drainage can occur. While weather and
   soil conditions (especially trafficability) were the principal reasons
   given by farmers not to spread slurry, farm management practices
   (grazing and silage) and current Nitrates Directive policies (closed
   winter period for spreading) combined with limited storage capacities
   were obstacles to utilisation of slurry nutrients. Despite the slightly
   more restrictive advice of the DSS regarding the number of suitable
   spreading opportunities, the system has potential to address an
   information deficit that would help farmers to reduce nutrient losses
   and optimise plant nutrient uptake by improved slurry management. The
   DSS advice was in general agreement with the farmers and, therefore,
   they should not be resistant to adopting the tool for day to day
   management. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   replace the bottom layer of conventional rebar, are essentially flat
   plates with T-up ribs. They span between support girders spaced at 1,772
   mm and are lap-spliced using adhesive and mechanical fasteners. Special
   attention was given to the detailing of monolithic connections between
   the deck and girders to simulate continuity. The flange of the
   supporting concrete girders had a rough surface finish and protruded
   steel stirrups and mimicked AASHTO Type III girders. Five full-scale
   decks were tested to (1) compare the novel system with a conventional RC
   deck, (2) examine the effect of eliminating a top layer of orthogonal
   GFRP rebar, (3) assess a practice commonly used in bridge deck tests of
   using simple spans resting on neoprene pads, neglecting connection to
   girders, and (4) examine a commercially available all-GFRP deck, using
   the same GFRP panels but with a top GFRP plate fastened to the T-up
   ribs. Four auxiliary flexural specimens were tested to examine the
   lap-splice. The concrete deck with GFRP SIP form showed 33\% higher
   strength than the conventional RC deck. It also achieved a peak load 7.8
   times higher than the service load plus impact. Deflection under the
   service load was less than span/1,600. Remarkable deformability and
   pseudoductility was achieved at ultimate load, beyond punching shear,
   because of the progressive failure of the lap-splice. The simply
   supported deck failed at a slightly lower strength than the
   monolithically cast one but had a much lower stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{The durability of reinforced concrete structures depends, in the main,
   on the performance of the cover-zone concrete, which protects the steel
   from the external environment. This paper focuses on the use of
   discretized electrical property measurements to study depth-related
   features during both the curing and postcuring period, thereby allowing
   an integrated assessment of the protective properties of the cover
   region. In the current work, use is made of a small, multielectrode
   array embedded within the surface 75mm of concrete specimens. Concretes
   were manufactured with different European cements (CEM) and water/binder
   ratios representing mixes that satisfied the minimum requirements for a
   range of environmental exposure classes, including exposure to
   chlorides. Electrical resistance measurements were taken over a period
   in excess of 300days which showed ongoing hydration, pozzolanic
   reaction, and pore-structure refinement; in addition, in the postcuring
   period, when exposed to a cyclic chloride ponding regime, measurements
   could be used to study the convective zone and ionic enrichment of the
   surface layer.}},

Abstract = {{Context-awareness and Location-Based-Services are of great importance in
   mobile computing environments. Although fingerprinting provides accurate
   indoor positioning in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), difficulty of
   offline site surveys and the dynamic environment changes prevent it from
   being practically implemented and commercially adopted. This paper
   introduces a novel client/server-based system that dynamically estimates
   and continuously calibrates a fine radio map for indoor positioning
   without extra network hardware or prior knowledge about the area and
   without time-consuming offline surveys. A modified Bayesian regression
   algorithm is introduced to estimate a posterior signal strength
   probability distribution over all locations based on online observations
   from WLAN access points (AP) assuming Gaussian prior centered over a
   logarithmic pass loss mean. To continuously adapt to dynamic changes,
   Bayesian kernels parameters are continuously updated and optimized
   genetically based on recent APs observations. The radio map is further
   optimized by a fast features reduction algorithm to select the most
   informative APs. Additionally, the system provides reliable integrity
   monitor (accuracy measure). Two different experiments on IEEE 802.11
   networks show that the dynamic radio map provides 2-3m accuracy, which
   is comparable to results of an up-to-date offline radio map. Also
   results show the consistency of estimated accuracy measure with actual
   positioning accuracy.}},

   three different plumbing configurations and two different hourly draw

   environment, and the results showed that the TRNSYS model was in good
   agreement with the experimental results, where the discrepancies between
   data were found mainly in the regions of high temperature gradients
   within the storage tanks. Preliminary simulations were also conducted
   using realistic charge and draw profiles to illustrate the thermal
   behaviour of the tanks under non-ideal operating conditions. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Measuring inconsistency is crucial to effective inconsistency management
   in software development. A complete measurement of inconsistency should
   focus on not only the degree but also the significance of inconsistency.
   However, most of the approaches available only take the degree of
   inconsistency into account. The significance of inconsistency has not
   yet been given much needed consideration. This paper presents an
   approach for measuring the significance of inconsistency arising from
   different viewpoints in the Viewpoints framework. We call an individual
   set of requirements belonging to different viewpoints a combined
   requirements collection in this paper. We argue that the significance of
   inconsistency arising in a combined requirements collection is closely
   associated with global priority levels of requirements involved in the
   inconsistency. Here we assume that the global priority level of an
   individual requirement captures the relative importance of every
   viewpoint including this requirement as well as the local priority level
   of the requirement within the viewpoint. Then we use the synthesis of
   global priority levels of all the requirements in a combined collection
   to measure the significance of the collection. Following this, we
   present a scoring matrix function to measure the significance of
   inconsistency in an inconsistent combined requirements collection, which
   describes the contribution made by each subset of the requirements
   collection to the significance of the set of requirements involved in
   the inconsistency. An ordering relationship between inconsistencies of
   two combined requirements collections, termed more significant than, is
   also presented by comparing their significance scoring matrix functions.
   Finally, these techniques were implemented in a prototype tool called
   IncMeasurer, which we developed as a proof of concept. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{1-10}},

Abstract = {{The two-phase flow of a hydrophobic ionic liquid and water was studied
   in capillaries made of three different materials (two types of Teflon,
   FEP and Tefzel, and glass) with sizes between 200 pm and 270 gm. The
   ionic liquid was 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis\{(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl\}amide, with density and viscosity of
   1420 kg m(-3) and 0.041 kg m(-1) s(-1), respectively. Flow patterns and
   pressure drop were measured for two inlet configurations (T- and
   Y-junction), for total flow rates of 0.065-214.9 cm(3) h(-1) and ionic
   liquid volume fractions from 0.05 to 0.8. The continuous phase in the
   glass capillary depended on the fluid that initially filled the channel.
   When water was introduced first, it became the continuous phase with the
   ionic liquid forming plugs or a mixture of plugs and drops within it. In
   the Teflon microchannels, the order that fluids were introduced did not
   affect the results and the ionic liquid was always the continuous phase.
   The main patterns observed were annular, plug, and drop flow. Pressure
   drop in the Teflon microchannels at a constant ionic liquid flow rate,
   was found to increase as the ionic liquid volume fraction decreased, and
   was always higher than the single phase ionic liquid value at the same
   flow rate as in the two-phase mixture. However, in the glass
   microchannel during plug flow with water as the continuous phase,
   pressure drop for a constant ionic liquid flow rate was always lower
   than the single phase ionic liquid value. A modified plug flow pressure
   drop model using a correlation for film thickness derived for the
   current fluids pair showed very good agreement with the experimental
   data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates a systematic approach for the identification
   and control of Hammerstein systems over a physical IEEE 802.11b wireless
   channel. Three major factors which may affect system stability and
   stabilisation are concerned: wireless network-induced delays,
   nonlinearity and model mismatch. First the network-induced delays are
   characterised by an inverse Gaussian distribution model according to
   IEEE 802.11b protocol and a model-based compensation method is used to
   estimate the delayed samples. Then an inverse function of nonlinear part
   of the identified model is used to attenuate the influence of
   nonlinearity, while the model mismatch is regarded as disturbance which
   is then dealt with by H control approach. A sufficient condition for

Abstract = {{Thermoforming is widely employed in industry for the manufacture of
   lightweight, thin-walled products from pre-extruded plastic sheet and
   its largest application is in packaging. Over many years attempts have
   been made to simulate the process and thereby exploit modern
   computational tools for process optimisation. However, progress in this
   area has been greatly hampered by insufficient knowledge of the response
   of polymer materials under thermoforming conditions and an inability to
   measure this and other processing phenomena accurately. In recent years
   some address has been made to these problems through advances in
   measurement technologies, and in particular, the development of high
   speed, high strain, biaxial testing machines that are designed to
   replicate the conditions in thermoforming processes. In this work the
   development of an advanced finite element-based thermoforming process
   simulation is presented. At its heart is a sophisticated large strain
   thermally coupled (LSTC) material model for polypropylene, which has
   been developed after several years of research and is founded directly
   on biaxial test results at elevated temperatures. This material model
   has been demonstrated to provide an excellent fit to the biaxial data
   and to offer a very stable computational platform for the process
   simulation.The performance of the working simulation was validated
   through comparison with matching experimental test results, and this
   enabled investigation of the sensitivity of the process output (in the
   form of part wall thickness distribution) to changes in a range of other
   processing parameters. This work confirmed that the process is most
   sensitive to the parameters controlling plug/sheet contact friction.
   Heat transfer parameters were also shown to be significant and the
   requirement for the model to be fully thermo-mechanically coupled has
   been clearly established. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed air-gap inductors have the advantage of reducing winding
   loss in high switching frequency dc/dc converters. However, they also
   have the disadvantage of uneven distribution of flux density, which
   inevitably leads to uncompleted utilization of magnetic material. This
   paper proposes a horizontal-winding multipermeability low-temperature
   cofired ceramic (LTCC) inductor to increase inductance and improve
   efficiency without the necessity of increasing inductor volume. For the
   purpose of simplicity, a two-permeability LTCC inductor is taken as an
   example for analysis and comparison. Design of such an inductor is
   demonstrated with the aid of 2-D finite elementary analysis simulation.
   A two-permeability LTCC inductor together with a single-permeability
   LTCC inductor is fabricated for measuring and testing. The measured
   results show the two-permeability inductor has higher inductance than
   the single-permeability inductor. Both inductors are tested in a 5-V
   input, 3.3-V output dc/dc converter to test their performances. The
   testing results show the two-permeability LTCC inductor could further
   improve the efficiency of high-frequency dc/dc converters compared with
   the single-permeability LTCC inductor.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed air-gap inductors such as iron powder chip inductors and
   low-temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) inductors have the advantage of
   low-fringing effect loss. However, the flux density nonuniformly
   distributes in the magnetic cores, which results in the magnetic
   material closer to the conductor becoming saturated while the magnetic
   material further away from the conductor is still not fully utilized.
   This paper proposes a multipermeability distributed air-gap inductor
   structure to increase inductance without the necessity of increasing the
   inductor volume. The best discrete permeability value is investigated.
   Based on the best discrete permeability value, inductance as well as the
   inductance density trends is calculated by varying the number of
   permeability layers under the condition that thickness for each layer is
   constant. Also, the inductance variations versus the number of
   permeability layers are also obtained under the condition that the
   inductor thickness is constant. A three-permeability inductor and a
   single-permeability inductor are fabricated to evaluate the proposed
   method. The measured results show that the three-permeability inductor
   has a much higher inductance than the single-permeability inductor for
   the entire load range. Both inductors are tested in a 5-V input, 3-V
   output dc/dc converter to compare their performances. The results show
   that the three-permeability inductor can further improve the efficiency
   of high-frequency dc/dc converters.}},

Abstract = {{A selection of imines derived from phenyl t-butyl ketones and
   substituted 2-phenylethylamines or phenylalanine exhibit slow rotation
   around the aryl-imino bond at ambient temperature, resulting in a large
   non-equivalence of the ortho hydrogens in the H-1 NMR spectra. This
   facilitates assessment of aryl substituent effects on the face tilted-T
   CH-pi interaction between a phenyl ring (A) on the imino carbon
   proximate to the terminal phenyl ring (B). Analysis of the marked
   temperature dependence of the chemical shift of the interacting ortho
   hydrogen affords estimates of the opposing enthalpic and entropic
   factors involved in the rapid equilibrium between the closed
   edge-to-face conformation and alternative open conformations devoid of a
   CH-pi interaction while in solution. Above ca. 80 degrees C the entropy
   term (T Delta S) cancels out the enthalpy (Delta H) favouring the closed
   conformation and open conformations are preferred. Accordingly, commonly
   reported binding free energies may not be a good measure of the
   energetic strength of intramolecular aromatic interactions.
   Investigation of an ortho fluoro substituted compound indicates that a
   CF-pi interaction is at least 1.0 kcal mol(-1) weaker in enthalpy than
   the CH-pi interaction. Several X-ray crystal structures depicting an
   intramolecular edge-to-face interaction are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Activator regenerated by electron transfer atom-transfer radical
   polymerization of butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate was
   successfully adapted from a batch process to a continuous stirred tank
   reactor (CSTR) with 50 ppm copper. A series of batch polymerizations
   were first performed to identify a solvent mixture to enhance the
   polymerization rate, maintain chain livingness, and eliminate
   unsteady-state behavior caused by the precipitation of copper(II)
   complexes. The batch formulations were run in a CSTR with mean residence
   times of 60, 90, and 120 min, with steady-state behavior reached after
   four residence times. The apparent rate coefficient in the CSTR
   experiments was higher than that in batch polymerizations, likely
   because of a higher steady-state reducing agent concentration in the
   CSTR, which shifted the copper(I)/copper(II) ratio in favor of the
   activating species. Polymer chain extensions showed good living
   characteristics, demonstrating CSTRs as a viable platform for

Title = {{Physical activity and the rejuvenation of Connswater (PARC study):
   protocol for a natural experiment investigating the impact of urban
   regeneration on public health}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{AUG 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: There is a dearth of evidence regarding the impact of urban
   regeneration projects on public health, particularly the nature and
   degree to which urban regeneration impacts upon health-related behaviour
   change. Natural experiment methodology enables comprehensive large-scale
   evaluations of such interventions. The Connswater Community Greenway in
   Belfast is a major urban regeneration project involving the development
   of a 9 km linear park, including the provision of new cycle paths and
   walkways. In addition to the environmental improvements, this complex
   intervention involves a number of programmes to promote physical
   activity in the regenerated area. The project affords a unique
   opportunity to investigate the public health impact of urban
   regeneration.
   Methods/Design: The evaluation framework was informed by the
   socio-ecological model and guided by the RE-AIM Framework. Key
   components include: (1) a quasi-experimental before-and-after survey of
   the Greenway population (repeated cross-sectional design), in tandem
   with data from a parallel Northern Ireland-wide survey for comparison;
   (2) an assessment of changes in the local built environment and of
   walkability using geographic information systems; (3) semi-structured
   interviews with a purposive sample of survey respondents, and a range of
   community stakeholders, before and after the regeneration project; and
   (4) a cost-effectiveness analysis. The primary outcome is change in
   proportion of individuals identified as being regularly physically
   active, according to the current UK recommendations. The RE-AIM
   Framework will be used to make an overall assessment of the impact of
   the Greenway on the physical activity behaviour of local residents.
   Discussion: The Connswater Community Greenway provides a significant
   opportunity to achieve long-term, population level behaviour change. We
   argue that urban regeneration may be conceptualised meaningfully as a
   complex intervention comprising multiple components with the potential,
   individually and interactively, to affect the behaviour of a diverse
   population. The development and implementation of our comprehensive
   evaluation framework reflects this complexity and illuminates an
   approach to the empirical, rigorous evaluation of urban regeneration.
   More specifically, this study will add to the much needed evidence-base
   about the impact of urban regeneration on public health as well as
   having important implications for the development of natural experiment
   methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE)/multi-walled carbon nanotube
   (MWCNT) composites were prepared by melt compounding, following two
   different compatibilization strategies that involved non-covalent
   interactions between the matrix and the filler. The first approach
   involved grafting pyridine aromatic moieties on the maleated polyolefin
   backbone, which are able to interact by pi-pi stacking with the surface
   of the nanotubes. The second method implemented
   non-covalent/non-specific surface functionalization of the MWCNTs with a
   hyperbranched polyethylene (HBPE). The enhanced interfacial interactions
   established in the composites containing LLDPE functionalized with
   pyridine grafts improved the dispersion of the nanotubes within the
   polymer matrix. Dispersion was also favoured by higher matrix viscosity.
   Composites containing finely dispersed MWCNTs exhibited an increase in
   the rheological and electrical percolation thresholds, and a significant
   improvement in mechanical properties. On the contrary the composites
   based on the low viscosity matrix contained large amounts of aggregates,
   which promoted lower percolation thresholds. Manipulation of matrix
   viscosity and compatibilization resulted in composites with good
   mechanical properties, and low percolation thresholds. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{The biotransformation of indene to the pharmaceutical intermediate,
   1,2-indandiol, by Pseudomonas putida 421-5 (ATCC 55687) produces large
   amounts of the inhibitory by-product, 1-indenol, as well as several
   different minor degradation products. Three segmented block copolymers,
   Hytrel (R) 8206, Hytrel (R) 3078, and Pebax (R) 2533, containing varying
   types and amounts of soft segment components, exhibited different
   affinity toward the product and by-product. The polymers were each used
   as the sequestering phase for metabolite removal from this
   transformation in a two-phase partitioning bioreactor (TPPB). The
   polymer with the highest affinity for each metabolite enhanced its
   production via more extensive partitioning into the polymer phase. This
   work reports the first use of polymers whose differing compositions are
   attributed to target molecule affinity and the different production
   profiles seen during two-phase biocatalysis. The uniquely high water
   content of 30 wt\% in Hytrel (R) 8206 emphasized the importance of
   accounting for water uptake in partition calculations, and potentially
   conferred enhanced affinity and diffusivity by providing an expanded
   polymer network, significantly improving biotransformation completion
   time compared to the low-water-absorbing polymers. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   pressures up to 20 MPa for ultrapure samples using a state-of-the-art

   based on experimental volumetric data. The experimental data reported in
   this work are in good agreement with available literature isotherms.
   Soave-Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson equations of state coupled with

Abstract = {{Finding new uses for waste or discarded material is an important
   environmental goal; being able to use a waste material to treat another
   waste is an even more attractive objective, and this was the purpose of
   the present work. We previously showed that used automobile tires have
   an affinity for a toxic contaminant, dichlorophenol (DCP), absorbing and
   releasing it based on concentration driving forces. Here we have
   exploited this phenomenon by using used tires as the sequestering phase
   in a Two-Phase Partitioning Bioreactor (TPPB) to treat otherwise-toxic
   levels of DCP, far out-performing single phase operation in a sequencing
   batch bioreactor. A comprehensive examination of substrate loading,
   reactor exchange ratio, and tire fraction used, demonstrated that the
   tire-TPPB system could handle a 40\% higher influent substrate loading
   and an increase of the exchange ratio value from 0.5 (prohibitive for
   single phase operation) to 0.7. Such improvement was obtained with a
   tire fraction <= 9\%, comparable to that for commercial polymers
   previously employed in TPPBs. This study has opened the door to the
   identification of other waste plastics suitable for use in TPPBs for the
   treatment of recalcitrant organic contaminants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The study of lattice strain evolution during uniaxial deformation via in
   situ neutron diffraction is a well established technique for
   characterizing the deformation behavior of metals. However, the
   relatively low flux of neutron facilities results in count times on the
   order of several minutes, requiring experimenters to choose between
   either applying a very slow strain rate, or loading the sample
   incrementally rather than continuously. Here we investigate the effects
   on lattice strain data obtained by using stress, strain, and position
   controlled incremental loading, as well as continuous loading, on
   samples of Zircaloy-2 under uniaxial compression. It was found that both
   qualitative and quantitative differences arise in the lattice strain
   behavior of certain grain families, particularly (10 (1) over bar0\} and
   \{11 (2) over bar0\}, while other grain families show no discernible
   effect The differences in lattice strain evolution brought on by the
   variation in loading modes are believed to be the result of thermally
   activated dislocation motion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A scenario-based two-stage stochastic programming model for gas
   production network planning under uncertainty is usually a large-scale
   nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programme (MINLP), which can be
   efficiently solved to global optimality with nonconvex generalized
   Benders decomposition (NGBD). This paper is concerned with the
   parallelization of NGBD to exploit multiple available computing
   resources. Three parallelization strategies are proposed, namely, naive
   scenario parallelization, adaptive scenario parallelization, and
   adaptive scenario and bounding parallelization. Case study of two
   industrial natural gas production network planning problems shows that,
   while the NGBD without parallelization is already faster than a
   state-of-the-art global optimization solver by an order of magnitude,
   the parallelization can improve the efficiency by several times on
   computers with multicore processors. The adaptive scenario and bounding
   parallelization achieves the best overall performance among the three
   proposed parallelization strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Raman spectra in the range of the totally symmetric stretching mode of
   the {[}PF6](-) anion, nu(s)(PF6), have been measured for
   1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ionic liquids {[}C(n)C(1)im]{[}PF6], for n =
   4, 6, and 8, as a function of pressure at room temperature. The ionic
   liquids {[}C(6)C(1)im]{[}PF6] and {[}C(8)C(1)im]{[}PF6] remain in an
   amorphous phase up to 3.5 GPa, in contrast to {[}C(4)C(1)im]{[}PF6],
   which crystallizes above similar to 0.5 GPa. Equations of state based
   either on a group contribution model or Carnahan-Starling-van der Waals
   model have been used to estimate the densities of the ionic liquids at
   high pressures. The shifts of the vibrational frequency of nu(s)(PF6)
   with density observed in {[}C(6)C(1)im]{[}PF6] and in
   {[}C(8)C(1)im]{[}PF6] have been calculated by a hard-sphere model of a
   pseudo-diatomic solute under short-range repulsive interactions with the
   neighboring particles. The stochastic model of Kubo for vibrational
   dephasing has been used to obtain the amplitude of vibrational frequency
   fluctuation, <Delta omega(2)>, and the relaxation time of frequency
   fluctuation, tau(c), as a function of density by Raman band shape
   analysis of the nu(s)(PF6) mode of {[}C(6)C(1)im]{[}PF6] and

Abstract = {{A service-oriented application is composed of multiple Web services to
   fulfill complex functionality that cannot be provided by individual Web
   service. The combination of services is not random. In many cases, a set
   of services are repetitively used together in various applications. We
   treat such a set of services as a service composition pattern. The
   quality of the patterns is desirable because of the extensive uses and
   testing in the large number of applications. Therefore, the service
   composition patterns record the best practices in designing and
   developing reliable service-oriented applications. The execution log
   tracks the execution of services in a service-oriented application. To
   document the service composition patterns, we propose an approach that
   automatically identifies service composition patterns from various
   applications using execution logs. We locate a set of associated
   services using Apriori algorithm and recover the control flows among the
   services by analyzing the order of service invocation events in the
   execution logs. We also identify structurally and functionally similar
   patterns to represent such patterns in a higher level of abstraction
   regardless of the actual services. A case study shows that our approach
   can effectively detect service composition patterns. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Renewable energy generation is expected to continue to increase globally
   due to renewable energy targets and obligations to reduce greenhouse gas

   non-dispatchable renewable energy generation with load demands. Energy
   storage technologies can play different roles in each of the step of the
   electric power supply chain. Moreover, large scale energy storage
   systems can act as renewable energy integrators by smoothing the
   variability. Compressed air energy storage is one such technology. This

   insight into large-scale/long-term solute transport in both Cretaceous
   sediments and the basin. Despite the potential for significant advective
   migration during glaciations, molecular diffusion appears to be the
   dominant solute transport mechanism through the aquitard. Simulations
   suggest average vertical groundwater velocities of <0.05 m/10 ka and an
   average excess hydraulic head of <10 m; these values are much less than
   anticipated by successive glaciations. The dominant paleoevent reflected
   in present-day profiles is introduction during the Pleistocene of
   glaciogenic meteoric water to the aquifer underlying the shale, likely
   along an aquifer outcrop area east of the site or through local vertical
   conduits. Simulations suggest these recharge events occurred during one
   or more glacial periods. The isotopic profile over the upper 25 m of
   Pleistocene till and shale is consistent with glacial deposition and
   transport processes within these units over the Holocene (past 10 ka).}},

Abstract = {{This study developed a new process for synthesis of glycerol carbonate
   via glycerolysis of urea by reactive distillation. Missing thermodynamic
   parameters were estimated by various group contribution methods. The
   results of Gibbs free energy showed that Gani's method provided the
   lowest deviation. Equilibrium and kinetic model parameters of the
   glycerolysis obtained from batch experiments were employed for the
   simulation of the reactive distillation using Aspen Plus (R) software.
   High conversion of glycerol was achieved by reducing reactant loss in
   distillate through an increase in the number of stripping and reaction
   stages and a decrease in the number of rectifying stages. Moreover,
   glycerol and urea in distillate were recycled to the reactive section by
   increasing reflux ratio to a reasonable value. The suitable design and
   operating parameters were achieved at 3 stripping stages, 3 reactive
   stages, no rectifying stage, reboiler heat duty of 15 kW and reflux
   ratio of 2. This offered 93.6\% conversion of glycerol, and 90.0\% yield
   of glycerol carbonate with 100\% purity in the final product. Compared
   with conventional in vacua process, reactive distillation promoted
   glycerol conversion by 29.1\% and saved in energy consumption by 37.1\%.

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine the marriage of Fountain coding and network
   coding (NC). Fountain codes are capacity achieving erasure codes
   designed for point-to-point transmissions. NC is a throughput-optimal
   data dissemination technique, but its high-complexity decoding makes it
   unattractive for applications where limited resources are available. In
   this paper, we consider Fountain network coding to take advantage of
   efficient fountain decoders. Protocols such as Soliton-like rateless
   coding (SLRC) have previously addressed this issue, yet the re-encoding
   at the relay is expensive while there is still room for improving the
   performance. Extending SLRC, we propose the Improved Soliton-like
   Rateless Coding (ISLRC) protocol, where the relay is designed to perform
   distribution shaping given limited resources. ISLRC preserves the same
   properties as SLRC, but also makes the aggregate degree distribution
   more efficient for Fountain decoding. We analyze ISLRC's degree
   distribution and perform an asymptotic error analysis for the case where
   resources are most scarce. The ISLRC scheme is compared against other
   existing schemes. Simulation results show that even under the worst-case
   scenario of ISLRC, better performance can be achieved compared to SLRC
   and other existing schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing and quantifying vertical exchange processes is essential
   for understanding physical and biological dynamics in stratified lakes
   and oceans. Unfortunately, the role of mixing is still poorly understood
   because of the challenges of conducting field research on small-scale
   turbulence, especially in the vicinity of a thermocline. This study
   presents a new moored sensor platform that was designed to investigate
   small-scale turbulence structures in time and space. The objective is to
   determine all terms of the turbulent energy equation separately and
   simultaneously. The platform is equipped with a microstructure package
   for measuring shear, temperature, and temperature gradients, as well as
   with a vertical array of high-precision thermistor probes and acoustic
   Doppler velocimeters. The platform can be moved vertically in the water
   column using a bottom-resting winch that is connected to a shore station
   by a 1800-m-long communication cable. This cable allows real-time data
   access and control of the winch, and thus optimization of the
   measurement strategy. A field study in Lake Geneva, located between
   Switzerland and France, shows that this system is ideally suited for the
   analysis of the dynamics of baroclinic motions, such as internal Kelvin
   waves. First results indicate a clear relationship between low
   Richardson number and elevated dissipation, and suggest a mean flux
   Richardson number R-f = 0.14 +/- 0.4. However, this measurement campaign
   was not as conclusive for the reason of the variability of R-f.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we describe a method for computer-assisted distal
   radius osteotomies in which computer-generated, patient-specific plastic
   guides are used for intraoperative guidance. Before surgery, the
   correction and plate location are planned using computed tomography
   scans for both radii and ulnae, and the planned locations of the distal
   and proximal drill holes for the plate are saved. A plastic,
   patient-specific instrument guide is created using a rapid prototyping
   machine into which a mirror image of intraoperative, accessible bone
   structure of the distal radius is integrated. This allows for unique
   positioning of the guide during surgery. For each planned drill
   location, a guidance hole is incorporated into the guide. During
   surgery, a conventional incision is made, and the guide is positioned on
   the radius. The surgeon drills the holes for the plate screws into the
   intact radius and performs the osteotomy using the conventional
   technique. Using the predrilled holes, the surgeon affixes the plate to
   the radius fragments. The guides are easy to integrate into the surgical
   workflow and minimize the need for intraoperative fluoroscopy for
   guidance of the procedure. Copyright (C) 2013 by the American Society

Abstract = {{A significant number of proteins in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes are
   known to be post-translationally modified by the addition of phosphate,
   serving as a means of rapidly regulating protein function.
   Phosphorylation of the amino acids serine, threonine and tyrosine are
   the focus of the vast majority of studies aimed at elucidating the
   extent and roles of such modification, yet other amino acids, including
   histidine and aspartate, are also phosphorylated. Although histidine
   phosphorylation is known to play extensive roles in signalling in
   eukaryotes, plants and fungi, roles for phosphohistidine are poorly
   defined in higher eukaryotes. Characterization of histidine
   phosphorylation aimed at elucidating such information is problematic due
   to the acid-labile nature of the phosphoramidate bond, essential for
   many of its biological functions. Although MS-based strategies have
   proven extremely useful in the analysis of other types of phosphorylated
   peptides, the chromatographic procedures essential for such approaches
   promote rapid hydrolysis of phosphohistidine-containing peptides.

Abstract = {{This study aims to unravel the spatial and temporal distribution of
   diagenetic alterations of the Mheiherrat Member, the Rudeis Formation
   (lower Miocene) of the Gulf of Suez rift, Egypt within depositional
   fades and sequence stratigraphy. The Mheiherrat member is represented by
   shoreface calcarenites and hybrid arenites (transgressive and highstand
   systems tracts; TST and HST; respectively) and deltaic rudites and
   coarse-grained calcarenites and hybrid arenites (lowstand systems
   tracts; LST). Petrographic, stable O- and C-isotopes, mineral chemical
   and geochemical analyses have revealed that the arenites are pervasively
   cemented by eogenetic carbonates and, to small extent, by zeolite and
   pyrite as well as by telogenetic palygorskite. The shoreface TST and HST
   calcarenites and hybrid arenites were dominantly cemented by
   microcrystalline grain-rimming and inter- and intragranular pore-filling
   calcite (delta O-13(V-PDB) = -3.6 parts per thousand to -0.3 parts per
   thousand and delta C-13(V-PDB) = -2.3 parts per thousand to -0.7 parts
   per thousand) and rhombic dolomite (delta C-13(V-PDB) = -3.9 parts per
   thousand to +0.9 parts per thousand and delta C-13(V-PDB) = -2.5 parts
   per thousand to -0.7 parts per thousand). These cements are interpreted
   to be formed by marine to brackish waters with delta O-13(V-SMOW) -1.2
   parts per thousand to +3.2 parts per thousand, at temperature of 20-55
   degrees C. The deltaic LST coarse-grained calcarenites and hybrid
   arenites were dominantly cemented by coarse-crystalline, inter- and
   intragranular pore-filling calcite (delta O-13(V-PDB) -4.4 parts per
   thousand to -2.3\% and delta C-13(V-PDB) = -2.8 parts per thousand. to
   -1.3 parts per thousand.), which are interpreted to have precipitated
   from pore waters with delta O-13(V-SWOM) +3.5 parts per thousand. to
   +5.5 parts per thousand, at temperatures of greater than 55 degrees C.
   Such pervasive cementation by carbonates is attributed to the occurrence
   of abundant intrabasinal carbonate grains. The carbonate cement texture
   is suggested to be controlled by changes in pore-water chemistry owing
   to transgression and regression events. This case study revealed that
   better understanding of factors controlling the extent and textural
   habits of carbonate cements can be achieved when it is linked with
   depositional facies and sequence stratigraphy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{The 617 MHz-lambda 850 mu m correlation (cosmic rays and cold dust) in
   NGC 3044 and NGC 4157}},
Journal = {{MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We present the first maps of NGC 3044 and NGC 4157 at lambda 450 mu m
   and lambda 850 mu m from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as well as
   the first maps at 617 MHz from the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope.
   High-latitude emission has been detected in both the radio continuum and
   sub-mm for NGC 3044 and in the radio continuum for NGC 4157, including
   several new features. For NGC 3044, in addition, we find 617 MHz
   emission extending to the north of the major axis, beginning at the far
   ends of the major axis. One of these low-intensity features, more than
   10 kpc from the major axis, has apparently associated emission at. 20 cm
   and may be a result of in-disc activity related to star formation.
   The dust spectrum at long wavelengths required fitting with a
   two-temperature model for both galaxies, implying the presence of cold
   dust (T-c = 9.5 K for NGC 3044 and T-c = 15.3 K for NGC 4157). Dust
   masses are M-d = 1.6 x 10(8) M-circle dot and M-d = 2.1 x 10(7) M-circle
   dot for NGC 3044 and NGC 4157, respectively, and are dominated by the
   cold component.
   There is a clear correlation between the 617 MHz and. 850 mu m emission
   in the two galaxies. In the case of NGC 3044 for which the lambda 850 mu
   m data are strongly dominated by cold dust, this implies a relation
   between the non-thermal synchrotron emission and cold dust. The 617 MHz
   component represents an integration of massive star formation over the
   past 10(7-8) yr and the lambda 850 mu m emission represents heating from
   the diffuse interstellar radiation field (ISRF).
   The 617 MHz-lambda 850 mu m correlation improves when a smoothing kernel
   is applied to the lambda 850 mu m data to account for differences
   between the cosmic ray (CR) electron diffusion scale and the mean free
   path of an ISRF photon to dust. The best-fitting relation is L-617MHz
   proportional to L-850 mu m(2.1) (+/-) (0.2) for NGC 3044. If variations
   in the cold dust emissivity are dominated by variations in dust density,
   and the synchrotron emission depends on magnetic field strength (a
   function of gas density) as well as CR electron generation (a function
   of massive star formation rate and therefore density via the Schmidt
   law) then the expected correlation for NGC 3044 is L-617MHz proportional
   to L-850 mu m(2.2), in agreement with the observed correlation.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to validate a commercially available inertial sensor
   based motion capture system, Xsens MVN BIOMECH using its native

   measurement of joint angular kinematics. Performance was evaluated by
   comparing waveform similarity using range of motion, mean error and a
   new formulation of the coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC). Three
   dimensional joint angles of the lower limbs were determined for ten
   healthy subjects while they performed three daily activities: level
   walking, stair ascent, and stair descent. Under all three walking
   conditions, the Xsens system most accurately determined the
   flexion/extension joint angle (CMC > 0.96) for all joints. The joint
   angle measurements associated with the other two joint axes had lower
   correlation including complex CMC values. The poor correlation in the
   other two joint axes is most likely due to differences in the anatomical
   frame definition of limb segments used by the Xsens and Optotrak
   systems. Implementation of a protocol to align these two systems is
   necessary when comparing joint angle waveforms measured by the Xsens and
   other motion capture systems.}},

Abstract = {{The numerical investigations of buoyancy-driven natural ventilation and
   thermal comfort evaluation in a simple three-storey atrium building as a
   part of the passive ventilation strategy was undertaken using a
   validated Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model. The Reynolds Averaged
   Navier-Stokes (RANS) modeling approach with the SST-k-omega turbulence
   model and the discrete transfer radiation model (DTRM) was used for the
   numerical investigations. The steady-state governing equations were
   solved using a commercial solver FLUENT (c). Various flow situations of
   the buoyancy-driven natural ventilation in the building during day and
   night time were examined. The numerical results obtained for the airflow
   rates, airflow patterns and temperature distributions inside the
   building are presented in this paper.
   Using the numerical results, the well-known thermal comfort indices PMV
   (predicted mean vote) and PPD (predicted percentage of dissatisfied)
   were calculated for the evaluation of the thermal comfort conditions in
   the occupied regions of the building. It was noticed that thermal
   conditions prevailing in the occupied areas of the building as a result
   of using the buoyancy-driven ventilation were mostly in comfort zone.
   From the study of the night time ventilation, it was found that hot
   water (80 degrees C) circulation (heated by solar collectors during
   daytime) along the chimney walls during night time and heat sources
   present in the building can be useful in inducing night ventilation
   airflows in the building as a part of the passive ventilation strategy.

Abstract = {{Fibre-reinforced self-consolidating concrete (FRSCC) combines the
   advantages of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) and fibre-reinforced
   concrete (FRC). In this study, 18 concrete mixtures were developed by
   incorporating different volumes of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and metallic
   fibres to a maximum of 0.3\% by volume. Fresh, mechanical and durability
   (in terms of chloride penetration resistance) properties of all FRSCC
   mixtures were evaluated. The influence of fibre type/size/dosage and
   combination (used in hybrid mixes) on fresh properties (slump flow,
   L-box passing ability, V-funnel flow time and segregation index) and
   hardened properties (fracture energy and compressive/flexural/splitting
   tensile strength) were critically analyzed to study the performance of
   the FRSCC mixtures. The fibres metallic ones in particular were more
   effective in increasing the fracture energy of FRSCC than in increasing
   its compressive/splitting tensile/flexural strength. A substantial
   fracture energy gain of about 507\% was observed compared to a 10\%
   increase in compressive strength, a 39\% gain in splitting tensile
   strength and a 124\% increase in flexural strength. The improved
   strength and fracture energy of such FRSCC mixtures can significantly
   reduce the amount of tensile reinforcement required and substantially
   increase the energy-absorbing capacity of concrete structures. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This review summarizes research conducted on concrete containing
   recycled materials after exposure to fire. Discarded products consist of
   brick and concrete demolition from the construction and building
   industries, in addition to supplementary cementing materials from
   industrial waste such as fly ash, blast furnace slag, silica fume and
   biomass/volcanic ashes. To understand the effects with and without
   aggregates, researchers have conducted a variety of tests on cement
   pastes, cement mortars, and concrete. Three heating and loading
   conditions have been used by researchers in this area: preloaded and
   tested hot, unloaded and tested hot, and unloaded and tested at room
   temperature. Of the many possible material property measurements, the
   most common was the compression strength and is reported here. The
   literature suggests a great deal of work is needed in this area to
   understand the performance in fire of structures constructed with
   sustainable concretes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the strengthening of T-joints of rectangular hollow
   steel section (HSS) chords against web buckling induced by transverse
   compression loading of welded brace members. Twelve T-joints of 1,200mm
   long, (or 5.92) mm HSS chords, welded to 400mm long, , HSS braces were
   tested under brace axial compression. Glass fiber reinforced polymer
   (GFRP) plates, 9.4mm thick, of different configurations, with and
   without edge tapering, and 2mm thick high-modulus carbon-FRP plates of
   equivalent stiffness, were adhesively bonded to the webs of the chord
   near the brace. Strength gain increases significantly, from 9-38\%, as
   the web height-to-thickness () ratio of the HSS chord increases from 34
   to 65. In thin-walled HSS (), retrofitting provided significant gains in
   strength but not in ductility. Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) plates
   delayed and shifted local buckling away from brace location but did not
   prevent it. Square-edged and tapered plates behaved similarly. Plates as
   small as half the chord depth and of width equal to the brace provided a
   35\% strength gain. Very wide plates, 0.4 of the span, provided a 53\%
   gain. In thick-walled HSS (), retrofitting provided little strength gain
   but enhanced ductility, especially with properly bonded plates extending
   on the brace. Generally, plates fractured under local bending or
   delaminated within plate layers while the bond was fully intact.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model is used to estimate the service life and clogging of
   gravel leachate drainage layers with a filter separator layer, such as
   those used in municipal solid waste landfills. A filter separator layer
   between the waste and the drainage layer is shown to reduce the leachate
   strength entering the gravel drainage layer and to extend the time that
   it takes to clog the drainage layer to the point when the leachate level
   exceeds the maximum design value (the service life). The filter layer is
   shown to have a far more significant effect in extending the service
   life when pea gravel () is used in the drainage layer, and less effect
   when coarse gravel () is used in the cases examined, although most of
   the benefit of a filter separator layer was achieved by using a
   3-mm-thick needle-punched nonwoven geotextile. This geotextile may be
   sufficient for many practical purposes that are similar to those
   examined. The results from modeling leachate collection systems with
   filter separator layers subjected to both constant and variable leachate
   strength show that the characteristics of the leachate entering the
   drainage layer can substantially affect the service life of the drainage
   layer, and that high-strength leachate entering the systems for a
   limited time early in the life (acid phase) of a landfill can greatly
   reduce the service life of the leachate drainage layer.}},

Abstract = {{Mapping combined with structural analyses in the foreland edge of the
   metamorphic core of the Himalayas in SW Nepal highlights the existence
   of two north-dipping shear zones with opposite sense of shear. Here, the
   metamorphic core is mainly affected by non-coaxial top-to-the-south
   sense of shear at temperatures between 450 degrees C and 550 degrees C
   that switch to a top-to-the-north sense of shear at the top of the
   metamorphic core. We regionally correlate this upper shear zone with the
   South Tibetan detachment system. Ar-dating on white mica indicates that
   both shear zones operated between 23 Ma and 17 Ma. Restoration of the
   folded South Tibetan detachment in far western Nepal yields a minimum
   dip-slip distance of 190 km, compatible with predictions made by models
   of extrusion of a weak mid-crustal channel. Our results support an
   orogenic model in which channel flow in the hinterland coexisted with
   thrust wedge mechanics in the foreland.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a multi-objective optimization approach for
   incorporating the conditional probability of fire flow failure into the
   design of branched water networks. To this end, a new analytical
   probabilistic model was developed to quantify the conditional
   probability of fire flow failure in branched networks and incorporated
   into the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The
   optimization sought to minimize capital cost through pipe diameter and
   pump selection and to minimize the conditional probability of fire flow
   failure. The NSGA-II was applied to two branched networks to generate
   Pareto-optimal solutions. Results indicated a strategic allocation of
   pipe and pump capacity with limited fiscal resources and with a
   reduction in uncertainty of fire flow failure. Interestingly,
   optimization results for a real branched network supported the industry
   practice of using a minimum 150 mm distribution main sizing to provide
   fire flow protection.}},

Abstract = {{Medical geology research has recognised a number of potentially toxic
   elements (PTEs), such as arsenic, cobalt, chromium, copper, nickel,
   lead, vanadium, uranium and zinc, known to influence human disease by
   their respective deficiency or toxicity. As the impact of infectious
   diseases has decreased and the population ages, so cancer has become the
   most common cause of death in developed countries including Northern
   Ireland. This research explores the relationship between environmental
   exposure to potentially toxic elements in soil and cancer disease data
   across Northern Ireland. The incidences of twelve different cancer types
   (lung, stomach, leukaemia, oesophagus, colorectal, bladder, kidney,
   breast, mesothelioma, melanoma and non melanoma (NM) skin cancer both
   basal and squamous) were examined in the form of twenty-five coded
   datasets comprising aggregates over the 12 year period from 1993 to
   2006. A local modelling technique, geographically weighted regression
   (GWR) is used to explore the relationship between environmental exposure
   and cancer disease data. The results show comparisons of the
   geographical incidence of certain cancers (stomach and NM squamous skin
   cancer) in relation to concentrations of certain PTEs (arsenic levels in
   soils and radon were identified). Findings from the research have
   implications for regional human health risk assessments. c (C) 2014 The

   designed for this purpose using a standard Si-TRIP steel composition.
   Detailed characterisation revealed that the microstructures represented
   a wide range of size, shape and surrounding phase for the retained
   austenite. Deduction of the evolution of the microstructures during
   processing completed the understanding of the microstructural
   differences for the four cases. The results of tensile tests showed that
   the microstructures had a corresponding wide range of mechanical
   properties, where YS and UTS inversely correlated with the scale of the
   features of the surrounding phase. In three of the microstructures the
   incremental work hardening exponent reached a constant, which is
   characteristic of the TRIP effect, the value of which increased with
   larger, more equiaxed martensite/austenite features and with lower
   carbon concentration in the retained austenite. These same three
   microstructures had high values of strength x ductility indicating a
   useful TRIP effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The current study monitors both the short- and long-term hydration
   characteristics of concrete using discretized conductivity measurements
   from initial gauging, through setting and hardening, the latter
   comprising both the curing and post-curing periods. In particular,
   attention is directed to the near-surface concrete as it is this zone
   which protects the steel from the external environment and has a major
   influence on durability, performance and service-life. A wide range of
   concrete mixes is studied comprising both plain Portland cement
   concretes and concretes containing fly-ash and ground granulated blast
   furnace slag. The parameter normalised conductivity was used to identify
   four distinct stages in the hydration process and highlight the
   influence of supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) on hydration and
   hydration kinetics. A relationship has been presented to account for the
   temporal decrease in conductivity, post 10-days hydration. The testing
   procedure and methodology presented lend itself to in-situ monitoring of

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with hydrogen absorption and desorption in
   AB(5)-type hydrogen storage metal alloys. We give a brief overview on
   models which have been proposed for hydrogen sorption in metals over the
   past decades: We choose three models based on different perspectives,
   i.e. thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, and mere observation
   (empiricism), and evaluate their applicability in order to describe the
   sorption behaviour. Additionally, we propose a model which is based on a
   cumulative distribution function. In order to evaluate the models, the
   hydrogen absorption and desorption isotherms of LaNi5 and LaNi4.5Co0.5
   are measured by means of a gravimetric technique. A nonlinear regression
   is performed to fit the models to experimental data. The computed model
   parameters are compared to values reported in the literature. The
   emphasis is given to the applicability of the models with respect to
   describing the non-ideality of the plateau region and the
   continuity/smoothness of phase transition regions. Copyright (C) 2013,

   The particles within these reflective, metal-like liquid films (MeLLFs)
   are optically coupled and give strong SERS enhancement, similar to that
   obtained for the same colloid aggregated with optimized concentration of
   metal salt. However, unlike aggregated colloids their structure means
   they do not sediment out of solution so they give SERS spectra that are
   stable for >20 h) and have good uniformity (relative standard deviation
   in absolute intensity over 1 mm(2) array of 25 points was 1.1\%). Since
   the films lie at the aqueous/organic interface they are open to
   adsorption of analytes from either of the phases and can be probed in
   situ to detect both water- and nonwater-soluble analytes. The detection

Abstract = {{GHMP kinases are a group of structurally related small molecule kinases.
   They have been found in all kingdoms of life and are mostly responsible
   for catalyzing the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of intermediary
   metabolites. Although the GHMP kinases are of clinical, pharmaceutical,
   and biotechnological importance, the mechanism of GHMP kinases is
   controversial. A catalytic base mechanism was suggested for mevalonate
   kinase that has a structural feature of the gamma-phosphate of ATP close
   to an aspartate residue; however, for one GHMP family member, homoserine
   kinase, where the residue acting as general base is absent, a direct
   phosphorylation mechanism was suggested. Furthermore, it was proposed by
   some authors that all the GHMP kinases function by a similar mechanism.
   This controversy in mechanism has limited our ability to exploit these
   enzymes as drug targets and in biotechnology. Here the phosphorylation
   reaction mechanism of the human galactokinase, a member of the GHMP
   kinase family, was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and
   density functional theory-based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics
   calculations (B3LYP-D/AMBER99). The reaction coordinates were localized
   by potential energy scan using an adiabatic mapping method. Our results
   indicate that a highly conserved Glu174 captures Arg105 in the proximity
   of the alpha-phosphate of ATP, forming a H-bond network; therefore, the
   mobility of ATP in the large oxyanion hole is restricted. Arg228
   functions to stabilize the negative charge developed at the
   beta,gamma-bridging oxygen of the ATP during bond cleavage. The reaction
   occurs via a direct phosphorylation mechanism, and the Asp 186 in the
   proximity of ATP does not directly participate in the reaction pathway.
   Because Arg228 is not conserved among GHMP kinases, reagents which form
   interactions with Arg228, and therefore can interrupt its function in
   phosphorylation, may be developed into potential selective inhibitors
   for galactokinase.}},

Title = {{Removal of arsenic from groundwater by adsorption onto an acidified

Abstract = {{A low cost by-product material namely Sulphuric acid Acidified Laterite
   (ALS), generated during the production of Ferric Aluminium Sulphate
   (FAS) by acid leaching treatment, was employed as an adsorbent for the
   removal of arsenic from aqueous solution. In addition raw laterite was
   used for comparison purposes in the arsenic adsorption experiments. The
   raw and Acidified Laterite were chemically and physically characterised
   (elemental analysis, surface chemistry, pore texture parameters, PZC,
   and SEM observation). Arsenic adsorption batch and kinetics experiments
   were undertaken, and process parameters such as; pH, dose, particle
   size, and initial arsenic concentration were investigated. Adsorption
   isotherm and kinetics data were modelled using the pseudo first and
   pseudo second order kinetic models. The maximum loading capacities of
   raw laterite for arsenite and arsenate ions were 127.8 mu g g(-1) and
   301.2 mu g g(-1), respectively. By contrast, the maximum loading
   capacities of Acidified Laterite for arsenite and arsenate ions are
   171.7 mu g g(-1) and 923.6 mu g g(-1), respectively. It was found that
   the higher surface area and presence of residual sulphate surface groups
   on the ALS explained the increase in the adsorption capacities. Overall
   the results indicated that the laterite adsorbents proved to be
   effective materials for the treatment of arsenic-bearing aqueous
   solutions. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Liquid marble granulation using super-hydrophobic powders}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{228}},
Pages = {{984-992}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{This work analyses the forces involved in liquid marble formation,
   primarily the surface energy of the powder on the liquid surface and the
   powder gravitational force, which we have shown to oppose liquid marble
   formation. In order to investigate these phenomena, hydrophobic powders
   possessing both high density and high contact angle need to be employed.
   For this purpose, superhydrophobic (SH) particles based on a copper
   substrate were prepared by a silver deposition technique of particle
   sizes 9, 20, 320 and 400 mu m having a contact angle with water
   approaching 160 degrees. Liquid marbles formed using the SH copper
   substrate were compared with polymer powder (e.g., PMMA) based liquid
   marbles. Initially, the effective surface tension of the liquid marbles
   was determined using the maximal height methodology, which indicated
   that effective surface tension was a function of powder particle size.
   It is probable that the phenomena of heavy particles give rise to lower
   effective surface tension, is caused by the weight of the particles
   reducing the puddle height. Moreover, it was found that in cases with
   large dense SH powder particles, liquid marble formation was not
   possible, as the additional weight of the larger particles, lowered the
   ``puddle{''} to an extent that marble became unstable and collapsed.
   Therefore, an analysis of the energies associated with the powder
   particles was undertaken to quantify the physical characteristics of
   powders that form liquid marbles under: (i) static and (ii) dynamic
   conditions. In addition, we have correlated this data using a regime map
   analysis in which we have plotted a surface energy versus a
   gravitational energy to provide operating regions within the regime map
   of potential liquid marble formation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{One-dimensional crystals have long range translational invariance which

   diffusion lengths, on the order of the SWCNT length (1.3-4.7 mu m), in
   sharp contrast to encapsulated samples. For these pristine samples, our
   model reveals intrinsic lifetimes (350-750 ps), diffusion constants

Abstract = {{Herein we present a study on the physical/chemical properties of a new
   Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES) based on N-methylacetamide (MAc) and lithium
   bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide (LiTFSI). Due to its interesting
   properties, such as wide liquid-phase range from -60 degrees C to 280
   degrees C, low vapor pressure, and high ionic conductivity up to 28.4 mS
   cm(-1) at 150 degrees C and at x(LiTFSI) = 1/4, this solution can be
   practically used as electrolyte for electrochemical storage systems such
   as electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and/or lithium ion batteries
   (LiBs). Firstly, relationships between its transport properties
   (conductivity and viscosity) as a function of composition and
   temperature were discussed through Arrhenius' Law and
   Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) equations, as well as by using the Walden
   classification. From this investigation, it appears that this complex
   electrolyte possesses a number of excellent transport properties, like a
   superionic character for example. Based on which, we then evaluated its
   electrochemical performances as electrolyte for EDLCs and LiBs
   applications by using activated carbon (AC) and lithium iron phosphate
   (LiFePO4) electrodes, respectively. These results demonstrate that this
   electrolyte has a good compatibility with both electrodes (AC and
   LiFePO4) in each testing cell driven also by excellent electrochemical
   properties in specific capacitance, rate and cycling performances,
   indicating that the LiTFSI/MAc DES can be a promising electrolyte for
   EDLCs and LiBs applications especially for those requiring high safety
   and stability. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Co3O4, Fe2O3 and a mixture of the two oxides Co-Fe (molar ratio of
   Co3O4/Fe2O3 = 0.67 and atomic ratio of Co/Fe = 1) were prepared by the
   calcination of cobalt oxalate and/or iron oxalate salts at 500 degrees C
   for 2 h in static air using water as a solvent/dispersing agent. The
   catalysts were studied in the steam reforming of ethanol to investigate
   the effect of the partial substitution of Co3O4 with Fe2O3 on the
   catalytic behaviour. The reforming activity over Fe2O3, while initially
   high, underwent fast deactivation. In comparison, over the Co-Fe
   catalyst both the H-2 yield and stability were higher than that found
   over the pure Co3O4 or Fe2O3 catalysts. DRIFTS-MS studies under the
   reaction feed highlighted that the Co Fe catalyst had increased amounts
   of adsorbed OH/water; similar to Fe2O3. Increasing the amount of
   reactive species (water/OH species) adsorbed on the Co-Fe catalyst
   surface is proposed to facilitate the steam reforming reaction rather
   than decomposition reactions reducing by-product formation and providing
   a higher H-2 yield. Copyright (C) 2013, The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{In this paper we analyze the possibility of persistent currents of a
   two-species bosonic mixture in the one-dimensional ring geometry. We
   extend the arguments used by F. Bloch {[}Phys. Rev. A 7, 2187 (1973)] to
   obtain a criterion for the stability of persistent currents for the
   two-species system. If the mass ratio of the two species is a rational
   number, persistent currents can be stable at multiples of a certain
   total angular momenta. We show that the Bloch criterion can also be
   viewed as a Landau criterion involving the elementary excitations of the
   system. Our analysis reveals that persistent currents at higher angular
   momenta are more stable for the two-species system than previously
   thought.}},

Abstract = {{The use of hybrid materials including carbon fiber reinforced plastics
   (CFRPs) and lightweight metals such as titanium are increasing
   particularly in aerospace applications. Multi-material stacks require a
   number of holes for the assembly purposes. In this research, drilling
   trials have been carried out in CFRP, Ti-6Al-4V and CFRP/Ti-6Al-4V stack
   workpieces using AlTiN coated tungsten carbide drill bit. The effects of
   process parameters have been investigated. The thrust force, torque,
   burr formation, delamination, surface roughness and tool wear have been
   analyzed at various processing condition. The experimental results have
   shown that the thrust force, torque, burr formation and the average
   surface roughness increase with the increased feed rate and decrease
   with the increased cutting speed in drilling of Ti-6Al-4V. In drilling
   CFRP, delamination and the average surface roughness has similar
   tendency with the cutting parameters however thrust force and torque
   rises with the increased cutting speed. The results showed that after
   making 15 holes in CFRP/Ti-6Al-4V stack, measured thrust forces were
   increased by 20\% in CFRP and by 45\% in Ti-6Al-4V. Delamination was
   found to be much smaller in drilling of CFRP in stack from compared to
   drilling single CFRP. Tool life was significantly shortened in drilling
   of stack due to the combination of the wear mechanisms.}},

Title = {{Influenza assessment centres: a case study of pandemic preparedness to

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{198-205}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Influenza assessment centres (IACs) were deployed to reduce
   emergency department (ED) volumes during the pH1N1 influenza outbreak in
   the Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox and Addington (KFL\&A) public health
   region of Ontario, Canada, in the fall of 2009. We present a case study
   for the deployment of IACs to reduce ED visit volume during both periods
   of pandemic and seasonal communicable disease outbreak.
   Methods: An emergency department syndromic surveillance system was used
   to trigger the deployment of eight geographically distributed IACs and
   to time their staggered closure 3 weeks later. We compared actual and
   expected ED visit volumes in the KFL\&A region to neighbouring regions
   where no IACs operated by time series regression analysis before,
   during, and after IAC operation.
   Results: The deployment of IACs was triggered with a rise in overall ED
   volume at the hospitals in the KFL\&A region to a level 10\% above the
   6-month running average. The IACs assessed 2,284 patients during 3 weeks
   of operation. Thirtythree patients were admitted directly to the
   hospital from the IACs, bypassing the EDs. During the operation of the
   IACs, the hospitals in the KFL\&A region experienced a modest decrease
   in daily visits when compared to the 3 previous weeks. Overall ED visit
   volume in the hospitals in the neighbouring regions increased 105\%
   during the period of IAC operation.
   Conclusions: Operating stand-alone influenza IACs may reduce ED volumes
   during periods of increased demand, as observed during an anticipated
   pandemic situation.}},

Title = {{Self-similar decay and mixing of a high-Schmidt-number passive scalar in
   an oscillating boundary layer in the intermittently turbulent regime}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{726}},
Pages = {{338-370}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We performed numerical simulations of dissolved oxygen (DO) transfer
   from a turbulent flow, driven by periodic boundary-layer turbulence in
   the intermittent regime, to underlying DO-absorbing organic sediment
   layers. A uniform initial distribution of oxygen is left to decay (with
   no re-aeration) as the turbulent transport supplies the sediment with
   oxygen from the outer layers to be absorbed. A very thin diffusive
   sublayer at the sediment-water interface (SWI), caused by the high
   Schmidt number of DO in water, limits the overall decay rate. A
   decomposition of the instantaneous decaying turbulent scalar field is
   proposed, which results in the development of similarity solutions that
   collapse the data in time. The decomposition is then tested against the
   governing equations, leading to a rigorous procedure for the extraction
   of an ergodic turbulent scalar field. The latter is composed of a
   statistically periodic and a steady non-decaying field. Temporal
   averaging is used in lieu of ensemble averaging to evaluate flow
   statistics, allowing the investigation of turbulent mixing dynamics from
   a single flow realization. In spite of the highly unsteady state of
   turbulence, the monotonically decaying component is surprisingly
   consistent with experimental and numerical correlations valid for steady
   high-Schmidt-number turbulent mass transfer. Linearly superimposed onto
   it is the statistically periodic component, which incorporates all the
   features of the non-equilibrium state of turbulence. It is modulated by
   the evolution of the turbulent coherent structures driven by the
   oscillating boundary layer in the intermittent regime, which are
   responsible for the violent turbulent production mechanisms. These
   cause, in turn, a rapid increase of the turbulent mass flux at the edge
   of the diffusive sublayer. This outer-layer forcing mechanism drives a
   periodic accumulation of high scalar concentration levels in the
   near-wall region. The resulting modulated scalar flux across the SWI is
   delayed by a quarter of a cycle with respect to the wall-shear stress,
   consistently with the non-equilibrium state of the turbulent mixing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an investigation of map width enhancement and a
   detailed analysis of the inducer flow field due to various bleed slot
   configurations and vanes in the annular cavity of a turbocharger
   centrifugal compressor. The compressor under investigation is used in a
   turbocharger application for a heavy duty diesel engine of approximately
   400 hp. This investigation has been undertaken using a computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the full compressor stage, which includes
   a manual multiblock-structured grid generation method. The influence of
   the bleed slot flow on the inducer flow field at a range of operating
   conditions has been analyzed, highlighting the improvement in surge and
   choked flow capability. The impact of the bleed slot geometry variations
   and the inclusion of cavity vanes on the inlet incidence angle have been
   studied in detail by considering the swirl component introduced at the
   leading edge by the recirculating flow through the slot. Further, the
   overall stage efficiency and the nonuniform flow field at the inducer
   inlet have been also analyzed. The analysis revealed that increasing the
   slot width has increased the map width by about 17\%. However, it has a
   small impact on the efficiency, due to the frictional and mixing losses.
   Moreover, adding vanes in the cavity improved the pressure ratio and
   compressor performance noticeably. A detail analysis of the compressor
   with cavity vanes has also been presented.}},

   production were evaluated. It was proposed that, compared to anaerobic
   digestion with wastewater treatment plant sludge (primary raw sludge),
   semi-continuous flow anaerobic co-digestion with FOG could effectively
   enhance biogas and methane production. Thermophilic (55 degrees C)
   co-digestions exhibited higher biogas production and degradation of
   organics than mesophilic co-digestions. The best biogas production rate
   of 17.4 +/- 0.86L/d and methane content 67.9 +/- 1.46\% was obtained
   with a thermophilic co-digestion at HRT=24 days and OLR=2.43 +/-
   0.15gTVS/Ld. These were 32.8\% and 7.10\% higher than the respective
   values from the mesophilic co-digestion under similar operating
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel approximation for the exponential integral

   approximation facilitates studying the error probability of a number of

   combining, selection relaying, incremental relaying, and opportunistic
   incremental relaying, just to name a few. To illustrate the usefulness
   and accuracy of the proposed approximation, we study the error
   probability of a Chase combining HARQ system operating in the presence
   of an unknown source of CCI where we derive an accurate closed form
   expression for the Moment Generating Function (MGF) of the resultant
   Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR). The accuracy of the
   derived result is verified using computer simulation.}},

Abstract = {{For distributed multi-user and multi-relay cooperative networks, the
   received signal may be affected by multiple timing offsets (MTOs) and
   multiple channels that need to be jointly estimated for successful
   decoding at the receiver. This paper addresses the design of optimal
   training sequences for efficient estimation of MTOs and multiple channel
   parameters. A new hybrid Cramer-Rao lower bound (HCRB) for joint
   estimation of MTOs and channels is derived. Subsequently, by minimizing
   the derived HCRB as a function of training sequences, three training
   sequence design guidelines are derived and according to these
   guidelines, two training sequences are proposed. In order to show that
   the proposed design guidelines also improve estimation accuracy, the
   conditional Cramer-Rao lower bound (ECRB), which is a tighter lower
   bound on the estimation accuracy compared to the HCRB, is also derived.
   Numerical results show that the proposed training sequence design
   guidelines not only lower the HCRB, but they also lower the ECRB and the
   mean-square error of the proposed maximum a posteriori estimator.
   Moreover, extensive simulations demonstrate that application of the
   proposed training sequences significantly lowers the bit-error rate
   performance of multi-relay cooperative networks when compared to
   training sequences that violate these design guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration signals from internal combustion engines contain strong noise
   and nonstationary characteristics in the time domain, which cause
   difficulties when attempting to detect and diagnose incipient faults in
   engines using signal features. In order to improve the success rate and
   broaden the applicability of engine incipient fault detection, a new
   concept of angle domain signal envelope analysis is proposed. The new
   method uses an encoder to acquire an engine rotational vibration signal
   using equal angle sampling. Angle domain synchronous averaging is used
   to denoise the original signal, and engine incipient fault features are
   extracted by the angle domain signal envelope algorithm. Experimental
   results using signals recorded from an engine with a connecting rod
   bearing with improper fit clearance have shown that the angle domain
   signal envelope algorithm can extract useful features from the vibration
   signal. The effectiveness of the new detection algorithm was verified.
   The engine fault detection method based on an angle domain signal
   envelope algorithm provides a new way to detect and diagnose engine
   incipient faults.}},

Abstract = {{Isobaric (200 MPa) experiments have been performed to investigate the
   effects of H2O alone or in combination with P, S, F or Cl on
   liquid-phase separation in melts in the systems
   Fe2SiO4-Fe3O4-KAlSi2O6-SiO2, Fe3O4-KAlSi2O6-SiO2 and
   Fe3O4-Fe2O3-KAlSi2O6-SiO2 with or without plagioclase (An(50)).
   Experiments were heated in a rapid-quench internally heated pressure
   vessel at 1,075, 1,150 or 1,200 A degrees C for 2 h. Experimental fO(2)
   was maintained at QFM, NNO or MH oxygen buffers. H2O alone or in
   combination with P, S or F increases the temperature and composition
   range of two-liquid fields at fO(2) = NNO and MH buffers. P, S, F and Cl
   partition preferentially into the Fe-rich immiscible liquid. Two-liquid
   partition coefficients for Fe, Si, P and S correlate well with the
   degree of polymerization of the SiO2-rich liquid and plot on similar but
   distinct power-law curves compared with equivalent anhydrous or basaltic
   melts. The addition of 2 wt\% S to the system Fe3O4-Fe2O3-KAlSi2O6-SiO2
   stabilizes three immiscible melts with Fe-, FeS- and Si-rich
   compositions. H2O-induced suppression of liquidus temperatures in the
   experimental systems, considered with the effects of pressure on the
   temperature and composition ranges of two-liquid fields in silicate
   melts, suggests that liquid-phase separation may be stable in some
   H2O-rich silicate magmas at pressures in excess of 200 MPa.}},

   The model is used to examine mesocosms with 38-mm (nominal diameter)
   gravel subjected to different durations of leachate permeation,
   mesocosms run-in series, and mesocosms with 19-mm gravel. A comparison
   of the calculated and measured leachate concentrations indicates that

   porosities within the saturated drainage layers are general in
   encouraging agreement with the measured values from all experimental

   reasonable agreement. The modeling results indicated that reducing the

Abstract = {{The propagation and acceleration of a flame surface past obstructions in
   a closed square channel was investigated using large eddy simulation.
   The dynamic Smagorinsky-Lilly subgrid model and the Boger flame surface
   density combustion model were used. The geometry is essentially
   two-dimensional with fence-type obstacles distributed on the top and
   bottom surfaces, equally spaced along the channel length at the channel
   height. Flame propagation, however, is three dimensional as ignition
   occurs at a point at the center of the channel cross-section. The effect
   of obstacle blockage ratio on the development of the flame structure was
   investigated by varying the obstacle height. Three-dimensional cases
   were simulated from the initiation of a combustion kernel through spark
   ignition to the acceleration of the flame front at speeds up to 80 m/s.
   The transition from laminar flame propagation to turbulent flame
   propagation within the ``thin reaction zone{''} regime was observed in
   the simulations. By analyzing the development of the three dimensional
   flame surface and unburned gas flow field, the formation of several
   flame structures observed experimentally are explained. Global
   quantities such as the total flame area and centerline flame velocity
   were ascertained and compared to the experimental data. High amplitude
   oscillations in the centerline flame velocity were found to occur from a
   combination of the unburned gas flow field and fluctuations in the
   volumetric burning rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   frame deflections, practitioners increase the size of the eaves haunch
   and / or the sizes of the steel sections used for the column and rafter
   members of the frame. This paper investigates the effect of such
   deflection limits using a real-coded niching genetic algorithm (RC-NGA)
   that optimizes frame weight, taking into account both ultimate as well
   as serviceability limit states. The results show that the proposed GA is
   efficient and reliable. Two different sets of serviceability deflection
   limits are then considered: deflection limits recommended by the Steel
   Construction Institute (SCI), which is based on control of differential
   deflections, and other deflection limits based on suggestions by
   industry. Parametric studies are carried out on frames with spans
   ranging between 15 m to 50 m and column heights between 5 m to 10 m. It
   is demonstrated that for a 50 m span frame, use of the SCI recommended
   deflection limits can lead to frame weights that are around twice as
   heavy as compared to designs without these limits. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sandstone-hosted unconformity-related U deposits in the Athabasca Basin
   at McArthur River Zone 4 and Maurice Bay as well as barren alteration
   systems at Wheeler River Zone ``K{''} and Spring Point are surrounded by
   an outer, peripheral zone of illite and an inner, central zone of
   chlorite alteration. The oxidation state of Fe determined by Fe-57
   Mossbauer spectroscopy of illite, sudoite, and clinochlore from these
   systems indicates that pre-ore illite contains mostly Fe3+ (Fe3+/Sigma
   Fe = 0.77-1.00), reflecting formation from a predominantly oxidizing
   basinal fluid. Lower Fe3+/Sigma Fe ratios are recorded by late pre-ore
   sudoite and clinochlore occurring near faulted unconformities,
   consistent with the contribution to the chlorites from reducing
   basement-derived fluids. Sudoite and clinochlore in the alteration halo
   of barren systems are more reduced (Fe3+/Sigma Fe median = 0.3-0.4) than
   sudoite from mineralized systems (Fe3+/Sigma Fe median = 0.45-0.55).
   Sudoite from both systems becomes broadly more oxidized with increasing
   distance from the fault zone. Variations in the Fe3+/Sigma Fe ratios of
   sudoite and clinochlore support a mechanism in which Fe2+ transported by
   reducing basement-derived fluids is partially oxidized to Fe3+ by
   basinal fluids prior to incorporation into the chlorite. Thus, scarcity
   of oxidizing U-bearing basinal fluids available for interaction with
   reducing basement fluids is a critical factor precluding U
   mineralization in barren systems. Trends of decreasing Fe3+/Sigma Fe
   ratios in sudoite coupled with decreasing Pb-207/Pb-206 ratios of
   leachable Pb can be used as geochemical vectors to the sites of
   potential U mineralization. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies single-channel speech separation, assuming unknown,
   arbitrary temporal dynamics for the speech signals to be separated. A
   data-driven approach is described, which matches each mixed speech
   segment against a composite training segment to separate the underlying
   clean speech segments. To advance the separation accuracy, the new
   approach seeks and separates the longest mixed speech segments with
   matching composite training segments. Lengthening the mixed speech
   segments to match reduces the uncertainty of the constituent training
   segments, and hence the error of separation. For convenience, we call
   the new approach Composition of Longest Segments, or CLOSE. The CLOSE
   method includes a data-driven approach to model long-range temporal
   dynamics of speech signals, and a statistical approach to identify the
   longest mixed speech segments with matching composite training segments.
   Experiments are conducted on the Wall Street Journal database, for
   separating mixtures of two simultaneous large-vocabulary speech
   utterances spoken by two different speakers. The results are evaluated
   using various objective and subjective measures, including the challenge
   of large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition. It is shown that the
   new separation approach leads to significant improvement in all these
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{With ever increasing green-house gas emissions from fossil fuel-driven
   automobiles leading to acute environmental pollution, and ever depleting
   reserves of fossil fuel, today need for the development of pure electric
   vehicle (EV) is of utmost importance. Presently, there is an immense
   impetus to develop plug-in EVs. High switching frequency and high-power
   ac-dc PFC converter with an isolated output and a dc-dc isolated
   converter are essential systems for transferring from utility mains to
   the different battery packs which store energy for propelling the EVs.
   Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) with strict regulatory standards is
   an essential requirement which any switch mode power converter must
   comply with not only for its own operation but also for safe and secure
   operation of surrounding electrical equipment. EVs possess many
   sophisticated electronic circuits in the vicinity of the battery
   charging power converters, so strict EMC standards of the on-board power
   converters should be met. For a cost-effective design approach, EMC
   should be considered at the primitive stages of the power converter
   design. The most commonly used passive electromagnetic interference
   (EMI) filters used for EMI mitigation in power converters come at the
   expense of cost, size and weight, power losses, and printed circuit
   board (PCB) real estate. In this paper, a novel embedded digital active
   EMI filter (DAEF) integrated into the DSP-based digital controller of a
   dc-dc converter applicable for charging the low-voltage battery bank of
   an EV is proposed and analyzed. Experimental results and comparison of
   the performance of the proposed embedded DAEF with a conventional EMI
   filter are presented in this paper so as to validate the feasibility of
   the proposed EMI filter and its advantages over the conventional one.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for design and control of dc-bus
   capacitance and transients in a renewable single-phase grid-connected

   for design of dc-bus PI controller gains; and 2) an accurate method for
   the design of the dc-bus controller gains without neglecting the
   dynamics of the current control loop. Two main objectives are to have
   control over the amount of output current harmonics and over the level
   of bus fluctuations caused by random input power swings. The proposed
   method is transparent and it provides a convenient and rigorous insight
   for the designer to properly select the size of dc-bus component and to
   determine the controller gains.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a control design approach for optimum dynamic
   response in single-phase grid-connected renewable converters with
   minimum energy storage components. This is a crucial matter in realizing
   compact and robust converters without use of bulky and sensitive
   electrolytic capacitors. Nonoptimum dynamic response results in
   undesired interruptions of the maximum power point tracking and
   reduction of the overall efficiency of the system. Common practice is to
   select a large dc-bus size in order to reduce the double-frequency
   ripples that cause harmonics and to slow down the dynamic response to
   avoid large fluctuations on the bus caused by random input power jumps.
   This paper shows that both problems can be addressed to a great extent
   by improving the control system and without need to excessively increase
   the size of the bus component. This paper proposes a control system to
   achieve these goals and provides an analytical design method to optimize
   both dynamic response and output current harmonics. The proposed method
   succeeds to reduce the size of bus component several times without
   compromising the system performance. Details of the proposed method,
   mathematical modeling of the bus control and current control systems,
   simulations, and experimental results are presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Organic inorganic hybrid membranes based on poly(methyl methacrylate)

   polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The properties of these
   membranes were characterized using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform

   thermogravimetric analysis. The results indicate that these membranes
   are formed through hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl group of PMMA and
   the uncondensed alcohol functional groups of the inorganic clusters. The
   proton conductivity of these membranes is on the order of 10(-1) S
   cm(-1), and the 60PMMA-30SiO(2)-10P(2)O(5) membrane displays the highest
   proton conductivity of 3.85 x 10(-1) S cm(-1) at 90 C and 50\% RH. The
   performance of a fuel cell using these membranes was tested. A maximum
   power density of 370 mW cm(-2) is obtained at 80 degrees C, and the
   current density at 0.4 V remains almost unchanged during the 100-h test

   nitrogen in dead-end mode, and it was shown that vanillin and vanillic
   acid were formed by hydrolysis at temperatures of 120, 140, and 160
   degrees C. At the two higher temperatures, the amount of vanillin
   produced was the same. Subsequently, experiments were conducted at the
   same elevated pressures and temperatures with addition of air or oxygen
   enriched air once the temperature in the reactor had reached
   temperatures similar to those used when only hydrolysis occurred. In
   this case, the concentration of vanillin at 140 and 160 degrees C was
   equal to that due to hydrolysis, and the subsequent 2-fold increase was
   due to oxidation. In addition, both vanillic acid and acetovanillone
   (which has rarely been reported) were produced, as was hydrogen. Thus,
   for the first time, it has been shown that the production of vanillin
   (and other compounds) from sodium lignosulfonate at elevated
   temperatures involves hydrolysis and oxidation, with hydrolysis starting
   at just above 100 degrees C, that is, much lower than has previously
   been reported. Approximately 50\% is produced by each mechanism. In
   addition, the orders of the reactions of the different steps were
   estimated, and the reaction mechanisms are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In-situ stair case loading experiments at 500 degrees C using neutron
   diffraction have been carried out on two gamma' strengthened
   polycrystalline nickel base superalloys, RR1000 and Udimet 720LI. In
   order to study the effect of gamma' particle size, uni-modal gamma' size
   distributions were generated in both alloys. Both alloys showed signs of
   dynamic strain aging (DSA) although the strain bursts were far more
   significant in RR1000 than Udimet 720LI. The neutron diffraction
   experiment revealed load partitioning between gamma and gamma' in the
   case of the coarse gamma' microstructure but not in the fine gamma'
   microstructure. When load partitioning occurred, gamma' picked up
   significantly larger elastic strains during a DSA related strain burst
   than the gamma matrix, indicating that mainly the matrix phase deforms
   plastically during such an event. The peak broadening data confirmed
   this. Subsequent to the strain burst, a reduction in the elastic strain
   partitioning was observed indicating preferred yielding of the gamma'
   phase during this stage. The differences in DSA detected between RR1000
   and Udimet 720LI are discussed in terms of possible contribution of the
   various alloying elements. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial inhibition and stripping of volatile compounds are two common
   problems encountered in the biotreatment of contaminated wastewaters.
   Both can be addressed by the addition of a hydrophobic auxiliary phase
   that can absorb and subsequently re-release the substrates, lowering
   their initial aqueous concentrations. Such systems have been described
   as Two Phase Partitioning Bioreactors (TPPBs). In the current work the
   performances of a solid-liquid TPPB, a liquid-liquid TPPB and a single
   phase reactor for the simultaneous degradation of butyl acetate (the
   volatile component) and phenol (the toxic component) have been compared.
   The auxiliary phase used in the solid-liquid TPPB was a 50:50 polymer
   mixture of styrene-butadiene rubber and Hytrel (R) 8206, with high
   affinities for butyl acetate and phenol, respectively. The liquid-liquid
   TPPB employed silicone oil which has fixed physical properties, and had
   no capacity to absorb the toxic contaminant (phenol). Butyl acetate
   degradation was enhanced in both TPPBs relative to the single phase,
   arising from its sequestration into the auxiliary phase, thereby
   reducing volatilization losses. The solid-liquid TPPB additionally
   showed a substantial increase in the phenol degradation rate, relative
   to the silicone oil system, demonstrating the superiority and
   versatility of polymer based systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A tactful ionic-liquid (IL)-assisted approach to in situ synthesis of
   iron fluoride/graphene nanosheet (GNS) hybrid nanostructures is
   developed. To ensure uniform dispersion and tight anchoring of the iron
   fluoride on graphene, we employ an IL which serves not only as a green
   fluoride source for the crystallization of iron fluoride nanoparticles
   but also as a dispersant of GNSs. Owing to the electron transfer
   highways created between the nanoparticles and the GNSs, the iron
   fluoride/GNS hybrid cathodes exhibit a remarkable improvement in both
   capacity and rate performance (230 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 74 mAh g(-1)
   at 40 C). The stable adhesion of iron fluoride nanoparticles on GNSs
   also introduces a significant improvement in long-term, cyclic
   performance (115 mAh g(-1) after 250 cycles even at 10 C). The superior
   electrochemical performance of these iron fluoride/GNS hybrids as
   lithium ion battery cathodes is ascribed to the robust structure of the
   hybrid and the synergies between iron fluoride nanoparticles and
   graphene.}},

   Control Regular Paper}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{The central pattern generator (CPG) has been found to be a real,
   existing neuron controller for the locomotion control of animals and it
   has been used on bio-inspired robots widely in recent years. However,
   research on the adaptability of CPG-based locomotion control methods is
   still a challenge. In particular, the performance of the CPG method on
   quadruped robots is not good enough in some situations compared with the
   traditional force control methods.
   In this article, we adopt a CPG method in which phase difference between
   oscillators can be arbitrarily adjusted, and we try to improve the CPG's
   applications in quadruped robots in some aspects. One aspect is static
   walk gait locomotion, in which we try to add a transition state in the
   CPG network to enhance the static balance of the robot. Another aspect
   is gait transition. Compared with the traditional abrupt gait
   transition, we try to realize a continuous gait transition between walk
   gait and trot gait to decrease the fluctuations of the robot. The
   improved CPG method is tested on a quadruped model and it shows positive
   results with regard to the improvement of static walk gait and gait
   transitions.}},

Abstract = {{Viscoelastic damping material attached on the surface of a structure is
   widely used to suppress the resonance vibration in aerospace,
   automobiles, and various other applications. A full treatment of damping
   material is not an effective method because the damping effect is not
   significantly increased compared to that obtained by an effective
   partial damping treatment. In addition, the weight of the structure is
   increased significantly, which can cause poor system performance.
   Topology optimization is recently implemented in order to find an
   effective optimal damping treatment. The objective function is
   maximization of the damping effect (i.e. the modal loss factor) and the
   constraint is a maximum allowable volume of damping material. In this
   paper we compare the modal loss factors obtained by topology
   optimization to the ones obtained by other approaches, in order to
   determine which approach provides a better damping treatment (i.e.
   higher value of the modal loss factor). As a result, topology
   optimization provides about up to 61.14 per cent higher modal loss
   factor, as confirmed by numerical example. The numerical model for
   finite element analysis and topology optimization is also experimentally
   validated by comparing the numerical results to the experimental modal
   loss factors. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{The luminance decay of generic sandwich polymer light-emitting
   electrochemical cells has been investigated. Under constant current
   operation, the apparent luminance decay is caused by both the formation
   of non-emitting black spots, which decreases the active emitting area,
   and the in situ electrochemical doping, which quenches the luminescence
   of the light-emitting electrochemical cell film. The latter's effect on
   luminance, however, can be mostly reversed by letting the
   electrochemical doping relax. A dramatic recovery of luminance is
   observed when the device is stored without voltage bias and/or
   moderately heated between consecutive operations. The decay/recovery
   cycle can be repeated multiple times with little loss of luminance
   despite the high current density (167 mA/cm(2)) applied. At lower
   current density, a freshly made device loses less than 10\% of its peak
   luminance after over 200 h of continuous operation. Polymer
   light-emitting electrochemical cells therefore possess vastly longer
   operating lifetime if allowed to recover from the effect of reversible
   doping. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative jamming for multiuser multiple input multiple output (MIMO)
   broadcast channel is studied to enhance the physical layer security with
   the help of a friendly jammer. We assume the base station transmits
   multiple independent data streams to multiple legitimate users. During
   the transmission, however, there are multiple eavesdroppers with
   multiple antennas that have interests in the streams from the base
   station. In order to wiretap the desired streams, the eavesdroppers may
   collude or not, and maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
   (SINR) of the desired streams using receive beamforming. The optimal
   cooperative jammer is designed to keep the achieved SINR at
   eavesdroppers below a threshold to guarantee that the transmission from
   the base station to legitimate users is confidential. One main advantage
   of the proposed cooperative jamming scheme is that no modification is
   needed for the existing precoding schemes at the base station and
   decoding schemes at legitimate users. Thus, any existing practical
   precoding/decoding schemes for multiuser MIMO broadcast channel can be
   applied directly with the help of a friendly jammer using the proposed
   cooperative jamming.}},

Abstract = {{The localization of un-functionalized MWCNTs in immiscible blends of PET
   and LDPE was investigated as a function of blend ratio and for a 20:80
   PET:LDPE blend as a function of MWCNT loading up to 5 wt\%. Theoretical
   prediction of wetting coefficients, microscopic examination, electrical
   conductivity measurements, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and
   oscillatory rheology analysis confirmed the MWCNTs preferentially
   located to the PET phase. For blends where the blend ratio was varied
   and the MWCNT content kept constant at 2 wt.\%, the onset of phase
   inversion was detected from the formation of a `droplet in droplet'
   morphology for the 40:60 PET:LDPE blend. This blend was semi-conductive
   (10(4) Omega cm), but when the LDPE content was increased to 80 wt.\%,
   the MWCNTs were confined to isolated PET droplets, the resistivity of
   the blend increased by 11 orders of magnitude. Crystallization
   temperature (T-c) and crystalline content (X-c) of the PET component
   increased, but T-c and X-c for the LDPE phase was unchanged with MWCNT
   addition. The melt viscosity of the PET:LDPE blend at low frequencies
   (omega < 1 rad/s) increased with increasing PET blend content as the
   MWCNTs were readily dispersed in PET when it was the continuous phase.
   Evidence from Cole-Cole plots for the 20:80 PET:LDPE blends with
   increasing MWCNT loading up to 5 wt.\% showed the MWCNTs had little
   effect on the theological response of this LDPE rich blend. However, as
   more MWCNTs are condensed in the PET phase, the melt viscosity of this
   blend increased, MWCNT transfer between phases, dispersion and
   distribution, and, particle coalescence become more difficult.
   Therefore, at higher MWCNT loadings, some MWCNTs remain in the LDPE
   phase or at the blend interface and a significant increase in electrical
   conductivity was obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Brominated (BIIR) and chlorinated (CIIR) poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene)
   are commercially available materials commonly known as halobutyl
   rubbers. The effect of leaving-group ability on the reactivity of
   halogenated poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene) was studied to place iodobutyl
   rubber reactivity into context with these materials. The effect of
   microstructure on reactivity of existing commercial materials was
   studied through comparison to that of polymers containing rearranged
   halomethyl (r-CIIR, r-BIIR, and r-IIIR) microstructure (prepared from
   as-received BIIR). The effect of leaving group on both thermal stability
   and reactivity towards nucleophilic substitution with acetate,
   N-butylimidazole, and sulfur was examined. The material containing the
   iodomethyl microstructure (r-IIIR) readily underwent nucleophilic
   substitution at low temperatures; however, it was extremely sensitive
   towards dehydrohalogenation at temperatures above 65 degrees C. At
   temperatures between 100 and 135 degrees C, the material containing the
   bromomethyl microstructure (r-BIIR) demonstrated the greatest balance
   between reactivity toward nucleophilic substitution and elimination
   through dehydrohalogenation. Exceptional thermal stability at
   temperatures up to 190 degrees C was displayed by the material
   containing the chloromethyl microstructure (r-CIIR); however, its
   reactivity towards nucleophiles was variable and nucleophile dependent.
   Sulfur vulcanization studies showed a clear effect of microstructure on
   the ability to cure with sulfur. While commercial chlorobutyl rubber has
   no ability to cure with sulfur alone, when rearranged to its
   chloromethyl microstructure (r-CIIR), curing occurs readily. Both
   commercial (BIIR) and rearranged (r-BIIR) bromobutyl rubber readily
   vulcanize in the presence of sulfur; however, BIIR cures to a greater
   extent.}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{We describe a method for the removal of arsenic and chromium
   contaminants from water by using ionically modified magnetic
   nanoparticles (PPhSi-MNPs). We synthesized and covalently attached a
   cationic ligand: phosphonium-silane (PPhSi), onto iron oxide magnetic
   nanoparticles. We exploit the ion-exchange capability of the phosphonium
   ligand for the removal of the metal ions from water and
   superparamagnetic nature of iron oxide for physical separation of the
   sorbent materials for recovery and regeneration. Chemical and physical
   properties of the phosphonium-coated MNPs are investigated by FTIR, TEM,
   XPS, EDX, XRD and zeta potential. The highest As(V) and Cr(VI)
   adsorption efficiency is observed at pH 3. The adsorption of As(V) and
   Cr(VI) on PPhSi-MNPs is not affected to any considerable extent by the
   presence of coexisting anions such as chloride, nitrate, and sulfate
   except phosphate. The adsorption data are best fitted with the Langmuir
   isotherm model and a pseudo-second-order kinetic model is proposed.
   Based on the zeta-potential and chemical analyses of the adsorbent
   surface, we propose that a synergy of electrostatic interaction and
   ion-exchange between anionic metals and the cation-modified magnetic
   nanoparticles allow highly efficient removal of the pollutants. A simple
   pH-triggered desorption and regeneration of the adsorbent is also
   presented. With adsorption capacities for arsenic (50.5 mg/g) and
   chromium (35.2 mg/g), coupled with facile magnetic separation, this
   nanoadsorbent can be an attractive material for the removal of several
   anionic metal species from water. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The Dwarf Galaxy Survey (DGS) program is studying low-metallicity
   galaxies using 230 hr of farinfrared (FIR) and submillimetre (submm)
   photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Herschel Space
   Observatory and draws from this a rich database of a wide range of
   wavelengths tracing the dust, gas and stars. This sample of 50 galaxies
   includes the largest metallicity range achievable in the local Universe
   including the lowest metallicity (Z) galaxies, 1/50 Z., and spans four
   orders of magnitude in star formation rates. The survey is designed to
   get a handle on the physics of the interstellar medium (ISM) of low
   metallicity dwarf galaxies, especially their dust and gas properties and
   the ISM heating and cooling processes. The DGS produces PACS and SPIRE
   maps of low-metallicity galaxies observed at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, and
   500 mu m with the highest sensitivity achievable to date in the FIR and
   submm. The FIR fine-structure lines, {[}CII] 158 mu m, {[}OI] 63 mu m,
   {[}OI] 145 mu m, {[}OIII] 88 mu m, {[}NIII] 57 mu m, and {[}NII] 122 and
   205 mu m have also been observed with the aim of studying the gas
   cooling in the neutral and ionized phases. The SPIRE FTS observations
   include many CO lines (J = 4-3 to J = 13-12), {[}NII] 205 mu m, and
   {[}CI] lines at 370 and 609 mu m. This paper describes the sample
   selection and global properties of the galaxies and the observing
   strategy as well as the vast ancillary database available to complement
   the Herschel observations. The scientific potential of the full DGS
   survey is described with some example results included.}},

Abstract = {{A method to fix movable beds in river-related laboratory research or
   physical model studies is proposed and investigated. The motivation was
   to develop a method that would: (1) not involve the use of harsh
   chemicals and (2) ensure that the granular roughness of the original
   movable bed was maintained. The method involves coating the surface with
   a mixture of sand and Portland cement. Laboratory tests were conducted
   to determine the amount of cement, and investigate the best method of
   application, effect on roughness, shear strength and durability. It is
   found that the method can be used to fix both flat and deformed beds.
   The method is particularly effective for sands up to 1.1mm, when it is

Abstract = {{A novel robust stability analysis framework is presented for
   unconditional stability analysis of multimaster/multislave teleoperation
   systems. Unlike the unconditional stability criterion for single-user
   systems, the newly proposed criteria for unconditional stability of
   multimaster/multislave teleoperation systems depend on the multiport
   network parameters and the port terminations. In addition to the
   analytical solution, the graphical demonstration of the unconditional
   stability region facilitates the analysis of coupled stability against
   variations in the dynamics of the environments and operators, even when
   they behave actively. The proposed robust stability analysis framework
   is examined on two multilateral shared control architectures that were
   previously developed for dual-user teleoperation systems.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model is developed for condensation polymerization of
   1,3-propanediol to produce Cerenol polyether. The effect of the
   super-acid catalyst is considered explicitly in the proposed reaction
   mechanism. The main reactions include protonation/deprotonation
   equilibrium, polycondensation, carbocation formation, end degradation,
   and transetherification. Formation of propanal and secondary hydroxyl
   ends is also considered. Mass transfer of water, propanal, and monomer
   from the liquid phase into nitrogen bubbles is included in the model.
   The proposed model predicts the time evolution of number average
   molecular weight and concentrations of water, propanal, monomer, and
   unsaturated end groups, along with evaporation rates of small molecules.
   Data from isothermal batch experiments are used to estimate model
   parameters. Steep upward trends in degree of polymerization and in
   concentration of unsaturated ends are not predicted well at long

Abstract = {{Salt weathering is a crucial process that brings about a change in
   stone, from the scale of landscapes to stone outcrops and natural
   building stone fa double dagger ades. It is acknowledged that salt
   weathering is controlled by fluctuations in temperature and moisture,
   where repeated oscillations in these parameters can cause
   re-crystallisation, hydration/de-hydration of salts, bringing about
   stone surface loss in the form of, for example, granular disaggregation,
   scaling, and multiple flaking. However, this `traditional' view of how
   salt weathering proceeds may need to be re-evaluated in the light of
   current and future climatic trends. Indeed, there is considerable scope
   for the investigation of consequences of climate change on
   geomorphological processes in general. Building on contemporary research
   on the `deep wetting' of natural building stones, it is proposed that
   (as stone may be wetter for longer), ion diffusion may become a more
   prominent mechanism for the mixing of molecular constituents, and a
   shift in focus from physical damage to chemical change is suggested.
   Data from ion diffusion cell experiments are presented for three
   different sandstone types, demonstrating that salts may diffuse through
   porous stone relatively rapidly (in comparison to, for example, dense
   concrete). Pore water from stones undergoing diffusion experiments was
   extracted and analysed. Factors controlling ion diffusion relating to
   `time of wetness' within stones are discussed, (continued saturation,
   connectivity of pores, mineralogy, behaviour of salts, sedimentary
   structure), and potential changes in system dynamics as a result of
   climate change are addressed. System inputs may change in terms of
   increased moisture input, translating into a greater depth of wetting
   front. Salts are likely to be `stored' differently in stones, with salt
   being in solution for longer periods (during prolonged winter wetness).
   This has myriad implications in terms of the movement of ions by
   diffusion and the potential for chemical change in the stone (especially
   in more mobile constituents), leading to a weakening of the stone
   matrix/grain boundary cementing. The `output' may be mobilisation and
   precipitation of elements leading to, for example, uneven cementing in
   the stone. This reduced strength of the stone, or compromised ability of
   the stone to absorb stress, is likely to make crystallisation a more
   efficacious mechanism of decay when it does occur. Thus, a delay in the
   onset of crystallisation while stonework is wet does not preclude
   exaggerated or accelerated material loss when it finally happens.}},

Abstract = {{In multi-relay cooperative systems, the signal at the destination is
   affected by impairments such as multiple channel gains, multiple timing

   paper we account for all these impairments and propose a new transceiver
   structure at the relays and a novel receiver design at the destination
   in distributed space-time block code (DSTBC) based amplify-and-forward
   (AF) cooperative networks. The Cramer-Rao lower bounds and a least
   squares (LS) estimator for the multi-parameter estimation problem are
   derived. In order to significantly reduce the receiver complexity at the
   destination, a differential evolution (DE) based estimation algorithm is
   applied and the initialization and constraints for the convergence of
   the proposed DE algorithm are investigated. In order to detect the
   signal from multiple relays in the presence of unknown channels, MTOs,
   and MCFOs, novel optimal and sub-optimal minimum mean-square error
   receiver designs at the destination node are proposed. Simulation
   results show that the proposed estimation and compensation methods

   to the modulated continuous wave Yb: fiber laser used in the
   experiments. We perform time-domain finite-element simulations of
   thermal dynamics to investigate thermo-optical coupling and link the
   observed machining to an intensity-thresholded runaway thermo-optically
   nonlinear process. This effect, cascaded absorption, is qualitatively
   different from ablation observed using nanosecond-duration pulses and is
   general enough to potentially facilitate high-quality, high

Abstract = {{This paper reports the findings of research on the environmental
   performance of two case-study houses, a retrofit and new build. The
   retrofit was completed to a Passivhaus standard while the new build was
   completed to current Irish building regulations. Environmental
   performance of the retrofit and new build was measured using life-cycle
   assessments, examining the assembly, operational and end-of-life stage
   over life spans of 50 and 80 years. Using primary information,
   life-cycle assessment software and life-cycle assessment databases the
   environmental impacts of each stage were modelled. The operational stage
   of both case studies was found to be the source of the most significant
   environmental damage, followed by the assembly and the end-of-life stage
   respectively. The relative importance of the assembly and end-of-life
   stage decreased as the life span increased. It was found that the
   retrofit house studied outperformed the new build in the assembly and
   operational stage, whereas the new build performed better in the
   end-of-life stage; however, this is highly sensitive, depending on the
   standards to which both are completed. Operational energy savings pre-
   and post-retrofit were significant, indicating the future potential for
   adoption of high-quality retrofitting practices.}},

Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{84-97}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are frequently installed in climates
   with significant snowfall. To better understand the effects of snowfall
   on the performance of PV systems, a multi-angle, multi-technology PV
   system was commissioned and monitored over two winters. A novel
   methodology was introduced and validated with this system, which allows
   for the determination of snowfall losses from time-series performance
   data with correlated meteorological observations down to a 5-min
   resolution. In addition, a new method for determining the probability
   distribution of snow deposition on a module from image data was
   developed. It was found that the losses due to snowfall are dependent on
   the angle and technology being considered and the effects of increased
   albedo in the surroundings of a PV system can increase expected yields,
   particularly in the case of high tilt angle systems. Existing methods
   for predicting losses due to snowfall were investigated, and were found
   to provide overly conservative estimates of snow losses. Overall the
   results show that the proper assessment of snow related losses can help
   improve system performance and maintenance. It is concluded that proper
   characterization of the snowfall effect on PV system performance can
   influence better systems optimization for climates experiencing
   snowfall. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nine different sulfur-containing compounds were biotransformed to the
   corresponding sulfoxides by Escherichia coli Bl21(DE3) cells expressing
   styrene monooxygenase (SMO) from Pseudomonas putida CA-3. Thioanisole
   was consumed at 83.3 mu moles min(-1) g cell dry weight(-1) resulting
   mainly in the formation of R-thioanisole sulfoxide with an enantiomeric
   excess (ee) value of 45 \%. The rate of 2-methyl-, 2-chloro- and
   2-bromo-thioanisole consumption was 2-fold lower than that of
   thioanisole. Surprisingly, the 2-methylthioanisole sulfoxide product had
   the opposite (S) configuration to that of the other 2-substituted
   thioanisole derivatives and had a higher ee value (84 \%). The rate of
   oxidation of 4-substituted thioanisoles was higher than the
   corresponding 2-substituted substrates but the ee values of the products
   were consistently lower (10-23 \%). The rate of benzo{[}b]thiophene and
   2-methylbenzo{[}b]thiophene sulfoxidation was approximately 10-fold
   lower than that of thioanisole. The ee value of the benzo{[}b]thiophene
   sulfoxide could not be determined as the product racemized rapidly. E.
   coli cells expressing an engineered SMO (SMOeng R3-11) oxidised
   2-substituted thioanisoles between 1.8- and 2.8-fold faster compared to
   cells expressing the wild-type enzyme. SMOeng R3-11 oxidised
   benzo{[}b]thiophene and 2-methylbenzo{[}b]thiophene 10.1 and 5.6 times
   faster that the wild-type enzyme. The stereospecificity of the reaction
   catalysed by SMOeng was unchanged from that of the wild type. Using the
   X-ray crystal structure of the P. putida S12 SMO, it was evident that
   the entrance of substrates into the SMO active site is limited by the
   binding pocket bottleneck formed by the side chains of Val-211 and
   Asn-46 carboxyamide group.}},

Abstract = {{The overall aim of this paper is to identify critical success factors
   that would help Private Finance Initiative/facility management (PFI/FM)
   contractors to avoid performance failure payment deductions in Public
   Private Partnership/PFI (PPP/PFI) projects (constructed facilities).
   Using focus groups discussions, 36 possible factors that could influence
   performance failure payment deductions were identified and put together
   in a questionnaire survey. Analysis included reliability analysis that
   enabled identification of 29 reliable factors from the initial 36
   factors. Using linear multiple regression, the best seven predictors
   that could help PFI/FM contractors to avoid performance payment failure
   deduction were identified from the 29 reliable factors. With the aid of
   another set of data and Spearman's rank correlation analysis, the seven
   predictors referred to as critical success factors were validated to
   confirm their dependability and wider applicability. The seven critical
   success factors include: (1) good working relationship with client,
   end-users, subcontractors, and suppliers; (2) minimal use of subjective
   measures as key performance indicators (KPIs); (3) a functioning help
   desk in place to receive service requests and complaints;, (4) explicit
   and realistic performance standards, criteria, and weighting systems;
   (5) quality of service delivery that meets requirements of output
   specification; (6) use of the Just-in-Time approach compared with a
   prescheduled maintenance regime; and (7) PFI/FM contractor active
   participation in the design process. The research findings would help
   both PFI/FM contractors and private project consortiums to maximize
   their profits/returns on investment by improving their performance and
   avoiding payment deductions in PFI projects. Public sector clients and
   occupants/users of their facilities would also achieve full value for
   money by enjoying facilities that adequately meet their needs and
   requirements. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The polymer light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) is an attractive
   alternative to the widely studied polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs)
   for possible lighting and display applications. The main advantage of an
   LEC is its relative insensitivity to electrode work function and active
   layer thickness. While this is true when compared to a PLED, we show
   that active layer thickness can strongly influence several key LEC
   performance parameters. Sandwich LECs exhibit vastly different device
   characteristics when the active layer thickness is varied from
   approximately 75 nm to 1206 nm. Maximum luminance, current efficiency
   (in cd/A) and operating lifetime are all strongly thickness dependent.
   The 75 nm LEC shows artificially slow turn on due to the presence of
   micro-shorts. The 1206 nm LEC exhibits a peculiar partial recovery of
   luminance after prolonged operation. We attribute the thickness
   dependent LEC characteristics to variations in doping levels. Our
   results suggest that the active layer thickness of sandwich LECs is a
   non-trivial parameter that should be carefully optimized and studied.

Abstract = {{This paper explores relationships between retirement and migration into
   and within remote rural areas. Rural areas in the UK are characterised
   by net population gain, with pre-retirement age migrants being an
   identifiable sub-group of rural in-migrants. This paper reports findings
   from a household survey which sought evidence for retirement transition
   migration into remote, rural areas. Drawing upon data collected on the
   Isle of Bute, Scotland, we show that the economic characteristics of
   migrant households and their motivations for moving vary by age group
   and by migrant status. Non-local moves were most common when the
   householder was aged 5064. Early retirement has facilitated these moves
   onto Bute, allowing migrants to fulfil their residential preferences and
   satisfy quality of life aspirations when their place of residence is no
   longer tied to their place of employment. Local moves associated with
   retirement were most likely when the householder was aged 65+. Our
   findings reflect the complexity of retirement, an event individuals and
   households react to over an extended period of time, and demonstrate the
   importance of early retirement as a catalyst for bringing young-old'
   migrants into a remote rural area, acting as a counterbalance to the
   ongoing effects of outmigration by young adults.}},

   force tended to their deterministic values as the ratio of anisotropic
   heterogeneity increased. Results also showed that the exit hydraulic

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to prospectively test the
   hypothesis that image overlay technology facilitates accurate navigation
   for magnetic resonance (MR)-guided osseous biopsy.
   Materials and Methods: A prototype augmented reality image overlay
   system was used in conjunction with a clinical 1.5-T MR imaging system.
   Osseous biopsy of a total of 16 lesions was planned in 4 human cadavers
   with osseous metastases. A loadable module of 3D Slicer open-source
   medical image analysis and visualization software was developed and used
   for display of MR images, lesion identification, planning of virtual
   biopsy paths, and navigation of drill placement. The osseous drill
   biopsy was performed by maneuvering the drill along the displayed MR
   image containing the virtual biopsy path into the target. The drill
   placement and the final drill position were monitored by intermittent MR
   imaging. Outcome variables included successful drill placement, number
   of intermittent MR imaging control steps, target error, number of
   performed passes and tissue sampling, time requirements, and
   pathological analysis of the obtained osseous core specimens including
   adequacy of specimens, presence of tumor cells, and degree of necrosis.
   Results: A total of 16 osseous lesions were sampled with percutaneous
   osseous drill biopsy. Eight lesions were located in the osseous pelvis
   (8/16, 50\%) and 8 (8/16, 50\%) lesions were located in the thoracic and
   lumbar spine. Lesion size was 2.2 cm (1.1-3.5 cm). Four (2-8) MR imaging
   control steps were required. MR imaging demonstrated successful drill
   placement inside 16 of the 16 target lesions (100\%). One needle pass
   was sufficient for accurate targeting of all lesions. One tissue sample
   was obtained in 8 of the 16 lesions (50\%); 2, in 6 of the 16 lesions
   (38\%); and 3, in 2 of the 16 lesions (12\%). The target error was 4.3
   mm (0.8-6.8 mm). Length of time required for biopsy of a single lesion
   was 38 minutes (20-55 minutes). Specimens of 15 of the 16 lesions (94\%)
   were sufficient for pathological evaluation. Of those 15 diagnostic
   specimens, 14 (93\%) contained neoplastic cells, whereas 1 (7\%)
   specimen demonstrated bone marrow without evidence of neoplastic cells.
   Of those 14 diagnostic specimens, 11 (79\%) were diagnostic for
   carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, which was concordant with the primary
   neoplasm, whereas, in 3 of the 14 diagnostic specimens (21\%), the
   neoplastic cells were indeterminate.
   Conclusions: Image overlay technology provided accurate navigation for
   the MR-guided biopsy of osseous lesions of the spine and the pelvis in
   human cadavers at 1.5 T. The high technical and diagnostic yield
   supports further evaluation with clinical trials.}},

Title = {{A diapycnal diffusivity model for stratified environmental flows}},
Journal = {{DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61-62}},
Pages = {{14-34}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The vertical diffusivity of density, K-rho, regulates ocean circulation,
   climate and coastal water quality. K-rho is difficult to measure and
   model in these stratified turbulent flows, resulting in the need for the
   development of K-rho parameterizations from more readily measurable flow
   quantities. Typically, K-rho is parameterized from turbulent temperature
   fluctuations using the Osborn-Cox model or from the buoyancy frequency,
   N, kinematic viscosity, nu, and the rate of dissipation of turbulent
   kinetic energy, epsilon, using the Osborn model. More recently, Shih et
   al. (2005, J. Fluid Mech. 525: 193-214) proposed a laboratory scale
   parameterization for K-rho, at Prandtl number (ratio of the viscosity
   over the molecular diffusivity) Pr = 0.7, in terms of the turbulence
   intensity parameter, Re-b = epsilon/(nu N-2), which is the ratio between
   the destabilizing effect of turbulence to the stabilizing effects of
   stratification and viscosity. In the present study, we extend the SKIP
   parameterization, against extensive sets of published data, over 0.7 <
   Pr < 700 and validate it at field scale. Our results show that the SKIF
   model must be modified to include a new Buoyancy-controlled mixing
   regime, between the Molecular and Transitional regimes, where K-rho is
   captured using the molecular diffusivity and Osborn model, respectively.
   The Buoyancy-controlled regime occurs over 10(2/3)Pr(-1/2) < Re-b < (3
   ln root Pr)(2), where K-rho = 0.1/Pr-1/4 nu Re-b(3/2) is Pr dependent.
   This range is shown to be characteristic to lakes and oceans and both
   the Osborn and Osborn-Cox models systematically underestimate K-rho in
   this regime. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A new method to determine the effects of hydrodynamic surface coatings
   on the snow shedding effectiveness of solar photovoltaic modules}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{71-78}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{As solar photovoltaic (PV) installations have become more common in
   regions that experience substantial snowfall, losses in energy
   production due to snow coverage have grown in concern. Several
   post-production surface coatings have been proposed to enhance snow
   shedding to reduce these snow related losses. In this paper, a novel
   methodology is developed to determine the effectiveness of a snow
   clearing from a PV module and is used to evaluate the snow shedding
   effectiveness of any module surface treatment. Measured PV output is
   compared to modeled PV output in a generalizable method that allows for
   the determination of the length of time a panel is covered with snowfall
   using electrical performance data. This model accounts for module
   degradation during long-term outdoor testing and other external factors
   effecting performance, such as persistent soiling losses. This
   methodology was tested on modules that had one of four hydrodyanmic
   surface coatings, as well as one module with a prismatic glass front in
   order to determine the snow clearing effectiveness of these surfaces as
   compared to conventional plain glass. The methodology was validated, but
   the surface coatings tested did not have an appreciable positive effect
   on snow clearance, and in some cases tended to impede the shedding of
   snow. The physical mechanisms responsible for the results are discussed.

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering is a promising approach for articular cartilage
   repair. However, using current technologies, the developed engineered
   constructs generally do not possess an organized superficial layer,
   which contributes to the tissue's durability and unique mechanical
   properties. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of applying a
   moving point of contract-type stimulation (MPS) to stimulate the
   production of a superficial-like layer in the engineered constructs. MPS
   was applied to chondrocyte-agarose hydrogels at a frequency of 0.5, 1 or
   2 Hz, under a constant compressive load of 10 mN for durations between 5
   and 60 min over 3 consecutive days. Expression and localization of
   superficial zone constituents was conducted by qRT-PCR and in situ
   hybridization. Finite element modeling was also constructed to gain
   insight into the relationship between the applied stimulus and
   superficial zone constituent expression. Gene expression of superficial
   zone markers were affected in a frequency dependent manner with a
   physiologic frequency of 1 Hz producing maximal expression of PRG4,
   biglycan, decorin and collagen II. In situ hybridization revealed that
   localization of these markers predominantly occurred at 500-1000 mu m
   below the construct surface which correlated to sub-surface strains
   between 10 and 25\% as determined by finite element modeling. These
   results indicate that while mechanical stimuli can be used to enhance
   the expression of superficial zone constituents in engineered cartilage
   constructs, the resultant subsurface loading is a critical factor for
   localizing expression. Future studies will investigate altering the
   applied stimulus to further localize superficial zone constituent
   expression at the construct surface.}},

Abstract = {{We present in this study the effect of nature and concentration of
   lithium salt, such as the lithium hexafluorophosphate, LiPF6; lithium
   tris(pentafluoroethane)-trifluorurophosphate LiFAP; lithium
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, LiTFSI, on the CO2 solubility in
   four electrolytes for lithium ion batteries based on pure solvent that
   include ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethyl methyl
   carbonate (EMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), as well as, in the EC: DMC,
   EC: EMC and EC: DEC (50: 50) wt.\% binary mixtures as a function of
   temperature from (283 to 353) K and atmospheric pressure. Based on
   experimental solubility values, the Henry's law constant of the carbon
   dioxide in these solutions with the presence or absence of lithium salt
   was then deduced and compared with reported values from the literature,
   as well as with those predicted by using COSMO-RS methodology within
   COSMOThermX software. From this study, it appears that the addition of 1
   mol.dm(-3) LiPF6 salt in alkylcarbonate solvents decreases their CO2
   capture capacity. By using the same experimental conditions, an opposite
   CO2 solubility trend was generally observed in the case of the addition
   of LiFAP or LiTFSI salts in these solutions. Additionally, in all
   solutions investigated during this work, the CO2 solubility is greater
   in electrolytes containing the LiFAP salt, followed by those based on
   the LiTFSI case. The precision and accuracy of the experimental data
   reported therein, which are close to (1 and 15)\%, respectively. From
   the variation of the Henry's law constant with temperature, the partial
   molar thermodynamic functions of dissolution such as the standard Gibbs
   energy, the enthalpy, and the entropy, as well as the mixing enthalpy of
   the solvent with CO2 in its hypothetical liquid state were calculated.
   Finally, a quantitative analysis of the CO2 solubility evolution was
   carried out in the EC: DMC (50: 50) wt.\% binary mixture as the function
   of the LiPF6 or LiTFSI concentration in solution to elucidate how ionic
   species modify the CO2 solubility in alkylcarbonates-based Li-ion
   electrolytes by investigating the salting effects at T = 298.15 K and
   atmospheric pressure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel technique to suppress common-mode
   electromagnetic interference (EMI) using a digital active EMI filter
   (DAEF). The DAEF control technique is concurrently implemented with a
   digital controller of a grid-tied photovoltaic microinverter. A brief
   description of the microinverter architecture and its inverter circuit
   is illustrated. The inverter stability is investigated using the overall
   transfer function. Accordingly, the system compensation is designed
   based on the direct quadrant (DQ) reference frame control technique.
   Finally, the proposed digital controller is tested on a grid-connected
   200-W dc-ac microinverter. The experiment results validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed technique. Compared with the conventional
   passive EMI filter, the proposed digital controller can achieve an
   equivalent or better performance in terms of EMI suppression and
   maintain stability within the operation bandwidth. Therefore, the
   embedded DAEF can significantly reduce the size, cost, and space of the
   overall power inverter printed circuit board without the need of a
   conventional passive EMI filter.}},

   inclination is also compared with increasing plenum depth without

   thermal performance by only 0.5\%, when compared with a baseline
   non-inclined case with a shallow plenum. Similarly, increasing plenum
   depth without inclination has a thermal performance benefit of
   approximately 1\%. The numerical study shows that, as the heat exchanger
   is inclined, the low velocity core at the centre of the heat exchanger
   moves to one side. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model is used to interpret and
   better understand the results of a systematic experimental investigation
   of activators regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical
   polymerization (ARGET ATRP) of butyl methacrylate (BMA) using Sn(EH)(2)
   as reducing agent, ethyl 2-bromoisobutyrate (EBiB) as ATRP initiator,
   and CuBr2/TPMA (TPMA: tris{[}(2-pyridyl)methyl]amine) as deactivator.
   The model demonstrates the importance of slow initiation, with distinct
   activation and deactivation rate coefficients for the initiator and
   polymeric species required to match the experimental data. In addition,
   the model incorporates a second reduction step for the reducing agent
   and accounts for diffusional limitations on chain-length-dependent
   termination. The effect of temperature on the slow ATRP initiation is
   limited, and a sufficiently high initial reducing agent concentration is
   crucial to obtain a high conversion, although achieved at the expense of
   decreased end-group functionality.}},

   degradative radical addition to monomer. The rates are increased by
   lowering the pH, wherein the degradative addition to NVI monomer is
   partially (at pH 4) and completely (at pH 1) hindered, with the
   polymerization rate matching that of QVI at pH 1. The initial rates of

Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{158}},
Pages = {{89-97}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Problems associated with swelling soils are faced by practitioners and
   researchers all over the world. Swelling soils incur large deformations
   and swelling induced pressures associated with changes to their moisture
   content or pore water chemistry. A combination of swelling soil and
   climatic conditions conspires to add additional design considerations
   for infrastructure founded in swelling soil. Difficulties are
   encountered in laboratory testing as well as analysis of applications
   that incorporate swelling soils. In this paper a two-part approach is
   used to characterize the swelling potential of Bearpaw clayshale.
   Traditional swelling pressure tests as well as specialized triaxial
   swelling tests are reported and interpreted using a unifying framework
   for characterizing swelling potential. The results indicate that the
   swelling potential of Bearpaw increases with depth corresponding to a
   decrease in moisture content and void ratio. The combination of swelling
   pressure tests and triaxial swelling tests allows the interpretation of
   the swelling potential for general conditions. Crown Copyright (c) 2013

Abstract = {{The present work reports a comparative study on the performances of two
   bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfony]-imide-based protic (PIL) and aprotic
   (AIL) ionic liquids, namely, trimethyl-ammonium
   bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]-imide {[}HN111]{[}TFSI], PIL) and
   trimethyl-sulfonium bis-{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonynl]imide
   ({[}S-111]{[}TESI], AIL), as mixtures with three molecular solvents:
   gamma butyrolactone (gamma-BL), propylene carbonate (PC), and
   acetonitrile (ACN) as electrolytes for supercapacitor applications.
   After an analysis of their transport properties as a function of
   temperature, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements were
   conducted at 25 and -30 degrees C to investigate the performance of
   these mixtures as electrolytes for supercapacitors using activated
   carbon as the electrode material. Surprisingly, for each solvent
   investigated, no significant differences were observed between the
   electrolytes based on the PIL and AIL in their electrochemical
   performance due to the presence or the absence of the labile proton.
   Furthermore, good specific capacitances were observed in the case of
   gamma-BL-based electrolytes even at low temperature. Capacitances up to
   131 and 80 F.g(-1) are observed for the case of the {[}S-111]{[}TESI] +
   gamma-BL mixture at 25 and -30 degrees C, respectively. This latter
   result is very promising particularly for the formulation of new
   environmentally friendly electrolytes within energy storage systems even
   at low temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{We present a theoretical study of the resonance fluorescence spectra of
   an optically driven quantum dot placed near a single metal nanoparticle.
   The metallic reservoir coupling is calculated for an 8-nm metal
   nanoparticle using a time-convolutionless master equation approach where
   the exact photon reservoir function is included using Green function
   theory. By exciting the system coherently near the nanoparticle dipole
   mode, we show that the driven Mollow spectrum becomes highly asymmetric
   due to internal coupling effects with higher-order plasmons. We also
   highlight the regimes of resonance squeezing and broadening as well as
   spectral reshaping through light propagation. Our master equation
   technique can be applied to any arbitrary material system, including
   lossy inhomogeneous structures, where mode expansion techniques are
   known to break down.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous computer simulation studies have been performed on the
   radiation damage of zirconium. In contrast to most of the work in the
   literature which has focused on the effects of temperature and recoil
   energy on defect production and defect clustering, we have developed a
   computational model to consider the influence of elastic strain field on
   the formation of defects and their clusters, as strain is commonly
   present in a real reactor environment. In this work, irradiation induced
   displacement cascades in alpha-zirconium experiencing a macroscopic
   strain have been studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a
   many-body interatomic potential. The external strain mainly affects the
   size of defect clusters rather than the total number of defects. The
   sizes of interstitial and vacancy clusters respond differently to the
   external strain conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Coherent excitation of neutral excitons will generally excite both

   two-exciton pumping using a coherent continuous wave pump field in the

Title = {{Excitonic analysis of many-body effects on the 1s-2p intraband
   transition in semiconductor systems}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{We present a detailed study of many-body effects associated with the
   intraband 1s-2p transition in two-and three-dimensional photoexcited
   semiconductors. We employ a previously developed excitonic model to
   treat effects of exchange and phase space filling (PSF). In this work,
   we extend the model to include intraband transitions and static
   free-carrier screening. The exciton transition energies are renormalized
   by many-body interactions, and the excitonic dynamical equations provide
   simple expressions for the individual contributions of screening, PSF
   and exchange. The excitonic model correctly predicts the blue shift and
   bleaching of the 1s exciton resonance due to exchange and PSF.
   Free-carrier screening is found to enhance these effects by lowering the
   binding energy of the 1s exciton. In contrast, the effects of
   free-carrier screening on the 1s-2p transition energy are subtler. For a
   coherent exciton system, in the absence of free-carrier screening,
   exchange and PSF lead to a blue shift of the transition energy. However,
   screening decreases the 1s binding energy faster than the 2p binding
   energy, which in turn decreases the transition energy. Thus screening
   effects oppose exchange and PSF, and the overall magnitude and sign of
   the 1s-2p transition energy shift depends on the free-carrier density.
   Specifically, for low to moderate excitation densities, exchange and PSF
   can be dominated by screening, leading to a net redshift of the
   transition energy. The results for two- and three-dimensional systems
   are qualitatively similar, although the magnitude of the shift is much
   smaller in three dimensions.}},

   Fe2SiO4-Fe3O4-KAlSi2O6-SiO2 + H2O and, Fe3O4-KAlSi2O6-SiO2 center dot
   KAlSi2O6-SiO2 + H2O melts are only 0.4-0.6 parts per thousand and do not
   differ significantly from those for anhydrous melts of similar
   composition. The Delta O-18 values for melts with added H2O + P or S are
   more variable, ranging from 0.0 to 0.8 parts per thousand. Partitioning
   of O-18 between the immiscible melts is 0.6-1 parts per thousand less
   than the partitioning reported for melt-mineral and mineral-mineral

   Delta O-18 values (<1 parts per thousand), and the variation in the
   delta O-18 values of conjugate melts that occurs with the inclusion of

Title = {{Effects of external intermittency and mean shear on the spectral
   inertial-range exponent in a turbulent square jet}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 14}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates by experiment the dependence of the
   inertial-range exponent m of the streamwise velocity spectrum on the
   external intermittency factor gamma (equivalent to the fraction of time
   the flow is fully turbulent) and the mean shear S in a turbulent square
   jet. Velocity measurements were made using hot-wire anemometry in the
   jet at 15 < x/ D-e < 40, where D-e denotes the exit equivalent diameter,
   and for an exit Reynolds number of Re = 50 000. The Taylor microscale
   Reynolds number R-lambda varies from about 70 to 450 in the present
   study. The TERA (turbulent energy recognition algorithm) method proposed
   by Falco and Gendrich {[} in Near-Wall Turbulence: 1988 Zoran Zaric,
   Memorial Conference, edited by S. J. Kline and N. H. Afgan (Hemisphere
   Publishing Corp., Washington, DC, 1990), pp. 911-931] is discussed and
   applied to estimate the intermittency factor from velocity signals. It
   is shown that m depends strongly on. but negligibly on S. More
   specifically, m varies with. following m = m(t) + (ln
   gamma(-0.0173))(1/2), where m(t) denotes the spectral exponent found in
   fully turbulent regions.}},

Journal = {{MACROMOLECULES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{3461-3475}},
Month = {{MAY 14}},
Abstract = {{Self-assembled Nafion films of varying thickness were generated on SiO2
   terminated silicon wafer by immersion in Nafion dispersions of different
   concentrations. The impact of solvent/dispersion media was probed by
   preparing films from two different types of Nafion
   dispersions-IPA-diluted dispersion and Nafion-in-water dispersion. The
   thickness of films was ascertained by three different techniques:
   variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The three
   techniques yielded consistent nominal thicknesses of 4, 10, 30, 55, 75,
   110, 160, and 300 nm for films self-assembled from IPA-diluted Nafion
   dispersions of concentrations 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and
   5.0 wt \%, respectively. Films generated from 0.25-5.0 wt \%
   Nafion-in-water dispersions generated comparable thicknesses. An
   interesting finding of our work is the observation of bimodal surface
   wettability, investigated by water contact angle. The sub-55 nm films
   were found to exhibit hydrophilic surface whereas the thicker films
   showed hydrophobic surface similar to those reported for Nafion
   membranes Employing XDLVO theory, surface energies of the hydrophobic,
   160 nm film was found to be similar to that reported for Nafion membrane
   whereas those for the hydrophilic 4 nm film yielded high
   electron-accepting/proton-donating parameters resulting in an enhanced
   surface polarity. It can be concluded that the structure and properties
   of the ultrathin (<55 nm) Nafion films are distinct from those of the
   thicker (but still submicrometer) films, which are likely similar to
   those of the well Nafion membranes. No significant effect of dispersion
   type was observed for 10-300 nm thick films.}},

   Triiodide Reduction in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY 14}},
Abstract = {{Platinum (Pt) nanocrystals have demonstrated to be an effective catalyst
   in many heterogeneous catalytic processes. However, pioneer facets with
   highest activity have been reported differently for various reaction
   systems. Although Pt has been the most important counter electrode
   material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), suitable atomic
   arrangement on the exposed crystal facet of Pt for triiodide reduction
   is still inexplicable. Using density functional theory, we have
   investigated the catalytic reaction processes of triiodide reduction
   over \{100\}, \{111\} and \{411\} facets, indicating that the activity
   follows the order of Pt(111) > Pt(411) > Pt(100). Further, Pt
   nanocrystals mainly bounded by \{100\}, \{111\} and \{411\} facets were
   synthesized and used as counter electrode materials for DSCs. The
   highest photovoltaic conversion efficiency of Pt(111) in DSCs confirms
   the predictions of the theoretical study. These findings have deepened
   the understanding of the mechanism of triiodide reduction at Pt surfaces
   and further screened the best facet for DSCs successfully.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer extrusion is an energy intensive process, which is often run at
   less than optimal conditions. The extrusion process consists of gradual
   melting of solid polymer by thermal conduction and viscous shearing
   between a rotating screw and a barrel; as such it is highly dependent
   upon the frictional, thermal and rheological properties of the polymer.
   Extruder screw geometry and extrusion variables should ideally be
   tailored to suit the properties of individual polymers, but in practice
   this is rarely achieved due to the lack of understanding of the process.
   Here, in-process monitoring techniques have been used to characterise
   the thermal dynamics of the extrusion process. Novel thermocouple grid
   sensors have been used to measure melt temperature fields within flowing
   polymer melts at the entrance to an extruder die in conjunction with
   infra-red thermometers and real-time quantification of energy
   consumption. A commercial grade of polyethylene has been examined using
   three extruder screw geometries at different extrusion operating
   conditions to understand the process efficiency. Extruder screw
   geometry, screw rotation speed and set temperature were found to have a
   significant effect on the thermal homogeneity of the melt and process
   energy consumed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Key Points <list list-type={''}bulleted{''}> SOD and HOD contribute
   equally to hypoxia hypolimnion thickness affects the relative
   contribution of HOD These observation apply to a wide range of lakes
   The examination of hypoxia in the hypolimnion of large lakes
   traditionally focuses on the assessment of its spatial and temporal
   extent and its effect on water quality. In Lake Erie, hypoxia typically
   occurs between July and October in the central basin; however, there is
   considerable interannual variability both spatially and temporally. The
   processes driving this interannual variability as well as the
   small-scale time variation in oxygen depletion (e.g., -0.7 to +0.3 mg
   L-1 d(-1)) were examined in a field study conducted in the western part
   of the central basin of Lake Erie in 2008 and 2009. Data were obtained
   from a spatial array of moorings as well as sampling cruises that
   examined the physical and biological conditions needed to investigate
   the dynamics of the oxygen depletion and create a vertical oxygen
   budget. The flux of oxygen through the thermocline to the hypolimnion
   was a significant source of oxygen equivalent to approximate to 18\% of
   the total oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion over the stratified
   period. The total oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion was due to
   equivalent amounts of hypolimnetic oxygen demand due to respiration in
   the water column and flux of oxygen to the bottom due to sediment oxygen
   demand. This latter finding was strongly dependent on hypolimnion
   thickness in Lake Erie, which also appeared to be an important parameter
   driving the rate of oxygen depletion by controlling the vertical
   volumetric fluxes and hence the competition between vertical flux and
   community respiration in the hypolimnion of shallow lakes.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive experimental program has been carried out on a 135 mm tip
   diameter radial turbine using a variety of stator designs, in order to
   facilitate direct performance comparisons of varying stator vane
   solidity and the effect of varying the vaneless space. A baseline vaned
   stator was designed using commercial blade design software, having 15
   vanes and a vane trailing edge to rotor leading edge radius ratio
   (R-te/r(le)) of 1.13. Two additional series of stator vanes were
   designed and manufactured; one series having varying vane numbers of 12,
   18, 24, and 30, and a further series with R-te/r(le) ratios of 1.05,
   1.175, 1.20, and 1.25. As part of the design process a series of CFD
   simulations were carried out in order to guide design iterations towards
   achieving a matched flow capacity for each stator. In this way the
   variations in the measured stage efficiency could be attributed to the
   stator passages only, thus allowing direct comparisons to be made.
   Interstage measurements were taken to capture the static pressure
   distribution at the rotor inlet and these measurements were then used to
   validate subsequent numerical models. The overall losses for different
   stators have been quantified and the variations in the measured and
   computed efficiency were used to recommend optimum values of vane
   solidity and R-te/r(le).}},

Abstract = {{Nano-sized (nO-Co3O4, 387 nm) and micron-sized (mO-Co3O4, 6.65 mu m)
   Co3O4 octahedra enclosed by \{111\} facets have been both synthesized
   through a wet chemical method followed by thermal treatment, and served
   as anode material of lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Electrochemical
   results demonstrate that the nO-Co3O4 shows excellent long cyclability
   and rate capability. The nO-Co3O4 can deliver a stable charge capacity
   as high as 955.5 mAh g(-1) up to 200 cycles without noticeable capacity
   fading at a charge/discharge current density of 0.1 A g(-1) (ca. 0.11C).
   The excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the nano-size
   and the \{111\} facets that enclose the octahedra. While the mO-Co3O4
   could only maintain 288.5 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles, illustrating very
   poor cycling performance, which is ascribed to the large particle size
   that may cause huge volume change during repeated charging/discharging
   process. The results reveal that the Co3O4 nanooctahedra would be a
   promising anode material for the next-generation of LIBs. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The Grand Forks complex (GFC) is a metamorphic core complex within the
   composite Shuswap complex in the southern Omineca belt of the Canadian
   Cordillera. It is juxtaposed against the surrounding low-grade rocks of
   the pericratonic Quesnel terrane by outward-dipping Eocene normal
   faults. The GFC attained peak metamorphic conditions of 750-800 degrees
   C and 5.5-6.0 kbar (1 kbar = 100 MPa) in the late Paleocene to early
   Eocene, followed by similar to 2.5 kbar of near-isothermal decompression
   at upper-amphibolite to granulite facies conditions (similar to 725-750
   degrees C) in the early Eocene. Subsequent low-temperature
   greenschist-facies exhumation (similar to 0.7-1.5 kbar) was accommodated
   by the brittle-ductile Kettle River normal fault (KRF) on the east flank
   of the complex and the Granby fault (GF) on the west flank. This study
   presents 16 new Ar-40/Ar-39 hornblende and biotite dates from the GFC
   and low-grade rocks in the hanging walls to the KRF and GF. Cooling of
   the GFC through the closure temperature of hornblende (similar to 530
   degrees C) is constrained to the interval between similar to 54 and 51.4
   +/- 0.5 Ma, whereas cooling through the closure temperature of biotite
   (similar to 280 degrees C) occurred at 51.4 +/- 0.2 Ma. In the hanging
   wall of the KRF, cooling through the closure temperature of hornblende
   and biotite occurred nearly coevally at 51.7 +/- 0.6 Ma and 51.0 +/- 1.0
   Ma, respectively. Five apatite fission track dates (closure temperature
   similar to 110 degrees C) from the GFC and adjacent hanging walls are
   indistinguishable within error, yielding an average age of 34.6 +/- 2.0
   Ma. The lack of difference in biotite and apatite ages between the GFC
   and the low-grade hanging wall rocks against which it is juxtaposed
   suggests no significant movement on the KRF and GF after ca. 51 Ma.
   Results from this study and a previous study on U-Pb dating of the GFC
   document rapid cooling of the GFC in excess of 200 degrees C/Ma in a 4
   Ma interval between 55 and 51 Ma (Eocene). This rapid phase of
   exhumation of the GFC was followed by 15 Ma of slow cooling (similar to
   10 degrees C/Ma) of the joined GFC and hanging wall between similar to
   280 degrees C (biotite closure) and similar to 110 degrees C (apatite
   closure).}},

Abstract = {{A clinical augmented reality guidance system was developed for
   MRI-guided musculoskeletal interventions Magnetic Resonance Image
   Overlay System (MR-IOS). The purpose of this study was to assess MRI
   compatibility, system accuracy, technical efficacy, and operator
   performance of the MR-IOS.
   The impact of the MR-IOS on the MR environment was assessed by measuring
   image quality with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal intensity
   uniformity with the system in various on/off states. The system accuracy
   was assessed with an in-room preclinical experiment by performing 62
   needle insertions on a spine phantom by an expert operator measuring
   entry, depth, angle, and target errors. Technical efficacy and operator
   performance were tested in laboratory by running an experiment with 40
   novice operators (20 using freehand technique versus 20 MR-IOS-guided)
   with each operator inserting 10 needles into a geometric phantom.
   Technical efficacy was measured by comparing the success rates of needle
   insertions between the two operator groups. Operator performance was
   assessed by comparing total procedure times, total needle path distance,
   presumed tissue damage, and speed of individual insertions between the
   two operator groups.
   The MR-IOS maximally altered SNR by 2\% with no perceptible change in
   image quality or uniformity. Accuracy assessment showed mean entry error
   of 1.6 +/- 0.6 mm, depth error of 0.7 +/- 0.5 mm, angle error of 1.5 +/-
   1.1A degrees, and target error of 1.9 +/- 0.8 mm. Technical efficacy
   showed a statistically significant difference (p = 0.031) between
   success rates (freehand 35.0\% vs. MR-IOS 80.95\%). Operator performance
   showed: mean total procedure time of 40.3 +/- 4.4 (s) for freehand and
   37.0 +/- 3.7 (s) for MR-IOS (p = 0.584), needle path distances of 152.6
   +/- 15.0 mm for freehand and 116.9 +/- 8.7 mm for MR-IOS (p = 0.074),
   presumed tissue damage of 7,417.2 +/- 955.6 mm(2) for freehand and
   6062.2 +/- 678.5 mm(2) for MR-IOS (p = 0.347), and speed of insertion
   5.9 +/- 0.4 mm/s for freehand and 4.3 +/- 0.3 mm/s for MR-IOS (p =
   0.003).
   The MR-IOS is compatible within a clinical MR imaging environment,
   accurate for needle placement, technically efficacious, and improves
   operator performance over the unassisted insertion technique. The MR-IOS
   was found to be suitable for further testing in a clinical setting.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe a condition classification technique designed
   to detect fault occurrence in an automotive light assembly during
   endurance testing. Inputs to the classifier are features extracted from
   vibration measurement data. They contain time domain parameters and
   frequency band energy parameters calculated using wavelet packet
   transforms. A support vector machine with Gaussian radial basis function
   kernel is designed for multiclass classification. A multiplex parameter
   estimation is achieved by searching for a minimum bound of the support
   vector count to achieve structural risk minimization. Through
   experiments, we show that the combination of effective feature
   extraction and classification with good generalization capability allows
   the proposed condition-monitoring system to be accurate and reliable.
   Additionally, acoustic signals known to have low signal to noise ratio
   are used as tests. We show that with the proposed methodology, acoustic
   signals can be used with increased sensitivity and accuracy for
   condition-monitoring purposes.}},

Abstract = {{In many coastal areas of North America and Scandinavia, post-glacial
   clay sediments have emerged above sea level due to iso-static uplift.
   These clays are often destabilised by fresh water leaching and
   transformed to so-called quick clays as at the investigated area at
   Smorgrav, Norway. Slight mechanical disturbances of these materials may
   trigger landslides. Since the leaching increases the electrical
   resistivity of quick clay as compared to normal marine clay, the
   application of electromagnetic (EM) methods is of particular interest in
   the study of quick clay structures.
   For the first time, single and joint inversions of direct-current
   resistivity (DCR), radiomagnetotelluric (RMT) and controlled-source
   audiomagnetotelluric (CSAMT) data were applied to delineate a zone of
   quick clay. The resulting 2-D models of electrical resistivity correlate
   excellently with previously published data from a ground conductivity
   metre and resistivity logs from two resistivity cone penetration tests
   (RCPT) into marine clay and quick clay. The RCPT log into the central
   part of the quick clay identifies the electrical resistivity of the
   quick clay structure to lie between 10 and 80 Omega m. In combination
   with the 2-D inversion models, it becomes possible to delineate the
   vertical and horizontal extent of the quick clay zone. As compared to
   the inversions of single data sets, the joint inversion model exhibits
   sharper resistivity contrasts and its resistivity values are more
   characteristic of the expected geology. In our preferred joint inversion
   model, there is a clear demarcation between dry soil, marine clay, quick
   clay and bedrock, which consists of alum shale and limestone. (c) 2013

Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},

Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{233-241}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper the theory of mismatch factor of the terrestrial solar
   spectrum is extended to more accurately represent the irradiance
   available to specific types of photovoltaic (PV) materials from surface
   albedo. Using spectra derived from the SBDART radiative transfer model,
   the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the
   differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of hydrogenated
   amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based PV
   technology compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo
   predictions. In order to quantify this effect for varying representative
   spectra, spectra for cloud optical thicknesses from 0 to 150 were
   investigated. Grass was found to be a poor reflector in the a-Si:H
   spectral response range with a spectrally responsive albedo of 0.08-0.07
   as cloud optical thickness increased from 0 to 150, whereas snow is a
   good reflector with a relatively constant spectrally responsive albedo
   of 0.94 as cloud optical thickness increased from 0 to 150. For c-Si PV
   systems the spectrally responsive albedo for snow and grass were found
   to be 0.87-0.91 and 0.24-0.15 as cloud optical thickness increased from
   0 to 150, respectively. These values can be compared to the albedo
   typically predicted from spectral integration relative to an AM1.5
   spectrum of 0.78 for snow and 0.23 for grass. On a yearly basis, the use
   of improper albedo values can lead to an under-prediction of system
   yields of 0.04\%, 2.4\%, and 10.5\% for systems at 25, 40, and 90 tilt
   from the horizontal, respectively. This can lead to improper PV systems
   optimization and masking of other loss mechanisms. The results of this
   study have implications for both solar systems evaluation and systems
   design, and supports further research on tailoring PV technologies
   specifically to the climate and geographic location where they are
   deployed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to contribute to the theorisation of midlife migration
   into rural areas. Although the factors influencing migration are known
   to be variable at different stages of a person's life, much less well
   understood is how migration decisions at different stages of the life
   course are connected and how post-migration experiences may be
   influenced by an earlier life course stage. We argue that midlife
   migration decisions are the product of the migrant's lifetime
   experiences and influences up until that stage in their life alongside
   their expectations and aspirations for future life course stages. Using
   a case study of the Glens of Antrim (Northern Ireland), this paper
   specifically demonstrates the role of childhood memories to explain
   midlife migration to a rural area. In doing so, it argues that some
   findings more commonly associated with second-generation transnational
   migration are also equally relevant to migration within the UK. Roots
   migration and place attachment alongside the midlife migrant's
   post-migration sense of belonging and permanency are found to be
   influenced by the migrant's earlier memories, behaviours, and
   experiences. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Fundamental mathematical relationships are widespread in biology yet
   there is little information on this topic with regard to human limb bone
   lengths and none related to human limb bone volumes. Forty-six sets of
   ipsilateral upper and lower limb long bones and third digit short bones
   were imaged by computed tomography. Maximum bone lengths were measured
   manually and individual bone volumes calculated from computed tomography
   images using a stereologic method. Length ratios of femur:tibia and
   humerus:ulna were remarkably similar (1.21 and 1.22, respectively) and
   varied little (<7\%) between individuals. The volume ratio of
   femur:tibia was approximately half that of humerus:ulna (1.58 and 3.28,
   respectively; P<0.0001). Lower limb bone volume ratios varied much more
   than upper limb ratios. The relationship between bone length and volume
   was found to be well described by power laws, with R2 values ranging
   from 0.983 to 0.995. The most striking finding was a logarithmic
   periodicity in bone length moving from distal to proximal up the limb
   (upper limb =0.72, lower limb =0.93). These novel data suggest that
   human limb bone lengths and volumes follow fundamental and highly
   conserved mathematical relationships, which may contribute to our
   understanding of normal and disordered growth, stature estimation, and
   biomechanics.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity is the primary risk factor for knee osteoarthritis (OA). Greater
   external knee adduction moments, surrogate measures for medial
   compartment loading, are present in Obese individuals and may predispose
   them to knee OA. Laterally wedged insoles decrease the magnitude of the
   external adduction moment in Obese individuals but it is unknown how
   they alter the center of pressure on the tibial plateau. A gait analysis
   was performed on 14 Obese (avg. 29.3 years; BMI range: 30.351.6kg/m2)
   and 14 lean women (avg. 26.1 years; BMI range: 20.924.6kg/m2) with and
   without a full-length, wedged insole. Computed joint angles, joint
   moments, and knee extensor strength values were input into a
   musculoskeletal model to estimate center of pressure of the contact
   force on the tibial plateau. Statistical significance was assessed using
   a two-way ANOVA to compare the main effects of group and insole
   condition (=0.05). The insole resulted in a significant (p<0.01) lateral
   shift in the center of pressure location in both the Obese and Control
   groups (mean: 2.9 +/- 0.7 and 1.5 +/- 0.7mm, respectively). The insole
   also significantly reduced the peak external knee adduction moment 1.88
   +/- 1.82Nm in the Control group (p<0.01) and 3.62 +/- 3.90Nm in the
   Obese group (p<0.01). The results of this study indicate the effects of
   a prophylactic wedged insole for reducing the magnitude of the load on
   the knee's medial compartment in Obese women who are at risk for knee OA
   development. (c) 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley

Abstract = {{Recently, current source drivers (CSDs) have been proposed to reduce the
   switching loss and gate drive loss in megahertz (MHz) dc-dc converters,
   in which the duty cycle normally has a steady-state value. However,
   different from dc-dc converters, the duty cycle of the power factor
   correction (PFC) converters is modulated fast and has a wide operation
   range during a half-line period in ac-dc applications. In this paper, an
   adaptive full-bridge CSD is proposed for the boost PFC converters. The
   proposed CSD can build adaptive drive current inherently depending on
   the drain current of the main power MOSFET. Compared to the CSDs with
   the constant drive current, the advantage of the adaptive drive current
   is able to reduce the switching loss further when the MOSFET is with a
   higher switching current, while minimize the drive circuit loss when the
   MOSFET is with a lower switching current. Therefore, the adaptive CSD is
   able to realize better design tradeoff between the switching loss and
   drive circuit loss so that the efficiency can be optimized in a wide
   operation range. Furthermore, no additional auxiliary circuit and
   control are needed to realize the adaptive current by the proposed CSD.
   The experimental results verified the functionality and advantages. For
   a 1-MHz/300-W boost PFC converter, the proposed CSD improves the
   efficiency from 89\% using a conventional voltage driver to 92.2\% (an
   improvement of 3.2\%) with 110 V-ac input, 380 V output, and full-load
   condition.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a low cost microcontroller based control method utilizing
   the concept of capacitor charge balance is presented to achieve a
   near-optimal transient response for Buck converters. First, this paper
   presents a new derivation of practical charge balance equations based on
   simplified differential equations. The final implementation does not
   require complex calculations and accurate knowledge of the output filter
   LC parameter. The hardware implementation only requires the output
   voltage information so that no extra sensing circuitry is needed
   compared with voltage mode controller. Also, this algorithm can be
   simply extended to adaptive voltage positioning (AVP) application.
   Second, due to the simplicity of this algorithm, a low cost
   microcontroller unit (MCU) based controller can be implemented to
   shorten the developing period for users. Thirdly, unlike previous work,
   the proposed voltage based CBC (V-CBC) controller does not require
   accurate current sensor or fast analog-to-digital converter (ADC).
   Instead, to detect the critical time instant when the inductor current
   equals the new load current, a practical extreme voltage detector is
   introduced to capture the output voltage peak/valley information.
   Experimental prototype is built to verify the feasibility and advantage
   of the new method.}},

Abstract = {{Strategic supply chain optimization (SCO) problems are often modeled as
   two-stage optimization problems, in which the first-stage variables
   represent decisions on the development of the supply chain and the
   second-stage variables represent decisions on the operations of the
   supply chain. When uncertainty is explicitly considered, the problem
   becomes an intractable infinite-dimensional optimization problem, which
   is usually solved approximately using a scenario or a robust approach.
   This article proposes a novel synergy of the scenario and robust
   approaches for strategic SCO under uncertainty. Two formulations are
   developed, namely, naive robust scenario formulation and affinely
   adjustable robust scenario formulation. It is shown that both
   formulations can be reformulated into tractable deterministic
   optimization problems if the uncertainty is bounded by the infinity norm
   and the uncertain equality constraints can be reformulated into
   deterministic constraints without any assumption about the uncertainty
   region. Case studies of a classical farm planning problem and an energy
   and bioproduct SCO problem demonstrate the advantages of the proposed
   formulations over the classical scenario formulation. The proposed
   formulations not only can generate solutions with guaranteed feasibility
   or indicate infeasibility of a problem, but also can achieve optimal
   expected economic performance with smaller numbers of scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Na-doped Birnessite-type manganese oxide (delta-MnO2) has been
   synthesized using the chemical method and characterized through X-ray
   diffraction and SEM, showing the lamellar structure and high crystal
   structure. A comparative study of the electrochemical performances of
   this material with those of the commercial Cryptomelane-type MnO2 has
   then been undertaken in ten neutral aqueous electrolytes for
   supercapacitor applications. Aqueous electrolytes, containing a lithium
   salt, LiX (where X = SO42-, NO3-, CH3CO2-, CH3SO3-, ClO4-, C7H15CO2-,
   TFSI-, Beti(-), BOB-, or Lact(-)), have been first prepared under
   neutral pH conditions to reach the salt concentration, providing the
   maximum in conductivity. Their transport properties are then
   investigated through conductivities, viscosities, and self-diffusion
   coefficient measurements. Second, the thermal behaviors of these
   electrolytic aqueous solutions are then evaluated by using a
   differential scanning calorimeter from (213.15 to 473.15) K in order to
   access their liquid range temperatures. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) in
   three electrode configurations are thereafter investigated using Na
   Birnessite and Cryptomelane as working electrode material from (-0.05 to
   1.5) V versus Ag/AgCl at various sweep rates from (2 to 100) mV.s(-1).
   According to anion nature/structure and manganese oxide material type,
   different CV responses are observed, presenting a pure capacitive
   profile for Beti(-) or C6H13CO2- and an additional pseudocapacitive
   signal for the smallest anions, such as ClO4- and NO3-. The
   capacitances, energies, and efficiencies are finally calculated. These
   results indicate clearly that electrolytes based on a mineral lithium
   salt under neutral pH condition and high salt concentration (up to 5
   mol.L-1) have better electrochemical performances than organic ones, up
   to 1.4 V with good material stability and capacity retention. The
   relationship between transport properties, electrostatic and steric
   hindrance considerations of hydrated ions, and their electrochemical
   performances is discussed in order to understand further the lithium
   intercalation-deintercalation processes in the lamellar or tunnel
   structure of investigated MnO2.}},

Abstract = {{This work revealed that the interactions between starch, the ionic
   liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ({[}Emim]{[}OAc]), and water
   might contribute to the phase transition (gelatinization, dissolution,
   or both) of native starch at reduced temperature. Using mixtures of
   water and {[}Emim]{[}OAc] at certain ratios (7.2/1 and 10.8/1 mol/mol),
   both the gelatinization and dissolution of the starch occur
   competitively, but also in a synergistic manner. At lower
   {[}Emim]{[}OAc] concentration (water/{[}Emim]{[}OAc] molar ratio >=
   25.0/1), mainly gelatinization occurs which is slightly impeded by the
   strong interaction between water and {[}Emim]{[}OAc]; while at higher
   {[}Emim]{[}OAc] concentration (water/{[}Emim]{[}OAc] molar ratio <=
   2.8/1), the dissolution of starch is the major form of phase transition,
   possibly restricted by the difficulty of {[}Emim]{[}OAc] to interact
   with starch. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Developing an integrated hydrograph separation and lumped modelling
   approach to quantifying hydrological pathways in Irish river catchments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{486}},

Abstract = {{An appreciation of the quantity of streamflow derived from the main
   hydrological pathways involved in transporting diffuse contaminants is
   critical when addressing a wide range of water resource management
   issues. In order to assess hydrological pathway contributions to
   streams, it is necessary to provide feasible upper and lower bounds for
   flows in each pathway. An important first step in this process is to
   provide reliable estimates of the slower responding groundwater pathways
   and subsequently the quicker overland and interflow pathways. This paper
   investigates the effectiveness of a multi-faceted approach applying
   different hydrograph separation techniques, supplemented by lumped
   hydrological modelling, for calculating the Baseflow Index (BFI), for
   the development of an integrated approach to hydrograph separation. A
   semi-distributed, lumped and deterministic rainfall runoff model known
   as NAM has been applied to ten catchments (ranging from 5 to 699 km(2)).
   While this modelling approach is useful as a validation method, NAM
   itself is also an important tool for investigation. These separation
   techniques provide a large variation in BFI, a difference of 0.741
   predicted for BFI in a catchment with the less reliable fixed and
   sliding interval methods and local minima turning point methods
   included. This variation is reduced to 0.167 with these methods omitted.
   The Boughton and Eckhardt algorithms, while quite subjective in their
   use, provide quick and easily implemented approaches for obtaining
   physically realistic hydrograph separations. It is observed that while
   the different separation techniques give varying BFI values for each of
   the catchments, a recharge coefficient approach developed in Ireland,
   when applied in conjunction with the Master Recession Curve tabulation
   method, predict estimates in agreement with those obtained using the NAM
   model, and these estimates are also consistent with the study
   catchments' geology. These two separation methods, in conjunction with
   the NAM model, were selected to form an integrated approach to assessing
   BFI in catchments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   layers), changes in an individual's foraging environment would be
   captured in the chemical signatures in these tissues. To determine
   whether trace elements can be used as a marker to track movement in
   terrestrial carnivores, we resolved multi-elemental data at a fine
   spatial scale in the claw keratin of a model species (Taxidea taxus)
   using high resolution laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectrometry (LA ICP-MS). The unique chemical signatures we detected in
   claws suggested that these chemical variations were, in part, a
   reflection of the chemical environment and were not be attributable to
   sex or random deposition. Neighbouring claw samples were not more
   chemically related than distant ones, which suggests that local
   differences in chemical composition (e.g., habitat type) may have a
   stronger influence on claw chemistry than large-scale patterns in trace
   element variation associated with underlying geology. Our findings
   illustrated that temporally-explicit chemical profiles in the blade horn
   keratin of mammalian claws may be used to examine endogenous uptake of
   trace element signatures from the local environment and serve as tool to
   assist in reconstructing animal movement pathways.}},

Abstract = {{We systematically develop a density functional description for the
   equilibrium properties of a two-dimensional, harmonically trapped,
   spin-polarized dipolar Fermi gas based on the Thomas-Fermi-von
   Weizsacker approximation. We pay particular attention to the
   construction of the two-dimensional kinetic energy functional, where
   corrections beyond the local density approximation must be motivated
   with care. We also present an intuitive derivation of the interaction
   energy functional associated with the dipolar interactions and provide
   physical insight into why it can be represented as a local functional.
   Finally, a simple and highly efficient self-consistent numerical
   procedure is developed to determine the equilibrium density of the
   system for a range of dipole interaction strengths. DOI:

Abstract = {{Cryogel beads, fabricated by the microchannel liquid-flow focusing and
   cryo-polymerization method, have micron-scale supermacropores allowing
   the passage of crude feedstocks, and could be of interest as
   chromatographic adsorbents in bioseparation applications. In this work,
   we provide a rapid freezing and continuous formation method for cryogel
   beads by cryo-polymerization using dry ice particles as the freezing
   source and microchannel liquid-flow focusing using peristaltic pumps for
   the fluid supply. Polyacrylamide (pAAm)-based supermacroporous cryogel
   beads were prepared and grafted with N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate
   (DMAEMA), which provided the anion-exchange cryogel beads with tertiary
   amine functional groups suitable for binding proteins. Properties of the
   supermacroporous cryogel-bead packed bed, i.e., permeability, bed
   voidage, protein breakthrough as well as protein adsorption performance
   by using bovine gamma-globulin as model protein, were experimentally
   investigated. A capillary-based model was employed to characterize the
   supermacroporous bed performance, and gave a reasonable description of
   the microstructure and thus an insight into the flow, dispersion and
   mass transfer behaviors within the cryogel bead-packed bed. The results
   also showed that by using dry ice as the freezing source, it is easy to
   reduce the temperature below -55 to -61 degrees C in the bulk solution,
   causing the rapid formation of ice crystals within the monomer drops,
   and finally effective cryo-polymerization to form supermacropores within
   the cryogel beads. By using peristaltic pumps, continuous preparation
   was achieved and the obtained cryogel beads had favorable properties
   similar to those prepared using syringe pumps in the microchannel
   liquid-flow focusing process. This method is thus expected to be
   interesting in the liter- or even larger-scale preparation of cryogel
   adsorbents. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for early detection and
   classification of breast cancer in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic
   resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is dependent upon the features used by the
   CAD classifier. Here, we show that fast orthogonal search (FOS), which
   provides a more efficient iterative manner of computing stepwise
   regression feature selection, can select features with predictive value
   from a set of kinetic and texture candidate features computed from
   dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images. FOS can in minutes
   search candidate feature sets of millions of terms, which may include
   cross-products of features up to second-, third-or fourth-order. This
   method is tested on a set of 83 DCE-MRI images, of which 20 are for
   cancerous and 63 for benign cases, using a leave-one-out trial. The
   features selected by FOS were used in a FOS predictor and
   nearest-neighbour predictor and had an area under the receiver operating
   curve (AUC) of 0.889 and 0.791 respectively. The FOS predictor AUC is
   significantly improved over the signal enhancement ratio predictor with
   an AUC of 0.706 (p=0.0035 for the difference in the AUCs). Moreover,
   using FOS-selected features in a support vector machine increased the
   AUC over that resulting when the features were manually selected.}},

Abstract = {{We have tested a dissolved oxygen (DO) transport model based on
   large-eddy simulation (LES) of a transitional oscillatory flow observed
   in the bottom boundary layer of Lake Alpnach, Switzerland. The
   transition from a quasi-laminar to a fully turbulent state makes this
   flow difficult to study with a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equation
   (RANSE) model. By resolving the full range of governing transport
   processes, LES provides a reliable prediction of the sediment-oxygen
   uptake (SOU). The model biogeochemical and flow parameters have been
   calibrated against DO and velocity measurements from published in situ
   data at the earliest phase available in the cycle. The fully developed
   flow thus obtained is used as an initial condition for the imposed
   oscillatory forcing. Numerical predictions show that transport in the
   outer layer is in equilibrium with the main current throughout most of
   the cycle and that nonequilibrium effects are limited to the diffusive
   sublayer response to the external forcing. During flow deceleration, the
   concentration boundary layer slowly expands as turbulence decays; later,
   during re-transition, mixing is restored by rapid and intense turbulent
   production events enhancing the SOU with a well-defined time lag. An
   algebraic model for the SOU is proposed for eventual inclusion in RANSE
   biogeochemical management-type models developed based on
   parameterizations used in turbulent mass transfer and with the support
   of published numerical data and the present simulation. The only input
   parameters required are the sediment oxidation rate, bulk temperature
   and DO concentration, and friction velocity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an approach to the control of linear
   teleoperation systems under time delays. Unlike traditional delay-robust
   control systems that guarantee passive communication channel through the
   transmission of wave variables, the new approach uses the concept of
   absolute stability for the physically expressive Lawrence's four-channel
   structure for transmitting the standard power variables, i.e., force and
   position. By incorporating kinesthetic performance requirements, we
   derive an absolutely stable four-channel controller that is transparent
   when time delay is negligible. Experimentally, the study evaluates and
   compares the performance of the proposed controller with that of a
   benchmark wave variable-based controller. The results indicate contact
   stability for large delays, a lack of position drift, and improved
   position and force tracking in both the free motion and rigid contact
   regimes for small delays.}},

   {[}HNO3](aq,init), the \%extraction decreased and then increased for
   {[}C(4)mim]{[}NTf2], while for the other two ionic liquids it increased.
   The \%extraction also increased with residence time in the channel.
   Overall mass transfer coefficients were about 0.2 s(-1) in all TBP/ionic

Abstract = {{Subduction of intraplate seamounts beneath a geochemically depleted

   in lavas from the central Tonga-Kermadec arc front are consistent with
   localized input of subducted alkaline Louisville material (lavas and
   volcaniclastics) into sub-arc partial melts. Furthermore, absolute
   Pacific Plate motion models indicate an anticlockwise rotation in the
   subducted Louisville seamount chain that, combined with estimates of the

Abstract = {{This letter presents a standalone circuit (cell) to reduce the
   third-order inter-modulation distortion (IMD) produced in microwave

   In one path, the amplified signal and the IMD tones pass through toward
   the output. In the other path, an auxiliary FET device biased near
   pinchoff and a tunable phase shifter reproduce the amplifier's IMD tones
   but with the opposite phase as the original tones. When the IMD tones in
   the two paths are combined at the output, they cancel out and the input
   third-order intercept point (IIP3) of the amplifier is improved. The
   cell requires only two tuning voltages: one for the auxiliary FET and
   another for the variable phase shifter. Experimental test results show

Abstract = {{We have developed a new benign means of reversibly breaking emulsions
   and latexes by using switchable water, an aqueous solution of switchable
   ionic strength. The conventional surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
   is not normally stimuli-responsive when CO2 is used as the stimulus but
   becomes CO2-responsive or switchable in the presence of a switchable
   water additive. In particular, changes in the air/water surface tension
   and oil/water interfacial tension can be triggered by addition and
   removal of CO2. A switchable water additive, N,N-dimethylethanolamine
   (DMEA), was found to be an effective and efficient additive for the
   reversible reduction of interfacial tension and can lower the tension of
   the dodecane/water interface in the presence of SDS surfactant to
   ultra-low values at very low additive concentrations. Switchable water
   was successfully used to reversibly break an emulsion containing SDS as
   surfactant, and dodecane as organic liquid. Also, the addition of CO2
   and switchable water can result in aggregation of polystyrene (PS)
   latexes; the later removal of CO2 neutralizes the DMEA and decreases the
   ionic strength allowing for the aggregated PS latex to be redispersed
   and recovered in its original state.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes a novel method of producing multicomponent
   fertiliser granules using high shear granulation. The granulation
   process was optimised using the response surface methodology technique.
   The variables used in the optimisation process include granulation time,
   batch size, impeller speed and binder concentration. Granulation time,
   binder concentration and interaction between the batch size and
   granulation time were found to be the main factors affecting the granule
   median size. The product yield is mainly influenced by granulation time
   and binder concentration. The interaction between the impeller speed and
   batch size also have a significant influence on the product yield.
   Product yield (2-4 mm) of approximately 60\% could be obtained with high
   sphericity and granule strength (>05 MPa). A low product recycle ratio
   of about 2:3 can be obtained at the optimised process conditions,
   compared to typical recycle rations of 6:1 which are obtained in typical
   fertiliser plants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Study of non-uniform bedding support under continuous PVC water
   distribution pipes}},
Journal = {{TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{99-108}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Current design standards for buried pipe installations assume that
   loading and bedding conditions along pipes are uniform, and thus do not
   take into account the effect of soil variability. However, although
   careful attention may be paid during pipe installation, there is still a
   possibility that a pipeline may experience non-uniform loading or
   bedding conditions during its lifetime, which may lead to pipe failure.
   Thus, these conditions should be addressed to understand the
   implications of construction practice and problems that may be detected
   after construction. In this paper, a parametric study employing
   three-dimensional finite element analysis is used to examine a
   continuous PVC water pipe. The objective is to understand the effect of
   non-uniform bedding support on the stability of buried PVC pressure
   pipes, and the longitudinal soil-pipe interaction. The numerical
   analyses are performed using ABAQUS. The results of the finite element
   analyses demonstrate that pipes with discontinuous bedding experience
   stresses higher than those with uniform ground support (37-69\% higher
   for medium dense sand, and 45-95\% higher for dense sand bedding), and
   that it is better to achieve uniform soil support under the pipe invert
   than to achieve non-uniform support in high stiffness (highly compacted)
   bedding (results that support conventional wisdom where a layer of
   uncompacted bedding is used under the invert in preference to well
   compacted bedding that is not level). The analysis also indicates that
   it is more important to achieve that uniform support under the invert
   than dense soil backfill under the haunches. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The ability to discriminate between inks is important for forensic
   document analysis. Here, Raman spectroscopy (RS) and surface-enhanced RS
   have been compared to the traditional document examination techniques of
   video spectral comparison and thin layer chromatography on a population
   of blue and black-coloured liquid and gel inks. It was found that in
   most cases, the Raman techniques provided a similar or better
   discriminating power than the conventional methods. Importantly, this
   study allowed us to determine whether the same underlying changes in
   composition were being exploited by the different methods to
   discriminate between samples. It was found that there was indeed a high
   degree of commonality in the sample pairs being discriminated by the
   various techniques. This work can therefore underpin introduction of
   Raman methods into standard operating procedures for ink analysis since
   it not only measures the extent of discrimination between samples but
   can also explain the origin of the spectral changes that are used to
   distinguish between them. (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd and Crown

Abstract = {{To design tissue-specific bioscaffolds with well-defined properties and
   3-D architecture, methods were developed for preparing porous foams from
   enzyme-solubilized human decellularized adipose tissue (DAT).
   Additionally, a technique was established for fabricating ``bead
   foams{''} comprised of interconnected networks of porous DAT beads fused
   through a controlled freeze-thawing and lyophilization procedure. In
   characterization studies, the foams were stable without the need for
   chemical crosslinking, with properties that could be tuned by
   controlling the protein concentration and freezing rate during
   synthesis. Adipogenic differentiation studies with human adipose-derived
   stem cells (ASCs) suggested that stiffness influenced ASC adipogenesis
   on the foams. In support of our previous work with DAT scaffolds and
   microcarriers, the DAT foams and bead foams strongly supported
   adipogenesis and were also adipo-inductive, as demonstrated by
   glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) enzyme activity, endpoint
   RT-PCR analysis of adipogenic gene expression, and intracellular lipid
   accumulation. Adipogenic differentiation was enhanced on the microporous
   DAT foams, potentially due to increased cell cell interactions in this
   group. In vivo assessment in a subcutaneous Wistar rat model
   demonstrated that the DAT bioscaffolds were well tolerated and
   integrated into the host tissues, supporting angiogenesis and
   adipogenesis. The DAT-based foams induced a strong angiogenic response,
   promoted inflammatory cell migration and gradually resorbed over the
   course of 12 weeks, demonstrating potential as scaffolds for wound
   healing and soft tissue regeneration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, a calibration method to compensate for changes in SEMG
   amplitude with joint angle is introduced. Calibration factors were
   derived from constant amplitude surface electromyogram (SEMG) recordings
   from the biceps brachii (during elbow flexion) and the triceps brachii
   (during elbow extension) across seven elbow joint angles. SEMG data were
   then recorded from the elbow flexors (biceps brachii and
   brachioradialis) and extensors (triceps brachii) during isometric,
   constant force flexion and extension contractions at the same joint
   angles. The resulting force at the wrist was measured. The fast
   orthogonal search method was used to find a mapping between the system
   inputs - estimated SEMG amplitudes and joint angle - and the system
   output - measured force, for both calibrated and non-calibrated SEMG
   data. Models developed with calibrated data yielded a statistically
   significant improvement in force estimation compared to models developed
   with non-calibrated data, suggesting that the calibration method can
   compensate for changes in the SEMG-force relationship with changing
   joint angle. It was also found that the number of non-linear, joint

Abstract = {{A facile and rapid microwave irradiation method was developed to prepare
   ZnS nanoparticles (NPs) using a set of ionic liquids (ILs) based on the
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide anion and different cations of
   1-alkyl-3-methyl-imidazolium. The phases, structures, and optical
   absorption properties of the NPs were determined in depth with X-ray
   powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman
   spectroscopy, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis), diffuse
   reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL).
   The average crystallite size of the ZnS NPs calculated from the XRD
   pattern was of the order of 2.8 nm which exhibits cubic zinc blende
   structure. The energy band gap measurements of NPs were carried out by
   UV and DRS. The results revealed that the ZnS NPs exhibit strong quantum
   confinement effect. The optical band gap energy increases significantly
   compared with those of the bulk ZnS. The refractive indices for
   different ZnS nanosamples and different concentrations of ZnS NPs for a
   typical sample suspended in deionized water were also measured. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This study is the first investigation of biodegradation of carbon
   disulphide (CS2) in soil that provides estimates of degradation rates
   and identifies intermediate degradation products and carbon isotope
   signatures of degradation. Microcosm studies were undertaken under
   anaerobic conditions using soil and groundwater recovered from
   CS2-contaminated sites. Proposed degradation mechanisms were validated
   using equilibrium speciation modelling of concentrations and carbon
   isotope ratios. A first-order degradation rate constant of 1.25 x 10(-2)
   h(-1) was obtained for biological degradation with soil. Carbonyl
   sulphide (COS) and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) were found to be
   intermediates of degradation, but did not accumulate in vials. A
   C-13/C-12 enrichment factor of -7.5 +/- A 0.8 aEuro degrees was obtained
   for degradation within microcosms with both soil and groundwater whereas
   a C-13/C-12 enrichment factor of -23.0 +/- A 2.1 aEuro degrees was
   obtained for degradation with site groundwater alone. It can be
   concluded that biological degradation of both CS2-contaminated soil and
   groundwater is likely to occur in the field suggesting that natural
   attenuation may be an appropriate remedial tool at some sites. The
   presence of biodegradation by-products including COS and H2S indicates
   that biodegradation of CS2 is occurring and stable carbon isotopes are a
   promising tool to quantify CS2 degradation.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The presence of illegal dyes such as the Sudan reds in spices is a
   well-recognised problem, and numerous methods of analysis have been
   described for their determination. However, some spice-derived matrices
   present particular problems. Oleoresins, complex extracts of spices
   containing phenolic natural pigments and terpene-like lipids, are used
   in the formulation of oriental sauces, pickles and processed spiced
   meals and hence likely to penetrate far into the food chain. Described
   herein is a case in which a false positive finding of one of the less
   commonly used illegal dyes in an oleoresin had the potential to trigger
   a costly food recall. Rapid resolution of the false positive by liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) came at the cost of
   subsequent decontamination of the instrument, incurring significant
   downtime. The analytical difficulties posed by the presence of a
   surfactant to improve oleoresin dispersive properties with other foods
   are discussed. We conclude that as LC-UV methods cannot deal with the
   possible matrix interferences, they must not be used for the analyses of
   illegal dyes in spice oleoresins. A combination of gel permeation
   chromatography with liquid-liquid and solid-phase cleanup is described
   that enables facile deployment of LC-MS/MS to an oleoresin-surfactant
   matrix for the forensically robust determination of dimethyl yellow at
   concentrations below the current ``action limit{''} for illegal dyes of
   500 mu g kg(-1).}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{342-354}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The overall aim of this study is to identify factors that influence
   architects' demotivation in design firms. After a review of extant
   literatures in design management, project management, and organisational
   behaviour, a list of 43 demotivating criteria was produced and used in a
   questionnaire survey. Analyses included reliability analysis,
   Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests, demotivation severity index
   (DSI) computation and exploratory factor analysis. Results show an
   underlying factor structure of seven demotivating factors that include
   `organisational injustice', `project induced stress', `dysfunctional
   design team', `poor interpersonal relationships', `perceived career
   decline', `negative leadership behaviours' and `poor organisational
   culture'. Comparing these demotivational factors with motivational
   factors identified from previous related research, this study confirms
   that demotivation and motivation are on the same pole. In addition, what
   causes motivation or demotivation is a function of individual frame of
   reference. This implies that the presence or absence of a factor might
   cause motivation or demotivation depending on an individual frame of
   reference. Positive attention to the identified factors in relation to
   individual personality differences therefore helps to remove impediments
   that could affect employees' well-being such as being downcast,
   dispirited, depressed and despondent. The study would help directors and
   managers of design firms to develop a healthy workforce through
   recognition and eradication of the identified demotivating factors using
   some of the suggested solutions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Title = {{Large-eddy simulation of three-dimensional dunes in a steady,
   unidirectional flow. Part 1. Turbulence statistics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{721}},
Pages = {{454-483}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We performed large-eddy simulations of flow over a series of
   three-dimensional dunes at laboratory scale (Reynolds number based on
   the average channel depth and streamwise velocity was 18 900) using the
   Lagrangian dynamic eddy-viscosity subgrid-scale model. The bedform
   three-dimensionality was imposed by shifting a standard two-dimensional
   dune shape in the streamwise direction according to a sine wave. The
   statistics of the flow are discussed in 10 cases with in-phase and
   staggered crestlines, different deformation amplitudes and wavelengths.
   The results are validated qualitatively against experiments. The
   three-dimensional separation of flow at the crestline alters the
   distribution of wall pressure, which in turn may cause secondary flow
   across the stream, which directs low-momentum fluid, near the bed,
   toward the lobe (the most downstream point on the crestline) and
   high-momentum fluid, near the top surface, toward the saddle (the most
   upstream point on the crestline). The mean flow is characterized by a
   pair of counter-rotating streamwise vortices, with core radius of the
   order of the flow depth. However, for wavelengths smaller than the flow
   depth, the secondary flow exists only near the bed and the mean flow
   away from the bed resembles the two-dimensional case. Staggering the
   crestlines alters the secondary motion; the fastest flow occurs between
   the lobe and the saddle planes, and two pairs of streamwise vortices
   appear (a strong one, centred about the lobe, and a weaker one, coming
   from the previous dune, centred around the saddle). The distribution of
   the wall stress and the focal points of separation and attachment on the
   bed are discussed. The sensitivity of the average reattachment length,
   depends on the induced secondary flow, the streamwise and spanwise
   components of the channel resistance (the skin friction and the form
   drag), and the contribution of the form drag to the total resistance are
   also studied. Three-dimensionality of the bed increases the drag in the
   channel; the form drag contributes more than in the two-dimensional case
   to the resistance, except for the staggered-crest case.
   Turbulent-kinetic energy is increased in the separated shear layer by
   the introduction of three-dimensionality, but its value normalized by
   the plane-averaged wall stress is lower than in the corresponding
   two-dimensional dunes. The upward flow on the stoss side and higher
   deceleration of flow on the lee side over the lobe plane lift and
   broaden the separated shear layer, respectively, affecting the turbulent
   kinetic energy.}},

Abstract = {{Seismic geophysical methods have rarely been used in precision
   agriculture, predominantly due to the perception that they are slow and
   results require a complex evaluation. This paper explores the
   possibility of using a recently developed surface wave seismic
   geophysical approach, the multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW)
   method, for assessment of agricultural compaction. This approach has the
   advantage of being non-intrusive, rapid and is able to produce 2D ground
   models with a relatively high density of spatial sampling points. The
   method, which was tested on a research site in Oakpark, Ireland,
   detected a significant difference in shear wave velocity between a
   heavily compacted headland and an uncompacted location. The results from
   this approach compared favourably with those obtained from measurements
   of bulk density and penetrometer resistance and demonstrate that the
   MASW approach can distinguish between the extreme states of heavily
   compacted and uncompacted soil. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: Autologous osteochondral cartilage repair is a valuable
   reconstruction option for cartilage defects, but the accuracy to harvest
   and deliver osteochondral grafts remains problematic. We investigated
   whether image-guided methods (optically guided and template guided) can
   improve the outcome of these procedures. Design: Fifteen sheep were
   operated to create traumatic chondral injuries in each knee. After 4
   months, the chondral defect in one knee was repaired using (a)
   conventional approach, (b) optically guided method, or (c)
   template-guided method. For both image-guided groups, harvest and
   delivery sites were preoperatively planned using custom-made software.
   During optically guided surgery, instrument position and orientation
   were tracked and superimposed onto the surgical plan. For the
   template-guided group, plastic templates were manufactured to allow an
   exact fit between template and the joint anatomy. Cylindrical holes
   within the template guided surgical tools according to the plan. Three
   months postsurgery, both knees were harvested and computed tomography
   scans were used to compare the reconstructed versus the native
   pre-injury joint surfaces. For each repaired defect, macroscopic
   (International Cartilage Repair Society {[}ICRS]) and histological
   repair (ICRS II) scores were assessed. Results: Three months after
   repair surgery, both image-guided surgical approaches resulted in
   significantly better histology scores compared with the conventional
   approach (improvement by 55\%, P < 0.02). Interestingly, there were no
   significant differences found in cartilage surface reconstruction and
   macroscopic scores between the image-guided and the conventional
   surgeries.}},

Title = {{C. elegans Chemotaxis Assay}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Many organisms use chemotaxis to seek out food sources, avoid noxious
   substances, and find mates. Caenorhabditis elegans has impressive
   chemotaxis behavior.
   The premise behind testing the response of the worms to an odorant is to
   place them in an area and observe the movement evoked in response to an
   odorant. Even with the many available assays, optimizing worm starting
   location relative to both the control and test areas, while minimizing
   the interaction of worms with each other, while maintaining a
   significant sample size remains a work in progress(1-10). The method
   described here aims to address these issues by modifying the assay
   developed by Bargmann et al.(1). A Petri dish is divided into four
   quadrants, two opposite quadrants marked ``Test{''} and two are
   designated ``Control{''}. Anesthetic is placed in all test and control
   sites. The worms are placed in the center of the plate with a circle
   marked around the origin to ensure that non-motile worms will be
   ignored. Utilizing a four-quadrant system rather than one 2 or two 1
   eliminates bias in the movement of the worms, as they are equidistant
   from test and control samples, regardless of which side of the origin
   they began. This circumvents the problem of worms being forced to travel
   through a cluster of other worms to respond to an odorant, which can
   delay worms or force them to take a more circuitous route, yielding an
   incorrect interpretation of their intended path. This method also shows
   practical advantages by having a larger sample size and allowing the
   researcher to run the assay unattended and score the worms once the
   allotted time has expired.}},

Abstract = {{Benzaldehyde, with its apricot and almond-like aroma, is the second most
   abundantly used molecule in the flavor industry, and is most commonly
   produced via chemical routes, such as by the oxidation of toluene.
   Biologically produced benzaldehyde, whether by extraction of plant
   material or via microbial biotransformation, commands a substantial
   price advantage, and greater consumer acceptance. Methylotrophic yeast,
   such as Pichia pastoris, contain the enzyme alcohol oxidase (AOX),
   which, in the presence of alcohols other than methanol, are able to
   yield aldehydes as dead-end products, for example, benzaldehyde from
   benzyl alcohol. In this work, we have determined that benzaldehyde, and
   not benzyl alcohol, is inhibitory to the transformation reaction by P.
   pastoris, prompting the development of a selection strategy for
   identifying sequestering polymers for use in a partitioning bioreactor
   that was based on the ratio of partition coefficients (PCs) for the two
   target molecules. Additionally, we have now confirmed for the first
   time, that the mechanism of solute uptake by amorphous polymers is via
   absorption, not adsorption. Finally, we have adopted a common strategy
   used for the production of heterologous proteins by P. pastoris, namely
   the use of a mixed methanol/glycerol feed for inducing the required AOX
   enzyme, while reducing the time required for high density biomass
   generation. All of these components were combined in a final experiment
   in which 10\% of the polymer Kraton D1102K, whose PC ratio of
   benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol was 14.9, was used to detoxify the
   biotransformation in a 5L partitioning bioreactor, resulting in a
   3.4-fold increase in benzaldehyde produced (14.4g vs. 4.2g) relative to
   single phase operation, at more than double the volumetric productivity
   (97mgL1h1 vs. 41mgL1h1). Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110: 10981105. (c)

Abstract = {{The world requires inexpensive, reliable, and sustainable energy
   sources. Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology, which converts sunlight
   directly into electricity, is an enormously promising solution to our
   energy challenges. This promise increases as the efficiencies are
   improved. One straightforward method of increasing PV device efficiency
   is to utilize multi-junction cells, each of which is responsible for
   absorbing a different range of wavelengths in the solar spectrum. Indium
   gallium nitride (In (x) Ga1-x N) has a variable band gap from 0.7 to 3.4
   eV that covers nearly the whole solar spectrum. In addition, In (x)
   Ga1-x N can be viewed as an ideal candidate PV material for both this
   potential band gap engineering and microstructural engineering in
   nanocolumns that offer optical enhancement. It is clear that In (x)
   Ga1-x N is an extremely versatile potential PV material that enables
   several known photovoltaic device configurations and multi-junctions
   with theoretic efficiencies over 50 pct. This potential is driving
   immense scientific interest in the material system. This paper reviews
   the solar PV technology field and the basic properties of In (x) Ga1-x N
   materials and PV devices. The challenges that remain in realizing a
   high-efficiency In (x) Ga1-x N PV device are summarized along with paths
   for future work. Finally, conclusions are drawn about the potential for
   In (x) Ga1-x N photovoltaic technology in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Density, rho, viscosity, eta, and conductivity, sigma, measurements of
   binary mixtures containing the pyrrolidinium nitrate Protic Ionic Liquid
   (PIL) and propylene carbonate (PC), are determined at the atmospheric
   pressure as a function of the temperature from (283.15 to 353.15) K and
   within the whole composition range. The temperature dependence of both
   the viscosity and conductivity of each mixture exhibits a non-Arrhenius
   behaviour, but is correctly fitted by using the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher
   (VTF) equation. In each case, the best-fit parameters, such as the
   pseudo activation energy, E-a{*} and ideal glass transition temperature,
   T-0 are then extracted. The excess molar volumes V-E, and viscosity
   deviations from the ideality, Delta eta, of each investigated mixture
   were then deduced from the experimental results, as well as, their
   apparent molar volumes, V-phi, thermal expansion coefficients alpha(p),
   and excess Gibbs free energies (Delta G{*}(E)) of activation of viscous
   flow. The V-E, alpha(E)(p), Delta eta values are negative over the whole
   composition range for each studied temperature therein. According to the
   Walden rule, the ionicity of each mixture was then evaluated as a
   function of the temperature from (283.15 to 353.15) K and of the
   composition. Results have been then discussed in terms of molecular
   interactions and molecular structures in this binary mixture. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Support vector machines (SVMs), though accurate, are not preferred in
   applications requiring high classification speed or when deployed in
   systems of limited computational resources, due to the large number of
   support vectors involved in the model. To overcome this problem we have
   devised a primal SVM method with the following properties: (1) it solves
   for the SVM representation without the need to invoke the representer
   theorem, (2) forward and backward selections are combined to approach
   the final globally optimal solution, and (3) a criterion is introduced
   for identification of support vectors leading to a much reduced support
   vector set. In addition to introducing this method the paper analyzes
   the complexity of the algorithm and presents test results on three
   public benchmark problems and a human activity recognition application.
   These applications demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the

Abstract = {{The design of passive biological filters has evolved and current design
   practices are predominantly based on flow (either horizontal or
   vertical) through porous media. To date, no method has been developed to
   accurately estimate the effective life expectancy of these types of
   treatment systems, nor have non-intrusive methods to determine the
   extent of substratum clogging been perfected. This research presents the
   results of tracer studies on various stages of two hybrid-passive
   landfill leachate treatment systems: an aerated pretreatment system
   followed by two different types of vertical-flow through porous media
   treatment systems. The tracer studies were used to assess changes in the
   active volumes of the different stages of the leachate treatment systems
   over a 9-month period. An analytical method, employing the governing
   equations for flow through porous media, was used to quantify the
   changes in saturated hydraulic conductivity in the treatment system
   cells. The results from the analytical method were combined with the
   results from the tracer study to further the understanding of the flow
   and mixing within the treatment system cells. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Many cardiovascular diseases are characterised by the restriction of
   blood flow through arteries. Stents can be expanded within arteries to
   remove such restrictions; however, tissue in-growth into the stent can
   lead to restenosis. In order to predict the long-term efficacy of
   stenting, a mechanobiological model of the arterial tissue reaction to
   stress is required. In this study, a computational model of arterial
   tissue response to stenting is applied to three clinically relevant
   stent designs. We ask the question whether such a mechanobiological
   model can differentiate between stents used clinically, and we compare
   these predictions to a purely mechanical analysis. In doing so, we are
   testing the hypothesis that a mechanobiological model of arterial tissue
   response to injury could predict the long-term outcomes of stent design.
   Finite element analysis of the expansion of three different stent types
   was performed in an idealised, 3D artery. Injury was calculated in the
   arterial tissue using a remaining-life damage mechanics approach. The
   inflammatory response to this initial injury was modelled using
   equations governing variables which represented tissue-degrading species
   and growth factors. Three levels of inflammation response were modelled
   to account for inter-patient variability. A lattice-based model of
   smooth muscle cell behaviour was implemented, treating cells as discrete
   agents governed by local rules.
   The simulations predicted differences between stent designs similar to
   those found in vivo. It showed that the volume of neointima produced
   could be quantified, providing a quantitative comparison of stents. In
   contrast, the differences between stents based on stress alone were
   highly dependent on the choice of comparison criteria. These results
   show that the choice of stress criteria for stent comparisons is
   critical.
   This study shows that mechanobiological modelling may provide a valuable
   tool in stent design, allowing predictions of their long-term efficacy.
   The level of inflammation was shown to affect the sensitivity of the
   model to stent design. If this finding was verified in patients, this
   could suggest that high-inflammation patients may require alternative
   treatments to stenting. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   degrees, from the substrate normal. Films fabricated at 50 degrees vapor
   incidence and greater exhibit triangular-shaped ``microspikes{''}
   scattered seemingly randomly across the surface with areal densities on
   the order of 50 spikes per 10 x 10 micrometer area. SEM analysis reveals
   that the microspikes increase in size with increasing vapor incidence
   angle. Films deposited at glancing vapor incidence angles (80 degrees
   and greater), are composed of inclined nanoscale columnar structures,
   with a high degree of interconnectivity between adjacent columns; where
   microspikes grow randomly from these tilted columns, and the spikes

Title = {{Influence of a boundary on the development of a propeller wash}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{50-55}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{When vessels operate within harbours or over a density interface in an
   estuary, the seabed or interface may be close to the tip of the
   propeller blades. The presence of this boundary will have an effect on
   the propeller wash and this can affect the erosion of the boundary. The
   influence of such a boundary on the characteristics of a propeller wash
   was studied in experiments using a horizontal fixed boundary to confine
   a propeller jet. Detailed velocity measurements within the jet were
   obtained using a 3D Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system. The bottom
   stream of a propeller jet was found to expand at a faster rate due to
   the reduction in pressure beneath the jet caused by the suppression of
   the replacement fluid. The boundary was found to significantly increase
   the axial velocities close to it, and reduce the rate of decay of the
   maximum axial velocity due to the confinement, reducing the height of
   the jet. Three zones within the propeller wash were identified, the
   first being before the jet impacted the boundary, the second in which
   the boundary layer developed at the fixed boundary, followed by a fully
   developed boundary layer region. Predictive equations to estimate the
   influence of the boundary have been developed and are presented. (C)

Abstract = {{Flow responsive passive samplers offer considerable potential in
   nutrient monitoring in catchments; bridging the gap between the
   intermittency of grab sampling and the high cost of automated monitoring
   systems. A commercially available passive sampler was evaluated in a
   number of river systems encapsulating a gradient in storm response,
   combinations of diffuse and point source pressures, and levels of
   phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations. Phosphorus and nitrogen are
   sequestered to a resin matrix in a permeable cartridge positioned in
   line with streamflow. A salt tracer dissolves in proportion to advective
   flow through the cartridge. Multiple deployments of different cartridge
   types were undertaken and the recovery of P and N compared with the
   flow-weighted mean concentration (FWMC) from high-resolution bank-side
   analysers at each site. Results from the passive samplers were variable
   and largely underestimated the FWMC derived from the bank-side
   analysers. Laboratory tests using ambient river samples indicated good
   replication of advective throughflow using pumped water, although this
   appeared not to be a good analogue of river conditions where flow
   divergence was possible. Laboratory tests also showed good nutrient
   retention but not elution and these issues appeared to combine to limit
   the utility in ambient river systems at the small catchment scale.}},

Abstract = {{Future wireless systems face challenges in supporting high-rate
   multimedia streaming with wide coverage area and at low power.
   Cooperative relaying is investigated in the following context: a single
   base station with multiple antennas simultaneously transmits different
   data streams to single-antenna destinations through a set of
   single-antenna fixed relays, with no direct link transmission between
   base stations and destinations. Transmission is via space-division
   multiple access with per-user quality-of-service constraints. The base
   station performs transmit beamforming (precoding) and relays
   cooperatively perform distributed beamforming. To address minimum-power
   source precoding and relay beamforming, the source precoder design with
   a fixed relay beamformer is first considered. Precoding is also
   generalized to multiple cooperating base stations. Next, the relay
   beamformer is optimized for a given source precoder and the process is
   iterated. The formulation is generalized to account for CSI estimates
   obtained from pilot symbol training. Simulation results quantify
   tradeoffs, including numbers of base station antennas and relays, effect
   of CSI quality on performance, as well as the impact of cooperating base
   stations.}},

Abstract = {{Black limestone clasts are present across the globe at modern and
   ancient subaerial exposure surfaces, and in intertidal and supratidal
   environments. These problematic clasts are particularly abundant at
   multiple subaerial exposure surfaces across southern Australia. The
   genesis of such exceptionally preserved dasts can be interpreted through
   universal fabrics across wide geographic regions and geologic ages.
   Regardless of location or age, all south Australian blackened dasts
   studied have a similar microstructure that is dominated by porous
   micritic laminae and chambered tubules. Such laminae are interpreted to
   represent calcified root cells and occur in two different varieties: 1)
   micrite-walled tubules with hollow centers that are thought to represent
   calcification in the rhizosphere or outer surfaces of the root, and 2)
   tubules consistent with calcification of both the medulla and cortex,
   which preserved medulla, cortex, and parenchymatic cells along with
   xylem vessels. Preserved root fabrics are present only in the blackest
   clasts and are consequently thought to be the main mechanism driving
   limestone blackening. The dark coloration in southern Australian clasts
   is derived from the impregnation of partially decayed terrestrial
   organic substances. These organic substances were trapped in the
   cellular structures of roots as they calcified and were subsequently
   prevented from further decay and oxidation. A threshold of approximately
   7-weight \% organic carbon is needed in the insoluble residue to produce
   the distinct black coloration in limestone. This process occurs at the
   base of slightly organic-rich humic soil profiles where they interact
   with underlying carbonate bedrock (B-C soil horizon). Roots both
   physically and chemically (through acid secretion) corrode the
   underlying limestone and provide the calcium bicarbonate needed in the
   root calcification process. Specific semiarid flora have the ability to
   calcify their cellular structures, which could explain why blackened
   clasts occur at only some unconformities. This result means that the
   formation of blackened clasts via root calcification and entrapment of
   organics relies upon specific conditions of semiarid plants and climate
   along with organic soils. Such conditions would be restricted to a
   specific climate regime and when combined with the new proposed
   blackening mechanism herein could help explain their limited
   distribution and occurrences worldwide.}},

   high electrochemical stabilities, especially towards lithium, a unique

Abstract = {{Dye-sensitized solar cells have attracted intense research attention
   owing to their ease of fabrication, cost-effectiveness and high
   efficiency in converting solar energy. Noble platinum is generally used
   as catalytic counter electrode for redox mediators in electrolyte
   solution. Unfortunately, platinum is expensive and non-sustainable for
   long-term applications. Therefore, researchers are facing with the
   challenge of developing low-cost and earth-abundant alternatives. So
   far, rational screening of non-platinum counter electrodes has been
   hamstrung by the lack of understanding about the electrocatalytic
   process of redox mediators on various counter electrodes. Here, using
   first-principle quantum chemical calculations, we studied the
   electrocatalytic process of redox mediators and predicted
   electrocatalytic activity of potential semiconductor counter electrodes.
   On the basis of theoretical predictions, we successfully used rust
   (alpha-Fe2O3) as a new counter electrode catalyst, which demonstrates
   promising electrocatalytic activity towards triiodide reduction at a
   rate comparable to platinum.}},

Abstract = {{Blind steganalysis of JPEG images is addressed by modeling the
   correlations among the DCT coefficients using K-variate (K >= 2) p.d.f.
   estimates (p.d.f.s) constructed by means of Markov random field (MRF)
   cliques. The reasoning of using high variate p.d.f.s together with MRF
   cliques for image steganalysis is explained via a classical detection
   problem. Although our approach has many improvements over the current
   state-of-the-art, it suffers from the high dimensionality and the
   sparseness of the high variate p.d.f.s. The dimensionality problem as
   well as the sparseness problem are solved heuristically by means of
   dimensionality reduction and feature selection algorithms. The detection
   accuracy of the proposed method(s) is evaluated over Memon's (30.000
   images) and Goljan's (1912 images) image sets. It is shown that
   practically applicable steganalysis systems are possible with a suitable
   dimensionality reduction technique and these systems can provide, in
   general, improved detection accuracy over the current state-of-the-art.
   Experimental results also justify this assertion.}},

Title = {{Late Cretaceous subduction of the continental basement of the Maya block
   (Rabinal Granite, central Guatemala): Tectonic implications for the
   geodynamic evolution of Central America}},
Journal = {{GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{625-639}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{The Rabinal Granite is a peraluminous S-type composite pluton formed
   upon partial melting of a metasedimentary source region that fringes the
   southernmost North America plate in central Guatemala. It is therefore
   considered, together with the intruded metasedimentary sequences, to be
   part of the continental basement of the Maya block. This leucocratic
   K-feldspar-plagioclase-quartz-muscovite +/-+/- biotite granite shows
   increasing deformation along its southern margin, where it is cut across
   by the dextral, Late Cretaceous, top-to-the-NE Baja Verapaz shear zone.
   Although it has been recently dated at 562-453 Ma (isotope
   dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry), the new data presented
   here, including laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass
   spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) U-Pb and Ar-40-Ar-39 geochronology and
   electron-probe mineral chemistry, allow us to more precisely establish
   the timing of intrusion and metamorphic overprinting of the Rabinal
   Granite. The zircons dated by LA-ICP-MS indicate a crystallization age
   of 471 (+3)/(-5) Ma (Early Ordovician), as well as abundant inherited
   cores with Pan-African and Mesoproterozoic dates. Laser total fusion
   Ar-Ar analyses of magmatic low-silica muscovite (Si = 6.2-6.4 atoms per
   formula unit) indicate cooling following magmatic crystallization during
   the mid-late Paleozoic and variable extents of resetting of Ordovician
   micas during Cretaceous metamorphism and deformation. The
   pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions of the inferred Ordovician
   metamorphism that produced partial melting of the metasedimentary source
   of the Rabinal Granite and the ascent and crystallization of the
   granitic melt are uncertain, but a clockwise P-T-time path with maximum
   P and T of <8 kbar and 750 degrees C, respectively, is proposed. A
   second thermal event is recognized in recrystallized high-silica
   muscovite (Si up to = 6.8 atoms per formula unit) formed at peak P and T
   of similar to 8.5 kbar and similar to 300 degrees C, respectively. This
   second event, dated at 70.1 +/- 0.6 Ma by means of laser total fusion
   Ar-40-Ar-39 analyses on high-Si muscovite grains, is interpreted to be
   the result of subduction and accretion of the basement of the Maya block
   during the latest Cretaceous, likely in a transpressional tectonic
   regime related to the lateral collision of the Maya block with the
   Pacific (Farallon)-derived Caribbean arc. This finding represents the
   first direct evidence for latest Cretaceous subduction of the
   metamorphic Paleozoic basement of the Maya block, north of the Baja
   Verapaz shear zone.}},

Abstract = {{We present results from a spectroscopic survey of the dwarf spheroidal
   galaxy And XXII and the two extended clusters EC1 and EC2. These three
   objects are candidate satellites of the Triangulum galaxy, M33, which
   itself is likely a satellite of M31. We use the DEep Imaging
   Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) mounted on the Keck II telescope to
   derive radial velocities for candidate member stars of these objects and
   thereby identify the stars that are most likely actual members. 11
   probable stellar members are found for And XXII. We obtain an upper
   limit of sigma(upsilon) < 6.0 kms(-1) for the velocity dispersion of And
   XXII, {[}Fe/H] similar to -1.6 for its metallicity and 255 pc for the
   Plummer radius of its projected density profile. We construct a
   colour-magnitude diagram for And XXII and identify both the red giant
   branch and the horizontal branch. The position of the latter is used to
   derive a heliocentric distance to And XXII of 853 +/- 26 kpc. The
   combination of the radial velocity, distance and angular position of And
   XXII indicate that it is a strong candidate as the first known satellite
   of M33 and one of the very few examples of a galactic satellite of a
   satellite. N-body simulations imply that this conclusion is unchanged
   even if M31 and M33 had a strong encounter in the past few Gyr. We test
   the hypothesis that the extended clusters highlight tidally stripped
   galaxies by searching for an excess cloud of halo-like stars in their
   vicinity. We find such a cloud for the case of EC1 but not for EC2. The
   three objects imply a dynamical mass for M33 that is consistent with
   previous estimates.}},

Abstract = {{The flow in the near-to-intermediate field of a jet emanating from a
   long square pipe is investigated using hot-wire anemometry. The data
   include distributions of the mean and high order turbulence moments over
   8000 < Re < 50 000 along the jet centreline. It is demonstrated that the
   far-field rates of the mean velocity decay and spread, as well as the
   asymptotic value of the streamwise turbulent intensity, all decrease as
   Re increases for Re < 30 000; however, they become approximately
   Re-independent for Re > 30 000. It follows that the critical Reynolds
   number should occur at Re<emph type={''}20{''}>cr = 30 000. Attention is
   given to the exponents associated with the compensated axial velocity
   spectra that show that the inertial subrange calculated according to
   isotropic, homogeneous turbulence emerges at x/D<emph type={''}20{''}>e
   = 30 for all Re; however, if the scaling exponent is altered from m =
   -5/3 to between -1.56 < m < -1.31 the ``inertial{''} range emerges at
   lower values of Re and the exponent is Re dependent. It is also found
   that the exponent agrees very well with Mydlarski and Warhaft
   correlation m = (5/3)(1-3.15R<emph type={''}20{''}>lambda-2/3), where
   R<emph type={''}20{''}>lambda is the Taylor Reynolds number, obtained
   for turbulence decay behind a grid.}},

Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method of audio-visual feature-level fusion
   for person identification where both the speech and facial modalities
   may be corrupted, and there is a lack of prior knowledge about the
   corruption. Furthermore, we assume there are limited amount of training
   data for each modality (e.g., a short training speech segment and a
   single training facial image for each person). A new multimodal feature
   representation and a modified cosine similarity are introduced to
   combine and compare bimodal features with limited training data, as well
   as vastly differing data rates and feature sizes. Optimal feature
   selection and multicondition training are used to reduce the mismatch
   between training and testing, thereby making the system robust to
   unknown bimodal corruption. Experiments have been carried out on a
   bimodal dataset created from the SPIDRE speaker recognition database and
   AR face recognition database with variable noise corruption of speech
   and occlusion in the face images. The system's speaker identification
   performance on the SPIDRE database, and facial identification
   performance on the AR database, is comparable with the literature.
   Combining both modalities using the new method of multimodal fusion
   leads to significantly improved accuracy over the unimodal systems, even
   when both modalities have been corrupted. The new method also shows
   improved identification accuracy compared with the bimodal systems based
   on multicondition model training or missing-feature decoding alone.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach to relay and user selection is proposed using
   threshold-based transmission to reduce outage probability and save
   transmit power. By exploiting properties of dual-hop transmission using
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying, new threshold-based relay and user
   (TRU) selection protocols that employ one-bit channel state information
   (CSI) feedback are proposed for multiple-relay, multiple-user systems.
   These new protocols have the advantages of (1) economical feedback, and
   (2) optional adaptive power-saving transmission. Centralized selection
   (CS) and distributed selection (DS) policies as well as lower-complexity
   suboptimal selection schemes are investigated for downlink transmission.
   Exact expressions for outage probability, outage diversity and feedback
   requirement are provided to quantify the complexity/performance
   trade-offs. The analysis shows that selection threshold(s) can be chosen
   such that transmission is interrupted when system outage is certain,
   which allows power saving without impairing outage performance. These
   protocols are compared in terms of performance, energy-efficiency and
   system requirement to others that trade outage performance for
   additional energy saving and/or reduced complexity.}},

Journal = {{CEMENT \& CONCRETE COMPOSITES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{20-29}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Interest in alkali-activated slag as a construction material is
   increasing, primarily due to its environmentally friendly nature.
   Although strong alkaline activators, such as sodium hydroxide and sodium
   silicate solution, are preferred for high strength, none of them exists
   naturally and their manufacturing process is quite energy intensive.
   Whilst sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) can be obtained from natural resources,
   the early strength of Na2SO4 activated slag is usually low. In this
   paper, the effects of slag fineness and Na2SO4 dosage on strength, pH,
   hydration and microstructure were investigated and compared with those
   of a pure Portland cement (PC). Test results indicated that increasing
   the slag fineness is a more effective approach than increasing Na2SO4
   dosage for increasing both the early and long-term strength of Na2SO4
   activated slags. In addition, increasing the slag fineness can also
   increase the strength without increasing the pH of the hardened matrix,
   which is beneficial for immobilizing certain types of nuclear waste
   containing reactive metals and resins. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel control strategy is presented, which is capable
   of controlling a 12-V-1.5-V main buck converter and an auxiliary circuit

   the charge balance controller minimizes the settling time of the main
   buck converter, the auxiliary circuit is controlled in boundary
   conduction mode (BCM) for a predictable pattern of auxiliary switching
   to reduce the output overshoot. Therefore, the reliability and dynamic
   performance of the entire system is significantly enhanced. Compared
   with existing technologies, the proposed BCM auxiliary switching
   strategy achieves improved output voltage overshoot and reduced
   auxiliary power losses at the same time. Furthermore, numerical analysis
   of the improved output voltage overshoot and reduced auxiliary power
   losses has been conducted for a design guideline. Finally, simulation
   and experimental results are provided to verify the proposed scheme on a

Abstract = {{Fish, benthic macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, biofilm, plankton, and
   terrestrial material were analyzed for stable nitrogen (delta N-15) and
   carbon isotopes (delta C-13) to study the food web structure of a
   double-basined, ultra-oligotrophic lake in northwest Patagonia. The
   delta N-15 values of all biota were consistently higher in Moreno East
   basin, probably caused by a higher anthropogenic impact; however, the
   estimated trophic positions of fish showed no differences between
   basins, indicating that fish are feeding from food chains with different
   delta N-15 baselines. Fish delta C-13 values were higher in Moreno West
   basin but no pattern was observed for the rest of the organisms
   analyzed. The different hydrogeomorphic characteristics between the
   basins could lead to these differences in the C signatures of fish. SIAR
   (Stable Isotope Analysis in R) mixing model was used to study possible
   food sources for adult fish and the results were contrasted with
   published gut content analysis. According to the model, in both basins
   small size fish such as Small Puyen (Galaxias maculatus) and juvenile
   fish, had the highest relative isotopic contribution to introduced
   Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Brook Trout (Salvelinus
   fontinalis), which had lower contributions from other sources such as
   insect larvae, decapods, and snails. On the contrary, decapods and
   insect larvae were isotopically more important for the native Creole
   Perch (Percichthys trucha) than small fish in both basins. An
   ontogenetic shift in the carbon source and trophic level was observed in
   Puyen Chico and Rainbow Trout from the West basin. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Pages = {{62-68}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{A new mesoporous carbon (MCSG60) was developed using an inexpensive
   commercial mesoporous silica gel as a template and sucrose as the carbon
   source. The surface area, porosity and density of the carbon were
   determined. The material possesses a high specific surface area and pore
   volume accessible for most typical aqueous pollutants. The adsorbent
   material was tested in a batch dye adsorption system. The behaviour of
   three reactive dyes adsorbed onto MCSG60 was evaluated (Naphthol Blue
   Black, NBB; Reactive Black 5, RB5; and Remazol Brilliant Blue R, RBBR).
   The maximum adsorption capacities obtained for the dyes were: 270 mg/g
   for NBB; 270 mg/g for RB5; and 280 mg/g for RBBR. Kinetic studies
   indicated that the adsorption process onto the mesoporous carbon was
   rapid and that equilibrium was reached in less than 1 h for all the dye
   systems investigated. Further batch experiments showed MCSG60
   successfully adsorbed the dyes over a wide pH range and at low adsorbate
   concentration. The adsorption potential of MCSG60 for dye removal was
   further evaluated using a fixed-bed adsorption column. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: We report three cases of lateral outfracture of the inferior
   turbinate, which demonstrate a range of changes in the size, position
   and shape of the inferior turbinate.
   Method: During a study of the validity of computer modelling of nasal
   airflow, computed tomography scans of the noses of patients who had
   undergone lateral outfracture of the inferior turbinate were collected.
   The pre-operative scan was compared with the post-operative scan six
   weeks later.
   Results: In one patient, there was only a small lateral displacement of
   the inferior turbinate. In the other two cases, appreciable reduction in
   the volume of one inferior turbinate was noted, in addition to minor
   changes in the shape.
   Conclusion: Lateral outfracture of the inferior turbinate produces
   varied and inconsistent changes in morphology which may affect the
   shape, size and position of the turbinate.}},

Abstract = {{A nonlinear finite element model is developed to analyze beam-column
   T-joints of Rectangular Hollow Sections (RHS) strengthened using
   through-wall bolts. The model was verified using experimental results
   for different beam depth-to-wall thickness (h/t) ratios and different
   bolts configurations and captured the full response and web buckling at
   the vicinity of the column quite well. The model was then used in a
   parametric study to investigate the effects of beam depth-to-width (h/b)
   ratio, span-to-depth (L/h) ratio, column breadth-to-beam depth (B/h)
   ratio, and welding the bolts to the webs, on the ultimate-to-plastic
   moment (M/M-p) ratio. As (L/h) increased from 4.9 to 7.9, (M/M-p)
   increased from 0.57 to 0.77 for the control joints and from 0.71 to 1.0
   for the strengthened joints. Similarly, the limits of (h/b) and (B/h) at
   which strengthening allows the RHS beam to reach its full plastic moment
   are established. Welding the bolts to the beam walls enhanced ductility
   considerably with little increase in strength. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

Abstract = {{T-joints of Hollow Steel Sections (HSSs) are vulnerable to local
   instabilities of the web under the orthogonal compression in both
   members. Unlike W-sections stiffeners cannot be installed inside the
   closed sections. Therefore, alternative strengthening methods are
   needed. This experimental study explored the effectiveness of two
   retrofitting methods by controlling the web buckling of the
   longitudinally compressed 203 x 76 x 3.09 mm chord, which is also
   subjected to transverse axial compression loading through the brace
   member. The web height-to-wall thickness (h/t) ratio of the chord is 65.
   In the first method, 8 mm diameter through-wall steel bolts were used to
   brace the webs of the chord at the vicinity of the brace. In the second
   method, 76 x 185 x 9.5 mm glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) plates
   were adhesively bonded to the two webs of the chord at the brace
   location. Two levels of sustained axial compression load were induced in
   the chord, representing 45\% and 80\% of its full axial capacity, in
   addition to control specimens without axial loads. The transverse brace
   load was then gradually increased to failure. The through-wall steel
   bolts increased the joint capacity by 13-25\%, depending on the chord's
   axial load level, while the bonded GFRP plate increased the capacity by
   38-46\%. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Straw bale construction is a nonconventional technique that involves
   stacking common straw bales and then applying layers of plaster to form
   load-bearing walls. The straw bales provide insulation, whereas the
   plaster protects the bales from moisture and provides strength and
   stiffness for the wall. This technique has experienced a revival because
   of its environmental benefits. Because there are few codes and standards
   for this construction technique, engineers are often required to check
   and approve designs using straw bale construction before building
   permits will be issued. An understanding of the behavior of straw bale
   construction is needed for engineers to approach this system with
   confidence. A model for predicting the response of plastered straw bale
   walls subjected to concentric and eccentric compressive loading was
   proposed in this paper. The model was verified using experimental tests
   of wall panels loaded until failure. The eccentrically loaded specimens
   were found to have load-deflection behavior (lateral and vertical) that
   could be predicted by theoretical models based on the stress-strain
   behavior of the lime-cement plaster. Failure of the specimens was
   observed to occur as a result of compressive failure of the plaster and
   was predicted based on the theoretical models. DOI:

Abstract = {{Interdigitated microelectrode arrays have been exploited to move
   electrolyte via ac electroosmosis. The performance of three dimensional

   This report, to our best knowledge, is the first to describe a 3D
   stepped microelectrode array on a flexible Kapton (R) substrate. The
   Kapton surface was modified to make it capable of bonding with
   poly(dimethylsiloxane) microchannels. The metal electrode was patterned
   by wet etching, a simpler process than previous approaches. Results of
   bonding, bending, and fluidic testing are reported. The frequency
   response obtained using deionized water showed maximum velocities of
   approximately 370 and 180 mu m/s at 5V(pp) for testing with a flat and

Abstract = {{This paper represents the first step in developing an inertial sensor
   system that is capable of assessing post-stroke gait in terms of walking
   speed and temporal gait symmetry. Two inertial sensors were attached at
   the midpoint of each shank to measure the accelerations and angular
   velocity during walking. Despite the abnormalities in hemiparetic gait,
   the angular velocity of most of the testing subjects (12 out of 13)
   exhibited similar characteristics as those from a healthy population,
   enabling walking speed estimation and gait event detection based on the
   pendulum walking model. The results from a standardized 10-meter walk
   test demonstrated that the IMU-based method has an excellent agreement
   with the clinically used stopwatch method. The gait symmetry results
   were comparable with previous studies. The gait segmentation failed when
   the angular velocity deviates significantly from the healthy groups'
   profile. With further development and concurrent validations, the
   inertial sensor-based system may eventually become a useful tool for
   continually monitoring spatio-temporal gait parameters post stroke in a
   natural environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel model describes copolymerization of isobutylene and inimer
   (initiator-monomer) via living carbocationic polymerization. Six
   different propagation rate constants and two types of equilibrium
   reactions are considered. Simplifying assumptions are made to enable
   implementation in PREDICI, so that the molecular weight distribution
   (MWD) could be predicted for molecules with different branching levels.
   Four apparent rate constants were estimated from experimental data with
   <5 branches per molecule. Model predictions provide a good fit to data,
   and simulation results show that polymers with high-branching levels and
   15 inimer units contribute significantly to the MWD, even though their
   concentrations are very low.}},

   hydrodynamic and habitat suitability modelling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Selection of sites for successful restoration of impacted shellfish
   populations depends on understanding the dispersion capability and
   habitat requirements of the species involved. In Strangford Lough,
   Northern Ireland, the horse mussel (Modiolus modiolus) biogenic reefs
   cover only a fraction of their historical range with the remaining reefs
   badly damaged and requiring restoration. Previous experimental trials
   suggest that translocation of horse mussels accelerates reef recovery
   and has therefore been proposed as a suitable restoration technique. We
   used a series of coupled hydrodynamic and particle dispersal models to
   assess larval dispersion from remnant and translocated populations to
   identify suitable areas for adult live M. modiolus translocation in
   Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland. A maximum entropy model (MAXENT) was
   used to identify if dispersing larvae could reach habitat suitable for
   adult M. modiolus. From these we predicted if translocated mussels will
   reseed themselves or be able to act as larval sources for nearby reefs.
   The dispersal models showed that the remnant M. modiolus populations are
   largely self-recruiting with little connectivity between them. The
   majority of larvae settled near the sources and movement was largely
   dependent on the tides and not influenced by wind or waves. Higher reef
   elevation resulted in larvae being able to disperse further away from
   the release point. However, larval numbers away from the source
   population are likely to be too low for successful recruitment There was
   also little connectivity between the Irish Sea and Strangford Lough as
   any larvae entering the Lough remained predominantly in the Strangford
   Narrows. The areas covered by these self-seeding populations are
   suitable for M. modiolus translocation according to the MAXENT model. As
   a result of this work and in conjunction with other field work we
   propose a combination of total protection of all remaining larval
   sources and small scale translocations onto suitable substrata in each
   of the identified self-recruiting areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In situ neutron diffraction loading experiments were carried out on a
   cold-rolled dual-phase (alpha-phase, similar to 10\% beta-phase)
   Zr-2.5\%Nb alloy at room temperature. The specimens were cut at
   different angles from the rolling direction (RD) towards the transverse
   direction (TD), thus the loading axis changes gradually from the rolling
   to transverse direction. Due to the strong texture of the studied alloy,
   and unidirectional nature of deformation twinning, the changing loading
   direction with respect to initial texture has a significant impact on
   the collaborative slip-twinning deformation mode in the hexagonal
   close-packed (hcp) alpha-phase. The present neutron diffraction results
   provide direct evidence of \{1 - 1.2\}< 1-1.-1 > ``tensile{''} twins in
   the alpha-phase of dual-phase Zr-2.5\%Nb alloy at room temperature.
   Additionally, TEM analysis was employed to confirm the presence of
   ``tensile{''} twins, and determine if other type of twins were present.
   It is further clear from the neutron diffraction results that applied
   load is gradually transferred from the plastically softer alpha-phase to
   the plastically harder beta-phase which acts as a reinforcing phase
   having a yield strength in the range 750-900 MPa depending on the
   loading direction. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge when attempting to model biochemical reaction networks
   within the cell is that the dimensionality can become huge, where a
   large number of molecular species can be involved even in relatively
   small networks. This investigation attempts to infer models of these
   networks using a co-evolutionary algorithm that reverse engineers
   differential equation models of the target system from time-series data.
   The algorithm not only estimates the system parameters, but also the
   symbolic structure of the network. To reduce the problem of
   dimensionality, the algorithm uses a partitioning method while
   integrating candidate models in order to decouple system equations. In
   addition, the conventional evolutionary algorithm has been modified and
   extended to include a technique called `eng-genes', where candidate
   models are built up from fundamental mathematical terms derived from
   knowledge about the target system a priori. This technique essentially
   focuses the search on more biologically plausible models. The approach
   is demonstrated on several example reaction networks. The results show
   that the eng-genes method of limiting the term pool using a priori
   knowledge improves the convergence of the reverse engineering process
   compared with the conventional method, resulting in more accurate and
   transparent models.}},

   population. The home environment can enable independence and provide a
   therapeutic place for everyone. As Part M of the building regulations
   are compulsory in all housing and LTHS are mandatory for public sector
   housing, a review of research articles was undertaken on these
   standards. The paper begins with a brief background on accessibility
   regulations, followed by a critical review of the standards that takes
   the body of literature that has been written around them into account.
   This review suggests that the standards should be improved and that
   designers and architects face challenges to creatively incorporate them

Abstract = {{High-pressure (HP) rocks at Tehuitzingo, on the western margin of the HP
   belt within the Paleozoic Acatlan Complex (southern Mexico), occur in a
   klippe that was thrust over low-grade clastic rocks. The youngest
   detrital zircon cluster in the low-grade rocks yielded U-Pb ages of 481
   +/- 16 Ma, which provide an older limit for deposition. The HP rocks are
   composed of metabasites, serpentinite, granite (482 +/- 3 Ma) and mica
   schist (youngest concordant detrital zircon: 433 +/- 3 Ma). The schist
   and granite are inferred to be high-grade equivalents of lower
   Paleozoic, low-grade rocks exposed elsewhere in the Acatlan Complex,
   from which they are inferred to have been removed by subduction erosion.
   Mineral analyses indicate that the subducted rocks underwent HP
   metamorphism and polyphase deformation at depths of similar to 50 km
   (similar to 16 kbar and 750 degrees C: eclogite facies). Subsequent
   retrogression passed through epidote-amphibolite to greenschist fades,
   which was synchronous with W-vergent thrusting over the low-grade
   clastic rocks. Deposition of the low-grade rocks and thrusting are
   bracketed between either 481-329 Ma (Ordovician-Mississippian), and was
   followed by F-3 synformal folding. Cooling through ca. 385 degrees C is
   indicated by 329 +/- 1 and 316-317 +/- 2 Ma, Ar-40/Ar-39 muscovite
   plateau ages in HP rocks, which are 5-17 my younger than those of the
   adjacent Piaxtla eclogites suggesting younger exhumation. The petrology,
   P-T conditions and ages of the Piaxtla Suite is consistent with an
   extrusion channel within the Acatlan Complex along the active western
   margin of Pangea during the Carboniferous. Detrital zircon populations
   in the low-grade psammite (ca. 481, 520-650, 720, 750, 815, 890, 1050
   and 2750 Ma) and the HP schist (ca. 457-480, 534, 908, 954-1150, 1265,

Abstract = {{The behavior of precast concrete beams prestressed using carbon
   fiber-reinforced polymer ( CFRP) rods was studied under the combined
   effects of sustained load and low temperature. Three 13-year-old
   concrete T-beams were tested, including two with CFRP rods stressed to
   different levels and one with steel prestressing strands. Test beams
   were exposed to -27 degrees C while being subjected to a sustained load
   of 25\% of their flexural strength for 163 days. The sustained load was
   equivalent to the service load level and produced cracking in two of the
   beams with the lower prestress levels. Results were then compared to
   those obtained from a set of similar beams subjected to the same
   sustained load at room temperature. Deflection increase under sustained
   load at low temperature was generally small and similar to that at room
   temperature. Prestressing strain decreased as the temperature decreased
   in the CFRP-prestressed beams. Exposure to low temperature likely
   contributed to a 19\% reduction in strength and a change in failure mode
   from flexure to bond failure. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CR.1943-5495.0000045.

Abstract = {{The dielectric properties of pharmaceutical powder-(paracetamol,
   aspirin, lactose, maize starch, adipic acid) solvent (water) mixtures
   were measured at 2,450 MHz at a range of moisture contents (0-1.0 kg
   kg(-1), dry basis) and temperatures (20-70 A degrees C). The dielectric
   constant (epsilon'), loss factor (epsilon aEuro(3)) and penetration
   depth (d (p)) were found to be dependent on frequency, moisture content,
   temperature and powder type. For powder-water mixtures, a linear
   increase in the dielectric properties with moisture content was
   observed, whilst the temperature dependence was of quadratic form. The
   penetration depth was also significantly affected by temperature and
   moisture content. Although, epsilon aEuro(3) also increased with
   increasing temperature, variation with moisture content was temperature
   dependent. This information on dielectric properties is essential for
   mathematical description of the pharmaceutical product temperature
   history during microwave heating and for the design of microwave drying

Abstract = {{Over the last decade there has been a rapid global increase in wind
   power stimulated by energy and climate policies. However, as wind power
   is inherently variable and stochastic over a range of time scales,
   additional system balancing is required to ensure system reliability and
   stability. This paper reviews the technical, policy and market
   challenges to achieving ambitious wind power penetration targets in
   Ireland's All-Island Grid and examines a number of measures proposed to
   address these challenges. Current government policy in Ireland is to
   address these challenges with additional grid reinforcement,
   interconnection and open-cycle gas plant. More recently smart grid
   combined with demand side management and electric vehicles have also
   been presented as options to mitigate the variability of wind power. In
   addition, the transmission system operators have developed wind farm
   specific grid codes requiring improved turbine controls and wind power
   forecasting techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Absolute molecular weight distributions were determined for different
   medium-chain-length poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (MCL PHAs) with
   predominantly 3-hydroxyoctanoate (PHO), 3-hydroxynonanoate (PHN) or
   3-hydroxydodecanoate content. This is the first study to estimate the
   Mark-Houwink constants of these polymers in the commonly employed GPC
   carrier solvent tetrahydrofuran (THF). The absolute molecular weight
   averages were determined via triple-detector size exclusion
   chromatography and combined with analyses using various detectors.
   Unlike with the short-chain-length poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), PHB,
   uncorrected polystyrene calibration in THF provided a good estimate
   (within 10 \%) of absolute MW values for these MCL PHAs, irrespective of
   side chain length. Weight-average MW values ranged from 172,000 Da for
   PHO to 18,200 for PHN with 30 mol\% 3-hydroxyheptanoate, and
   dispersities of all samples were close to two. Melt viscosity data
   suggested an entanglement molecular weight around 8 x 10(4) Da,
   significantly higher than most polymers.}},

Title = {{Characterization of biologically active insulin-loaded alginate
   microparticles prepared by spray drying}},
Journal = {{DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND INDUSTRIAL PHARMACY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{457-465}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Spray drying has been used as a means to encapsulate
   therapeutics in polymeric matrices to improve stability and alter
   pharmacokinetics. This research aims to characterize alginate
   microparticles formed by spray drying to encapsulate insulin for
   therapeutic delivery applications.
   Methods: Particle size was characterized by laser diffraction
   spectroscopy, morphology by scanning electron microscopy, and protein
   and polymer distribution by confocal laser scanning microscopy. In
   addition, particle fines collected from the spray-dryer exhaust unit
   were characterized for size and morphology. The insulin encapsulation
   efficiency (EE) was determined after particle dissolution through
   quantification by spectrophotometric analysis. An in-vitro bioassay
   involving stimulation of rat L6 myoblasts was developed to confirm the
   bioactivity of released insulin.
   Results: Mean diameter of the product was 2.1 +/- 0.3 mu m. Larger
   particles appeared spherical, with some smaller particles presenting
   surface topography variability and divoting. Protein EE was 38.2\% +/-
   9.5\%, with confocal microscopy showing the protein and polymer
   concentrated at the surface of larger particles, but more evenly
   distributed throughout smaller particles. A bioassay for the in-vitro
   quantification of insulin bioactivity was developed by calibrating the
   ratio of phosphorylated to total cellular protein kinase B (PKB; also
   known as AKT). in insulin-stimulated rat L6 myoblasts. Insulin released
   from the particles was 88\% +/- 15\% bioactive, showing that spray
   drying had minimal impact on protein structure.
   Conclusion: Spray drying was effective in producing microparticles
   containing bioactive insulin. Future studies will focus on the
   improvement of the EE and particle uniformity with the aim of developing
   this technology further for the encapsulation and delivery of peptide or
   protein-based therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new three-phase phase-locked loop (PLL) system
   that primarily estimates the phase angles, frequency, and magnitudes of
   the a three-phase input signal and also provides a filtered version of
   the input. It is then extended to the estimation of sequence components,
   their magnitudes, and phase angles. As compared with the conventional
   three-phase PLL, this method does not suffer from errors that are caused
   by signal unbalance and dc offset. It also provides estimate for several
   other variables which are not included in the conventional three-phase
   PLL. As compared with the method of using three independent single-phase
   enhanced PLLs, the proposed method offers a simpler structure. Moreover,
   the estimated frequency is more accurate and smoother because it uses
   the information from all three phases to estimate a single value for
   frequency. The paper also presents a modification that makes the PLL
   parameters independent from the input signal amplitude. The same
   modification is applicable to existing methods such as conventional
   three-phase PLL. Simulation and experimental results are presented to
   confirm desirable performance of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{The interrelations between microstructure and rheology of melt
   compounded poly(ethylene-cooctene) (EOC) based nanocomposites containing
   low amounts of silica (SiO2) nanoparticles were studied. In the presence
   of a maleated EOC compatibilizer, hydrogen bonds are established between
   the silanol groups located on the surface of the particles and the
   succinic anhydride functionality of the compatibilizer, resulting in
   improved filler dispersion during compounding and the formation of a
   bound layer of polymer surrounding the particles. This layer alters the
   interface between the bulk polymeric matrix and the particles,
   influencing the linear viscoelastic (LVE) response. The compatibilized
   composites exhibited a more stable response in time sweeps and a higher
   critical strain for the onset of nonlinearity, compared to their
   noncompatibilized counterparts. Superposition of small angle oscillatory
   shear and creep/creep recovery experiments revealed enhancements in the
   LVE functions in the absence of a compatibilizer, which are attributed
   to the increased hydrodynamic effect due to increased propensity for
   particle aggregation, and to the direct interactions between the polymer
   chains and the surface of the filler. On the contrary these effects were
   moderated in the case of the compatibilized composites, due to the
   presence of the bound layer of polymer surrounding the particles. (C)

Abstract = {{Amidine-based switchable surfactants can be used as stabilizers during
   emulsion polymerization, and the resulting latexes can then be
   destabilized simply by the removal of CO2. Polystyrene and poly( methyl
   methacrylate {[}MMA]) latexes have been successfully redispersed by
   reintroducing CO2 to the latex, as shown by recovery of primary particle
   size, but an input of energy was required. Sonication is the most
   effective method of energy input, but lower-energy methods, such as
   rotor-stators and a blender, are successful in redispersing some
   aggregated latexes. Colloidal stability was found to be reversible for
   at least three aggregation/redispersion cycles, and redispersibility was
   achieved even after the removal of water and addition of fresh water.
   The traditional method of aggregating latexes involves addition of
   salts, acids or bases, which result in a contaminated wastewater stream.
   Furthermore, aggregated latexes cannot usually be redispersed. This
   approach could enable dewatering of latexes prior to transport followed
   by redispersion at the point of use, yielding significantly reduced
   transportation costs and energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Time-resolved DRIFTS, MS, and resistance measurements were used to study
   the interaction of undoped and Pd-doped SnO2 with H-2 in air and argon
   at 300 degrees C. Using first-order kinetics, we compare the time
   constants for the resistance drop and its partial recovery with those of
   the surface hydroxyl evolution and water formation in the gas phase upon
   exposure to hydrogen. In the case of the undoped oxide, resistance and
   bridging hydroxyls (BOHs) evolve similarly, manifesting a fast main drop
   followed by recovery at a similar rate. The rate of water formation for
   this material was found to be much slower than that of the main drop in
   both the resistance and BOHs. In contrast, the resistance change for
   SnO2-Pd appeared to be similar to that of water formation, and no
   correlation was found between the evolution of resistance and surface
   OHs. Isotopic exchange on both materials revealed that water formation
   occurs via fast and slow hydrogen transfer to surface oxygen species.
   While the former originates from just-adsorbed hydrogen, the latter
   appears to proceed from the preadsorbed OHs. Both surfaces exhibit close
   interaction between chemisorbed oxygen and existing bridging OH groups,
   indicating that the latter is an intermediate in the hydrogen oxidation
   and generation of donor states on the surface.}},

Abstract = {{We present both experimental and theoretical investigations of a

   the triplet sidebands may spectrally broaden or narrow with increasing
   detuning. Based on a polaron master equation approach, which includes
   electron-phonon interaction nonperturbatively, we derive a fully
   analytical expression for the spectrum. With respect to detuning
   dependence, we identify a crossover between the regimes of spectral
   sideband narrowing or broadening. We also predict regimes of
   phonon-induced squeezing and anti-squeezing of the spectral resonances.

Abstract = {{The study aim was to develop and apply an experimental technique to
   determine the biomechanical effect of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and
   calcium phosphate (Cap) cement on the stiffness and strength of
   augmented vertebrae following traumatic fracture. Twelve burst type
   fractures were generated in porcine three-vertebra segments. The
   specimens were randomly split into two groups (n=6), imaged using
   microCT and tested under axial loading. The two groups of fractured
   specimens underwent a vertebroplasty procedure, one group was augmented
   with CaP cement designed and developed at Queen's University Belfast.
   The other group was augmented with PMMA cement (WHW Plastics, Hull, UK).
   The specimens were imaged and re-tested. An intact single vertebra
   specimen group (n=12) was also imaged and tested under axial loading. A
   significant decrease (p<0.01) was found between the stiffness of the
   fractured and intact groups, demonstrating that the fractures generated
   were sufficiently severe, to adversely affect mechanical behaviour.
   Significant increase (p< 0.01) in failure load was found for the
   specimen group augmented with the PMMA cement compared to the
   pre-augmentation group, conversely, no significant increase (p<0.01) was
   found in the failure load of the specimens augmented with CaP cement,
   this is attributed to the significantly (p<0.05) lower volume of CaP
   cement that was successfully injected into the fracture, compared to the
   PMMA cement. The effect of the percentage of cement fracture fill,
   cement modulus on the specimen stiffness and ultimate failure load could
   be investigated further by using the methods developed within this study
   to test a more injectable CaP cement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Radiochromic micelle gel dosimeters are promising for three-dimensional
   (3D) radiation dosimetry because they can be read out by optical CT
   techniques and they have superior spatial stability compared to polymer
   and Fricke gel dosimeters. This study evaluates the use of diacetylenes
   as reporter molecules in micelle gel dosimeters. Several gels containing
   pentacosa-10,12-diynoic acid (PCDA) emulsified using sodium dodecyl
   sulfate (SDS) changed from colourless to blue upon irradiation.
   Unfortunately, all phantoms that experienced a colour change were turbid
   and would be unsuitable for 3D dosimetry. Two techniques (use of organic
   solvent and aqueous-phase additives) were successful in increasing
   colloidal stability to prevent the turbidity problem, but none of the
   resulting transparent gels changed colour in response to radiation.
   Transparent PCDA emulsions were prepared using NaOH solutions with no
   SDS or other emulsifier, but these transparent emulsions also did not
   change colour. Only turbid gels and emulsions with precipitated
   particles responded to radiation. These results indicate that the colour
   change was due to the oligomerization within precipitated PCDA crystals,
   and that liquid-phase emulsified PCDA did not undergo oligomerization.
   As a result, PCDA is not suitable for use in micelle gel dosimeters, and
   other radiochromic reporter molecules will need to be identified.}},

Abstract = {{Practical demonstration of the operational advantages gained through the
   use of a co-operating retrodirective array (RDA) basestation and Van
   Atta node arrangements is discussed. The system exploits a number of
   inherent RDA features to provide analogue real time multifunctional
   operation at low physical complexity. An active dual-conversion four
   element RDA is used as the power distribution source (basestation) while
   simultaneously achieving a receive sensitivity level of -109 dBm and 3
   dB automatic beam steering angle of +/- 45 degrees. When mobile units
   are each equipped with a semi-passive four element Van Atta array, it is
   shown mobile device orientation issues are mitigated and optimal energy
   transfer can occur because of automatic beam formation resulting from
   retrodirective self-pointing action. We show that operation in multipath
   rich environments with or without line of sight acts to reduce average
   power density limits in the operating volume with high energy density
   occurring at mobile nodes sites only. The system described can be used
   as a full duplex ASK communications link, or, as a means for remote node
   charging by wireless means, thereby enhancing deployment opportunities
   between un-stabilised moving platforms.}},

Abstract = {{The dominance of old pre-event water in headwater storm runoff has been
   recorded in numerous upland catchment studies; however, the mechanisms
   by which this pre-event water enters the stream channel are poorly
   understood. Understanding these processes is fundamental to determining
   the controls on surface water quality and associated impacts on stream
   ecology. Previous studies in the upland forested catchment of the Afon
   Hafren (River Severn) at Plynlimon, mid-Wales, identified an active
   bedrock groundwater system that was discharging into the stream channel
   during storm response. Detailed analysis showed that these discharges
   were small and could not account for the majority of pre-event storm
   water response identified at this site; pre-event storm runoff had to be
   sourced predominantly from further upstream. An intensive stream survey
   was used to determine the spatial nature of groundwatersurface water
   (GWSW) interactions in the Hafren Catchment. Detailed physico-chemical
   in-stream profiling identified a marked change in water quality
   indicating a significant discrete point of bedrock groundwater discharge
   upstream of the Hafren Transect study site. The in-stream profiling
   showed the importance of high spatial resolution sampling as a key to
   understanding processes of GWSW interaction and how quick and
   cost-effective measurements of specific electrical conductance of stream
   waters could be used to highlight in-stream heterogeneity. This approach
   is recommended for use in headwater catchments for initial
   characterisation of the stream channel in order to better locate
   instrumentation and to determine more effective targeted sampling
   protocols in upland catchment research. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the design of a linear-in-the-parameters (LITP)
   regression classifier for two-class problems. Most existing algorithms
   generally learn a classifier (model) from the available training data
   based on some stopping criterions, such as the Akaike's final prediction
   error (FPE). The drawback here is that the classifier obtained is then
   not directly obtained based on its generalization capability. The main
   objective of this paper is to improve the sparsity and generalization
   capability of a classifier, while reducing the computational expense in
   producing it. This is achieved by proposing an automatic two-stage
   locally regularized classifier construction (TSLRCC) method using the
   extreme learning machine (ELM). In this new algorithm, the nonlinear
   parameters in each term, such as the width of the Gaussian function and
   the power of a polynomial term, are firstly determined by the ELM. An
   initial classifier is then generated by the direct evaluation of these
   candidates models according to the leave-one-out (LOO) misclassification
   rate in the first stage. The significance of each selected regressor
   term is also checked and insignificant ones are replaced in the second
   stage. To reduce the computational complexity, a proper regression
   context is defined which allows fast implementation of the proposed
   method. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
   technique. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Are Alkyl Sulfate-Based Protic and Aprotic Ionic Liquids Stable with
   Water and Alcohols? A Thermodynamic Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B}},

Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The knowledge of the chemical stability as a function of the temperature
   of ionic liquids (ILs) in the presence of other molecules such as water
   is crucial prior to developing any no GO industrial application and
   process involving these novel materials. Fluid phase equilibria and
   density over a large range of temperature and composition can give basic
   information on IL purity and chemical stability. The IL scientific
   community requires accurate measurements accessed from reference data.
   In this work, the stability of different alkyl sulfate-based ILs in the
   presence of water and various alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 1-butanol,
   and 1-octanol) was investigated to understand their stability as a
   function of temperature up to 423.15 K over the hydrolysis and
   transesterification reactions, respectively. From this investigation, it
   was clear that methyl sulfate- and ethyl sulfate-based ILs are not
   stable in the presence of water, since hydrolysis of the methyl sulfate
   or ethyl sulfate anions to methanol or ethanol and hydrogenate anion is
   undoubtedly observed. Such observations could help to explain the
   differences observed for the physical properties published in the
   literature by various groups. Furthermore, it appears that a
   thermodynamic equilibrium process drives these hydrolysis reactions. In
   other words, these hydrolysis reactions are in fact reversible,
   providing the possibility to re-form the desired alkyl sulfate anions by
   a simple transesterification reaction between hydrogen sulfate-based ILs
   and the corresponding alcohol (methanol or ethanol). Additionally, butyl
   sulfate- and octyl sulfate-based ILs appear to follow this pattern but
   under more drastic conditions. In these systems, hydrolysis is observed
   in both cases after several months for temperatures up to 423 K in the
   presence of water. Therein, the partial miscibility of hydrogen
   sulfate-based ILs with long chain alcohols (1-butanol and 1-octanol) can
   help to explain the enhanced hydrolytic stability of the butyl sulfate-
   and octyl sulfate-based ILs compared with the methyl or ethyl sulfate
   systems. Additionally, rapid transesterification reactions are observed
   during liquid-liquid equilibrium studies as a function of temperature
   for binary systems of (hydrogen sulfate-based ionic liquids + 1-butanol)
   and of (hydrogen sulfate-based ionic liquids + 1-octanol). Finally, this
   atom-efficient catalyst-free transesterification reaction between
   hydrogen sulfate-based ILs and alcohol was then tested to provide a
   novel way to synthesize new ILs with various anion structures containing
   the alkyl sulfate group.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, nitroxide-mediated controlled copolymerization (NMP) of
   methyl methacrylate (MMA) using BlocBuilder unimolecular initiator was
   found to require much less controlling comonomer when using
   9-(4-vinylbenzyl)-9H-carbazole (VBK) compared to styrene (S) as a
   comonomer (minimum similar to 1 mol \% VBK versus 4.4 mol \% S). Here,
   we explored why this was the case. Initially, the use of
   dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent in the copolymerization of MMA/S was
   studied as the MMA/VBK copolymerizations were done in DMF. The results
   confirmed that the increased effectiveness of VBK as a controlling
   comonomer was not due to the solvent or other experimental conditions.
   Second, the propagation rate constant k(P,VBK) and various <
   k(P)>(MMA/VBK) for MMA/VBK copolymerizations were determined using
   pulsed laser polymerization-size exclusion chromatography (PLP-SEC), and
   the dissociation rate constants k(d,VBK) for the VBK-BlocBuilder adduct
   and PVBK chains were determined using electron paramagnetic resonance
   (EPR) spectroscopy, showing that k(d) for VBK was very similar to S and
   < k(P)>(MMA/VBK) was very similar to k(P,MMA). Finally, modeling of the
   system using PREDICI was done and illustrated that the difference in
   reactivity ratios between MMA/S and MMA/VBK was ultimately one of the
   major reasons for the increased control of VBK versus S. This study
   showed that propagation rate of the copolymerization and equilibrium
   constant for the dormant/active species are not the only parameters that
   govern controlled NMP, and the effect of reactivity ratios between the
   methacrylate and the controlling comonomer must also be considered for
   the controlled nitroxide-mediated copolymerization of methacrylate-rich
   mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Ion-conducting polymers are important materials for a variety of
   electrochemical applications. Perfluorinated ionomers, such as Nafion,
   are the benchmark materials for proton conduction and are widely used in
   fuel cells and other electrochemical devices including solar-fuel
   generators, chlor-alkali cells, and redox flow batteries. While the
   behavior of Nafion in bulk membranes (10 to 100s mu m thick) has been
   studied extensively, understanding its properties under thin-film
   confinement is limited. Elucidating the behavior of thin Nafion films is
   particularly important for the optimization of fuel-cell catalyst layers
   or vapor-operated solar-fuel generators, where a thin film of ionomer is
   responsible for the transport of ions to and from the active
   electrocatalytic centers. Using a combination of transport-property
   measurements and structural characterization, this work demonstrates
   that confinement of Nafion in thin films induced thickness-dependent
   proton conductivity and ionic-domain structure. Confining Nafion films
   to thicknesses below 50 nm on a silicon substrate results in a loss of
   microphase separation of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains, which
   drastically increases the material's water uptake while in turn
   decreasing its ionic conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Composites of multiwalled carbon nanotubes with poly(ethylene
   terephthalate) (PET-MWCNT) with up to 3 vol\% MWCNTs were prepared and
   characterized by broad-band AC conductivity and dielectric spectroscopy
   up to the infrared range using several techniques. A very low electrical
   percolation threshold of 0.07 vol\% MWCNTs was revealed from the
   low-frequency conductivity plateau as well as from DC conductivity,
   whose values show the same critical power dependence on MWCNT
   concentration with the exponent t = 4.3. Above the plateau, the AC
   conductivity increases with frequency up to the THz range, where it
   becomes overlapped with the absorption of vibrational modes. The
   temperature dependence down to similar to 5 K has shown semiconductor
   behaviour with a concentration-independent but weakly
   temperature-dependent small activation energy of similar to 3 meV. The
   behaviour is compatible with the previously suggested
   fluctuation-induced tunnelling conductivity model through a thin
   (similar to 1 nm) polymer contact layer among the adjacent MWCNTs within
   percolated clusters. At higher frequencies, deviations from the simple
   universal conductivity behaviour are observed, indicating some
   distribution of energy barriers for an electron hopping mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, we present a comparative study of the thermophysical properties
   of two homologous ionic liquids, namely, trirnethyl-sulfonium
   bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]-imide, {[}S-111]{[}TFSI], and
   trimethyl-ammonium bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide,
   {[}HN111]{[}TFSI], and their mixtures with propylene carbonate,
   acetonitrile, or gamma butyrolactone as a function of temperature and
   composition. The influence of solvent addition on the viscosity,
   conductivity, and thermal properties of IL solutions was studied as a
   function of the solvent mole fraction from the maximum solubility of IL,
   x(g), in each solvent to the pure solvent. In this case, x(s) is the
   composition corresponding to the maximum salt solubility in each liquid
   solvent at a given temperature from 258.15 to 353.15 K. The effect of
   temperature on the transport properties of each binary mixture was then
   investigated by fitting the experimental data using Arrhenius' law and
   the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) equation. The experimental data shows
   that the residual conductivity at low temperature, e.g., 263.15 K of
   each binary mixture is exceptionally high. For example, conductivity
   values up to 35 and 42 mS.cm(-1) were observed in the case of the
   {[}S-111]{[}TFSI] + ACN and {[}HN111]{[}TFSI] + ACN binary mixtures,
   respectively. Subsequently, a theoretical approach based on the
   conductivity and on the viscosity of electrolytes was formulated by
   treating the migration of ions as a dynamical process governed by
   ion-ion and solvent-ion interactions. Within this model, viscosity data
   sets were first analyzed using the Jones-Dole equation. Using this
   theoretical approach, excellent agreement was obtained between the
   experimental and calculated conductivities for the binary mixtures
   investigated at 298.15 K as a function of the composition up to the
   maximum solubility of the IL. Finally, the thermal characterization of
   the IL solutions, using DSC measurements, showed a number of features
   corresponding to different solid-solid phase transitions, Ts-s, with
   extremely low melting entropies, indicating a strong organizational
   structure by easy rotation of methyl group. These ILs can be classified
   as plastic crystal materials and are promising as ambient-temperature
   solid electrolytes.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(ethylene succinate)/SiO2 nanocomposites were prepared in situ with
   different SiO2 contents. C-13 NMR spectra revealed that the hydroxyl end
   groups of poly(ethylene succinate) could form covalent bonds with the
   surface silanol groups of SiO2. These interactions had a significant
   positive effect on the molecular weight and mechanical properties of the
   nanocomposites. TEM revealed homogeneous dispersion of the
   nanoparticles, with some aggregates appearing at higher concentrations.
   Crystallization under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions was
   extensively studied. The nanoparticles acted as a nucleating agent and
   the nucleation activity was calculated for non-isothermal melt- and
   cold-crystallization. Activation energy of non-isothermal
   cold-crystallization was estimated using the iso-conversional method of
   Friedman. Moreover, crystallization kinetics were analysed and
   spherulitic morphology also examined. The enzymatic hydrolysis rate of
   the nanocomposites was slowed down by the incorporation of the inorganic
   nanoparticles, attributed to the smaller available biodegradable surface
   and the existence of branched and crosslinked macromolecules. (C) 2012

   little is understood concerning the impact of extreme events in
   otherwise temperate environments. Internal stone temperatures (5cm)
   collected during the atypical cold extreme experienced, throughout the
   UK, in December 2010 show a difference between ambient air temperatures
   and aspect-related thermal differences, particularly concerning
   temperature lows and the influence of radiative heating. In this case,
   debris release was not visible; however, laboratory simulations have
   shown that under such conditions, surface loss does not necessarily
   negate the occurrence of internal stone modifications. This preparatory
   sequence of change demonstrates that surface loss is not the result of
   one process, but rather many operating over time to sufficiently
   decrease stone strength to facilitate obvious damage.}},

Abstract = {{The conventional radial basis function (RBF) network optimization
   methods, such as orthogonal least squares or the two-stage selection,
   can produce a sparse network with satisfactory generalization
   capability. However, the RBF width, as a nonlinear parameter in the
   network, is not easy to determine. In the aforementioned methods, the
   width is always pre-determined, either by trial-and-error, or generated
   randomly. Furthermore, all hidden nodes share the same RBF width. This
   will inevitably reduce the network performance, and more RBF centres may
   then be needed to meet a desired modelling specification. In this paper
   we investigate a new two-stage construction algorithm for RBF networks.
   It utilizes the particle swarm optimization method to search for the
   optimal RBF centres and their associated widths. Although the new method
   needs more computation than conventional approaches, it can greatly
   reduce the model size and improve model generalization performance. The
   effectiveness of the proposed technique is confirmed by two numerical
   simulation examples.}},

Abstract = {{Wilcoxite, (Mg0.81Mn0.07Fe0.04Zn0.04)(Sigma 0.96)Al-1.01(SO4)(2)F-1.02
   center dot 17H(2)O, is a secondary sulfate mineral that occurs in
   hydrothermal systems containing significant amounts of fluorine. A
   sample of wilcoxite was collected from abandoned mine workings east of
   Rico, Dolores Co., Colorado, U. S. A., where it occurs as white,
   efflorescent crusts composed of small anhedral crystals within a timber
   crib that protected the material from direct exposure to rain and snow,
   but not from changes in the humidity and temperature of the atmosphere.
   It is remarkable that this highly hydrated mineral has remained stable
   under these conditions. Unit cell dimensions are a 6.644(1), b 6.749(2),
   and c 14.892(3) angstrom, alpha 79.664(4)degrees, beta 80.113(4)degrees,
   gamma 62.487(3)degrees, and V 579.6(2) angstrom(3), space group P The
   previously unknown crystal structure was determined from single-crystal
   X-ray diffraction data and consists of isolated sulfate tetrahedra,
   Mg(H2O)(6) octahedra, and Al(H2O,F)(6) octahedra connected only through
   hydrogen bonding involving additional water molecules. Wilcoxite has 1.5
   water molecules per sulfate tetrahedron that do not participate in the
   formation of an Al(H2O,F)(6) or Mg(H2O)(6) octahedron. The water
   molecules held within the epsomite (MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O) structure
   are lost if the relative humidity (RH) drops below 50\% at 298 K, and
   hexahydrite (MgSO4 center dot 6H(2)O) loses water to form starkeyite
   (MgSO4 center dot 4H(2)O) at 40\% RH at 298 K. The fact that wilcoxite,
   with such a high water content, is stable when the magnesium sulfate
   with which it coexists has become starkeyite indicates that water
   molecules are more tightly bonded within the wilcoxite structure. If
   epsomite crystals are warmed slightly they slowly become first
   translucent and then an opaque white powder, whereas wilcoxite does not
   dehydrate but abruptly melts when warmed. This behavior is similar to
   the incongruent melting of meridianiite (MgSO4 center dot 11H(2)O) on
   warming above 2 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Infiltration is often assumed to occur with little or no impedance from
   the air within the vadose zone. If this assumption is not valid air
   counterflow may occur, while the infiltration rate and degree of
   saturation within the transmission zone may be significantly reduced.
   Accurate predictions of infiltration rates are important for
   applications such as moisture balance calculations and predictions of
   pore water pressures in landslide triggering. Existing results for
   confined infiltration show contradictory evidence for either air
   pressure remaining at a threshold or continual increase of air pressure.
   In this paper, the effect of air entrapment is investigated in the
   laboratory using recently developed techniques of unsaturated
   transparent porous media and digital photograph interpretation. These
   techniques enable the full saturation profile to be quantified every 5
   s. The experimental data are used to quantify the decrease in
   infiltration rate and degree of saturation within the transmission zone
   in the confined infiltration, to accurately locate the wetting front,
   and to assess the stability of the wetting front. The results confirm
   previous observations in which infiltration in an open system was
   observed to occur significantly faster than in a closed system. However,
   in this study, the air pressure ahead of the wetting front was observed
   to reach a threshold value, which was a function of the ponding height
   and suction at the wetting front. A Green-Ampt infiltration model based
   on this observation of air confinement was observed to provide a better
   fit to the experimental data than the one based on the continual
   increase in air pressure assumption. Citation: Siemens, G. A., S. B.

Abstract = {{Ultrasound (US) radio-frequency (RF) time series is an effective tissue
   classification method that enables accurate cancer diagnosis, but the
   mechanisms underlying this method are not completely understood. This
   paper presents a model to describe the variations in tissue temperature
   and sound speed that take place during the RF time series scanning
   procedures and relate these variations to US backscattering. The model
   was used to derive four novel characterization features. These features
   were used to classify three animal tissues, and they obtained accuracies
   as high as 88.01\%. The performance of the proposed features was
   compared with RF time series features proposed in a previous study. The
   results indicated that the US-induced variations in tissue temperature
   and sound speed, which were used to derive the proposed features, were
   important contributors to the tissue typing capabilities of the RF time
   series. Simulations carried out to estimate the heating induced during
   the scanning procedure employed in this study showed temperature rises
   lower than 2 degrees C. The model and results presented in this paper
   can be used to improve the RF time series.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of ultrasonic and thermo-chemical pre-treatments on the
   methane production potential of anaerobic co-digestion with synthetic
   kitchen waste (KW) or fat, oil and grease (FOG) were investigated.
   Non-linear regressions were fitted to accurately assess and compare the
   methane production from co-digestion under the various pre-treatment
   conditions and to achieve representative simulations and predictions.
   Ultrasonic pre-treatment was not found to improve methane production
   effectively from either FOG co-digestion or KW co-digestions.
   Thermo-chemical pre-treatment could increase methane production yields
   from both FOG and KW co-digestions. COD solubilization was found to
   effectively represent the effects of pre-treatment. A comprehensive
   evaluation indicated that the thermo-chemical pre-treatments of pH = 10,
   55 degrees C and pH = 8, 55 degrees C provided the best conditions to
   increase methane production from FOG and KW co-digestions, respectively.
   The most effective enhancement of biogas production (288 +/- 0.85 mL
   CH4/g TVS) was achieved from thermo-chemically pre-treated FOG
   co-digestion, which was 9.9 +/- 1.5\% higher than FOG co-digestion
   without thermo-chemical pre-treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Granular anchors are a relatively new concept in ground engineering with
   relatively little known regarding their load-displacement behaviour,
   failure modes, ultimate pullout capacity, and also potential
   applications. A granular anchor consists of three main components: a
   base plate, tendon, and compacted granular backfill. The tendon is used
   to transmit the applied load to the base plate, which compresses the
   granular material to form the anchor. A study of the load-displacement
   response and ultimate pullout capacity of granular anchors constructed
   in intact lodgement till and made ground deposits is reported in this
   paper. Parallel tests were also performed on cast in situ concrete
   anchors, which are traditionally used for anchoring purposes. A new
   method of analysis for the determination of the ultimate pullout
   capacity of granular anchors is presented and verified experimentally,
   with the dominant mode of failure controlled by the column length (L) to
   diameter (D) ratio. Granular anchors with L/D > 7 principally failed by
   bulging whereas short granular anchors failed on shaft resistance, with
   the latter mobilizing similar pullout capacities as conventional
   concrete anchors.}},

Abstract = {{The leachate characteristics and clogging of the leachate collection
   system at the Keele Valley Landfill is examined using the numerical
   model ``BioClog{''}. The calculated effluent leachate concentrations (e.
   g., the chemical oxygen demand and calcium concentrations) and
   calculated calcium fraction in the clog material are in encouraging
   agreement with measured field data. A new practical model is developed
   and calibrated against the data from the sophisticated numerical model
   to estimate the service life of leachate collection systems in typical
   municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. The procedures for using the new
   practical model are provided and illustrated by examples. Design charts
   are presented that may aid the design of leachate collection systems for

Title = {{Paleoenvironmental analysis of Ediacaran strata in the Catalina Dome,

Abstract = {{Ediacaran strata in the Conception and St. John's groups that are
   exposed in the Catalina Dome, eastern Newfoundland, comprise a
   succession that is thinner but otherwise broadly similar to that known
   from the well-studied outcrops near Mistaken Point in southern Avalon
   Peninsula and Spaniard's Bay in northern Avalon. In all of these areas,
   strata consist of turbidites deposited in deep-water basin-plain and
   slope environments, but important differences help to constrain
   interpretations of basin history and Ediacaran paleobiology of eastern
   Newfoundland. A turbidite paleocurrent shift from easterly to southerly
   is consistent with the existing two-phase tectonic model for basin
   evolution previously proposed for the Avalon Peninsula. In the Catalina
   Dome, however, this shift occurred stratigraphically higher than at
   Mistaken Point but lower than at Spaniards Bay in the Avalon Peninsula.
   Probable seismoturbidites are common in the lower part of the Catalina
   succession, suggesting particularly active tectonism. Except in the very
   lowest 20 m of the succession (Drook and lowermost Mistaken Point
   formations) in which ash is absent, volcanic ash beds are both more
   common and more volumetrically significant throughout the succession
   than farther to the south and east, which suggests that deposition
   occurred closer to the volcanic arc. Volcanic ash beds persist higher
   stratigraphically, occurring within the Fermeuse Formation, which here
   contains diverse rangeomorph fossils in contrast with the low-diversity
   assemblage of Ediacaran discs prevalent in the Fermeuse Formation of the
   Avalon Peninsula. This distribution strongly reaffirms the importance of
   taphonomy in controlling the composition of deep-water Ediacaran
   assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we report direct observations on heavy ion (Kr2+)
   irradiation induced changes in microstructures of pure Zr at different
   temperatures using intermediate voltage electron microscopy. Thin TEM
   foils were irradiated with 1 MeV Kr2+ ions. Materials have been
   irradiated to different damage levels ranging from 0.008 dpa to 1 dpa at
   different temperatures ranging from 300 degrees C to 500 degrees C. We
   particularly concentrate on yield of small defects directly occurring
   from cascade collapse at very low doses, and their evolution as the dose
   increases. In situ observation of growth and evolution of these small
   defects into complex defect structures at high dose has been carried
   out. Irradiation of materials at different temperatures provided an
   opportunity to investigate the temperature dependence of defect
   accumulation in Zr during irradiation. The differences in defect
   structures, defect densities, and therefore dynamic growth have been
   discussed in detail as a function of irradiation parameters (dose,
   temperature). Interaction of irradiation induced defects with existing
   microstructure and other defects is discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In shallow waters, such as those found close to berth structures, the
   wash from a manoeuvring ship's propeller can cause erosion of the
   seabed. This erosion can be increased if the wash intersects a berth
   structure. A number of researchers have undertaken model studies and
   used regression analysis to develop predictive relationships for the
   scouring action. This paper presents an experimental investigation with
   Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), used to analyse the results. The
   purpose of using ANNs was to examine the prediction accuracy of the
   Networks in comparison with previous regression analysis methods. ANNs
   were found to provide a more accurate method of predicting propeller
   wash scour than the equations presented by previous investigators. (C)

Abstract = {{The selective hydrogenation of ,-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones has
   been studied using ketoisophorone and cinnamaldehyde as model substrates
   using manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2) based
   catalysts. For the first time, OMS-2 has been shown to be an efficient
   and selective hydrogenation catalyst. High selectivities for either the
   CC or CO double bond at approximate to 100\% conversion were achieved by
   using OMS-2 and platinum supported on OMS-2 catalysts. Density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the dissociation of H2
   on OMS-2 was water assisted and occurred on the surface Mn of OMS-2(001)
   that had been modified by an adsorbed H2O molecule. The theoretically
   calculated activation barrier was in good agreement with the
   experimentally determined value for the hydrogenation reactions,
   indicating that H2 dissociation on OMS-2 is likely to be the
   rate-determining step. A significant increase in the rate of reaction
   was observed in the presence of Pt as a result of the enhancement of H2
   dissociative adsorption and subsequent reaction on the Pt or spillover
   of the hydrogen to the OMS-2 support. The relative adsorption strengths
   of ketoisophorone and cinnamaldehyde on the OMS-2 support compared with
   the Pt were found to determine the product selectivity.}},

Abstract = {{A mu(2)-process in the Ullmann-type C-O coupling of potassium phenolate
   and 4-chloropyridine was successfully performed in a combined microwave
   (MW) and microflow process. Selective MW absorption in a micro-fixed-bed
   reactor (mu-FBR) by using a supported Cu nanocatalyst resulted in an
   increased activity compared to an oil-bath heated process. Yields of up
   to 80\% were attained by using a multisegmented m-FBR without
   significant catalyst deactivation. The mu-FBR was packed with beads
   coated with Cu/TiO2 and CuZn/TiO2 catalysts. Temperature measurements
   along axial positions of the reactor were performed by using a
   fiber-optic probe in the catalyst bed. The simultaneous application of
   MW power and temperature sensors resulted in an isothermal reactor at 20
   W. Initially, only solvent was used to adjust the MW field density in
   the cavity and optimize the power utility. Subsequently, the reaction
   mixture was added to ensure the maximum MW power transfer by adjusting
   the waveguide stub tuners to steady-state operations as a result of the
   changed reaction mixture composition and, therefore, the dielectric
   properties. Finally, the beneficial influence of the Cu/TiO2- and
   CuZn/TiO2-coated glass beads (200 mm) on the MW absorption as a result
   of the additional absorbing effect of the metallic Cu nanoparticles was
   optimized in a fine-tuning step. For the catalyst synthesis, various
   sol-gel, deposition, and impregnation methods provided Cu catalyst
   loadings of around 1 wt\%. The addition of Zn to the Cu nanocatalyst
   revealed an increased catalyst activity owing to the presence of stable
   Cu-0. Multilaminar mixing was necessary because of the large difference
   in fluid viscosities. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
   first extended experimental survey of the decisive parameters to combine
   microprocess and single-mode MW technology following the concepts of
   ``novel process windows{''} for organic syntheses.}},

Title = {{A New Gradient Descent Approach for Local Learning of Fuzzy Neural
   Models}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{30-44}},

Abstract = {{The majority of reported learning methods for Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK)
   fuzzy neural models to date mainly focus on improvement of their
   accuracy. However, one of the key design requirements in building an
   interpretable fuzzy model is that each obtained rule consequent must
   match well with the system local behavior when all the rules are
   aggregated to produce the overall system output. This is one of the
   distinctive characteristics from black-box models such as neural
   networks. Therefore, how to find a desirable set of fuzzy partitions
   and, hence, identify the corresponding consequent models which can be
   directly explained in terms of system behavior, presents a critical step
   in fuzzy neural modeling. In this paper, a new learning approach
   considering both nonlinear parameters in the rule premises and linear
   parameters in the rule consequents is proposed. Unlike the conventional
   two-stage optimization procedure widely practiced in the field where the
   two sets of parameters are optimized separately, the consequent
   parameters are transformed into a dependent set on the premise
   parameters, thereby enabling the introduction of a new integrated
   gradient descent learning approach. Thus, a new Jacobian matrix is
   proposed and efficiently computed to achieve a more accurate
   approximation of the cost function by using the second-order
   Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method. Several other interpretability

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel voltage-based charge balance control algorithm is
   presented, which is suitable for both digital and analog implementations
   for buck converter to achieve nearo-ptimal dynamic performance. First,
   this paper presents a new derivation of practical charge balance
   equations based on simplified differential equations. This deviation is
   applicable to both fast input voltage and load step transients. The
   final algorithm does not require complex calculations and accurate
   knowledge of the output filter LC parameter. Second, the proposed
   voltage-based charge balance controller does not require accurate
   current sensor or fast analog-to-digital converter. Instead, to detect
   the critical time instant when the inductor current equals the new load
   current, a practical extreme voltage detector is introduced to capture
   the output voltage peak/valley information. Third, this algorithm is
   simple to be implemented by either low-cost digital signal processing
   devices (such as microcontroller unit) or analog circuits. Both digital
   and analog experimental prototypes are built to verify the feasibility
   and advantages of the new method.}},

Abstract = {{A new energy-efficient tunable pulse generator is presented in this
   paper using 0.13-mu m CMOS technology for short-range high-data-rate
   3.110.6GHz ultra-wideband applications. A ring oscillator consisting of
   current-starved CMOS inverters is quickly switched on and off for the
   duration of the pulse, and the amplitude envelope is shaped with a
   variable passive CMOS attenuator. The variable passive attenuator is
   controlled using an impulse that is created by a low-power glitch
   generator (CMOS NOR gate). The glitch generator combines the falling
   edge of the clock and its delayed inverse, allowing the duration of the
   impulse to be changed over a wide range (500900ps) by varying the delay
   between the edges. The pulses generated with this technique can provide
   a sharp frequency roll off with high out-of-band rejection to help meet
   the Federal Communications Commission mask. The entire circuit operates
   in switched mode with a low average power consumption of less than 3.8mW
   at 910MHz pulse repetition frequency or below 4.2pJ of energy per pulse.
   It occupies a total area of 725x600 mu m2 including bonding pads and
   decoupling capacitors, and the active circuit area is only 360x200 mu

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{166-179}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A study was undertaken at the Creighton Mine, near Sudbury, Canada, to
   investigate the relationships between geologic structure, stress, and
   seismicity. Creighton Mine hosts numerous families of shear zones and
   experiences frequent microseismic and often macroseismic events.
   Underground structural mapping as well as microstructural and kinematic
   analysis are used to characterize faults. Fault geometries are then
   compared to those derived from seismic event focal mechanisms. Focal
   mechanism information is next used for stress inversion to obtain
   estimates of in-situ principal stresses for three spatial clusters of
   events on the 7400-foot (2256 m) level. Fault characteristics are then
   integrated into a numerical discontinuum model of the 7400-foot level of
   the mine to examine the distribution of stresses in the study volume.
   The synthesis of these elements is used to determine the sources of
   seismicity within the deepest levels of the mine. The major shear zones
   within the mine have not been found to contribute to seismicity via
   fault-slip but do influence the flow of stress around the main
   excavation. An anomalous cluster of microseismic events is postulated to
   be a result of induced stresses from mine development on deeper levels.

Abstract = {{The fate and cycling of two selected POPs is investigated for the North
   Sea system with an improved version of a fate and transport ocean model
   (FANTOM). The model uses atmospheric data from the EMEP MSC East POP
   model (Gusev et al., 2009), giving reasonable concentrations and
   seasonal distributions for the entire region, as opposed to the three
   observation stations that Ilyina et al. (2006) were limited to. Other
   model improvements include changes in the calculation of POP exchange
   between the water column and sediment. We chose to simulate the fate of
   two POPs with very different properties, gamma-HCH and PCB 153. Since
   the fate and cycling of POPs are strongly affected by hydrodynamic
   processes, a high resolution version of the Hamburg Shelf Ocean Model
   (HAMSOM) was developed and utilised. Simulations were made for the
   period 1996-2005. Both models were validated by comparing results with
   available data, which showed that the simulations were of very
   satisfactory quality.
   Model results show that the North Sea is a net sink for gamma-HCH and a
   net source to the atmosphere of PCB 153. Total masses of gamma-HCH and
   PCB 153 in 2005 are reduced to 30\% and 50\%, respectively, of 1996
   values.
   Storms resuspending bottom sediments into the water column mobilise POPs
   into the atmosphere and have the potential to deliver substantial loads
   of these POPs into Europe. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study is designed to understand further implications of
   using multivariate loadings for the correction of background signal,
   which has previously been shown to be highly reproducible even for very
   low quality signals. Singular value decomposition (SVD)-based background
   correction was compared with the traditional per-signal paradigm for a
   biomedical dataset to generate qualitative and quantitative models. The
   qualitative effect on a principal component analysis model and the
   quantitative effect on a partial least square regression model were
   assessed for these background correction methods. The chosen
   quantitative parameter was the concentration of a pathologically
   relevant protein modification, pentosidine. Of the approaches tested,
   the SVD-based paradigm provided the regression model with the highest
   correlations, highest accuracy (lowest standard error of prediction) and
   repeatability (lowest sampling error). Contrasted against the
   traditional approaches, it was determined that the improved accuracy and
   repeatability of the SVD-based approach arises from its ability to
   simultaneously handle very complex background shapes alongside the
   complex variation in biochemical species that resulted in Raman signals
   with incompatible baseline regions. A better understanding of the
   interaction of SVD-based baseline correction, and data will give the
   reader more insight into the potential applicability of the procedure
   for other datasets. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We present some aspects of photon counting to study scintillators at low
   temperatures. A time-to-digital converter (TDC) had been configured to
   acquire several-minute-long streams of data, simplifying the multiple
   photon counting coincidence technique. Results in terms of light yield
   and time structure of a ZnWO4 scintillator are comparable to those
   obtained with a fast digitizer. Streaming data also provides flexibility
   in analyzing the data, in terms of coincidence window between the
   channels, and acquisition window of individual channels. We discuss the
   effect of changing these parameters, and use them to confirm low-energy
   features in the spectra of the number of detected photons, such as the
   60 keV line from Am-241 in the ZnWO4 sample. We lastly use the TDC to
   study the transmission of the optical cryostat employed in these studies
   at various temperatures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We study the dynamics of vortices in finite temperature atomic

   {[}Science 329, 1182 (2010)] in which real-time dynamics of a single

   formalism based on a dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the
   condensate coupled to a semiclassical Boltzmann equation for the thermal
   cloud, we find a rapid nonlinear increase of both the decay rate and
   precession frequency with increasing temperatures. The increase, which
   is dominated by the dynamical condensate-thermal coupling is also
   dependent on the intrinsic thermal cloud collisional dynamics; the
   precession frequency also varies with the initial radial coordinate. The
   integrated thermal cloud density in the vortex core is for the most part
   independent of the position of the vortex (except when it is near the
   condensate edge), with its value increasing with temperature. This could
   potentially be used as a variant to the method of Coddington et al.

Abstract = {{The influence of annealing above the glass transition temperature (T-g)
   on chain entanglement and molecular dynamics of solution-cast
   poly(methyl methacrylate)/poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) (PMMA/SMA)
   blends was investigated via a combination of dynamic rheological
   measurement and broadband dielectric spectroscopy. Chain entanglement
   density increases when the annealing temperature and/or time increases,
   resulting from the increased efficiency of chain packing and
   entanglement recovery. The results of the annealing treatment without
   cooling revealed that the increase of the entanglement density occurred
   during the annealing process instead of the subsequent cooling
   procedure. Annealing above T-g exerts a profound effect on segmental
   motion, including the transition temperature and dynamics. Namely, T-g
   shifts to higher temperatures and the relaxation time (tau(max))
   increases due to the increased entanglement density and decreased
   molecular mobility. Either T-g or tau(max) approaches an equilibrium
   value gradually, corresponding to the equilibrium entanglement density
   that might be obtained through the theoretical predictions. However, no
   obvious distribution broadening is observed due to the unchanged
   heterogeneous dynamics. Furthermore, side group rotational motion could
   be freely achieved without overcoming the chain entanglement resistance.
   Hence, neither the dynamics nor the distribution width of the subglass
   relaxation (beta- and gamma-relaxation) processes is affected by chain
   entanglement resulting from annealing, indicating that the local
   environment of the segments is unchanged.}},

Abstract = {{Tea waste (TW) and Date pits (DP) were investigated for their potential
   to remove toxic Cr(VI) ions from aqueous solution. Investigations showed
   that the majority of the bound Cr(VI) ions were reduced to Cr(III) after
   biosorption at acidic conditions. The electrons for the reduction of
   Cr(VI) may have been donated from the TW and DP biomasses. The
   experimental data obtained for Cr(VI)-TW and Cr(VI)-DP at different
   solution temperatures indicate a multilayer type biosorption, which
   explains why the Sips isotherm accurately represents the experimental
   data obtained in this study. The Sips maximum biosorption capacities of
   Cr(VI) onto TW and DP were 5.768 and 3.199 mmol/g at 333 K,
   respectively, which is comparatively superior to most other low-cost
   biomaterials. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis of the
   metal loaded biosorbents confirmed the participation of -COOH, -NH2 and
   -O-CH3 groups in the reduction and complexation of chromium.
   Thermodynamic parameters demonstrated that the biosorption of Cr(VI)
   onto TW and DP biomass was endothermic, spontaneous and feasible at
   303-333 K. The results evidently indicated that tea waste and date pits
   would be suitable biosorbents for Cr(VI) in wastewater under specific
   conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{224-233}},

Abstract = {{The importance of accurately measuring gas diffusivity in porous
   materials has led to a number of methods being developed. In this study
   the Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) reactor and Flux Response
   Technology (FRT) have been used to examine the diffusivity in the
   washcoat supported on cordierite monoliths. Herein, the molecular
   diffusion of propane within four monoliths with differently prepared
   alumina/CeZrOx washcoats was investigated as a function of temperature.
   Moment-based analysis of the observed TAP responses led to the
   calculation of the apparent intermediate gas constant, K-p, that
   characterises adsorption into the mesoporous network and apparent time
   delay, tau(app), that characterises residence time in the mesoporous
   network. Additionally, FRT has been successfully adapted as an extensive
   in situ perturbation technique in measuring intraphase diffusion
   coefficients in the washcoats of the same four monolith samples. The
   diffusion coefficients obtained by moment-based analysis of TAP
   responses are larger than the coefficients determined by zero length
   column (ZLC) analysis of flux response profiles with measured values of
   the same monolith samples between 20 and 100 degrees C ranging from 2-5
   x 10(-9) m(2) s(-1) to 4-8 x 10(-10) m(2) s(-1), respectively. The TAP
   and FRT data, therefore, provide a range of the lower and upper limits
   of diffusivity, respectively. The reported activation energies and
   diffusivities clearly correlate with the difference in the washcoat
   structure of different monolith samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

   power in the wire. We are able to control the final resistance of the
   point contact precisely below 5 k Omega and to within a factor of three
   when the target resistance approaches 12 k Omega where only a single

Abstract = {{The solid matrix of the porous cathode catalyst layer (CCL) of a polymer
   electrolyte fuel cell is made of two different materials (carbon with
   supported Pt and ionomer), which are characterized by different
   wettability (i.e. contact angles). This paper discusses the need for
   considering the combined consideration of the mixed wettability and the
   distributed pore structure of CCL in modelling the transport of liquid
   water and oxygen gas. A simple 1-D model that considers two different
   pore size distributions, derived from experimental capillary pressure
   saturation literature data, for the hydrophobic and hydrophilic pores is
   presented. The results indicate that for water to be transported in
   liquid-state through the CCL, the liquid saturation is such that only
   very small hydrophobic pores remain available for gas transport such
   that Knudsen diffusion will dominate and must be considered in CCL
   models. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published

Title = {{A vast, thin plane of corotating dwarf galaxies orbiting the Andromeda

Abstract = {{Dwarf satellite galaxies are thought to be the remnants of the
   population of primordial structures that coalesced to form giant
   galaxies like the Milky Way(1). It has previously been suspected(2) that
   dwarf galaxies may not be isotropically distributed around our Galaxy,
   because several are correlated with streams of H I emission, and may
   form coplanar groups(3). These suspicions are supported by recent
   analyses(4-7). It has been claimed(7) that the apparently planar
   distribution of satellites is not predicted within standard
   cosmology(8), and cannot simply represent a memory of past coherent
   accretion. However, other studies dispute this conclusion(9-11). Here we
   report the existence of a planar subgroup of satellites in the Andromeda
   galaxy (M 31), comprising about half of the population. The structure is
   at least 400 kiloparsecs in diameter, but also extremely thin, with a
   perpendicular scatter of less than 14.1 kiloparsecs. Radial velocity
   measurements(12-15) reveal that the satellites in this structure have
   the same sense of rotation about their host. This shows conclusively
   that substantial numbers of dwarf satellite galaxies share the same
   dynamical orbital properties and direction of angular momentum.
   Intriguingly, the plane we identify is approximately aligned with the
   pole of the Milky Way's disk and with the vector between the Milky Way
   and Andromeda.}},

   current required to guarantee ZVS of the power MOSFETs. The proposed
   DC/DC converter is used as a battery charger for an electric vehicle.
   Since this application demands a wide range of load/line variations, the
   converter should be able to sustain ZVS under different conditions. The
   converter employs coupled inductors to provide the reactive current for
   the full-bridge semiconductor switches, which ensures ZVS at turn-on
   times. The coupled inductor along with the specific control system is
   able to generate the optimum value of the reactive current injected by
   the auxiliary circuit in order to minimize extra conduction losses in
   the power MOSFETs, as well as the losses in the coupled inductors. In
   the proposed approach, the peak value of the reactive current is
   controlled by the phase-shift between the leading leg and lagging leg of
   the full-bridge converter to optimize the load impact. Also, the
   reactive current is controlled by the switching frequency in order to
   compensate for the input voltage variations. Experimental results for a
   2kW DC/DC converter are presented. The results show an improvement in
   efficiency and better performance of the converter particularly for
   heavy loads.}},

Abstract = {{Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS) require a control system which is
   able to maintain the stability of the power conditioning system under a
   wide range of operating conditions. Conventional PI-based dq-controllers
   are very difficult to stabilize, especially under a wide range of
   operating conditions and in the presence of un-modeled dynamics and
   uncertainties. This paper introduces a novel nonlinear controller based
   on Control-Lyapunov Functions (CLF) providing robust and reliable
   closed-loop control. The proposed CLF-based controller offers some
   attractive features for this particular application. The controller is
   able to track the reference point with less effort due to the fact that
   it does not remove the inherent self-stabilizing terms. Also, due to the
   inclusion of integral terms in the control system, the sensitivity to
   parameter variations is vastly reduced since the Lyapunov function
   compensates itself by accumulating errors. Lastly, the stability of the
   closed-loop is also guaranteed for all operating conditions.
   Experimental results show good performance of the closed-loop control
   system even under severe load changes.}},

Abstract = {{The single stage LED Driver can achieve relatively high efficiency,

   power factor has been achieved. With two stages AC-DC LED Driver

   relatively low efficiency and high component cost. In this paper, an
   innovative single stage LED Driver with ripple cancellation technology
   has been proposed. We can achieve almost as high efficiency and low
   component cost as single stage LED Driver while maintaining comparable
   performance to the two stages LED Driver. Our experimental prototype can
   achieve 1.5mA Pk-Pk 120Hz ripple current, 0.99 power factor and 85.5\%

Abstract = {{High frequency transformers are one of the essential building blocks to
   provide galvanic isolation for power converters. Due to the switching
   nature of the converter, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of these
   converters is an essential requirement, to ensure not only its own
   operation but also the safe and secure operation of surrounding
   electrical equipment that are connected to same power distribution
   network. Thus, strict EMC standards such as CISPR 12 or SAEJ551/5 are
   imposed to provide safe and reliable operation of the power converters.
   Conventional passive filters used for EMI mitigation in power
   converters, comes at the expense of cost, size and weight, power losses
   and PCB real estate. In this paper, an integrated EMI filter embedded
   into the main high frequency planar transformer used in the DC/DC
   converter is proposed as a very cost-effective and efficient solution.
   The proposed structure is able to significantly suppress the Common-Mode
   (CM) EMI noise generated in the DC/DC converter. In order to evaluate
   the performance of the integrated transformer, a high frequency
   simulation through HFSS has been performed. Also, a prototype has been
   implemented to assess the feasibility of the proposed structure and
   confirm the HFSS simulation results. The results obtained from a 3KW
   prototype show that the proposed integrated EMI filter can effectively
   suppress the CM noise particularly for power converters operating at
   high switching frequency. The proposed structure can be a very simple
   and cost-effective EMI filtering solution for many applications such as
   future plug-in electric vehicle.}},

   Conventionally, the AC/DC converters are controlled with linear

   nonlinearity of the converter. The proposed nonlinear controller, based

   able to achieve a superior performance compared to typical linear

   experimentally with an FPGA-controlled full-bridge converter and is

Abstract = {{Multi-level converters are widely used to convert high voltage DC
   (typically above 500V) to an isolated DC output voltage that may vary
   from 12V to 300V, depending on the application. Presently 80plus.org
   efficiency standards like ``platinum{''} or ``titanium{''} efficiency
   standards require power converters to meet high efficiency (>90\%) from
   loads as low as 20\% of full load. Zero-voltage switching is necessary
   for such highly efficient operation of the converter and also to ensure
   reduced EMI and proper operation of the switching devices. Most
   conventional ZVS techniques for multi-level converters fail to achieve
   ZVS typically below 50\% of full load, while some ZVS techniques are
   able to do so, they increase the design complexity of the overall
   system. Moreover such techniques may suffer from increased circulating
   current losses at certain load ranges (typically at high loads) thus
   offsetting the gain in efficiency achieved through ZVS. In this paper a
   simple yet novel ZVS auxiliary circuit for three level DC-DC converter
   is proposed, analyzed and validated by experimental results. The
   proposed three level converter achieves ZVS even at no load, is able to
   optimize the circulating auxiliary circuit current necessary for ZVS as
   a function of load, thus maximize the efficiency of the converter for
   all load conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytical solution for the solid stresses in a
   silo with an internal tube. The research was conducted to support the
   design of a group of full scale silos with large inner concrete tubes.
   The silos were blasted and formed out of solid rock underground for
   storing iron ore pellets. Each of these silos is 40m in diameter and has
   a 10m diameter concrete tube with five levels of openings constructed at
   the centre of each rock silo. A large scale model was constructed to
   investigate the stress regime for the stored pellets and to evaluate the
   solids flow pattern and the loading on the concrete tube. This paper
   focuses on the development of an analytical solution for stresses in the
   iron ore pellets in the silo and the effect of the central tube on the
   stress regimes. The solution is verified using finite element analysis
   before being applied to analyse stresses in the solid in the full scale
   silo and the effect of the size of the tube.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the behaviour of iron ore fines with varying levels of
   adhesion was investigated using a confined compression test and a
   uniaxial test. The uniaxial test was conducted using the semi-automated
   uniaxial EPT tester in which the cohesive strength of a bulk solid is
   evaluated from an unconfined compression test following a period of
   consolidation to a pre-defined vertical stress. The iron ore fines were
   also tested by measuring both the vertical and circumferential strains
   on the cylindrical container walls under vertical loading in a separate
   confined compression tester - the K-0 tester, to determine the lateral
   pressure ratio.
   Discrete Element Method simulations of both experiments were carried out
   and the predictions were compared with the experimental observations. A
   recently developed DEM contact model for cohesive solids, an
   Elasto-Plastic Adhesive model, was used. This particle contact model
   uses hysteretic non-linear loading and unloading paths and an adhesion
   parameter which is a function of the maximum contact overlap. The model
   parameters for the simulations are phenomenologically based to reproduce
   the key bulk characteristics exhibited by the solid.
   The simulation results show a good agreement in capturing the stress
   history dependent behaviour depicted by the flow function of the
   cohesive iron ore fines while also providing a reasonably good match for
   the lateral pressure ratio observed during the confined compression K-0
   tests. This demonstrates the potential for the DEM model to be used in
   the simulation of bulk handling applications.}},

Abstract = {{Many researchers have investigated the flow and segregation behaviour in
   model scale experimental silos at normal gravity conditions. However it
   is known that the stresses experienced by the bulk solid in industrial
   silos are high when compared to model silos. Therefore it is important
   to understand the effect of stress level on flow and segregation
   behaviour and establish the scaling laws governing this behaviour. The
   objective of this paper is to understand the effect of gravity on the
   flow and segregation behaviour of bulk solids in a silo centrifuge
   model. The materials used were two mixtures composed of Polyamide and
   glass beads. The discharge of two bi-disperse bulk solids in a silo
   centrifuge model were recorded under accelerations ranging from 1g to
   15g. The velocity distribution during discharge was evaluated using
   Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques and the concentration
   distribution of large and small particles were obtained by imaging
   processing techniques. The flow and segregation behaviour at high
   gravities were then quantified and compared with the empirical equations
   available in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter applies Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to rational
   approximation of fractional order differential or integral operators.
   These operators are the building blocks of Fractional Order Controllers,
   that often can improve performance and robustness of control loops.
   However, the implementation of fractional order operators requires a
   rational approximation specified by a transfer function, i.e. by a set
   of zeros and poles. Since the quality of the approximation in the
   frequency domain can be measured by the linearity of the Bode magnitude
   plot and by the ``flatness{''} of the Bode phase plot in a given
   frequency range, the zeros and poles must be properly set. Namely, they
   must guarantee stability and minimum-phase properties, while enforcing
   zero-pole interlacing. Hence, the PSO must satisfy these requirements in
   optimizing the zero-pole location. Finally, to enlighten the crucial
   role of the zero-pole distribution, the outputs of the PSO optimization
   are compared with the results of classical schemes. The comparison shows
   that the PSO algorithm improves the quality of the approximation,
   especially in the Bode phase plot.}},

   Subject reacquisition is a fundamental task to ensure in-time reaction

   reasoning techniques to reduce the computational effort which deploys
   the time-of-flight information between interested zones such as airport
   security corridors. Also, to improve accuracy of reacquisition, we
   introduce the idea of revision as a method of post-processing. We
   demonstrate the significance and usefulness of our framework with an

Abstract = {{The available evidence suggests that both geosynthetic clay liners
   (GCLs) and composite liners with a geomembrane (GMB) over a clay liner
   have performed extremely well at controlling leakage in field
   applications for a couple of decades. However there have also been some
   problems reported and recent research has allowed us to have a much
   better understanding of the key design and construction factors
   affecting good and poor performance. This paper examines some of these
   issues including factors affecting GCL performance such as the water
   retention curve of GCLs, subgrade grain size and initial water content,
   GCL water content and normal stress on the GCL, the effect of daily
   thermal cycles on hydration, GCL panel shrinkage, and cation exchange.
   Factors affecting composite liner performance examined include the
   potential for desiccation of the clay liner under a sustained thermal
   gradient, GMB/GCL interface transmissivity, wrinkles in the GMB when the
   ballast layer is placed over the composite liner, and the potential
   interaction between wrinkles and GCL panel overlaps. Recent insights
   regarding leakage through composite liners are discussed. Although a
   number of potential issues with liner performance are discussed, it is
   concluded that all can be addressed by appropriate design, material
   selection, construction, and operations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the clogging of leachate collection systems (LCSs)
   in municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills and evaluates leakage through a
   composite liner arising from an increase in leachate head due to
   clogging. Accumulation of clog mass within the drainage layer is modeled
   and used to calculate the reduction in hydraulic conductivity and the
   subsequent leakage through the underlying composite liner at different
   times. For the cases and leachate history examined, the hydraulic
   conductivity of the granular drainage layer is reduced by one to five
   orders of magnitude (depending on the grain size of the drainage
   material) when the leachate mound reaches the LCS thickness. Leakage
   analyses show that while the reduction in the hydraulic conductivity of
   the drainage layer is sufficient to increase the head on the liner and
   hence leakage, the reduction is not sufficient for the clogged LCS to
   provide significant resistance to leakage through a hole in the
   geomembrane.}},

   associated to the hidden nodes are fixed, thus only significant hidden
   nodes are selected for inclusion in the final model. However, due to
   existence of noise on data, this procedure often leads to an over-fitted
   model with unsatisfactory generalisation performance. Bayesian
   regularisation and leave-one-out cross validation can be incorporated to
   tackle this issue, but the algorithm stability is an issue that needs to
   be addressed. This paper proposes a new method which not only improves
   the compactness of the resultant RBF neuralmodel, but also the accuracy
   of estimated model coefficients. This is achieved by effectively
   incorporating the A-optimality design criterion into a recently proposed
   two-stage subset selection, while the computational efficiency is still
   retained from the original two-stage selection method by introducing a
   residual matrix. Experimental results on two simulation benchmarks are
   included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

   the performance of traditional solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. In this
   study such an outdoor system has been shown to improve energy yield by
   45\% for a traditional flat glass module and by 35\% for a prismatic
   glass crystalline silicon module. In addition, this paper presents new
   methodologies for properly modelling this type of system design and
   experimental results using a bi-directional reflectance function (BDRF)
   of non-ideal surfaces rather than traditional geometric optics. This
   methodology allows for the evaluation and eventual optimization of

Abstract = {{High penetration of distributed energy resources raises operational and
   market challenges. Existing incentives and tariff support can not be
   sustained with penetration growth and competitive market mechanisms are
   required at the micorgrid level. We propose a market mechanism to bring
   competitiveness at the microgrid level. In this dynamic matching
   mechanism, individual generators and load units meet to conduct a
   bilateral trade. Each unit interested in maximising its benefit adopts
   its own bid strategy. The trade between randomly matched generation and
   load unit is established if their bids are compatible. If a trade is not
   established the units go back to the matching pool and are randomly
   matched again. We demonstrate that it is beneficial for the generators
   and loads to participate in such a microgrid level market. The mechanism
   also provides tools to pursue microgrid level norms of participation.
   The mechanism is anonymous and unlike many other approaches, it does not
   require the units to share their private cost or value information.}},

Abstract = {{A modeling framework for the microstructural modeling of infiltrated
   SOFC electrodes is presented. The model numerically reconstructs
   infiltrated electrodes through a sedimentation algorithm for the
   backbone generation and a novel Monte Carlo packing algorithm for the
   random infiltration. Effective properties are evaluated by means of
   Monte Carlo geometric analysis and finite volume method as a function of
   the loading and of the particle size of infiltrated particles.
   Infiltration into ion-conducting and composite backbones is analyzed in
   this study. Simulations show that the infiltration can lead to an
   increase in TPB density of about two orders of magnitude if compared
   with conventional composite electrodes. In addition, infiltration into
   monocomponent backbones can lead to a TPB density about twice the TPB
   achievable when infiltrating composite backbones. On the other hand, a
   critical loading of nanoparticles must be reached in monocomponent
   backbones while in a composite backbone the infiltration is always
   beneficial.}},

   advantage of excess steam from coal or nuclear power plants to reduce
   the required input energy, thus improving the overall efficiency for
   electrolysis. A novel three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) model is developed to simulate the coupled physical phenomena
   occuring in SOECs. The computational model is based on the open-source
   CFD software package, OpenFOAM (R). The novelty would be development and
   implementation of complicated thermo-electrochemical models of
   underlying governing equations for SOEC.}},

Abstract = {{Affordable housing has been the latest addition in the lexicon of Indian
   policy circles. As neoliberalism started gathering political and policy
   momentum, the discourse around low-income housing has shifted towards
   the Government of India's agenda of `affordable housing for all'. A
   stated goal of the policy is to increase housing supply, including the
   low-income category. Today, however, the manifesting goals of affordable
   housing design seem to be a `walk in two worlds', with inherent
   contradictions and paradoxes in the housing `dream' currently being
   repackaged as affordable homes for low-income people. This paper
   investigates this aphorism. It argues that both affordability and
   housing design have several different meanings and identities.
   Transplanting standard housing design across the board suggests a rather
   elementary confluence of priorities and policies that is capable of
   producing a range of alternative scenarios, which may not necessarily
   align with the goal of `affordable housing for all'.}},

Abstract = {{We review a self-consistent scheme for modelling trapped weakly
   interacting quantum gases at temperatures where the condensate coexists
   with a significant thermal cloud. This method has been applied to atomic
   gases by Zaremba, Nikuni, and Griffin, and is often referred to as ZNG.
   It describes both mean-field-dominated and hydrodynamic regimes, except
   at very low temperatures or in the regime of large fluctuations.
   Condensate dynamics are described by a dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii
   equation (or the corresponding quantum hydrodynamic equation with a
   source term), while the non-condensate evolution is represented by a
   quantum Boltzmann equation, which additionally includes collisional
   processes which transfer atoms between these two subsystems. In the
   mean-field-dominated regime, collisions are treated perturbatively, and
   the full distribution function is needed to describe the thermal cloud,
   while in the hydrodynamic regime the system is parametrised in terms of
   a set of local variables. Applications to the finite-temperature-induced
   damping of collective modes and vortices in the mean-field-dominated
   regime are presented.}},

   systems was formulated by Beliaev in 1957, based on splitting the
   quantum field operator into a macroscopically occupied condensate
   component and a non-condensate component. This leads to a description of
   the condensate in terms of a `single-particle state, the so-called
   macroscopic wavefunction. Since the discovery of Bose-condensed gases,
   an alternative theoretical picture has been developed which is based on
   a `coherent band' of classically occupied states. This is often called
   the classical or c-field approach. The goal of this chapter is to review
   the differences between the Beliaev broken-symmetry and c-field
   approaches, and to argue that the c-field concept of a coherent
   condensate band of states has problems as a description of Bose
   superfluidity. However, the c-field idea of treating the lowest-energy
   excitations classically can be used to advantage to simplify
   calculations within the Beliaev broken-symmetry formalism.}},

Abstract = {{The development of mesoporous adsorbents coated with iron and aluminium
   oxides has been optimised for the removal of arsenic. 3D-organised
   mesoporous silica KIT-6 was used as a host for iron and aluminium oxides
   loading in single or mixed conditions. Material properties were
   characterized using BET and TEM analysis. The high surface area and
   porosity of the sorbents and their 3D organization has been ascertained.
   Materials produced were used in adsorption studies for removing both
   As(III) and As(V). KIT-6 coated with 8 \% iron oxides showed an As(III)
   and As(V) removal capacity of 10.47 and 6.26 mg.g(-1) while the same
   silica matrix coated with 8 \% aluminium oxides displayed an As(III) and
   As(V) removal capacity of 7.73 and 38.78 mg.g(-1) respectively. The use
   of mixed Fe-Al oxides coated sorbents showed the possibility to tailor
   the adsorption towards one of the two arsenic species. These materials
   are expected to be superior adsorbents when used in column systems as
   they will be saturated simultaneously with both As(III) and As(V) thus
   avoiding the use of an oxidation step.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of resorcinol formaldehyde xerogels was investigated by
   controlling its porosity for potential use as adsorbents for heavy
   metals removal from industrial wastewater. Resorcinol formaldehyde
   carbon xerogels were synthesised by sol-gel polymerization of resorcinol
   (R) with formaldehyde (F) in the presence of sodium carbonate (C) and
   then vacuum dried. Resorcinol formaldehyde (RF) gels were synthesised at
   same temperature conditions with varying resorcinol / catalyst (R/C) and
   resorcinol / water (R/W) ratios. The influence of R/C and R/W ratios on
   the pore structure of the xerogels was investigated. Surface area and
   porosity of the resorcinol formaldehyde gels were analysed by physical
   adsorption (physiosorption) of nitrogen (N-2) at 77 K. The result(s)
   showed an increase in mesoporosity and pore size as R/C ratio increases.
   At resorcinol /catalyst (R/C) of 200, the pore size and pore volume
   increased with increase in R/W ratio. From the result, it can be
   concluded that the resorcinol /catalyst (R/C) and resorcinol / water
   (R/W) ratios are two contributing factors to determining the pore
   structure of the xerogels.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal protections (TP) applied to road tankers for the transportation
   of pressurized liquefied flammable gases are able to postpone or even
   avoid boiling liquid expanding vapor explosions (BLEVEs) and the
   following fireball. Their presence delays mechanical failure and
   provides more time to emergency responders. However, installation and
   maintenance costs of TP, as well as difficulties in inspections and
   maintenance of the protected steel tank limited its implementation.
   Actually TP is applied only where it's mandatory due to technical
   standards or national regulations.
   In the present study a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) model is presented
   for the application of TP on road tankers. A simplified risk analysis is
   performed to determine the benefits of risk reduction by thermal fire
   protections, which are compared to the costs of applying them. If the
   average population density in the areas crossed by road tankers is
   higher than a critical density threshold, or if the time spent by the
   road tankers along the route is higher than a critical time limit, the
   TP results convenient. The application of the CBA model to some case
   studies confirmed the validity of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The events in March of 2011 in Japan have provided us with an example of
   what can happen when large LPG spheres are exposed to severe fire
   engulfment. This paper presents an approximate failure analysis of a
   sphere exposed to a severe fire engulfment scenario. It estimates the
   expected failure time of the sphere based on predicted wall temperatures
   and internal pressure buildup. The prediction of the pressurization rate
   is based on a two-zone, thermally stratified liquid model. It shows that
   the pressurization rate depends strongly on the initial fill level. At
   high fill levels, the sphere can pressurize much faster then would be
   expected if the liquid were well mixed and isothermal. This rapid
   pressurization can lead to early failure.
   The analysis considered two fire heat flux conditions and shows how
   prediction of failure time can be affected by high temperature stress
   rupture. The analysis also considers various initial fill conditions to
   predict BLEVE hazards at failure. The results are in reasonable
   agreement with limited observations and data from the March 2011
   incident in Japan.}},

Abstract = {{Originally designed for point-to-point transmissions, fountain codes are
   capacity-achieving codes over a binary erasure channel. On the other
   hand, network coding is an optimal multi-hop data dissemination protocol
   whose high decoding complexity makes it too expensive for
   resource-constrained applications. Soliton-like rateless coding (SLRC)
   has previously combined network and fountain coding paradigms such that
   a less complex decoder can be applied. Specifically, the coding done at
   an intermediate relay node allows a belief propagation decoder to be
   efficiently applied. We extend the SLRC protocol and propose the
   Improved Soliton-like Rateless Coding (ISLRC) protocol. In ISLRC, the
   relay applies intelligent coding and shapes the degree distribution such
   that performance is better than SLRC. In addition, ISLRCs performance
   gains are achieved using fewer resources than SLRC while maintaining all
   the key properties of SLRC. Simulation results show that even under the
   worst-case scenario of ISLRC, better performance can be achieved
   compared to SLRC and other existing schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Manipulator motion planning is a task which relies heavily on the
   construction of a configuration space prior to path planning. However
   when fast real-time motion is needed, the full construction of the
   manipulator's high-dimensional configuration space can be too slow and
   expensive. Alternative planning methods, which avoid this full
   construction of the manipulator's configuration space are needed to
   solve this problem. Here, one such existing local planning method for
   manipulators based on configuration-sampling and subgoal-selection has
   been extended. Using a modified Artificial Potential Fields (APF)
   function, goal-configuration sampling and a novel subgoal selection
   method, provides faster, more direct paths than the previously proposed
   work. Simulation results show a decrease in both runtime and path
   lengths, along with a decrease in unexpected local minimum and

Abstract = {{This paper presents an Invariant Information Local Sub-map Filter
   (IILSF) as a technique for consistent Simultaneous Localisation and
   Mapping (SLAM) in a large environment. It harnesses the benefits of
   sub-map technique to improve the consistency and efficiency of Extended
   Kalman Filter (EKF) based SLAM. The IILSF makes use of invariant
   information obtained from estimated locations of features in independent
   sub-maps, instead of incorporating every observation directly into the
   global map. Then the global map is updated at regular intervals.
   Applying this technique to the EKF based SLAM algorithm: (a) reduces the
   computational complexity of maintaining the global map estimates and (b)
   simplifies transformation complexities and data association ambiguities
   usually experienced in fusing sub-maps together. Simulation results show
   that the method was able to accurately fuse local map observations to
   generate an efficient and consistent global map, in addition to
   significantly reducing computational cost and data association
   ambiguities.}},

Abstract = {{Oceans, islands, and coastal areas are at least as threatened by
   humanity's rapidly increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations
   as the remaining 30\% of Earth's surface. Yet most of the discussion for
   sequestering the dominant greenhouse gas, CO2, involves deep sub-earth
   geologic structures limited to relatively small areas in continental
   plates. Humanity needs a secure carbon storage alternative that is
   available in more countries. Secure Seafloor Container Storage (SSCS) is
   an alternative that could safely store trillions of tons of CO2. The
   paper presents a computational geophysical, chemical, and economic model
   of SSCS. Our research shows that appropriate undisturbed geosynthetics
   will prevent contact with seawater for millennia (<0.06\% osmosis loss
   per millennium). CO2 hydrate below 500 meters is a rock-like solid
   denser than water. Our life cycle assessment predicts a mass ratio of
   stored-CO2:materials needed of 1,700:1. The projected cost to compress
   pure gaseous CO2 to a liquid, convert the liquid to hydrate inside a
   geosynthetic membrane, monitor and maintain the structures is
   approximately \$16 per ton of CO2.}},

Abstract = {{Surface waves (SWs) on planar substrates are generally considered an
   adverse effect that can degrade the performance of printed circuits and
   antenna arrays. However, with appropriate conditions, these SW fields
   can be employed for controlled propagation along a planar guiding
   surface. For example, by the addition of a periodic configuration of
   microstrip lines printed on top of a grounded dielectric slab, an
   effective phase constant can be achieved, refracting cylindrical SWs
   transmitted from a slot source etched in the ground plane. A design
   approach for these surface lenses is presented as well as a specific
   structure that can generate a bound and guided plane-wave. Applications
   for these printed metallic lenses include new quasi-optical circuits,
   novel planar feeds, as well as lowcost leaky-wave antennas for microwave
   and millimeter-wave frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{An object recognition system based on registering repeatable interest
   segments from 3D surfaces is presented. The strength of this approach
   lies in its independence of local features, which can be unreliable when
   corrupted by noise, and indistinct for certain objects and surfaces. The
   proposed framework is based on recent advances in segmenting 3D data
   into repeatable interest segments, followed by efficient surface
   registration of model and scene segments, where pose clustering returns
   the best pose candidates. A quality measure based on reprojection of the
   model points and pose refinement are then used to select the best pose.
   The proposed method is demonstrated experimentally to be both accurate
   and robust when tested against a variety of partially occluded free-form
   objects in cluttered scenes, achieving an average accuracy of 93\% on an
   accurate and high resolution LiDAR data set, and 81\% on a noisy and low

Abstract = {{Datasets of stretches of railway tracks are collected using both
   Airborne and Terrestrial LiDAR scanners having varying density,
   resolution and provide different views of the railway track. Manual
   feature extraction from such datasets is tedious and labour intensive.
   Therefore, automatic extraction of desired features is highly desirable.
   In this work, we propose a technique to extract the rails from these two
   types of datasets. Our rail extraction technique models the a railway
   track as a dynamic system of local pairs of parallel line segments and
   uses the Kalman filter to predict and monitor the state of the system.
   The system's state is composed of the two centroids of the parallel line
   segments as well as their common direction. Additionally, we augment the
   Kalman filter process to deal with special cases such as missing railway
   track segments, sensor noise, and data sparseness. Our technique is
   effective on both types of data sets as we achieve a precision of 91\%
   and a recall of 99\% on the high resolution Terrestrial dataset and a
   precision of 94\% and a recall of 91\% on the Airborne dataset.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented to automatically classify objects that lie within
   the vicinity of streets in 3D point clouds of urban environments. The
   system first successfully segments objects of interest from the scene
   through a combination of ground segmentation and road extraction using a
   Kalman filtering approach, and cluster extraction region growing. Those
   clusters that fall close to the road are then passed to a classification
   phase, where they are compared against a labelled database of such
   clusters. The comparison of clusters is based upon Variable Dimensional
   Global Shape Descriptors, which encode the geometry of the objects into
   multi-dimensional histograms, the similarities of which are measured
   against the database clusters using a variety of metrics including Earth
   Mover's Distance and Bhattacharya similarity. The method was applied to
   dense data acquired from central New York City, covering an area of 78,
   000 m(2). On a test set containing 101 objects partitioned into 5
   classes, the method had an average successful recognition rate of 94.5\%

   fire hydrants, street signs, and poles.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe an optimization method based on differential
   evolution (DE). It shows good convergence properties with few
   parameters. However, the appropriate selection of the parameters is a
   difficult task. Hence, we here analyze the performance indexes of the DE
   algorithm to set the control parameters. Moreover, to identify the best
   parameter intervals, the DE approach is first compared to two different
   Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms and then to a recent
   adaptive genetic algorithm (DABGA). The optimization of benchmark
   functions shows that the DE algorithm performs better than PSO and DABGA
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{To tackle the twin challenges of sustainable energy supply and climate
   change, numerous efforts have been made to decarbonize the whole energy
   systems. Control Engineering, which concerns the automated operation of
   a machine or system to achieve desired target(s) and to avoid unstable
   or unintended disruptive behavior, has played a key role in modern
   industry and across the whole energy system. Advanced control
   technologies, such as optimal control, provide a framework to
   simultaneously regulate the system performance and limit control energy.
   However, little has been done so far to exploit the full potential of
   controller design in reducing the energy consumption while maintaining
   desirable system performance. This paper for the first time investigates
   the correlation between control energy consumption and system
   performance, and shows that this correlation is nonlinear and the
   controller design should be a delicate synthesis procedure to achieve
   better trade-off between system performance and energy saving.}},

   The survey was taken across 40 software development companies in
   Northern Ireland at the beginning of 2012. The paper describes the
   design of the survey and examines maturity by comparing the results
   obtained in 2012 with those from a study of agile adoption in the same
   region in 2010. Both surveys aimed to achieve comprehensive coverage of
   a single area rather than rely on a voluntary sample. The main outcome
   from the work is a collection of `insights' into the nature and practice

Abstract = {{Load tests ensure that software systems are able to perform under the
   expected workloads. The current state of load test analysis requires
   significant manual review of performance counters and execution logs,
   and a high degree of system-specific expertise. In particular,
   memory-related issues (e.g., memory leaks or spikes), which may degrade
   performance and cause crashes, are difficult to diagnose. Performance
   analysts must correlate hundreds of megabytes or gigabytes of
   performance counters (to understand resource usage) with execution logs
   (to understand system behaviour). However, little work has been done to
   combine these two types of information to assist performance analysts in
   their diagnosis. We propose an automated approach that combines
   performance counters and execution logs to diagnose memory-related
   issues in load tests. We perform three case studies on two systems: one
   open-source system and one large-scale enterprise system. Our approach
   flags <= 0.1\% of the execution logs with a precision >= 80\%.}},

Abstract = {{Bug prediction models are often used to help allocate software quality
   assurance efforts. Software metrics (e. g., process metrics and product
   metrics) are at the heart of bug prediction models. However, some of
   these metrics like churn are not actionable; on the contrary,
   antipatterns which refer to specific design and implementation styles
   can tell the developers whether a design choice is ``poor{''} or not.
   Poor designs can be fixed by refactoring. Therefore in this paper, we
   explore the use of antipatterns for bug prediction, and strive to
   improve the accuracy of bug prediction models by proposing various
   metrics based on antipatterns. An additional feature to our proposed
   metrics is that they take into account the history of antipatterns in
   files from their inception into the system. Through a case study on
   multiple versions of Eclipse and ArgoUML, we observe that (i) files
   participating in antipatterns have higher bug density than other files;
   (ii) our proposed antipattern based metrics can provide additional
   explanatory power over traditional metrics, and (iii) improve the
   F-measure of cross-system bug prediction models by 12.5\% in average.
   Managers and quality assurance personnel can use our proposed metrics to
   better improve their bug prediction models and better focus testing
   activities and the allocation of support resources.}},

Abstract = {{Software metrics have many uses, e. g., defect prediction, effort
   estimation, and benchmarking an organization against peers and industry
   standards. In all these cases, metrics may depend on the context, such
   as the programming language. Here we aim to investigate if the
   distributions of commonly used metrics do, in fact, vary with six
   context factors: application domain, programming language, age,
   lifespan, the number of changes, and the number of downloads. For this
   preliminary study we select 320 nontrivial software systems from
   Source-Forge. These software systems are randomly sampled from nine
   popular application domains of Source-Forge. We calculate 39 metrics
   commonly used to assess software maintainability for each software
   system and use Kruskal Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test to determine
   if there are significant differences among the distributions with
   respect to each of the six context factors. We use Cliff's delta to
   measure the magnitude of the differences and find that all six context
   factors affect the distribution of 20 metrics and the programming
   language factor affects 35 metrics. We also briefly discuss how each
   context factor may affect the distribution of metric values. We expect
   our results to help software benchmarking and other software engineering
   methods that rely on these commonly used metrics to be tailored to a
   particular context.}},

Abstract = {{Data Analytics has proven its importance in knowledge discovery and
   decision support in different data and application domains. Big data
   analytics poses a serious challenge in terms of the necessary hardware
   and software resources. The cloud technology today offers a promising
   solution to this challenge by enabling ubiquitous and scalable
   provisioning of the computing resources. However, there are further
   challenges that remain to be addressed such as the availability of the
   required analytic software for various application domains, estimation
   and subscription of necessary resources for the analytic job or
   workflow, management of data in the cloud, and design, verification and
   execution of analytic workflows. We present a taxonomy for analytic
   workflow systems to highlight the important features in existing
   systems. Based on the taxonomy and a study of the existing analytic
   software and systems, we propose the conceptual architecture of
   CLoud-based Analytics-as-a-Service (CLAaaS), a big data analytics
   service provisioning platform, in the cloud. We outline the features
   that are important for CLAaaS as a service provisioning system such as
   user and domain specific customization and assistance, collaboration,

Abstract = {{Anti-islanding protection is becoming increasingly important due to the
   rapid installation of distributed generation from renewable resources
   like wind, tidal and wave, solar PV, bio-fuels, as well as from other
   resources like diesel. Unintentional islanding presents a potential risk
   for damaging utility plants and equipment connected from the demand
   side, as well as to public and personnel in utility plants. This paper
   investigates automatic islanding detection. This is achieved by
   deploying a statistical process control approach for fault detection
   with the real-time data acquired through a wide area measurement system,
   which is based on Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) technology. In
   particular, the principal component analysis (PCA) is used to project
   the data into principal component subspace and residual space, and two
   statistics are used to detect the occurrence of fault. Then a fault
   reconstruction method is used to identify the fault and its development
   over time. The proposed scheme has been used in a real system and the
   results have confirmed that the proposed method can correctly identify
   the fault and islanding site.}},

Abstract = {{Increased complexity and interconnectivity of Supervisory Control and
   Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in Smart Grids potentially means
   greater susceptibility to malicious attackers. SCADA systems with legacy
   communication infrastructure have inherent cyber-security
   vulnerabilities as these systems were originally designed with little
   consideration of cyber threats. In order to improve cyber-security of
   SCADA networks, this paper presents a rule-based Intrusion Detection
   System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) method, which includes
   signature-based and model-based approaches tailored for SCADA systems.
   The proposed signature-based rules can accurately detect several known
   suspicious or malicious attacks. In addition, model-based detection is
   proposed as a complementary method to detect unknown attacks. Finally,
   proposed intrusion detection approaches for SCADA networks are
   implemented and verified via Snort rules.}},

Abstract = {{New spectral line polarisation observations of 7 bright Ap stars have
   been obtained with the ESPaDOnS and Narval high resolution
   spectropolarimeters (Silvester et al. 2012). The aim of this data set is
   produce a series of surface magnetic field and surface chemistry maps
   for these Ap stars. We present new magnetic maps for the Ap star
   alpha(2) CVn using these new data and the MDI inversion code INVERS10.
   alpha(2) CVn is the first Ap star to be observed during two separate
   epochs using high resolution phase resolved spectropolarimetric IQUV
   observations and as such allows us an insight into how stable the
   surface magnetic structure is over a decade timescale. We show that the
   new maps give a magnetic field structure consistent with the previous
   maps obtained by Kochukhov and Wade (2010) from lower quality MuSiCoS
   spectra taken a decade ago and that the field topology cannot be
   described by a dipolar or quadrupolar field.}},

Title = {{Robust Modeling of Low-Cost MEMS Sensor Errors in Mobile Devices Using
   Fast Orthogonal Search}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Accessibility to inertial navigation systems (INS) has been severely
   limited by cost in the past. The introduction of low-cost
   microelectromechanical system-based INS to be integrated with GPS in
   order to provide a reliable positioning solution has provided more wide
   spread use in mobile devices. The random errors of the MEMS inertial
   sensors may deteriorate the overall system accuracy in mobile devices.
   These errors are modeled stochastically and are included in the error
   model of the estimated techniques used such as Kalman filter or Particle
   filter. First-order Gauss-Markov model is usually used to describe the
   stochastic nature of these errors. However, if the autocorrelation
   sequences of these random components are examined, it can be determined
   that first-order Gauss-Markov model is not adequate to describe such
   stochastic behavior. A robust modeling technique based on fast
   orthogonal search is introduced to remove MEMS-based inertial sensor
   errors inside mobile devices that are used for several location-based
   services. The proposed method is applied to MEMS-based gyroscopes and
   accelerometers. Results show that the proposed method models low-cost
   MEMS sensors errors with no need for denoising techniques and using
   smaller model order and less computation, outperforming traditional
   methods by two orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{Wind power is perhaps the most promising renewable energy for fossil
   fuel replacement in many countries. In order to integrate offshore wind
   farms, voltage source converter based high voltage direct current
   (VSC-HVDC) appears to be an appealing solution. Stable DC voltage is the
   key for successful power transmission, and this paper focuses on the
   advanced control method for stabilizing the DC cable voltage, aiming to
   achieve a stable power transmission. Based on the idea of adaptive
   backstepping control, DC cable is modelled as a series of pi sections,
   and each section is responsible for the control of previous one. Inner
   current loop is then used to provide the final control signal of VSC and
   the global stability is guaranteed. Based on the voltage and current
   measurement, internal states of the DC cable can be estimated using a
   state observer. Using adaptive backstepping control, Matlab/Simulink
   simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed method when active power changes. Compared with traditional PI
   control, it is shown that backstepping control can significantly improve
   the performance of existing DC voltage controller.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the most affordable and widely available renewable energy
   resources, wind power has been recognized as the main promising form of
   renewable energy in many countries for achieving the targets of cutting
   greenhouse gas emission according to the Kyoto agreement. However, due
   to the intermittent nature of wind power, it is imperative to forecast
   the wind generation hours even days ahead to enhance the flexibility of
   the operation and control of real-time power systems including economic
   load dispatch. In this paper, a variant of Gaussian Process is proposed
   and applied to make short-term prediction of the overall wind power
   production in the island of Ireland. Only measurement data of power
   generation is utilized. A number of modifications are made to the
   standard Gaussian Process during the model training and testing
   procedures to reduce the computational complexity of modeling and
   forecasting wind power generation. The prediction results are compared
   to those of standard Gaussian Process and persistence model to confirm
   the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is shown that not only the
   computation complexity is greatly reduced, but also poor local optima
   could also be avoided due to the reduction of matrix dimension.}},

Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},

Abstract = {{In the context of cognitive network architecture, an opportunistic
   cognitive receiver must identify the present active networks. In this
   article, we propose an efficient algorithm for the identification of
   OFDM networks exploiting the pilot patterns used in these standards
   which are prescribed uniquely by their underlying standards. These
   pilots are inserted for the channel estimation and synchronization
   between the base stations and their users. The proposed generalized
   likelihood ratio test (GLRT) not only allows a cognitive observer to
   detect the active networks by analyzing the observed signals but also
   performs channel estimation, time-frequency synchronization as well as
   estimation of the noise variance. These informations are of a great
   interest for Quality of Service estimation in the purpose of an
   association with the base station. The proposed solution is applicable
   to the existing standards (e.g., LTE, WiMAX, WiFi), doesn't require any
   signaling overhead to be embedded on the pilot tones, is computationally
   inexpensive and only requires to know the pilot patterns. An other GLRT
   is proposed as a pre-detector which ignores the pilot information and
   allows to reduce the computational cost of the system for the cases
   where a large number of patterns/systems are to be tested.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the MIMO signal detection problem using widely
   separated antennas in Gaussian interference. The interference is assumed
   to be colored with unknown N x N covariance matrix. We derive the
   Uniformly Most Powerful Invariant (UMPI) test for this detection problem
   as the upper performance bound for invariant tests. Also the Separating
   Function Estimation Test (SFET) is derived for this problem using the
   Signal and Scatter to Interference Ratio (SIR). Then, based on the
   eigenvalues expansion of SIR, we propose a set of orthogonal signals in
   transmitters which maximizes the detection probability of UMPI and SFET.
   Simulation results show that 1) the performance of our proposed detector
   is close to the UMPI bound and 2) the performance of the optimal
   invariant bound improves when the transmitters use the proposed set of
   signals instead of the orthogonal complex exponential signals.}},

Abstract = {{Single-zone modelling is used to assess different collections of
   impeller 1D loss models. Three collections of loss models have been
   identified in literature, and the background to each of these
   collections is discussed. Each collection is evaluated using three
   modern automotive turbocharger style centrifugal compressors;
   comparisons of performance for each of the collections are made. An
   empirical data set taken from standard hot gas stand tests for each
   turbocharger is used as a baseline for comparison. Compressor range is
   predicted in this study; impeller diffusion ratio is shown to be a
   useful method of predicting compressor surge in 1D, and choke is
   predicted using basic compressible flow theory. The compressor designer
   can use this as a guide to identify the most compatible collection of
   losses for turbocharger compressor design applications. The analysis
   indicates the most appropriate collection for the design of automotive
   turbocharger centrifugal compressors.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effectiveness of high modulus fiber
   reinforced polymer (FRP) composites for strengthening of slender

   failure at loads much lower than their counterpart short columns. This
   paper is focused on using an analytical model based on modifying the
   provisions of ACI 318-08 to develop the loath path of the slender
   columns. Using the load paths and cross-sectional axial load-bending
   moment interaction curves, the interaction curves of the slender columns
   are developed. Moreover, through a parametric study, the effectiveness
   of CFRP laminates is evaluated for different slenderness ratios, CFRP
   reinforcement ratios, and effective length factors. It is shown that the
   longitudinal CFRP reinforcements are more effective on slender columns.}},

Title = {{New Features Using Robust MVDR Spectrum of Filtered Autocorrelation
   Sequence for Robust Speech Recognition}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel noise-robust feature extraction method for
   speech recognition using the robust perceptual minimum variance
   distortionless response (MVDR) spectrum of temporally filtered
   autocorrelation sequence. The perceptual MVDR spectrum of the filtered
   short-time autocorrelation sequence can reduce the effects of residue of
   the nonstationary additive noise which remains after filtering the
   autocorrelation. To achieve a more robust front-end, we also modify the
   robust distortionless constraint of the MVDR spectral estimation method
   via revised weighting of the subband power spectrum values based on the
   sub-band signal to noise ratios (SNRs), which adjusts it to the new
   proposed approach. This new function allows the components of the input
   signal at the frequencies least affected by noise to pass with larger
   weights and attenuates more effectively the noisy and undesired
   components. This modification results in reduction of the noise
   residuals of the estimated spectrum from the filtered autocorrelation
   sequence, thereby leading to a more robust algorithm. Our proposed
   method, when evaluated on Aurora 2 task for recognition purposes,
   outperformed all Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) as the
   baseline, relative autocorrelation sequence MFCC (RAS-MFCC), and the
   MVDR-based features in several different noisy conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Many structures in North America are reaching the end of their design
   lives but some are still fit for purpose while others require repair or
   replacement. Currently, to assess these structures, subjective visual
   inspections are relied upon. An alternative technology that can be used
   is Digital Image Correlation (DIC). DIC is a technique that uses digital
   images of an object (e.g. a critical element of a structure) before and
   after load is applied to create a 2-D displacement field for the object.
   If this displacement field can be measured with a sufficiently high
   resolution, these displacements can also be used to determine a 2-D
   strain field. Recent progress in this area has led to the development of
   contactless strain sensors that are suitable for lab use under
   quasi-static conditions. The current research explores the possibility
   of using high speed cameras to measure displacements and strains under
   dynamic conditions. An initial calibration exercise was performed to
   determine the potential accuracy of the high speed camera system. Image
   texture and quality were found to be crucial as measurement errors
   increased with decreasing texture and image quality. An experiment was
   then conducted using an axially loaded plate specimen with different
   amounts of texture and using two different types of lenses. Texture and
   image quality had a significant impact on dynamic strain measurement
   accuracy, however, when these factors are optimized, near strain gage
   accuracy can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Time-dependent deformation processes can occur under sustained loading

   boundary conditions may within the influence zone of an excavation. The
   mechanics of response can be visco-elastic deformation or relaxation,

   is important to consider the mechanics of the problem when selecting the

   illustrates these different mechanisms through simple analogue models,
   before using combinations of the models to approximate time-dependent
   behaviour of rock masses using industry-conventional 2D methods. Drawing
   on the results of a sensitivity analysis utilizing accepted methods and

Abstract = {{Over the years, the disciplines of rock mechanics and rock engineering
   have produced numerous theoretical and empirical tools for estimation of
   rock and rockmass strength. These in turn have improved our capacity for
   prediction of ground behavior and tunnel support design. Nevertheless,
   there is still a significant gap in our understanding of post-yield
   processes and specifically of the volumetric deformation characteristics
   of yielding or failing rock. State-of-the-art dilation models account
   for the confinement and plastic strain ( damage) dependencies of this
   phenomenon. For many applications, however, these models remain
   insufficient: where discontinuum controlled behavior is prevalent, these
   models cannot captures observed trends in displacement measurements;
   where high precision estimates of damage controlled dilation are
   necessary, models require large numbers of parameters with little
   physical meaning; even in rocks and rockmasses that deform through
   continuum or pseudo-continuum shearing processes, these models can be
   difficult to implement in existing numerical codes. This paper reviews
   existing approaches for modeling dilation and the corresponding
   limitations. In the case of continuum shearing behaviour, a mobilized
   dilation model and a constant dilation angle model are compared. A
   methodology for the practical determination of a representative constant
   dilation angle model is then tested, and the results are compared to a
   case study using recorded excavation convergence measurements.}},

Abstract = {{The conventional approach for preliminary geotechnical analysis is based
   on an equivalent continuum representation of a rockmass containing
   joints, bedding, and/or other systematic discontinuities. The authors
   have previously proposed that meso-scale structures (e.g. veinlets,
   stockwork, and sedimentary structures) that occur within blocks bounded
   by macro-scale structure (e.g. joints) have a significant impact on
   rockmass strength. These structures may not be accounted for in
   conventional core logging and yet should be included in rockmass
   characterization and numerical modelling for geotechnical design. Three
   case examples of arched underground excavations are used to highlight
   the implications of inclusion and exclusion of discrete structure in
   Finite Element Method numerical models. The cases discussed in this
   paper show that it is very important to consider meso- scale and
   intrablock structure in numerical models. In cases that are too
   computationally demanding to allow for discrete modelling of such
   structure, it is important to understand their influence on rockmass
   strength and behaviour, and to use an equivalent continuum GSI approach

Abstract = {{The Olmos tunnel in Peru is a key component of a large water
   infrastructure initiative in that country to transfer water from the
   Huancabamba River on the Eastern side of the Andes to drought-ridden
   areas on the Pacific Ocean Watershed. The tunnel is more than 20 km long
   and reaches depths of 2500 m under the Andes. Problems in the 12.5 km
   TBM section have included stress driven spalling from the roof which was
   managed though innovations in roof support to large scale rockburst
   events which have damage the TBM and held up operations. The tunnelling
   has been successfully completed with finishing works ongoing. This paper
   examines the causes of significant behavioural change from continuous
   but manageable roof spalling to large strain and shear bursting events
   around the perimeter and face of the tunnel. The in situ stresses in
   this area are locally influenced by changes in the volcanic geology
   within the tunnel project. In addition there is significant macro-scale
   variability in rock structure. Finally, the rock units themselves
   transition from heterogenous volcanic breccias to homogenous dacites.
   These factors together control both the in situ stress acting locally at
   the tunnel horizon as well as the damage strength and post damage
   response of the rockmass as described in this case study. Site data and
   numerical analyses are used to highlight these relationships.}},

   treatment and pumping, as well as from decreased domestic water heating.
   Northern Ireland Water ( NI Water) is actively pursuing measures to
   reduce its carbon footprint. This paper investigated the carbon impacts
   of implementing a household water efficiency programme in Northern
   Ireland. Assuming water savings of 59.6 L/prop/day and 15\% uptake among
   households, carbon savings of 0.6\% of NI Water's current net
   operational emissions are achievable from reduced treatment and pumping.
   Adding the carbon savings from reduced household water heating gives
   savings equivalent to 6.2\% of current net operational emissions. Cost
   savings to NI Water are estimated as 300,000 pound per year. The cost of
   the water efficiency devices is approximately 1.6 pound million, but may
   be higher depending on the number of devices distributed relative to the
   number installed. This paper has shown clear carbon benefits to water
   efficiency, but further research is needed to examine social and cost
   impacts.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a general control approach is presented to achieve
   power-factor correction (PFC) for three-phase boost rectifiers. By
   considering the three-phase four-wire topology, the three-phase diode
   rectifier can be decoupled as independent single phase circuits. Thus
   the design of the controller is simplified by using the single-phase
   One-Cycle Control (OCC) with the advantages, such as constant switching
   frequency, no multipliers, and simple circuitry. Moreover, the block
   diagram of the proposed OCC controller is derived with some key
   equations. A 6 kW PFC rectifier was built and tied together using the
   proposed approach. Experiments and simulation have demonstrated the
   simplicity and the effectiveness of this method.}},

Abstract = {{The capability of a directly modulated laser (DML) can be dramatically
   enhanced through precise control of the drive current waveform based on
   digital signal processing (DSP) and a digital-to-analog convertor (DAC).
   In this paper, a novel method to pre-compensate fiber dispersion for
   metro and regional networks is described for a bit rate of 10.709 Gb/s
   using a DML. A look-up table (LUT) for the drive current is optimized
   for dispersion mitigation. The entries of the LUT are determined based
   on the effects of the DML adiabatic and transient chirp on pulse
   propagation, the nonlinear mapping between the input current and the
   output optical power, and the bandwidth of the DML package. A DAC
   operating at 2 samples per bit (21.418 GSa/s with 6 bit resolution)
   converts the digital samples at the output of the LUT to an analog
   current waveform driving the DML. Experimental results for a bit rate of
   10.709 Gb/s and on-off keying demonstrate a transmission reach of 252 km
   using a DML intended for 2.5 Gb/s operation and 608 km using a chirp
   managed laser intended for 10 Gb/s operation. Using this approach (DSP +
   DAC), the generation of 10.709 Gb/s differential phase shift keying
   (DPSK) and 56 Gb/s 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation, sub-carrier
   multiplexed (QAM SCM) optical signals using the direct modulation of a
   passive feedback laser is also presented. 6-bit DACs operating at
   sampling rates of 21.418 GSa/s and 28 GSa/s, respectively, was used to
   generate the requisite analog current waveform.}},

Abstract = {{A large portion of the Irish railway network contains earthworks that
   were poorly constructed mainly because they were built over 100 years
   ago when scientific understanding of soil behaviour was not nearly as
   advanced as it is today. Also, engineers involved in the construction of
   these structures had to work with often unsuitable local materials as
   sound bulk fill was not able to be transported significant distances. In
   order to improve the information obtained from site investigation of
   these poorly constructed earthworks a number of authors have recently
   suggested complimenting direct geotechnical investigations with a
   non-invasive geophysical assessment. In addition to providing a review
   of the factors which cause failure of earthworks, this paper also
   discusses the capabilities of three geophysical techniques, Ground
   Penetrating Radar (GPR), Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and
   Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) for assessing the
   stability of railway earthworks. Examples of the use of each technique
   are provided from forensic investigations into railway earthwork slope
   failures in Ireland.}},

   proposed approach is based on a decomposition of a differential one-form
   that encodes the divergence of the given vector fields into its exact
   and anti-exact components, and into its co-exact and anti-coexact
   components. The decomposition method, based on the Hodge decomposition
   theorem, is rendered constructive by introducing a dual operator to the
   standard homotopy operator. The dual operator inverts locally the
   co-differential operator, and is used in the present paper to identify
   the structure of the dynamics. Applications of the proposed approach to
   gradient systems, Hamiltonian systems, and generalized Hamiltonian
   systems are given to illustrate the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Two teams of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used in the
   encirclement of two targets at the same time. Encirclement is defined as
   the situation in which a target is isolated and surrounded by a group of
   UAVs. It is a tactic that can be employed by a team of UAVs to
   neutralize a target by restricting its movement due to a containment
   motion near the target while maintaining a formation around it. In this
   paper, the problem of choosing the correct target to create a dynamic
   circular formation is considered and a Decentralized Model Predictive
   Control (DMPC) policy is formulated. From simulation results the derived
   Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy is effective for the case of two
   teams of UAVs encircling two stationary targets, and two teams of UAVs
   encircling two moving targets. The contributions of this paper are the
   application of MPC to the problem of encirclement, the explicit
   objective of a dynamic circular formation around the target, and the
   ability of each team to choose its correct target.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{48}},
Pages = {{15258-15264}},
Abstract = {{Solar hydrogen production assisted with semiconductor materials is a
   promising way to provide alternative energy sources in the future. Such
   a photocatalytic reaction normally takes place on the active sites of
   the catalysts surface, and the identification of the active sites is
   crucial for understanding the photocatalytic reaction mechanism and
   further improving the photocatalytic efficiency. However, the active
   sites of model catalysts are still largely disputed because of their
   structural complexity. Conventionally, H-2 evolution from solar water
   splitting over Pt/TiO2 is widely deemed to take place on metallic Pt
   nanoparticles. Oppositely, we report through a combined experimental and
   theoretical approach, that metallic Pt nanoparticles have little
   contribution to the activity of photocatalytic H-2 evolution; the
   oxidized Pt species embedded on the TiO2 surface are the key active
   sites and primarily responsible for the activity of the hydrogen
   evolution Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst.}},

Abstract = {{Surface-dependent mechanical and corrosion resistance has been enhanced
   by electroless nickel (EN) deposition on laser surface treated (LST)
   AZ91D substrate (AZ91D/LST/EN). This proposed method enhanced the
   surface properties in a better way than conventional LST on EN deposited
   AZ91D substrate (AZ91D/EN/LST). Microhardness, dry-sliding wear and
   electrochemical polarization tests were used to study the hardness, wear
   and corrosion resistance of these modified surfaces and followed by
   microstructure, phase composition analysis. The conventional,
   AZ91D/EN/LST samples produced a relatively smooth, crack-free and hard
   layer consisting of Ni-Mg intermetallic particles; thereby offered a
   significant increase in hardness and wear resistance and shortcoming of
   this method is its significant decrease in corrosion resistance, due to
   the diffusion of Mg into re-melted layer and the formation of Ni-Mg
   intermetallic phases. On the other hand, this proposed method
   AZ91D/LST/EN samples produced an increase in surface hardness and wear
   resistance and maintains a similar and high corrosion resistance.}},

Title = {{Behavior of Bell and Spigot Joints in Buried Thermoplastic Pipelines}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2332}},
Pages = {{29-40}},
Abstract = {{Failures in joints are among the most common sources of problems in
   buried gravity flow pipelines. Poor performance of these elements can
   cause infiltration and exfiltration, which lead to soil erosion and
   eventually to serviceability or strength limit states for the system. To
   prevent poor performance, joints should be designed to adequately
   accommodate the demands generated under normal loading conditions. Such
   demands are not clearly understood, however, because joint behavior has
   received scant attention. The goal of this research was to examine the
   response of gasketed bell and spigot joints in two, common,
   thermoplastic pipelines employed in gravity flow applications when
   subjected to live loading. The specimens examined were a high-density
   polyethylene pipeline, 1,500 mm in diameter, and a polyvinyl chloride
   (PVC) pipeline, 900 mm in diameter. Two burial depths and three loading
   locations were examined for each pipeline buried according to AASHTO
   guidelines. Moreover, two installations not specified by AASHTO were
   examined for the PVC specimen, which featured voids in the bedding under
   the joint. Subsequently, each specimen was loaded directly over the
   joint up to and beyond fully factored loads under recommended burial
   conditions to observe the joint performance and the final failure mode
   of the pipelines. The test measurements provide guidance on the key
   demands that develop at the joints and how they are influenced by the
   burial and loading condition. Finally, recommendations are made on the
   development of structural design procedures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a study whose objective is to explore the
   potential and compare the performance of intelligent adaptive control
   methods. Specifically, the performance of PID plus an adaptive neural
   network compensator (ANNC) is compared with the performance of a fuzzy
   adaptive PID controller. The application is position control of a
   pneumatic gantry robot. Both controllers were carefully tuned to provide
   a fair comparison. Experimental results were collected for the tracking
   of a sine wave. Both adaptive controllers were found to improve tracking
   performance over fixed gain PID by upwards of 70\%. However, the tuning
   procedure for the fuzzy controller is judged to be more intuitive in
   nature and hence, more practical than that for ANNC. The fuzzy adaptive
   controller uses a novel rule set that is reduced in size from that used
   in previous studies.}},

   complex fixed-point data are fed as input to a system under test.
   On-chip FPGA memory is used to implement high-speed FIFO buffers
   connected to the system under test. On-chip memory is also used to stage
   data for the input FIFO buffer feeding the system under test and to
   collect processed data from the output FIFO buffer. An embedded
   processor executes software used to perform data transfers between the
   FIFO buffers and staging memory, and to initiate full-speed operation
   for a system under test with data flowing through the external loopback
   connection. This paper also provides sample results from a
   representative parallelized finite-impulse-response filter tested using
   the hardware platform described in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a graphical and interactive software tool to
   support embedded systems engineering with highly integrated
   microcontrollers such as the ColdFire MCF54418. Such products have many
   input/output interfaces that share chip pins, hence not all possible
   combinations of active interfaces are feasible due to pin conflicts. To
   address challenges stemming from such conflicts, the software tool
   described in this paper provides early decision support for selection
   and subsequent hardware configuration of interfaces. An XML input file
   describes pins and interfaces of a microcontroller. From this
   information, the software tool generates an interactive graphical
   representation for a designer to interactively explore interfaces and
   pins, to visualize interface conflicts due to shared pins, and to
   incrementally develop conflict-free interface combinations. More
   importantly, the tool provides higher-level automated decision support
   with integer linear programming to solve an optimization problem and
   conclusively determine whether there exists a feasible conflict-free
   selection for given specifications on desired types and numbers of
   interfaces. Finally, for general-purpose input/output, the tool also has
   a more specialized mode that enables a user to indicate
   application-specific grouping and direction of pins. From this
   information, the tool automatically tailors an application programming
   interface in C code.}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines the implementation of multiple Linux device drivers
   for the highly integrated ColdFire MCF54418 microcontroller to support
   software for embedded monitoring and control in optical communication
   support equipment from MPB Communications Inc. To explore implementation
   complexity and execution overhead, different software interfaces and
   organizations are considered for the device drivers, emphasizing either
   performance or generality. Execution performance results for a
   low-complexity driver are presented for a 250-MHz ColdFire processor.
   The performance-oriented approach yields an execution time of 1.6 mu sec
   to enter/exit the driver through the Linux kernel. The general approach
   increases this time to 18 mu sec, and requires an additional time of 6.5
   mu sec for the overhead of data conversion. The performance-oriented
   approach is therefore up to 15 times faster.}},

Abstract = {{A Multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) team formed from two or more UAVs
   is used in the encirclement of a target. Encirclement is defined as the
   situation in which a target is isolated and surrounded by a UAV team in
   order to maintain awareness and containment of that target. In this
   paper, the problem of maintaining a circular path around a target is
   considered and a Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) strategy is
   implemented on a team of Qball-X4 quadrotor aircraft in order to follow
   the circular path. The linear plant controlled by the LMPC is a
   combination of process models found through system identification and a
   linear cartesian to polar transformation. A collision avoidance system,
   based on potential fields, is successfully implemented between the
   Qball-X4 quadrotors. The contribution of this paper lay in the
   application of LMPC to the problem of encirclement using a team of
   Qball-X4 quadrotors and the ability of these UAVs to apply a collision

   Research When Researching Minority Communities}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{113-131}},
Abstract = {{Research and processes of knowledge production are often based on
   racialised and imperialistic frameworks that have led to either the
   exclusion or the pathologisation of minority groups. Researchers address
   issues of exclusion by adopting recruitment strategies that involve
   negotiating with gatekeepers to ensure the inclusion of minority or
   marginalised groups. This often involves in-depth scrutiny of
   gatekeepers and requires the researchers to negotiate deals and to make
   personal disclosures. However, there remains relatively little
   discussion on the pragmatic ethical issues facing researchers in the
   field as a result of these interactions. This article suggests that
   interactions with gatekeepers present ethical issues that can be
   effectively addressed and managed by researchers through the exercise of
   phronesis. Phronesis allows researchers to make critical ethical
   decisions based on the specific characteristics of the research sites
   and subjects, not least of which are those issues that emerge as a
   consequence of researcher positionality. Such decisions are not
   necessarily identified or accommodated through bureaucratic processes
   which govern research ethics. We advance the notion of research ethics
   as an ongoing process that requires researcher skills and engagement,
   rather than a one-off bureaucratic exercise.}},

   proposed. The first protocol is a centralized majority-voting protocol

Title = {{Deep eutectic solvents based on N-methylacetamide and a lithium salt as

Abstract = {{In this work, we present a study on the physical and electrochemical
   properties of three new Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) based on
   N-methylacetamide (MAc) and a lithium salt (LiX, with X =
   bis{[}(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide, TFSI; hexafluorophosphate, PF6;
   or nitrate, NO3). Based on DSC measurements, it appears that these
   systems are liquid at room temperature for a lithium salt mole fraction
   ranging from 0.10 to 0.35. The temperature dependences of the ionic
   conductivity and the viscosity of these DESs are correctly described by
   using the Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) type fitting equation, due to the
   strong interactions between Li+, X- and MAc in solution. Furthermore,
   these electrolytes possess quite large electrochemical stability windows
   up to 4.7-5 V on Pt, and demonstrate also a passivating behavior toward
   the aluminum collector at room temperature. Based on these interesting
   electrochemical properties, these selected DESs can be classified as
   potential and promising electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).
   For this purpose, a test cell was then constructed and tested at 25
   degrees C, 60 degrees C and 80 degrees C by using each selected DES as
   an electrolyte and LiFePO4 (LFP) material as a cathode. The results show
   a good compatibility between each DES and LFP electrode material. A
   capacity of up to 160 mA h g(-1) with a good efficiency (99\%) is
   observed in the DES based on the LiNO3 salt at 60 degrees C despite the
   presence of residual water in the electrolyte. Finally preliminary tests
   using a LFP/DES/LTO (lithium titanate) full cell at room temperature
   clearly show that LiTFSI-based DES can be successfully introduced into
   LIBs. Considering the beneficial properties, especially, the cost of
   these electrolytes, such introduction could represent an important
   contribution for the realization of safer and environmentally friendly
   LIBs.}},

   Recent literature provides conflicting information on the first step in

   adsorption-deprotonation process. Density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations, in combination with a cluster-continuum model approach are
   used to resolve the nature of the adsorbing species. We show that
   methanol is the dominant species in solution over methoxide, and also
   has a smaller barrier to adsorption. The nature of the surface species
   is revealed to be a methanol-OH complex.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-level converters are widely used to convert high voltage DC
   (typically above 500V) to an isolated DC output voltage that may vary
   from 12V to 300V, depending on the application. Typical applications can
   range from network server power supplies to battery chargers for purely
   electric vehicles. Almost all these industrial applications require the
   converter to operate from no load to full load. Zero-voltage switching
   is necessary for the efficient operation of the converter as it ensures
   reduced EMI, reduced switching losses and the proper operation of the
   switching devices. Most conventional ZVS techniques for multi-level
   converters fail to achieve ZVS typically below 50\% of full load, while
   some ZVS techniques are able to do so, but they increase the design
   complexity of the overall system. Moreover such techniques may suffer
   from increased circulating current loess at certain load ranges
   (typically at high loads) thus offsetting the gain in efficiency
   achieved through ZVS. In this paper a simple yet novel ZVS auxiliary
   circuit that achieves ZVS even at no load, can optimize the circulating
   auxiliary circuit current necessary for ZVS as a function of load, thus
   maximize the efficiency of the converter for all load conditions, is
   proposed, analyzed and validated by experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{A new three-phase dc-dc PWM boost converter is proposed in the paper.
   The proposed converter can operate with ZVS due to a simple auxiliary
   circuit that consists of just a single active switch and a few passive
   components and transfers energy through the three phase path with zero
   voltage switching (ZVS) capability with minimal electromagnetic noises.
   The number of components in the proposed circuit is reduced compared to
   previous proposed converters of the same type, resulting in lower cost
   and lower conduction losses. The paper presents the new converter then
   discusses its operation, steady-state characteristics and design.
   Experimental results obtained from a 1kW converter prototype are
   presented to validate the converter's performance and the concepts

   power conditioning systems (PCS) of PV arrays used in hybrid renewable

   converter is also able to achieve soft-switching over a wide range. A
   2kW experimental prototype has been provided to validate the feasibility

Abstract = {{In this paper a multivariable control system is proposed for an
   efficient ZVS full-bridge dc-dc converter used in a Plug-in Hybrid
   Electric Vehicle (PHEV). This converter processes the power between the
   high voltage traction battery and low voltage (12V) battery. Generally,
   Phase-shift between the two legs of the full-bridge converter is the
   main control parameter to regulate the output power. However, the zero
   voltage switching cannot be guaranteed by merely controlling the
   phase-shift particularly for light load conditions. In order to extend
   the soft switching operation of the converter for light loads,
   asymmetrical passive auxiliary circuits are used to provide reactive
   current. However, the auxiliary circuits increase extra current burden
   on the power MOSFETs, leading to lower efficiency. In this paper, the
   duty cycle of bridge legs (as another control parameter) is also
   controlled to minimize the conduction losses of the converter.
   Basically, the multivariable controller has to adjust the control
   parameters in such a way that the circulating currents are kept at their
   minimum level for soft switching while the output power is regulated.
   The system operating principle, soft switching and mathematical model
   are discussed. Experimental results are also presented that validate the
   effectiveness of the control method for a 2KW prototype.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach to control a boost PFC AC/DC
   converter without using any current sensors. Due to the particular
   structure of the boost PFC AC/DC converter, sensorless control of the
   converter is very challenging. As illustrated in this paper, the
   converter loses its observability for some operating points. This is the
   reason that the sensorless control of the boost PFC entails special
   attentions. A very simple and practical senseless scheme is proposed in
   this paper, which is able to accurately estimate the inductor current
   for the entire operating range of the converter. In addition, a very
   simple and practical closed-loop control approach is proposed in order
   to improve the transient response of the single-phase boost PFC
   converter. This approach eliminates the need for filtering double
   frequency ripple from the output voltage, which allows increasing the
   bandwidth of the external voltage loop. Simulation and experimental
   results validate the feasibility of the proposed technique and confirm
   its superior performance compared to the conventional control system.}},

Abstract = {{A novel high power factor, soft-switched Light Emitting Diode (LED)
   driver without electrolytic capacitors is proposed in this paper.
   Conventional electrolytic capacitors used in LED drivers as the energy
   storage element have relatively short lifespan and affect the lifetime
   of the entire LED lighting system. In the proposed design, coupled
   inductors are used to provide power factor correction (PFC) and to
   provide part of the required energy with the DC-link capacitor to the
   output. As a result, low ripple output current is still achieved even
   when the size of the DC-link capacitor is reduced, which allows the film
   capacitor to be used to replace the conventional unreliable electrolytic
   capacitor. At the same time, high input power factor is also achieved.
   The operating principles and theoretical analysis of the proposed
   circuit will be described in this paper. An experimental prototype is
   built and tested in the laboratory. All the experimental results are

   transients. Additionally, they can only reject the disturbance created

   able to increase the bandwidth of the closed loop control system, while
   providing guaranteed stability and perfect disturbance rejection. Since
   the proposed controller is based on the system model, it is able to
   completely remove the disturbances caused by the grid voltage. The
   integral terms of the error are also incorporated into the Lyapunov
   function in order to account for parameter uncertainties in the system
   model. The performance of the proposed control scheme has been compared

Abstract = {{Front-end AC/DC single-phase converters in typical two-stage AC/DC
   converters are typically implemented with linear controllers that allow
   them to perform input power factor correction (PFC). Such conventional
   PFC controllers generally have a very low bandwidth voltage loop to
   filter the 2nd harmonic DC bus ripple, but this loop results in from
   poor dynamic performance. In this paper, a comparative study of three
   nonlinear controllers is made. The basic principles of each controller
   are explained and results from prototypes of converters with each
   controller are presented. Based on these results, conclusions are made
   about the effectiveness of each controller relative to the other
   nonlinear controllers.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a dual-channel current source driver is presented as an
   efficient means of driving complementary switches. The driver transfers
   charge between the gates of the power devices through a single magnetic
   core with a discontinuous current. This promotes lower conduction loss
   than continuous current resonant gate drivers (RGD), and lower component
   count or conduction loss than existing discontinuous current RGD applied
   to complementary switches. In addition, controlled switching speed is
   achieved through non-zero inductor current resulting in lower current
   stress, and faster switching compared to some pulse RGD circuits. There
   is good correlation between the analysis and experimental results of a
   1.8MHz prototype.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a very simple open loop control scheme for a
   current-driven Full-Bridge DC/DC converter used in automotive
   applications. DC current sensors impose a lot of difficulties and cost
   to the power conditioning system. In this paper, a novel control
   approach is proposed, which can eliminate the need for the output
   current sensor. The particular structure of the current-driven
   full-bridge DC/DC converter provides the flexibility to accurately
   estimate the output current. This flexibility is employed to provide a
   robust and cost effective solution for electric vehicles. The proposed
   approach has been examined on a 3KW industrial prototype. The
   experimental results show that the proposed scheme is able to tightly
   control the charging power of the DC/DC converter.}},

   processes is an attractive solution for soil decontamination and renewal
   of polluted sites. Depending on the site characteristics and target
   treatment requirements for the decontaminated soil, in situ or ex situ

   safe and effective intervention is required (i.e., in the presence of
   severe contamination of highly hazardous compounds). In this review,
   conventional and innovative ex situ technologies for soil bioremediation
   are presented. For each one the principle of operation and recent
   applications are reported. In addition, strategies to improve their
   efficiency are explored. Finally, the possibility of making these

Abstract = {{The spherical acrylic vessel that contains the liquid argon target is
   the most critical detector component in the DEAP-3600 dark matter
   experiment. Alpha decays near the inner surface of the acrylic vessel
   are one of the main sources of background in the detector. A fraction of
   the alpha energy, or the recoiling nucleus from the alpha decay, could
   misreconstruct in the fiducial volume and result in a false candidate
   dark matter event. Acrylic has low levels of inherent contamination from
   U-238 and Th-232. Another background of particular concern is diffusion
   of Rn-222 during manufacturing, leading to Pb-210 contamination. The
   maximum acceptable concentrations in the DEAP-3600 acrylic vessel are
   ppt levels of U-238 and Th-232 equivalent, and 10(-8) ppt Pb-210. The
   impurities in the bulk acrylic will be measured by vaporizing a large
   quantity of acrylic and counting the concentrated residue with ultra-low
   background HPGe detectors and a low background alpha spectrometer. An
   overview of the acrylic assay technique is presented.}},

Abstract = {{A strain gauge instrumentation trial on a high-pressure die casting
   (HPDC) die was compared to a corresponding simulation model using
   Magmasoft (R) casting simulation software at two strain gauge rosette
   locations. The strains were measured during the casting cycle, from
   which the von Mises stress was determined and then compared to the
   simulation model. The von Mises stress from the simulation model
   correlated well with the findings from the instrumentation trial,
   showing a difference of 5.5\%, similar to 10 MPa for one strain gauge
   rosette located in an area of low stress gradient. The second rosette
   was in a region of steep stress gradient, which resulted in a difference
   of up to 40\%, similar to 40 MPa between the simulation and
   instrumentation results. Factors such as additional loading from die
   closure force or metal injection pressure which are not modelled were
   shown to have very little influence on the stress in the die, less than
   7\%.}},

   Oxygen contamination can cause severe problems in polymer gel
   dosimeters, even when THPC is used. Oxygen leakage must be prevented
   between manufacturing and irradiation of polymer gels, and internal
   calibration methods should be used so that contamination problems can be
   detected. Micelle gel dosimeters are promising due to their favourable
   diffusion properties. The introduction of micelles to gel dosimetry may
   open up new areas of dosimetry research wherein a range of

Abstract = {{Mechanochemical synthesis has the potential to provide more sustainable
   preparative routes to catalysts than the current multistep solvent-based
   routes. In this review, the mechanochemical synthesis of catalysts is
   discussed, with emphasis placed on catalysts for environmental, energy
   and chemical synthesis applications. This includes the formation of
   mixed-metal oxides as well as the process of dispersing metals onto
   solid supports. In most cases the process involves no solvent.
   Encouragingly, there are several examples where the process is
   advantageous compared with the more normal solvent-based methods. This
   can be because of process cost or simplicity, or, notably, where it
   provides more active/selective catalysts than those made by conventional
   wet chemical methods. The need for greater, and more systematic,
   exploration of this currently unconventional approach to catalyst
   synthesis is highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Design and manufacture of aircraft requires deep multi-disciplinary

Title = {{Efficient Model Selection for Sparse Least-Square SVMs}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{The Forward Least-Squares Approximation (FLSA) SVM is a newly-emerged
   Least-Square SVM (LS-SVM) whose solution is extremely sparse. The
   algorithm uses the number of support vectors as the regularization
   parameter and ensures the linear independency of the support vectors
   which span the solution. This paper proposed a variant of the FLSA-SVM,
   namely, Reduced FLSA-SVM which is of reduced computational complexity
   and memory requirements. The strategy of ``contexts inheritance{''} is
   introduced to improve the efficiency of tuning the regularization
   parameter for both the FLSA-SVM and the RFLSA-SVM algorithms.
   Experimental results on benchmark datasets showed that, compared to the
   SVM and a number of its variants, the RFLSA-SVM solutions contain a
   reduced number of support vectors, while maintaining competitive
   generalization abilities. With respect to the time cost for tuning of
   the regularize parameter, the RFLSA-SVM algorithm was empirically
   demonstrated fastest compared to FLSA-SVM, the LS-SVM, and the SVM
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Electromagnetic (EM)-tracked ultrasound (US)-guided needle
   navigation systems have potential use in spinal interventions; however,
   an assessment of the accuracy of these systems is required. Analysis of
   these systems involves examining the overall error of the system and the
   error of its components. The purpose of this study is to estimate the
   error components in an EM-tracked US-guided needle navigation system,
   and to determine the relationships between them, specifically for
   evaluation of US probe calibration. Methods: The main parts of the
   experimental setup are the US probe, the tracker, and the needle. The
   system error is examined by imaging the tracked needle with the US
   probe. The positional tracking error is tested for multiple needle,
   probe and reference sensors using a 7x9 grid with 4 cm spacing between
   points. Needle calibration error is evaluated by pivot calibration. An
   upper bound for the probe calibration error is then estimated using a
   series of transformations between the tracker and the needle tip
   position. Results: For all experiments, the mean error and its standard
   deviation increase as a function of distance from the tracker. The
   upper-bound of the US probe calibration error is estimated to be 1.81
   mm. Conclusion: Operating distance has significant impact on component
   error, and the optimal operating distance for the presented setup has
   been shown. Although US probe calibration error cannot be measured
   directly, its upper-bound has been estimated by assessing the errors in
   other components of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Feedback of proprioceptive information is essential for many
   tele-robotic systems, especially those designed to undertake tasks
   concerning hazardous environments and for efficient out-of-sight remote
   control applications. Given highly sensitive nature of these
   applications, even small errors (e. g. less than one degree of
   displacement in robot posture) can cause unnecessary risk. Thus,
   accurate feedback of proprioceptive information, as well as a technique
   to precisely interpret this information, is significant to operator. In
   this paper, we introduce a framework that uses pulse feedback mechanism
   to measure the proprioceptive information of a robot operating over
   real-time wireless communication and represent it in 3D model user
   interface. The 3D user interface enhances the interpretation of
   proprioceptive information to help operator to visualize the real-time
   relative position of the robot. The paper also provides results that
   demonstrate how the framework allows synchronization between 3D model
   and tele-robot to be achieved in real-time over wireless communications.}},

Abstract = {{The heterogeneous computing revolution continues unabated. Yet despite
   the vast number of naive users in possession of bespoke software hoping
   to embrace the opportunities that this revolution has wrought, few
   approaches proposed in current literature can guide such users in these
   efforts. The most appropriate choice would appear to be a (semi-)
   automating compiler. However, these typically target a single
   device-type and demand the unguided use of directives. Consequently,
   they are of little use when naive users are seeking answers to more
   fundamental questions, such as: which fragments of a program can/should
   be parallelized, which device should each fragment target, and what
   speedup will be attained. To this end, this paper expands on previous
   work and proposes Paralysis - an extensible guidance environment, tiered
   for varying programmer competencies with support for static and dynamic
   analysis techniques. At the highest level, guided user experiences are
   paramount. At the lowest level, underlying functionality is exposed as a
   set of plug-ins, ensuring longevity. A partial prototype, built atop the
   Cetus infrastructure, is described. It is used to analyze two serial
   programs for CUDA execution - the DFT and the Box Blur Filter. Speedups
   of 15x and 22x are achieved on the basis of the analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional adversarial relationship in the construction industry
   has been criticized by a larger number of researchers and practitioners.
   Following the success of the supply chain collaboration in other
   industry sectors, such as manufacturing, supply chain relationships in
   UK construction have been increasingly changing from the traditional
   adversarial to the collaborative, which is supported by a series of
   government reports for the industry reform. However, few empirical
   studies have been conducted to investigate the current status of supply
   chain relationships in a systematic way. Therefore, there is no clear
   understanding of how change has taken place in today's practice and
   whether or not the change is balanced. To bridge the gap, a
   questionnaire survey is carried out in the UK construction industry.
   Based on the analysis of more than 100 responses, it is found that the
   UK construction industry as a whole has experienced an important change
   and moved toward supply chain collaboration. On the other hand, an
   unbalance is found for the change movement. In addition to the
   questionnaire survey, a series of industrial experts are interviewed,
   which help to explore the specific characteristics of supply chain
   collaboration in construction and provide practical implications for
   collaboration strategy implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) against imiquimod, a highly potent
   immune response modifier used in the treatment of skin cancer, were
   synthesised using a template analogue strategy and were compared with
   imprints of the drug itself. An investigation of the complexation
   between the functional monomer and the template analogue revealed an
   association constant of 1376 +/- 122 M-1, significantly higher than
   previously reported values for similar systems. The binding
   characteristics of the synthesised imprinted polymers were evaluated and
   extremely strong binding for imiquimod was observed while imprinting
   factors as high as 17 were calculated. When applied as sorbents in
   solid-phase extraction of imiquimod from aqueous, urine and blood serum
   samples, clean extracts and recoveries up to 95\% were achieved, and it
   is concluded that while imiquimod imprints exhibited higher capacity for
   the drug, template analogue imprints are more selective. The results
   obtained suggest potential applications of imiquimod imprints as
   sorbents in rapid extraction and monitoring of undesirable systemic
   release of the drug.}},

   and new fabrication methodologies that have enabled both the fabrication
   of nanohole arrays with improved optical attributes and a reduction in
   manufacturing costs. The achievements of several platforms developed to
   date and the significant benefits obtained from operating the nanoholes
   as nanochannels are also reviewed herein. Finally, we discuss future
   opportunities for on-chip nanohole array sensors by outlining potential
   applications and the use of the abilities of the nanostructures beyond

Abstract = {{We report the detection of a strong, organized magnetic field in the
   secondary component of the massive O8III/I+O7.5V/III double-lined
   spectroscopic binary system HD 47129 (Plaskett's star) in the context of
   the Magnetism in Massive Stars survey. Eight independent Stokes V
   observations were acquired using the Echelle SpectroPolarimetric Device
   for the Observations of Stars (ESPaDOnS) spectropolarimeter at the
   Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Narval spectropolarimeter at the
   Telescope Bernard Lyot. Using least-squares deconvolution we obtain
   definite detections of signal in Stokes V in three observations. No
   significant signal is detected in the diagnostic null (N) spectra. The
   Zeeman signatures are broad and track the radial velocity of the
   secondary component; we therefore conclude that the rapidly rotating
   secondary component is the magnetized star. Correcting the polarized
   spectra for the line and continuum of the (sharp-lined) primary, we
   measured the longitudinal magnetic field from each observation. The
   longitudinal field of the secondary is variable and exhibits extreme
   values of -810 +/- 150 and +680 +/- 190 G, implying a minimum surface
   dipole polar strength of 2850 +/- 500 G. In contrast, we derive an upper
   limit (3 sigma) to the primary's surface magnetic field of 230 G. The
   combination of a strong magnetic field and rapid rotation leads us to
   conclude that the secondary hosts a centrifugal magnetosphere fed
   through a magnetically confined wind. We revisit the properties of the
   optical line profiles and X-ray emission - previously interpreted as a
   consequence of colliding stellar winds - in this context. We conclude
   that HD 47129 represents a heretofore unique stellar system - a close,
   massive binary with a rapidly rotating, magnetized component - that will
   be a rich target for further study.}},

   a redox dye (methylene blue, MB), a colloidal semiconductor
   photocatalyst (SC = TiO2), and a sacrificial electron donor (SED =
   tartaric acid). The colloidal anatase TiO2 particles, with diameter
   similar to 5 nm, are made via the hydrothermal treatment of titanium
   isopropoxide, with tartaric acid as the peptizing agent, and SED. This
   ink is inkjet-printed on polyester film, resulting in a physically
   robust, colorimetric oxygen-indicating film with a thickness of similar
   to 63 nm. Upon exposure to 3 min UVA light (4 mW cm(-2)), the indicator
   is readily photobleached when MB is photoreduced to leucomethylene blue,
   LMB. The photobleached film recovers its colour in similar to 12 h under
   ambient conditions (similar to 21 degrees C, similar to 60\% RH, 21\%
   O-2), but did not recover its original colour in the absence of O-2. The
   rate of recovery in air (from cylinders) exhibits some dependence upon
   relative humidity at 21 degrees C, but little at 4 degrees C and rate of
   recovery is found to be linearly dependent upon the \%O-2 present. The
   rate of colour recovery is reduced upon reducing the temperature from 21
   to 4 degrees C, and has an estimated activation energy for the reaction
   of the LMB photoreduced dye with O-2, E-a = 41 +/- 6 kJ mol(-1).
   Potential uses of this simple UV light activated indicator are discussed
   briefly. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{AC magnetic heating of superparamagnetic Co and Fe nanoparticles for
   application in hyperthermia was measured to find a size of nanoparticles
   that would result in an optimal heating for given amplitude and
   frequency of ac externally applied magnetic field. To measure it, a
   custom-made power supply connected to a 20-turn insulated copper coil in
   the shape of a spiral solenoid cooled with water was used. A fiber-optic
   temperature sensor has been used to measure the temperature with an
   accuracy of 0.0001 K. The magnetic field with magnitude of 20.6 mu T and
   a frequency of oscillation equal to 348 kHz was generated inside the
   coil to heat magnetic nanoparticles. The maximum specific power loss or
   the highest heating rate for Co magnetic nanoparticles was achieved for
   nanoparticles of 8.2 nm in diameter. The maximum heating rate for coated
   Fe was found for nanoparticles with diameter of 18.61 nm.}},

   and dissociation of O-2 on graphene and graphene oxide as model systems.
   The reactions on the basal plane, zigzag and armchair edges of graphene
   and graphene oxide with different oxygen-containing groups are
   calculated using first principles calculations. Two
   Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi relationships are identified and an electron
   delocalization model is suggested to understand the general trend of
